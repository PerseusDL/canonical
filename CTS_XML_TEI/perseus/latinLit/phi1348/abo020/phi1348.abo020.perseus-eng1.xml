				<p>THE empire, which had been long thrown into a disturbed and unsettled state, by
					the rebellion and violent death of its three last rulers, was at length restored
					to peace and security by the Flavian family, whose descent was indeed obscure,
					and which boasted no ancestral honours; but the public had no cause to regret
					its elevation; though it is acknowledged that Domitian met with the just reward
					of his avarice and cruelty. Titus Flavius Petro, a townsman of <placeName

					centurion of the first order, and others, that whilst he held that rank, he was
					discharged on account of his bad state of health: this Sabinus, I say, was a
					republican, and received the tax of the fortieth penny in <placeName

						miles to the north-east of <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
						>Rome</placeName>.</note> After his advancement to the empire, he used
					frequently to visit the place where he had spent his infancy; and the villa was
					continued in the same condition, that he might see every thing about him just as
					he had been used to do. And he had so great a regard for the memory of his
					grandmother, that, upon solemn occasions and festival days, he constantly drank
					out of a silver cup which she had been accustomed to use. After assuming the
					manly habit, he had a long time a distaste for the senatorian toga, though his
					brother had obtained it- nor could he be persuaded by any one but his mother to
					sue for that badge of honour. She at length drove him to it, more by taunts and
					reproaches, than by entreaties and authority, calling him now and then, by way
					of reproach, his brother's footman. He served as military tribune in <placeName
						key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>. When made quaestor, the province of
						<placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> and <placeName
						key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> fell to him by lot. He was candidate
					for the aedileship, and soon after for the praetorship, but met with a repulse
					in the former case; though at last, with much difficulty, he came in sixth on
					the poll-books. But the office of praetor he carried upon his first canvass,
					standing amongst the highest at the poll. Being incensed against the senate, and
					desirous to gain, by all possible means, the good graces of Caius,<note

						word in the English language which exactly conveys the meaning of
						contubernium; a word which, in a military sense, the Romans applied to the
						intimate fellowship between comrades in war who messed together, and lived
						in close fellowship in the same tent. Thence they transferred it to a union
						with one woman who was in a higher position than a concubine, but, for some
						reason, could not acquire the legal rights of a wife, as in the case of
						slaves of either sex. A man of rank, also, could not marry a slave or a

					concubine, Caenis, the freedwoman of Antonia, and also her amanuensis, and

						to Drusilla, see CALIGULA, c. xxiv., and to Marcella, the concubine of
						Commodus, by Herodian, 1. xvi. 9 , where he says that she had all the
						honours of an empress, except that the incense was not offered to her. These
						connections resembled the left-hand marriages of the German

				<p>In the reign of Claudius, by the interest of Narcissus, he was sent to <placeName

					removed into <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, he engaged the

					very powerful tribes, and above twenty great towns, with the Isle of Wight,
					which lies close to the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7008653"

						In representing him, however, as carrying his arms among the Caledonian
						tribes, their flattery transferred to the emperor the glory of the victories
						gained by his lieutenant, Agricola. Vespasian's own conquests, while he
						served in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, were principally
						in the territories of the Brigantes, lying north of the Humber, and
						including the present counties of <placeName key="tgn,7011995"
							>York</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7008127">Durham</placeName>.
					</note> For this success he received the triumphal ornaments, and in a short
					time after two priesthoods, besides the consulship, which he held during the
					last two months of the year.<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 824</note> The interval
					between that and his proconsulship he spent in leisure and retirement, for fear
					of Agrippina, who still held great sway over her son, and hated all the friends
					of Narcissus, who was then dead. Afterwards he got by lot the province of
						<placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, which he governed with
					great reputation, excepting that once, in an insurrection at Adrumetum, he.was
					pelted with turnips. It is certain that he returned thence nothing richer; for
					his credit was so low, that he was obliged to mortgage his whole property to his
					brother, and was reduced to the necessity of dealing in mules, for the support
					of his rank; for which reason he was commonly called "the Muleteer." He is said
					likewise to have been convicted of extorting from a young man of fashion two
					hundred thousand sesterces for procuring him the broad-stripe, contrary to the
					wishes of his father, and was severely reprimanded for it. While in attendance
					upon Nero in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>, he frequently
					withdrew from the theatre while Nero was singing, and went to' sleep if he
					remained, which gave so much offence, that he was not only excluded from his
					society, but debarred the liberty of saluting him in public. Upon this, he
					retired to a small out-of-the-way town, where he lay skulking in constant fear
					of his life, until a province, with an army, was offered him.</p>
				<p>A firm persuasion had long prevailed through all the East,<note anchored="true"
						>Tacitus, Hist. V. xiii. 3, mentions this ancient prediction, and its
						currency through the East, in nearly the same terms as Suetonius. The coming
						power is in both instances described in the plural number, <foreign
							xml:lang="la">profecti</foreign>, "those shall come forth;" and Tacitus
						applies it to Titus as well as Vespasian. The prophecy is commonly supposed
						to have reference to a passage in Micah, v. 2, "Out of thee
						[Bethlehem-Ephrata] shall He come forth, to be ruler in <placeName
							key="tgn,1000119">Israel</placeName>." Earlier prophetic intimations of
						a similar character, and pointing to a more extended dominion, have been
						traced in the sacred records of the Jews; and there is reason to believe
						that these books were at this time not unknown in the heathen world,
						particularly at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>,
						and through the Septuagint version. These predictions, in their literal
						sense, point to the establishment of a universal monarchy, which should take
						its rise in <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judea</placeName>. The Jews looked
						for their accomplishment in the person of one of their own nation, the
						expected Messiah, to which character there were many pretenders in those
						times. The first disciples of Christ, during the whole period of his
						ministry, supposed that they were to be fulfilled in him. The Romans thought
						that the conditions were answered by Vespasian and Titus having been called
						from <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judea</placeName> to the seat of empire.
						The expectations entertained by the Jews, and naturally participated in and
						appropriated by the first converts to Christianity, having proved
						groundless, the prophecies were subsequently interpreted in a spiritual
						sense. </note> that it was fated for the empire of the world, at that time,
					to devolve on some one who should go forth from <placeName key="tgn,7001407"
						>Judaea</placeName>. This prediction referred to a Roman emperor, as the
					event shewed; but the Jews, applying it to themselves, broke out into rebellion,
					and having defeated and slain their governor, <note anchored="true">Gessius
						Florus was at that time governor of <placeName key="tgn,7001407"
							>Judaea</placeName>, with the title and rank of preposius, it not being
						a proconsular province, as the native princes still held some parts of it,
						under the protection and with the alliance of the Romans. Gessius succeeded
						Florus Albinus, the successor of <placeName key="tgn,2324437"
							>Felix</placeName>. </note> routed the lieutenant of <placeName
						key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, <note anchored="true">Cestius Gallus
						was consular lieutenant in <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>.
					</note> a man of consular rank, who was advancing to his assistance, and took an
					eagle, the standard of one of his legions. As the suppression of this revolt
					appeared to require a stronger force and an active general, who might be safely
					trusted in an affair of so much importance, Vespasian was chosen in preference
					to all others, both for his own activity, and on account of the obscurity of his
					origin and name, being a person of whom there could be not the least jealousy.
					Two legions, 'therefore, eight squadrons of horse, and ten cohorts, being added
					to the former troops in <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judaea</placeName>, and,
					taking with him his eldest son as lieutenant, as soon as he arrived in his
					province, he turned the eyes of the neighbouring provinces upon him, by
					reforming immediately the discipline of the camp, and engaging the enemy once or
					twice with such resolution, that, in the attack of a castle,<note
						anchored="true">See note to c. vii.</note> he had his knee hurt by the
					stroke of a stone, and received several arrows in his shield.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="5">
				<p>After the deaths of Nero and Galba, whilst Otho and Vitellius were contending for
					the sovereignty, he entertained hopes of obtaining the empire, with the prospect
					of which he had long before flattered himself, from the following omens. Upon an
					estate belonging to the Flavian family, in the neighbourhood of <placeName
						key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, there was an old oak, sacred to Mars,
					which, at the three several deliveries of Vespasia, put out each time a new
					branch; evident intimations of the future fortune of each child. The first was
					but a slender one, which quickly withered away; and accordingly, the girl that
					was born did not live long. The second became vigorous, which portended great
					good fortune; but the third grew like a tree. His father Sabinus, encouraged by
					these omens, which were confirmed by the augurs, told his mother, "that her
					grandson would be emperor of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>;" at
					which she laughed heartily, wondering, she said, "that her son should be in his
					dotage whilst she continued still in full possession of her faculties."</p>
				<p>Afterwards in his aedileship, when Caius Caesar, being enraged at his not taking
					care to have the streets kept clean, ordered the soldiers to fill the bosom of
					his gown with dirt, some persons at that time construed it into a sign that the
					government, being trampled under foot and deserted in some civil commotion,
					would fall under his protection, and as it were into his lap. Once, while he was
					at dinner, a strange dog that wandered about the streets, brought a man's
						hand,<note anchored="true">A right hand was the sign of sovereign power,
						and, as every one knows, borne upon a staff among the standards of the
						armies.</note> and laid it under the table. And another time, while he was
					at supper, a plough-ox throwing the yoke off his neck, broke into the room, and
					after he had frightened away all the attendants, on a suddren, as if he was
					tired, fell down at his feet, as he lay still upon his couch, and hung down his
					neck. A cypress-tree likewise, in a field belonging to the family, was torn up
					by the roots, and laid flat upon the ground, when there was no violent wind; but
					next day it rose again fresher and stronger than before.</p>
				<p>He dreamt in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName> that the good
					fortune of himself and his family would begin when Nero had a tooth drawn; and
					it happened that the day after, a surgeon coming into the hall, showed him a
					tooth which he had just extracted from Nero. In <placeName key="tgn,7001407"
						>Judea</placeName>, upon his consulting the oracle of the divinity at
						<placeName key="tgn,1064616">Carmel</placeName>,<note anchored="true"
						>Tacitus says, " <placeName key="tgn,1064616">Carmel</placeName> is the name
						both of a god and a mountain; but there is neither image nor temple of the
						god; such are the ancient traditions; we find there only an altar and
						religious awe."-Hist xi. 78, 4. It also appears, from his account, that
						Vespasian offered sacrifice on <placeName key="tgn,7001405">Mount
							Carmel</placeName>, where Basilides, mentioned hereafter, c. vii.,
						predicted his success from an inspection of the entrails.</note> the answer
					was so encouraging as to assure him of success in anything he projected, however
					great or important it might be. And when Josephus,<note anchored="true"
						>Josephus, the celebrated Jewish historian, who was engaged in these wars,
						having been taken prisoner, was confined in the dungeon at Jotapata, the
						castle referred to in the preceding chapter, before which Vespasian was
						wounded.-De Cell. cxi. 14.</note> one of the noble prisoners, was put in
					chains, he confidently affirmed that he should be released in a very short time
					by the same Vespasian, but he would be emperor first.<note anchored="true">The
						prediction of Josephus was founded on the Jewish prophecies mentioned in the
						note to c. iv., which he, like others, applied to Vespasian.</note> Some
					omens were likewise mentioned in the news from <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
						>Rome</placeName>, and among others, that Nero, towards the close of his
					days, was commanded in a dream to carry Jupiter's sacred chariot out of the
					sanctuary where it stood, to Vespasian's house, and conduct it thence into the
					circus. Also not long afterwards, as Galba was going to the election in which he
					was created consul for the second time, a statue of the Divine Julius<note
						anchored="true">Julius Caesar is always called by our author after his
						apotheosis, Divus Julius.</note> turned towards the east. And in the field
					of Bedriacum,<note anchored="true">The battle at Bedriacum secured the empire
						for Vitellius. See OTHO, c. ix.. VITELLIUS,, C. X.</note> before the battle
					began, two eagles engaged in the sight of the army; and one of them being
					beaten, a third came from the east, and drove away the conqueror.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="6">
				<p>He made, however, no attempt upon the sovereignty though his friends were very
					ready to support him, and even pressed him to the enterprise untl he was
					encouraged to it by the fortuitous aid of persons unknown to him and at a
					distance. Two thousand men, drawn out of three legions in the Moesian army, had
					been sent to the assistance of Otho. While they were upon their march, news came
					that he had been defeated, and had put an end to his life; notwithstanding which
					they continued their march as far as <placeName key="perseus,Aquileia"
						>Aquileia</placeName>, pretending that they gave no credit to the report.
					There, tempted by the opportunity which the disorder of the times afforded them,
					they ravaged and plundered the country at discretion; until at length, fearing
					to be called to an account on their return, and punished for it, they resolved
					upon choosing and creating an emperor. "For they were no ways inferior," they
					said, "to the army which made Galba emperor, nor to the praetorian troops which
					had set up Otho, nor the army in <placeName key="tgn,7000084"
						>Germany</placeName>, to whom Vitellius owed his elevation." The names of
					all the consular lieutenants, therefore, being taken into consideration, and one
					objecting to one, and another to another, for various reasons; at last some of
					the third legion, which a little before Nero's death had been removed out of
						<placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> into <placeName
						key="tgn,7016746">Moesia</placeName>, extolled Vespasian in high terms; and
					all the rest assenting, his name was immediately inscribed on their standards.
					The design was nevertheless quashed for a time, the troops being brought to
					submit to Vitellius a little longer.</p>
				<p>However, the fact becoming known, Tiberius Alexander, governor of <placeName
						key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, first obliged the legions under his
					command to swear obedience to Vespasian as their emperor, on the calends [the
					1st] of July, which was observed ever after as the day of his accession to the
					empire; and upon the fifth of the ides of the same month [the 28th of July], the
					army in <placeName key="tgn,7001407">Judaea</placeName>, where he then was, also
					swore allegiance to him. What contributed greatly to forward the affair, was a
					copy of a letter, whether real or counterfeit, which was circulated, and said to
					have been written by Otho before his decease to Vespasian, recommending to him
					in the most urgent terms to avenge his death, and entreating him to come to the
					aid of the commonwealth; as well as a report which was circulated, that
					Vitellius, after his success against Otho, proposed to change the winter
					quarters of the legions, and remove those in <placeName key="tgn,7000084"
						>Germany</placeName> to a less hazardous station and a warmer climate.
					Moreover, amongst the governors of provinces, Lucinius Mucianus dropping the
					grudge arising from a jealousy of which he had hitherto made no secret, promised
					to join him with the Syrian army, and, among the allied kings, Vologesus, king
					of the Parthians, offered him a reinforcement of forty thousand archers.</p>

				<p>Having, therefore, entered on a civil war, and sent forward his generals and

					certain that at the very time he was far away. Immeiately after this, arrived
					letters with intelligence that Vitellius's troops had been defeated at Cremona,
					and he himself slain at Rome. Vespasian, the new emperor, having been raised
					unexpectedly from a low estate, wanted something which might clothe him with
					divine majesty and authority. This, likewise, was now added. A poor man who was
					blind, and another who was lame, came both together before him, when he was
					seated on the tribunal, imploring him to heal them,<note anchored="true">Tacitus
						informs us that Vespasian himself believed Basilides to have been at this

						days' journey from Alexandria. But (for his greater satisfaction) he
						strictly examined the priests whether Basilides had entered the temple on
						that day: he made inquiries of all he met, whether he had been seen in the
						city; nay, further, he dispatched messengers on horseback, who ascertained
						that at the time specified, Basilides was more than eighty miles from
						Alexandria. Then Vespasian comprehended that the appearance of Basilides,

					he would restore sight to the one by anointing his eyes with his spittle, and
					give strength to the leg of the other, if he vouchsafed but to touch it with his
					heel. At first he could scarcely believe that the thing would any how succeed,
					and therefore hesitated to venture on making the experiment. At length, however,
					by the advice of his friends, he made the attempt publicly, in the presence of
					the assembled multitudes, and it was crowned with success in both cases.<note
						anchored="true">The account given by Tacitus of the miracles of Vespasian is
						fuller than that of Suetonius, but does not materially vary in the details,
						except that, in his version of the story, he describes the impotent man to
						be lame in the hand, instead of the leg or the knee, and adds an important
						circumstance in the case of the blind man, that he was "notus tabe
						occulorum," notorious for the disease in his eyes. He also winds up the
						narrative with the following statement: "They who were present, relate both
						these cures, even at this time, when there is nothing to be gained by
						lying." Both the historians lived within a few years of the occurrence, but
						their works were not published until advanced periods of their lives. The
						closing remark of Tacitus seems to indicate that, at least, he did not
						entirely discredit the account; and as for Suetonius, his pages are as full
						of prodigies of all descriptions, related apparently in all good faith, as a
						monkish chronicle of the Middle Ages. The story has the more interest, as it
						is one of the examples of successful imposture, selected by Hume in his
						Essay on Miracles; with the reply to which by Paley, in his Evidences of
						Christianity, most readers are familiar. The commentators on Suetonius agree
						with Paley in considering the whole affair as a juggle between the priests,
						the patients, and, probably, the emperor. But what will, perhaps, strike the
						reader as most remarkable, is the singular coincidence of the story with the
						accounts given of several of the miracles of Christ; whence it has been
						supposed that the scene was planned in imitation of them. It did not fall
						within the scope of Dr. Paley's argument to advert to this; and our own
						brief illustration must be strictly confined within the limits of historical
						disquisition. Adhering to this principle, we may point out that if the idea
						of plagiarism be accepted, it receives some confirmation from the incident
						related by our author in a preceding paragraph, forming, it may be
						considered, another scene of the same drama, where we find Basilides
						appearing to Vespasian in the temple of Serapis, under circumstances which
						cannot fail to remind us of Christ's suddenly standing in the midst of his
						disciples, "when the doors were shut." This incident, also, has very much
						the appearance of a parody on the evangelical history. But if the striking
						similarity of the two narratives be thus accounted for, it is remarkable
						that while the priests of Alexandria, or, perhaps, Vespasian himself from
						his residence in Judaea, were in possession of such exact details of two of
						Christ's miracles -- if not of a third striking incident in his history --
						we should find not the most distant allusion in the works of such
						cotemporary writers as Tacitus and Suetonius, to any one of the still more
						stupendous occurrences which had recently taken place in a part of the world
						with which the Romans had now very intimate relations. The character of
						these authors induces us to hesitate in adopting the notion, that either
						contempt or disbelief would have led them to pass over such events, as
						altogether unworthy of notice; and the only other inference from their
						silence is, that they had never heard of them. But as this can scarcely be
						reconciled with the plagiarism attributed to Vespasian or the Egyptian
						priests, it is safer to conclude that the coincidence, however singular, was
						merely fortuitous. It may be added that Spartianus, who wrote the lives of
						Adrian and succeeding emperors, gives an account of a similar miracle
						performed by that prince in healing a blind man.</note> About the same time,

					every species of licentiousness and insolence. Nay, the provinces, too, and free

					away without a reply, he ordered them for the future to run bare-footed; and so
					they have done ever since. He deprived of their liberties, Achaia, Lycia,
					Rhodes, Byzantium, and Samos, and reduced them into the form of provinces;
					Thrace, also, and Cilicia, as well as Comagene, which until that time had been
					under the government of kings. He stationed some legions in Cappadocia on
					account of the frequent inroads of barbarians, and, instead of a Roman knight,
					appointed as governor of it a man of consular rank. The ruins of houses which
					had been burnt down long before, being a great desight to the city, he gave

					it, if the proprietors should hesitate to perform the work themselves. He

					clearing the ground of the rubbish, and removed some of it upon his own
					shoulder. And he undertook, likewise, to restore the three thousand tables of
					brass which had been destroyed in the fire which consumed the Capitol; searching
					in all quarters for copies of those curious and ancient records, in which were

					prodigies, the mausoleum of the Caesars suddenly flew open, and a blazing star
					appeared in the heavens; one of the prodigies, he said, concerned Julia Calvina,
					who was of the family of Augustus,<note anchored="true">The Flavian Family had

						Vespasian. As to the tomb of the Julian family, see AUGUSTUS, c. ci. </note>

				<head>Remarks on Vespasian</head>
				<p>NEITHER consanguinity nor adoption, as formerly, but great influence in the army
					having now become the road to the imperial throne, no person could claim a
					better title to that elevation than Titus Flavius Vespasian. He had not only
					served with great reputation in the wars both in Britain and Judaea, but seemed
					as yet untainted with any vice which could pervert his conduct in the civil
					administration of the empire. It appears, however, that he was prompted more by
					the persuasion of friends, than by his own ambition, to prosecute the attainment
					of the imperial dignity. To render this enterprise more successful, recourse was
					had to a new and peculiar artifice, which, while well accommodated to the
					superstitious credulity of the Romans, impressed them with an idea, that
					Vespasian's destiny to the throne was confirmed by supernatural indications.
					But, after his elevation, we hear no more of his miraculous achievements.</p>
				<p>The prosecution of the war in Britain, which had been suspended for some years,
					was resumed by Vespasian; and he sent thither Petilius Cerealis, who by his
					bravery extended the limits of the Roman province. Under Julius Frontinus,
					successor to the general, the invaders continued to make farther progress in the
					reduction of the island: but the commander who finally established the dominion
					of the Romans in Britain, was Julius Agricola, not less distinguished for his
					military achievements, than for his prudent regard to the civil administration
					of the country. He began his operations with the conquest of North Wales, whence
					passing over into the island of Anglesey, which had revolted since the time of
					Suetonius Paulinus, he again reduced it to subjection. Then proceeding
					northwards with his victorious army, he defeated the Britons in every
					engagement, took possession of all the territories in the southern parts of the
					island, and driving before him all who refused to submit to the Roman arms,
					penetrated even into the forests and mountains of Caledonia. He defeated the
					natives under Galgacus, their leader, in a decisive battle; and fixing a line of
					garrisons between the friths of Clyde and Forth, he secured the Roman province
					from the incursions of the people who occupied the parts of the island beyond
					that boundary. Wherever he established the Roman power, he introduced laws and
					civilization amongst the inhabitants, and employed every means of conciliating
					their affection, as well as of securing their obedience.</p>
				<p>The war in Judaea, which had been commenced under the former reign, was now
					continued in that of Vespasian; but he left the siege of Jerusalem to be
					conducted by his son Titus, who displayed great valour and military talents in
					the prosecution of the enterprise. After an obstinate defence by the Jews, that
					city, so much celebrated in the sacred writings, was finally demolished, and the
					glorious temple itself, the admiration of the world, reduced to ashes; contrary,
					however, to the will of Titus, who exerted his utmost efforts to extinguish the
					flames.</p>
				<p>The manners of the Romans had now attained to an enormous pitch of depravity,
					through the unbounded licentiousness of the times; and, to the honour of
					Vespasian, he discovered great zeal in his endeavours to effect a national
					reformation. Vigilant, active, and persevering, he was indefatigable in the
					management of public affairs, and rose in the winter before day-break, to give
					audience to his officers of state. But if we give credit to the whimsical
					imposition of a tax upon urine, we cannot entertain any high opinion, either of
					his talents as a financier, or of the resources of the Roman empire. By his
					encouragement of science, he displayed a liberality, of which there occurs no
					example under all the preceding emperors, since the time of Augustus. Pliny the
					elder was now in the height of reputation, as well as in great favour with
					Vespasian; and it was probably owing not a little to the advice of that
					minister, that the emperor showed himself so much the patron of Literary men. A
					writer mentioned frequently by Pliny, and who lived in this reign, was Licinius
					Mucianus, a Roman knight: he treated of the history and geography of the eastern
					countries. Juvenal, who had begun his Satires several years before, continued to
					inveigh against the flagrant vices of the times; but the only author whose
					writings we have to notice in the present reign, is a poet of a different class.
