				<p>JULIUS CAESAR, the divine, <note anchored="true">
						<foreign xml:lang="la">Julius Caesar Divus</foreign>. Romulus, the founder
						of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, had the honour of an
						apotheosis conferred on him by the senate, under the title of Quirinus, to
						obviate the people's suspicion of his having been taken off by a conspiracy
						of the patrician order. Political circumstances again concurred with popular
						superstition to revive this posthumous adulation in favour of Julius Caesar,
						the founder of the empire, who also fell by the hands of conspirators. It is
						remarkable in the history of a nation so jealous of public liberty, that, in
						both instances, they bestowed the highest mark of human homage upon men who
						owed their fate to the introduction of arbitrary power. </note> lost his
					father <note anchored="true">Pliny informs us that Caius Julius, the father of
						Julius Caesar, a man of praetorian rank, died suddenly at <placeName
							key="perseus,Pisa">Pisa</placeName>. </note> when he was in the
					sixteenth year of his age; <note anchored="true">A. U. C. (in the year from the
						foundation of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>) 670; A. C.
						(before Christ) about 92. </note> and the year following, being nominated to
					the office of high-priest of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>,
						<note anchored="true">
						<foreign xml:lang="la">Flamen Dialis</foreign>. This was an office of great
						dignity, but subjected the holder to many restrictions. He was not allowed
						to ride on horseback, nor to absent himself from the city for a single
						night. His wife was also under particular restraints, and could not be
						divorced. If she died, the flamen resigned his office, because there were
						certain sacred rites which he could not perform without her assistance.
						Besides other marks of distinction, he wore a purple robe called laena, and
						a conical mitre called apex. </note> he repudiated Cossutia, who was very
					wealthy, although her family belonged only to the equestrian order, and to whom
					he had been contracted when he was a mere boy. He then married Cornelia, the
					daughter of Cinna, who was four times consul; and had by her, shortly
					afterwards, a daughter named Julia. Resisting all the efforts of the dictator
					Sylla to induce him to divorce Cornelia, he suffered the penalty of being
					stripped of his sacerdotal office, his wife's dowry, and his own patrimonial
					estates; and, being identified with the adverse faction, <note anchored="true"
						>Two powerful parties were contending at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
							>Rome</placeName> for the supremacy; Sylla being at the head of the
						faction of the nobles, while Marius espoused the cause of the people. Sylla
						suspected Julius Caesar of belonging to the Marian party, because Marius had
						married his aunt Julia. </note> was compelled to withdraw from <placeName
						key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. After changing his place of concealment
					nearly every night, <note anchored="true">He wandered about for some time in the
							<placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> territory. </note>
					although he was suffering from a quartan ague, and having effected his release
					by bribing the officers who had tracked his footsteps, he at length obtained a
					pardon through the intercession of the vestal virgins, and of Mamercus AEmilius
					and Aurelius Cotta, his near relatives. We are assured that when Sylla, having
					withstood for a while the entreaties of his own best friends, persons of
					distinguished rank, at last yielded to their importunity, he exclaimed-either by
					a divine impulse, or from a shrewd conjecture: "Your suit is granted, and you
					may take him among you; but know," he added, " that this man, for whose safety
					you are so extremely anxious, will, some day or other, be the ruin of the party
					of the nobles, in defence of which you are leagued with me; for in this one
					Caesar, you will find many a Marius."</p>

				<p>His first campaign was served in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>,
					on the staff of the praetor, M. Thermus; and being dispatched into <placeName

							key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7002294"

						Propontis; and on the north by the Euxine sea. Its boundaries towards the
						east are not clearly ascertained, Strabo, Pliny, and Ptolemy differing from
						each other on the subject. </note> to bring thence a fleet, he loitered so
					long at the court of Nicomedes, as to give occasion to reports of lewd
					proceedings between him and that prince; which received additional credit from
					his hasty return to <placeName key="tgn,7016608">Bithynia</placeName>, under the
					pretext of recovering a debt due to a freedman, his client. The rest of his
					service was more favourable to his reputation; and when <placeName

					<note anchored="true"><placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName> was a

						famous for the study of philosophy and eloquence. According to Pliny, it
						remained a free city and in power one thousand five hundred years. It
						suffered much in the Peloponnesian war from the Athenians, and in the
						Mithridatic from the Romans, by whom it was taken and destroyed. But it soon
						rose again, having recovered its ancient liberty by the favour of Pompey;
						and was afterwards much embellished by Trajan, who added to it the splendour
						of his own name. This was the country of Pittacus, one of the seven wise men
						of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, as well as of Alcaeus
						and Sappho. The natives showed a particular taste for poetry, and had, as
						Plutarch informs us, stated times for the celebration of poetical contests.
					</note> was taken by storm, he was presented by Thermus with the civic crown.
						<note anchored="true">The civic crown was made of oak-leaves, and given to
						him who had saved the life of a citizen. The person thus decorated wore it
						at public spectacles, and sat next the senators. When he entered, the
						audience rose up, as a mark of respect. </note></p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="3">
				<p>He served also in <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>, <note
						anchored="true">A very extensive country of Hither Asia; lying between
							<placeName key="tgn,7002611">Pamphylia</placeName> to the west, Mount
						Taurus and Amanus to the north, <placeName key="tgn,1000140"
							>Syria</placeName> to the east, and the Mediterranean to the south. It
						was anciently famous for saffron; and hair-cloth, called by the Romans
							<foreign xml:lang="la">cilicium</foreign>, was the manufacture of this
						country. </note> under Servilius Isauricus, but only for a short time; as
					upon receiving intelligence of Sylla's death, he returned with all speed to
						<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, in expectation of what might
					follow from a fresh agitation set on foot by Marcus Lepidus. Distrusting,
					however, the abilities of this leader, and finding the times less favourable for
					the execution of this project than he had at first imagined, he abandoned all
					thoughts of joining Lepidus, although he received the most tempting offers.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="4">
				<p>Soon after this civil discord was composed, he preferred a charge of extortion
					against Cornelius Dolabella, a man of consular dignity, who had obtained the
					honour of a triumph. On the acquittal of the accused, he resolved to retire to
						<placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, <note anchored="true">A
						city and an island, near the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002358"
							>Caria</placeName>, famous for the huge statue of the Sun, called the
						Colossus. The Rhodians were celebrated not only for skill in naval affairs,
						but for learning, philosophy, and eloquence. During the latter periods of
						the Roman republic, and under some of the emperors, numbers resorted there
						to prosecute their studies; and it also became a place of retreat to
						discontented Romans. </note> with the view not only of avoiding the public
					odium which he had incurred, but of prosecuting his studies with leisure and
					tranquillity, under Apollonius, the son of Molon, at that time the most
					celebrated master of rhetoric. While on his voyage thither, in the winter
					season, he was taken by pirates near the island of Pharmacusa, <note
						anchored="true">Pharmacusa, an island lying off the coast of <placeName
							key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, near <placeName
							key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>. It is now called Parmosa.
					</note> and detained by them, burning with indignation, for nearly forty days;
					his only attendants being a physician and two chamberlains. For he had instantly
					dispatched his other servants and the friends who accompanied him, to raise
					money for his ransom. <note anchored="true">The ransom, too large for Caesar's
						private means, was raised by the voluntary contributions of the cities in
						the Asiatic province, who were equally liberal from their public funds in
						the case of other Romans who fell into the hands of pirates at that period.
					</note> Fifty talents having been paid down, he was landed on the coast, when,
					having collected some ships, <note anchored="true">From <placeName
							key="perseus,Miletus">Miletus</placeName>, as we are informed by
						Plutarch. </note> he lost no time in putting to sea in pursuit of the
					pirates, and having captured them, inflicted upon them the punishment with which
					he had often threatened them in jest. At that time Mithridates was ravaging the
					neighbouring districts, and on Caesar's arrival at <placeName key="tgn,7011266"
						>Rhodes</placeName>, that he might not appear to lie idle while danger
					threatened the allies of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, he
					passed over into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and having
					collected some auxiliary forces, and driven the king's governor out of the
					province, retained in their allegiance the cities which were wavering and ready
					to revolt.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="5">
				<p>Having been elected military tribune, the first honour he received from the
					suffrages of the people after his return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
						>Rome</placeName>, he zealously assisted those who took measures for
					restoring the tribunitian authority, which had been greatly diminished during
					the usurpation of Sylla. He likewise, by an act, which Plotius at his suggestion
					propounded to the people, obtained the recall of Lucius Cinna, his wife's
					brother, and others with him, who having been the adherents of Lepidus in the
					civil disturbances, had after that consul's death fled to Sertorius; <note
						anchored="true">Who commanded in <placeName key="tgn,1000095"
							>Spain</placeName>. </note> which law he supported by a speech.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="6">
				<p>During his quaestorship he pronounced funeral orations from the rostra, according
					to custom, in praise of his aunt Julia, and his wife Cornelia. In the panegyric
					on his aunt, he gives the following account of her own and his father's
					genealogy, on both sides: "My aunt Julia derived her descent, by the mother,
					from a race of kings, and by her father, from the Immortal Gods. For the Marcii
					Reges, <note anchored="true">Rex, it will be easily understood, was not a title
						of dignity in a Roman family, but the surname of the Marcii. </note> her
					mother's family, deduce their pedigree from Ancus Marcius, and the Julii, her
					father's, from Venus; of which stock we are a branch. We therefore unite in our
					descent the sacred majesty of kings, the chiefest among men, and the divine
					majesty of Gods, to whom kings themselves are subject." To supply the place of
					Cornelia, he married Pompeia, the daughter of Quintus Pompeius, and
					grand-daughter of Lucius Sylla; but he afterwards divorced her, upon suspicion
					of her having been debauched by Publius Clodius. For so current was the report,
					that Clodius had found access to her disguised as a woman, during the
					celebration of a religious solemnity,<note anchored="true">The rites of the Bona
						Dea, called also Fauna, which were performed in the night, and by women
						only.</note> that the senate instituted an inquiry respecting the
					profanation of the sacred rites.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="7">
				<p>Farther-Spain <note anchored="true">Hispania Baetica; the Hither province being
						called Hispania Tarraconensis. </note> fell to his lot as quaestor; when
					there, as he was going the circuit of the province, by commission from the
					praetor, for the administration of justice, and had reached <placeName
						key="tgn,7007512">Gades</placeName>, seeing a statue of Alexander the Great
					in the temple of Hercules, he sighed deeply, as if weary of his sluggish life,
					for having performed no memorable actions at an ages at which Alexander had
					already conquered the world.<note anchored="true">Alexander the Great was only
						thirty-three years at the time of his death. </note> He, therefore,
					immediately sued for his discharge, with the view of embracing the first
					opportunity, which might present itself in The City, of entering upon a more
					exalted career. In the stillness of the night following, he dreamt that he lay
					with his own mother; but his confusion was relieved, and his hopes were raised
					to the highest pitch, by the interpreters of his dream, who expounded it as an
					omen that he should possess universal empire; for that the mother who in his
					sleep he had found submissive to his embraces, was no other than the earth, the
					common parent of all mankind.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="8">
				<p>Quitting therefore the province before the expiration of the usual term, he
					betook himself to the Latin colonies, which were then eagerly agitating the
					design of obtaining the freedom of <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
						>Rome</placeName>; and he would have stirred them up to some bold attempt,
					had not the consuls, to prevent any commotion, detained for some time the
					legions which had been raised for service in <placeName key="tgn,7002470"
						>Cilicia</placeName>. But this did not deter him from making, soon
					afterwards, a still greater effort within the precincts of the city itself.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="9">
				<p>For, only a few days before he entered upon the edileship, he incurred a
					suspicion of having engaged in a conspiracy with Marcus Crassus, a man of
					consular rank; to whom were joined Publius Sylla and Lucius Autronius, who,
					after they had been chosen consuls, were convicted of bribery. The plan of the
					conspirators was to fall upon the senate at the opening of the new year, and
					murder as many of them as should be thought necessary; upon which, Crassus was
					to assume the office of dictator, and appoint Caesar his master of the
						horse.<note anchored="true">The proper office of the master of the horse was
						to command the knights, and execute the orders of the dictator. He was
						usually nominated from amongst persons of consular and pratorian dignity;
						and had the use of a horse, which the dictator had not, without the order of
						the people. </note> When the commonwealth had been thus ordered according to
					their pleasure, the consulship was to have been restored to Sylla and Autronius.
					Mention is made of this plot by Tanusius Geminus<note anchored="true"><placeName
							key="tgn,2652379">Seneca</placeName> compares the annals of Tanusius to
						the life of a fool, which, though it may be long, is worthless; while that
						of a wise man, like a good book, is valuable, however short.-Epist. 94.
					</note> in his history, by Marcus Bibulus in his edicts, <note anchored="true"
						>Bibulus was Caesar's colleague, both as edile and consul. Cicero calls his
						edicts "Archilochian," that is, as full of spite as the verses of
							Archilochus.-<bibl n="Cic. Att. 7.24">Ad. Attc. b. 7. ep. 24.</bibl>
					</note> and by Curio, the father, in his orations. <note anchored="true">A. U.
						C. 689. Cicero holds both the Curios, father and son, very cheap.-Brut. c.

						the Roman people considered an insupportable tyranny. An honourable
						banishment. </note> Cicero likewise seems to hint at this in a letter to
						<placeName key="tgn,7015932">Axius</placeName>, where he says, that Caesar
					had in his consulship secured to himself that arbitrary power <note
						anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="la">Regnum</foreign>, the kingly power,
						which the Roman people considered an insupportable tyranny.</note> to which
					he had aspired when he was edile. Tanusius adds, that Crassus, from remorse or
					fear, did not appear upon the day appointed for the massacre of the senate; for
					which reason Caesar omitted to give the signal, which, according to the plan
					concerted between them, he was to have made. The agreement, Curio says, was that
					he should shake off the toga from his shoulder. We have the authority of the
					same Curio, and of M. Actorius Naso, for his having been likewise concerned in
					another conspiracy with young Cneius Piso; to whom, upon a suspicion of some
					mischief being meditated in the city, the province of <placeName
						key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> was decreed out of the regular
						course.<note anchored="true">An honourable banishment.</note> It is said to
					have been agreed between them, that Piso should head a revolt in the provinces,
					whilst the other should attempt to stir up an insurrection at <placeName
						key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, using as their instruments the
					Lambrani, and the tribes beyond the Po. But the execution of this design was
					frustrated in both quarters by the death of Piso.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="10">
				<p>In his edileship, he not only embellished the Comitium,<note anchored="true">The
						assemblies of the people were at first held in the open Forum. Afterwards, a
						covered building, called the Comitium, was erected for that purpose. There
						are no remains of it, but Lumisden thinks that it probably stood on the
						south side of the Forum, on the site of the present church of The
						Consolation.-Antiq. of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, p.
						357. </note> and the rest of the Forum, with the adjoining halls, <note
						anchored="true">Basilicas, from <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>basileu/s</foreign>; a king. They were, indeed, the palaces of the
						sovereign people; stately and spacious buildings, with halls, which served
						the purpose of exchanges, council chambers, and courts of justice. Some of
						the Basilicas were afterwards converted into Christian churches. "The form
						was oblong; the middle was an open space to walk in, called Testudo, and
						which we now call the nave. On each side of this were rows of pillars, which
						formed what we should call the sideaisles, and which the ancients called
						Porticus. The end of the Testudo was curved, like the apse of some of our
						churches, and was called Tribunal, from causes being heard there. Hence the
						term Tribune is applied to that part of the Roman churches which is behind
						the high altar."-Burton's Antiq. of <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
							>Rome</placeName>, p. 204. </note> but adorned the Capitol also, with
					temporary piazzas, constructed for the purpose of displaying some part of the
					superabundant collections he had made for the amusement of the people. <note
						anchored="true">Such as statues and pictures, the works of Greek artists.
					</note> He entertained them with the hunting of wild beasts, and with games,
					both alone and in conjunction with his colleague. On this account, he obtained
					the whole credit of the expense to which they had jointly contributed; insomuch
					that his colleague, Marcus Bibulus, could not forbear remarking, that he was
					served in the manner of Pollux. For as the temple <note anchored="true">It
						appears to have stood at the foot of the Capitoline hill. Piranesi thinks
						that the two beautiful columns of white marble, which are commonly described
						as belonging to the portico of the temple of Jupiter Stator, are the remains
						of the temple of Castor and Pollux. </note> erected in the Forum to the two
					brothers, went by the name of Castor alone, so his and Caesar's joint
					munificence was imputed to the latter only. To the other public spectacles
					exhibited to the people, Caesar added a fight of gladiators, but with fewer
					pairs of combatants than he had intended. For he had collected from all parts so
					great a company of them, that his enemies became alarmed; and a decree was made,
					restricting the number of gladiators which any one was allowed to retain at
						<placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="11">
				<p>Having thus conciliated popular favour, he endeavoured, through his interest with
					some of the tribunes, to get <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>
					assigned to him as a province, by an act of the people. The pretext alleged for
					the creation of this extraordinary government, was, that the Alexandrians had
					violently expelled their king,<note anchored="true">Ptolemy Auletes, the son of
							<placeName key="tgn,2038217">Cleopatra</placeName>.</note> whom the
					senate had complimented with the title of an ally and friend of the Roman
					people. This was generally resented; but, notwithstanding, there was so much
					opposition from the faction of the nobles, that he could not carry his point. In
					order, therefore, to diminish their influence by every means in his power, he
					restored the trophies erected in honor of Caius Marius, on account of his
					victories over Jugurtha, the Cimbri, and the Teutoni, which had been demolished
					by Sylla; and when sitting in judgment upon murderers, he treated those as
					assassins, who, in the late proscription, had received money from the treasury,
					for bringing in the heads of Roman citizens, although they were expressly
					excepted in the <placeName key="tgn,2257061">Cornelian</placeName> laws.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="12">
				<p>He likewise suborned some one to prefer an impeachment for treason against Caius
					Rabirius, by whose especial assistance the senate had, a few years before, put
					down Lucius Saturninus, the seditious tribune; and being drawn by lot a judge on
					the trial, he condemned him with so much animosity, that upon his appealing to
					the people, no circumstance availed him so much as the extraordinary bitterness
					of his judge.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="13">
				<p>Having renounced all hope of obtaining <placeName key="tgn,7016833"
						>Egypt</placeName> for his province, he stood candidate for the office of
					chief pontiff, to secure which, he had recourse to the most profuse bribery.
					Calculating, on this occasion, the enormous amount of the debts he had
					contracted, he is reported to have said to his mother, when she kissed him at
					his going out in the morning to the assembly of the people, "I will never return
					home unless I am elected pontiff." In effect, he left so far behind him two most
					powerful competitors, who were much his superiors both in age and rank, that he
					had more votes in their own tribes, than they both had in all the tribes
					together.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="14">
				<p>After he was chosen praetor, the conspiracy of Catiline was discovered; and while
					every other member of the senate voted for inflicting capital punishment on the
					accomplices in that crime,<note anchored="true">Lentulus, Cethegus, and
						others</note> he alone proposed that the delinquents should be distributed
					for safe custody among the towns of <placeName key="tgn,1000080"
						>Italy</placeName>, their property being confiscated. He even struck such
					terror into those who were advocates of severity, by representing to them what
					universal odium would be attached to their memories by the Roman people, that
					Decius Silanus, consul-elect, did not hesitate to qualify his proposal, it not
					being very honourable to change it, by a lenient interpretation: as if it had
					been understood in a harsher sense than he intended, and Caesar would certainly
					have carried his point, having brought over to his side a great number of the
					senators, among whom was Cicero, the consul's brother, had not a speech by
					Marcus Cato infused new vigour into the resolutions of the senate. He persisted,
					however, in obstructing the measure, until a body of the Roman knights, who
					stood under arms as a guard, threatened him with instant death, if he continued
					his determined opposition. They even thrust at him with their drawn swords, so
					that those who sat next him moved away; and a few friends, with no small
					difficulty, protected him, by throwing their arms round him, and covering him
					with their togas. At last, deterred by this violence, he not only gave way, but
					absented himself from the senate-house during the remainder of that year.</p>

					alternate months when the fasces were not carried before him. Upon preferring a
					bill to the people for the division of some public lands, he was opposed by his
					colleague, whom he violently drove out of the forum. Next day the insulted
					consul made a complaint in the senate of this treatment; but such was the
					consternation, that no one having the courage to bring the matter forward or
					move a censure, which had been often done under outrages of less importance, he
					was so much dispirited, that until the expiration of his office he never stirred
					from home, and did nothing but issue edicts to obstruct his colleague's
					proceedings. From that time, therefore, Caesar had the sole management of public
					affairs; insomuch that some wags, when they signed any instrument as witnesses,
					did not add " in the consulship of Caesar and Bibulus," but, "of Julius and
					Caesar;" putting the same person down twice, under his name and surname. The
					following verses likewise were currently repeated on this occasion: <quote

					to bid so extravagantly upon the next occasion. He made various profuse grants
					to meet the wishes of others, no one opposing him; or if any such attempt was
					made, it was soon suppressed. Marcus Cato, who interrupted him in his

				<p>About the same time he married Calpurnia, the daughter of Lucius Piso, who was to

				<p>When the term of his consulship had expired, upon a motion being made in the

					they declining the business, after three days spent in vain altercation, he set
					out for his province. Immediately, however, his quaestor was charged with
					several misdemeanors, for the purpose of implicating Caesar himself. Indeed, an
					accusation was soon after preferred against him by Lucius Antistius, tribune of
					the people; but by making an appeal to the tribune's colleagues, he succeeded in
					having the prosecution suspended during this absence in the service of the
					state. To secure himself, therefore, for the time to come, he was particularly
					careful to secure the good-will of the magistrates at the annual elections,
					assisting none of the candidates with his interest, nor suffering any persons to
					be advanced to any office, who would not positively undertake to defend him in
					his absence: for which purpose he made no scruple to require of some of them an
					oath, and even a written obligation.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="24">
				<p>But when Lucius Domitius became a candidate for the consulship, and openly
					threatened that, upon his being elected consul, he would effect that which he

						>Lucca</placeName>, a city in his province, and pressed them, for the
					purpose of disappointing Domitius, to sue again for the consulship, and to
					continue him in his command for five years longer: with both which requisitions
					they complied. Presumptuous now with his success, he added, at his own private
					charge, more legions to those which he had received from the republic; among the
					former of which was one levied in Transalpine Gaul, and called by a Gallic name,
						Alauda,<note anchored="true">So called from the feathers on their helmets,
						resembling the crest of a lark; Alauda, Fr. Alouette.</note> which he
					trained and armed in the Roman fashion, and afterwards conferred on it the
					freedom of the city. From this period he declined no occasion of war, however
					unjust and dangerous; attacking, without any provocation, as well the allies of
						<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> as the barbarous nations
					which were its enemies: insomuch, that the senate passed a decree for sending
					commissioners to examine into the condition of <placeName key="tgn,1000070"
						>Gaul</placeName>; and some members even proposed that he should be
					delivered up to the enemy. But so great had been the success of his enterprises,

					those more frequently, than had ever before been decreed to any commander.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="25">
				<p>During nine years in which he held the government of the province, his
					achievements were as follows: he reduced all <placeName key="tgn,1000070"
						>Gaul</placeName>, bounded by the Pyrenean forest, the <placeName
						key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, mount Gebenna, and the two rivers, the

						key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName>, and being about three thousand two
					hundred miles in compass, into the form of a province, excepting only the
					nations in alliance with the republic, and such as had merited his favour;
					imposing upon this new acquisition an annual tribute of forty millions of
					sesterces. He was the first of the Romans who, crossing the <placeName
						key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName> by a bridge, attacked the Germanic
					tribes inhabiting the country beyond that river, whom he defeated in several
					engagements. He also invaded the Britons, a people formerly unknown, and having
					vanquished them, exacted from them contributions and hostages. Amidst such a
					series of successes, he experienced thrice only any signal disaster; once in
						<placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, when his fleet was nearly
					wrecked in a storm; in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, at
						<placeName key="tgn,6002232">Gergovia</placeName>, where one of his legions
					was put to the rout; and in the territory of the Germans, his lieutenants
					Titurius and Aurunculeius were cut off by an ambuscade. </p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="26">
				<p>During this period<note anchored="true">A. U. C. 702</note> he lost his
						mother,<note anchored="true">Aurelia</note> whose death was followed by that
					of his daughter,<note anchored="true">Julia, the wife of Pompey, who died in
						childbirth</note> and, not long afterwards, of his granddaughter. Meanwhile,
					the republic being in consternation at the murder of Publius Clodius, and the
					senate passing a vote that only one consul, namely, Cneius Pompeius, should be
					chosen for the ensuing year, he prevailed with the tribunes of the people, who
					intended joining him in nomination with Pompey, to propose to the people a bill,
					enabling him, though absent, to become a candidate for his second consulship,
					when the term of his command should be near expiring, that he might not be
					obliged on that account to quit his province too soon, and before the conclusion
					of the war. Having attained this object, carrying his views still higher, and
					animated with the hopes of success, he omitted no opportunity of gaining
					universal favour, by acts of liberality and kindness to individuals, both in
					public and private. With money raised from the spoils of the war, he began to
					construct a new forum, the ground-plot of which cost him above a hundred
					millions of sesterces.<note anchored="true">Conquest had so multiplied business
						at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, that the Roman forum
						became too little for transacting it, and could not be enlarged without

						sum which its site is said to have cost, amounting, it is calculated, to
						£807,291 sterling. It stood near the old forum, behind the temple of Romulus
						and Remus, but not a vestige of it remains.</note> He promised the people a
					public entertainment of gladiators, and a feast in memory of his daughter, such
					as no one before him had ever given. The more to raise their expectations on
					this occasion, although he had agreed with victuallers of all denominations for
					his feast, he made yet farther preparations in private houses. He issued an
					order, that the most celebrated gladiators, if at any time during the combat
					they incurred the displeasure of the public, should be immediately carried off
					by force, and reserved for some future occasion. Young gladiators he trained up,
					not in the school, and by the masters, of defence, but in the houses of Roman
					knights, and even senators, skilled in the use of arms, earnestly requesting
					them, as appears from his letters, to undertake the discipline of those
					novitiates, and to give them the word during their exercises. He doubled the pay
					of the legions in perpetuity; allowing them likewise corn, when it was in
					plenty, without any restriction; and sometimes distributing to every soldier in
					his army a slave, and a portion of land.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="27">
				<p>To maintain his alliance, and good understanding with Pompey, he offered him in
					marriage his sister's grand-daughter Octavia, who had been married to Caius
					Marcellus; and requested for himself his daughter, lately contracted to Faustus
					Sylla. Every person about him, and a great part likewise of the senate, he
					secured by loans of money at low interest, or none at all; and to all others who
					came to wait upon him, either by invitation or of their own accord, he made
					liberal presents; not neglecting even the freedmen and slaves, who were
					favourites with their masters and patrons. He offered also singular and ready
					aid to all who were under prosecution, or in debt, and to prodigal youths;
					excluding from his bounty those only who were so deeply plunged in guilt,
					poverty, or luxury, that it was impossible effectually to relieve them. These,
					he openly declared, could derive no benefit from any other means than a civil
					war.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="28">
				<p>He endeavoured with equal assiduity to engage in his interest princes and
					provinces in every part of the world: presenting some with thousands of
					captives, and sending to others the assistance of troops, at whatever time and
					place they desired, without any authority from either the senate or people of
						<placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. He likewise embellished with
					magnificent public buildings the most powerful cities not only of <placeName

					of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and <placeName
						key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>; until all people being now astonished,
					and speculating on the obvious tendency of these proceedings, Claudius
					Marcellus, the consul, declaring first by proclamation, that he intended to
					propose a measure of the utmost importance to the state, made a motion in the
					senate that some person should be appointed to succeed Caesar in his province,
					before the term of his command was expired; because the war being brought to a
					conclusion, peace was restored, and the victorious army ought to be disbanded.
					He further moved, that Caesar being absent, his claims to be a candidate at the
					next election of consuls, should not be admitted, as Pompey himself had
					afterwards abrogated that privilege by a decree of the people. The fact was,
					that Pompey, in his law relating to the choice of chief magistrates, had forgot
					to except Caesar, in the article in which he declared all such as were not
					present incapable of being candidates for any office; but soon afterwards, when
					the law was inscribed on brass, and deposited in the treasury, he corrected his
					mistake. Marcellus, not content with depriving Caesar of his provinces, and the
					privilege intended him by Pompey, likewise moved the senate, that the freedom of
					the city should be taken from those colonists whom, by the Vatinian law, he had
					settled at New Como;<note anchored="true"><placeName key="perseus,Comum"
							>Comum</placeName> was a town of the Orobii, of ancient standing, and
						formerly powerful. Julius Csesar added to it five thousand new colonists;

			<div type="chapter" n="29">
				<p>Roused by these proceedings, and thinking, as he was often heard to say, that it
					would be a more difficult enterprise to reduce him, now that he was the chief
					man in the state, from the first rank of citizens to the second, than from the
					second to the lowest of all, Caesar made a vigorous opposition to the measure,
					partly by means of the tribunes, who interposed in his behalf, and partly
					through Servius Sulpicius, the other consul. The following year likewise, when
					Caius Marcellus, who succeeded his cousin Marcus in the consulship, pursued the
					same course, Caesar, by means of an immense bribe, engaged in his defence
					AEmilius Paulus, the other consul, and Caius Curio, the most violent of the
					tribunes. But finding the opposition obstinately bent against him, and that the
					consuls-elect were also of that party, he wrote a letter to the senate,
					requesting that they would not deprive him of the privilege kindly granted him
					by the people; or else that the other generals should resign the command of
					their armies as well as himself; fully persuaded, as it is thought, that he
					could more easily collect his veteran soldiers, whenever he pleased, than Pompey
					could his new-raised troops. At the same time, he made his adversaries an offer
					to disband eight of his legions and give up Transalpine-Gaul, on condition that
					he might retain two legions, with the Cisalpine province, or but one legion with
						<placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, until he should be

			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="30">
				<p>But as the senate declined to interpose in the business, and his enemies declared
					that they would enter into no compromise where the safety of the republic was at
					stake, he advanced into Hither-Gaul,<note anchored="true">A.U.C. 705.</note>
					and, having gone to the circuit for the administration of justice, made a halt
					at <placeName key="perseus,Ravenna">Ravenna</placeName>, resolved to have
					recourse to arms if the senate should proceed to extremity against the tribunes
					of the people who had espoused his cause. This was indeed his pretext for the
					civil war; but it is supposed that there were other motives for his conduct.
					Cneius Pompey used frequently to say, that he sought to throw every thing into
					confusion, because he was unable, with all his private wealth, to complete the
					works he had begun, and answer, at his return, the vast expectations which he
					had excited in the people. Others pretend that he was apprehensive of being
					called to account for what he had done in his protests of the tribunes; Marcus
					Cato having sometimes declared, and that, too, with an oath, that he would
					prefer an impeachment against him, as soon as he disbanded his ·army. A report
					likewise prevailed, that if he returned as a private person, he would, like
						<placeName key="tgn,1127168">Milo</placeName>, have to plead his cause
					before the judges, surrounded by armed men. This conjecture is rendered highly
					probable by Asinius Pollio, who informs us that Caesar, upon viewing the
					vanquished and slaughtered enemy in the field of Pharsalia, expressed himself in
					these very words: " This was their intention: I, Caius Caesar, after all the
					great achievements I had performed, must have been condemned, had I not summoned
					the army to my aid !" Some think, that having contracted from long habit an
					extraordinary love of power, and having weighed his own and his enemies'
					strength, he embraced that occasion of usurping the supreme power; which indeed
					he had coveted from the time of his youth. This seems to have been the opinion
					entertained by Cicero, who tells us, in the third book of his Offices, that
					Caesar used to have frequently in his mouth two verses of Euripides, which he
					thus translates: <quote xml:lang="la"><l>Nam si violandum est jus, regnandi

				<p>When intelligence, therefore, was received, that the interposition of the
					tribunes in his favour had been utterly rejected, and that they themselves had
					fled from the city, he immediately sent forward some cohorts, but privately, to
					prevent any suspicion of his design; and, to keep up appearances, attended at a
					public spectacle, examined the model of a fencing-school which he proposed to
					build, and, as usual, sat down to table with a numerous party of his friends.
					But after sun-set, mules being put to his carriage from a neighbouring mill, he
					set forward on his journey with all possible privacy, and a small retinue. The
					lights going out, he lost his way, and wandered a long time, until at length, by
					the help of a guide, whom he found towards day-break, he proceeded on foot
					through some narrow paths, and again reached the road. Coming up with his troops
					on the banks of the Rubicon, which was the boundary of his province, <note
						anchored="true">Now the Pisatello; near <placeName key="tgn,7004929"

					mind the importance of the step he was on the point of taking, he turned to
					those about him, and said: "We may still retreat: but if we pass this little

				<p>While he was thus hesitating, the following incident occurred. A person
					remarkable for his noble mien and graceful aspect, appeared close at hand,
					sitting and playing upon a pipe. When, not only the shepherds, but a number of
					soldiers also flocked from their posts to listen to him, and some trumpeters
					among them, he snatched a trumpet from one of them, ran to the river with it,
					and sounding the advance with a piercing blast, crossed to the other side. Upon
					this, Caesar exclaimed, " Let us go where the omens of the Gods and the iniquity
					of our enemies call us. The die is now cast."</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="33">
				<p>Accordingly, having marched his army over the river, he shewed them the tribunes
					of the people, who, upon their being driven from the city, had come to meet him;
					and, in the presence of that assembly, called upon the troops to pledge him
					their fidelity, with tears in his eyes, and his garment rent from his bosom. It
					has been supposed, that upon this occasion he promised to every soldier a
					knight's estate; but that opinion is founded on a mistake. For when, in his
					harangue to them, he frequently held out a finger of his left hand, <note
						anchored="true">The ring was worn on the finger next to the little finger of
						the left hand. </note> and declared, that to recompense those who should
					support him in the defence of his honor, he would willingly part even with his
					ring; the soldiers at a distance, who could more easily see than hear him while
					he spoke, formed their conception of what he said, by the eye, not by the ear;
					and accordingly gave out, that he had promised to each of them the privilege of
					wearing the gold ring, and an estate of four hundred thousand sesterces. <note
						anchored="true">Suetonius here accounts for the mistake of the soldiers with
						great probability. The class to which they imagined they were to be
						promoted, was that of the equites, or knights, who wore a gold ring, and
						were possessed of property to the amount stated in the text. Great as was
						the liberality of Caesar to his legions, the performance of this imaginary
						promise was beyond all reasonable expectation. </note></p>

				<p>Of his subsequent proceedings I shall give a cursory detail, in the order in

					he marched along the coast of the Upper Sea, to <placeName

					After vain attempts, by all the obstacles he could oppose, to prevent their

					without an army." Though his progress was retarded both by the siege of
						<placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, which shut her agates

					crossing the sea to <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, blocked

					flight to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, where he
					was tinformed of his murder, he presently found himself also engaged, under all
					the disadvantages of time and place, in a very dangerous war, with king Ptolemy,
					who, he saw, had treacherous designs upon his life. It was winter, and he,
					within the walls of a well-provided and subtle enemy, was destitute of every
					thing, and wholly unprepared for such a conflict. He succeeded, however, in his
					enterprise, and put the kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,7016833"
						>Egypt</placeName> into the hands of Cleopatra and her younger brother;
					being afraid to make it a province, lest, under an aspiring prefect, it might

					seized the opportunity which the distraction of the times offered for making war
					upon his neighbours, and his insolence and fierceness had grown with his
					success. Caesar, however, within five days after entering his country, and four
					hours after coming in sight of him, overthrew him in one decisive battle. Upon
					which, he frequently remarked to those about him the good fortune of Pompey, who
					had obtained his military reputation, chiefly, by victory over so feeble an
					enemy. He afterwards defeated Scipio and Juba, who were rallying the remains of
					the party in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, and Pompey's sons

				<p>To every foot soldier in his veteran legions, besides the two thousand sesterces

						were distributed into four parties, distinguished by the colour of their
						dress. The spectators, without regarding the speed of the horses, or the
						skill of the men, were attracted merely by one or the other of the colours,

						thousand men lost their lives at <placeName key="tgn,7002473"

						first made in the Circus Maximus, but afterwards elsewhere. The combatants

					presented on the spot with five hundred thousand sesterces, and a gold ring, he
					went from the stage, through the orchestra, and resumed his place in the seats
					allotted for the equestrian order. In the Circensian games, the circus being
					enlarged at each end, and a canal sunk round it, several of the young nobility
					drove chariots, drawn, some by four, and others by two horses, and likewise rode
					races on single horses. The Trojan game was acted by two distinct companies of
					boys, one differing from the other in age and rank. The hunting of wild beasts
					was presented for five days successively; and on the last day a battle was
					fought by five hundred foot, twenty elephants, and thirty horse on each side. To
					afford room for this engagement, the goals were removed, and in their space two
					camps were pitched, directly opposite to each other. Wrestlers likewise

				<p>Turning afterwards his attention to the regulation of the commonwealth, he

						to consist of twenty-nine days instead of twenty-eight, and, of course, the
						whole year to consist of three hundred and sixty-six days. The fourth year
						was denominated Bissextile, or leap year, because the sixth day before the
						calends, or first of March, was reckoned twice. The Julian year was
						introduced throughout the Roman empire, and continued in general use till
						the year <date value="1582">1582</date>. But the true correction was not six
						hours, but five hours, forty-nine minutes; hence the addition was too great
						by eleven minutes. This small fraction would amount in one hundred years to
						three-fourths of a day, and in a thousand years to more than seven days. It
						had, in fact, amounted, since the Julian correction, in <date value="1582"
							>1582</date>, to more than seven days. Pope Gregory XIII., therefore,
						again reformed the calendar, first bringing forward the year ten days, by
						reckoning the 5th of October the 15th, and then prescribing the rule which
						has gradually been adopted throughout Christendom, except in <placeName

					unwarrantable liberty which the pontiffs had taken in the article of
					intercalation. To such a height had this abuse proceeded, that neither the
					festivals designed for the harvest fell in summer, nor those for the vintage in
					autumn. He accommodated the year to the course of the sun, ordaining that in
					future it should consist of three hundred and sixty-five days without any
					intercalary month; and that every fourth year an intercalary day should be
					inserted. That the year might thenceforth commence regularly with the calends,
					or first of January, he inserted two months between November and December; so
					that the year in which this regulation was made consisted of fifteen months,
					including the month of intercalation. which, according to the division of time

				<p>He filled up the vacancies in the senate, by advancing several plebeians to the
					rank of patricians, and also increased the number of praetors, aediles,
					quaestors, and inferior magistrates; restoring, at the same time, such as had
					been degraded by the censors, or convicted of bribery at elections. The choice
					of magistrates he so divided with the people, that, excepting only the
					candidates for the consulship, they nominated one half of them, and he the
					other. The method which he practised in those cases was, to recommend such
					persons as he had pitched upon, by bills dispersed through the several tribes to
					this effect: "Caesar the dictator to such a tribe (naming it). I recommend to
					you (naming likewise the persons), that by the favour of your votes they may
					attain to the honours for which they sue." He likewise admitted to offices the
					sons of those who had been proscribed. The trial of causes he restricted to two
					orders of judges, the equestrian and senatorial; excluding the tribunes of the
					treasury who had before made a third class. The revised census of the people he
					ordered to be taken neither in the usual manner or place, but street by street,
					by the principal inhabitants of the several quarters of the city; and he reduced
					the number of those who received corn at the public cost, from three hundred and
					twenty, to a hundred and fifty, thousand. To prevent any tumults on account of

					deducting from the debt what had been paid for interest either in money or by
					bonds; by virtue of which provision about a fourth part of the debt was lost. He
					dissolved all the guilds, except such as were of ancient foundation. Crimes were
					punished with greater severity; and the rich being more easily induced to commit

					the lake on which he had entertained the people with the spectacle of a
					sea-fight. He also projected a most spacious theatre adjacent to the Tarpeian
					mount; and also proposed to reduce the civil law to a reasonable compass, and
					out of that immense and undigested mass of statutes to extract the best and most
					necessary parts into a few books; to make as large a collection as possible of
					works in the Greek and Latin languages, for the public use; the province of
					providing and putting them in proper order being assigned to Marcus Varro. He
					intended likewise to drain the Pomptine marshes, to cut a channel for the

					general engagement with them, until he had made some trial of their prowess in
					war. But in the midst of all his undertakings and projects, he was carried off
					by death; before I speak of which, it may not be improper to give an account of

					his face smoothly shaved, but even caused the hair on other parts of the body to
					be plucked out by the roots, a practice for which some persons rallied him. His
					baldness gave him much uneasiness, having often found himself on that account
					exposed to the jibes of his enemies. He therefore used to bring forward the hair
					from the crown of his head; and of all the honours conferred upon him by the

				<p>It is admitted by all that he was much addicted to women, as well as very

					Lollia, the wife of Aulus Gabinius; Tertulla, the wife of Marcus Crassus; and
					Mucia, the wife of Cneius Pompey. For it is certain that the Curios, both father

					ambition, he married the daughter of a man, upon whose account he had divorced
					his wife, after having had three children by her; and whom he used, with a deep
					sigh, to call AEgisthus." <note anchored="true">AEgisthus, who, like Caesar, was

				<p>In the number of his mistresses were also some queens; such as Eunoe, a Moor, the
					wife of Bogudes, to whom and her husband he made, as Naso reports, many large
					presents. But his greatest favourite was Cleopatra, with whom he often revelled
					all night until the dawn of day, and would have gone with her through <placeName

					honours and presents, and gave her permission to call by his name a son, who,

					acknowledged the child as his own; and that Caius Matias, Caius Oppius, and the
					rest of Caesar's friends knew it to be true. On which occasion Oppius, as if it
					had been an imputation which he was called upon to refute, published a book to
					shew, "that the child which Cleopatra fathered upon Caesar, was not his."
					Helvius Cinna, tribune to the people, admitted to several persons the fact, that
					he had a bill ready drawn, which Caesar had ordered him to get enacted in his
					absence, allowing him, with the hope of leaving issue, to take any wife he
					chose, and as many of them as he pleased; and to leave no room for doubt of his

				<p>It is acknowledged even by his enemies, that in regard to wine he was abstemious.
					A remark is ascribed to Marcus Cato, "that Caesar was the only sober man amongst
					all those who were engaged in the design to subvert the government." In the
					matter of diet, Caius Oppius informs us, "that he was so indifferent, that when
					a person in whose house he was entertained, had served him with stale, instead
					of fresh, oil,<note anchored="true">Plutarch tells us that the oil was used in'

				<p>But his abstinence did not extend to pecuniary advantages, either in his military
					commands, or civil offices; for we have the testimony of some writers, that he
					took money from the proconsul, who was his predecessor in <placeName
						key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and from the Roman allies in that
					quarter, for the discharge of his debts; and plundered at the point of the sword
					some towns of the Lusitanians, notwithstanding they attempted no resistance, and
					opened their gates to him upon his arrival before them. In <placeName
						key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, he rifled the chapels and temples of the
					gods, which were filled with rich offerings, and demolished cities oftener for
					the sake of their spoil, than for any ill they had done. By this means gold
					became so plentiful with him, that he exchanged it through <placeName
						key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and the provinces of the empire for
					three thousand sesterces the pound. In his first consulship he purloined from
					the Capitol three thousand pounds weight of gold, and substituted for it the
					same quantity of gilt brass. He bartered likewise to foreign nations and
					princes, for gold, the titles of allies and kings; and squeezed out of Ptolemy
					alone near six thousand talents, in the name of himself and Pompey. He
					afterwards supported the expense of the civil wars, and of his triumphs and
					public spectacles, by the most flagrant rapine and sacrilege.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="55">
				<p>In eloquence and warlike achievements, he equalled at least, if he did not
					surpass, the greatest of men. After his prosecution of Dolabella, he was
					indisputably reckoned one of the most distinguished advocates. Cicero, in
					recounting to Brutus the famous orators, declares, "that he does not see that
					Caesar was inferior to any one of them;" and says, "that he had an elegant,
					splendid, noble, and magnificent vein of eloquence." And in a letter to
					Cornelius Nepos, he writes of him in the following terms: "What! Of all the
					orators, who, during the whole course of their lives, have done nothing else,
					which can you prefer to him ? Which of them is more pointed or terse in his
					periods, or employs more polished and elegant language ?" In his youth, he seems
					to have chosen Strabo Caesar for his model; from whose oration in behalf of the
					Sardinians he has transcribed some passages literally into his Divination. In
					his delivery he is said to have had a shrill voice, and his action was animated,
					but not ungraceful. He has left behind him some speeches, among which are ranked
					a few that are not genuine, such as that on behalf of Quintus Metellus. These
					Augustus supposes, with reason, to be rather the production of blundering
					short-hand writers, who were not able to keep pace with him in the delivery,
					than publications of his own. For I find in some copies that the title is not
					"For Metellus," but "What he wrote to Metellus:" whereas the speech is delivered
					in the name of Caesar, vindicating Metellus and himself from the aspersions cast
					upon them by their common defamers. The speech addressed "To his soldiers in
						<placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>," Augustus considers likewise
					as spurious. We meet with two under this title; one made, as is pretended, in
					the first battle, and the other in the last; at which time, Asinius Pollio says,
					he had not leisure to address the soldiers, on account of the suddenness of the
					enemy's attack.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="56">
				<p>He has likewise left Commentaries of his own actions both in the war in
						<placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and in the civil war with
					Pompey; for the author of the Alexandrian, African, and Spanish wars is not
					known with any certainty. Some think they are the productions of Oppius, and
					some of Hirtius; the latter of whom composed the last book, which is imperfect,
					of the Gallic war. Of Caesar's Commentaries, Cicero, in his Brutus, speaks thus:
					" He wrote his Commentaries in a manner deserving of great approbation: they are
					plain, precise, and elegant, without any affectation of rhetorical ornament. In
					having thus prepared materials for others who might be inclined to write his
					history, he may perhaps have encouraged some silly creatures to enter upon such
					a work, who will needs be dressing up his actions in all the extravagance of
					bombast; but he has discouraged wise men from ever attempting the subject."
					Hirtius delivers his opinion of these Commentaries in the following terms: "So
					great is the approbation with which they are universally perused, that, instead
					of rousing, he seems to have precluded, the efforts of any future historian.
					Yet, with respect to this work, we have more reason to admire him than others;
					for they only know how well and correctly he has written, but we know, likewise,
					how easily and quickly he did it."</p>
				<p>Pollio Asinius thinks that they were not drawn up with much care, or with a due
					regard to truth; for he insinuates that Caesar was too hasty of belief in regard
					to what was performed by others under his orders; and that, he has not given a
					very faithful account of his own acts, either by design, or through defect of
					memory; expressing at the same time an opinion that Caesar intended a new and
					more correct edition. He has left behind him likewise two books on Analogy, with
					the same number under the title of Anti-Cato, and a poem entitled The
					.Itinerary. Of these books, he composed the first two in his passage over the
						<placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName>, as he was returning to the
					army after making his circuit in Hither-Gaul; the second work about the time of
					the battle of <placeName key="tgn,2552514">Munda</placeName>; and the last
					during the four-and-twenty days he employed in his journey from <placeName
						key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> to Farther-Spain. There are extant some
					letters of his to the senate, written in a manner never practised by any before
					him; for they are distinguished into pages in the form of a memorandum book:
					whereas the consuls and commanders till then, used constantly in their letters
					to continue the line quite across the sheet, without any folding or distinction
					of pages. There are extant likewise some letters from him to <placeName
						key="tgn,2031372">Cicero</placeName>, and others to his friends, concerning
					his domestic affairs; in which, if there was occasion for secrecy, he wrote in
					cyphers; that is, he used the alphabet in such a manner, that not a single word
					could be made out. The way to decipher those epistles was to substitute the
					fourth for the first letter, as d for a, and so for the other letters
					respectively. Some things likewise pass under his name, said to have been
					written by him when a boy, or a very young man; as the Encomium of <placeName
						key="tgn,2059070">Hercules</placeName>, a tragedy entitled (Edipus, and a
					collection of Apophthegms; all which Augustus forbad to be published, in a short
					and plain letter to Pompeius Macer, who was employed by him in the arrangement
					of his libraries.</p>

					oftener he had been crowned with success, the less he ought to expose himself to
					new hazards; and that nothing he could gain by a victory would compensate for
					what he might lose by a miscarriage. He never defeated the enemy without driving
					them from their camp; and giving them no time.to rally their forces. When the

						<placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> in a ferryboat, he met

					Then indeed he was so strict a disciplinarian, that he would give no notice of a
					march or a battle until the moment of action, in order that the troops might
					hold themselves in readiness for any sudden movement; and he would frequently
					draw them out of the camp without any necessity for it, especially in rainy
					weather, and upon holy-days. Sometimes, giving them orders not to lose sight of

					arrival of king <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName>, he called them
					together, and said, "I have to inform you that in a very few days the king will

					foot, and three hundred elephants. Let none of you, therefore, presume to make

				<p>He neither noticed all their trangressions, nor punished them according to strict

					Sometimes, after a great battle ending in victory, he would grant them a
					relaxation from all kinds of duty, and leave them to revel at pleasure; being
					used to boast, "that his soldiers fought nothing the worse for being well
					oiled." In his speeches, he never addressed them by the title of "Soldiers," but
					by the kinder phrase of "Fellow-soldiers;" and kept them in such splendid order,
					that their arms were ornamented with silver and gold, not merely for parade, but
					to render the soldiers more resolute to save them in battle, and fearful of
					losing them. He loved his troops to such a degree, that when he heard of the
					defeat of those under Titurius, he neither cut his hair nor shaved his beard,
					until he had revenged it upon the enemy; by which means he engaged their devoted
					affection, and raised their valour to the highest pitch.</p>

				<p>Upon his entering on the civil war, the centurions of every legion offered, each
					of them, to maintain a horseman at his own expense, and the whole army agreed to
					serve gratis, without either corn or pay; those amongst them who were rich,
					charging themselves with the maintenance of the poor. No one of them, during the
					whole course of the war, deserted to the enemy; and many of those who were made
					prisoners, though they were offered their lives, upon condition of bearing arms
					against him, refused to accept the terms. They endured want, and other
					hardships, not only when they were besieged themselves, but when they besieged
					others, to such a degree, that Pompey, when blocked up in the neighbourhood of
						<placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, upon seeing a sort of
					bread made of an herb, which they lived upon, said, "I have to do with wild
					beasts," and ordered it immediately to be taken away; because, if his troops
					should see it, their spirit might be broken by perceiving the endurance and
					determined resolution of the enemy. With what bravery they fought, one instance
					affords sufficient proof; which is, that after an unsuccessful engagement at
						<placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, they called for
					punishment; insomuch that their general found it more necessary to comfort than
					to punish them. In other battles, in different quarters, they defeated with ease
					immense armies of the enemy, although they were much inferior to them in number.
					In short, one cohort of the sixth legion held out a fort against four legions
					belonging to Pompey, during several hours; being almost every one of them
					wounded by the vast number of arrows discharged against them, and of which there
					were found within the ramparts a hundred and thirty thousand. This is no way
					surprising, when we consider the conduct of some individuals amongst them; such
					as that of Cassius Scaeva, a centurion, or Caius Acilius, a common soldier, not
					to speak of others. Scaeva, after having an eye struck out, being run through
					the thigh and the shoulder, and having his shield pierced in an hundred and

					them with equal acrimony, yet he afterwards assisted him with his vote and
					interest, when he stood candidate for the consulship. When C. Calvus, after
					publishing some scandalous epigrams upon him, endeavoured to effect a
					reconciliation by the intercession of friends, he wrote to him, of his own
					accord; the first letter. And when Valerius Catullus, who had, as he himself
					observed, fixed such a stain upon his character in his verses upon Mamurra as
					never could be obliterated, he begged his pardon, invited him to supper the same
					day; and continued to take up his lodging with his father occasionally, as he
					had been accustomed to do.</p>

				<p>His temper was also naturally averse to severity in retaliation. After he had

					promised his enemies to poison him, he put to death without torture. When he was

					was prosecuted for profanation of religious ceremonies, he declared he knew

				<p>Both in his administration and his conduct towards the vanquished party in the
					civil war, he showed a wonderful moderation and clemency. For while Pompey
					declared that he would consider those as enemies who did not take arms in
					defence of the republic, he desired it to be understood, that he should regard
					those who remained neuter as his friends. With regard to all those to whom he
					had, on Pompey's recommendation, given any command in the army, he left them at
					perfect liberty to go over to him, if they pleased. When some proposals were

					surrender, which gave rise to a free communication between the two camps, and
					Afranius and Petreius, upon a sudden change of resolu* tion, had put to the
					sword all Caesar's men who were found in the camp, he scorned to imitate the
					base treachery which they had practised against himself. On the field of
					Pharsalia, he called out to the soldiers " to spare their fellow-citizens," and
					afterwards gave permission to every man in his army to save an enemy. None of
					them, so far as appears, lost their lives but in battle, excepting only
					Afranius, Faustus, and young Lucius Caesar; and it is thought that even they
					were put to death without his consent. Afranius and Faustus had borne arms
					against him, after obtaining their pardon; and Lucius Caesar had not only in the
					most cruel manner destroyed with fire and sword his freedmen and slaves, but cut
					to pieces the wild beasts which he had prepared for the entertainment of the
					people. And finally, a little before his death, he permitted all whom he had not
					before pardoned, to return into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>,
					and to bear offices both civil and military. He even replaced the statues of
					Sylla and Pompey, which had been thrown down by the populace. And after this,
					whatever was devised or uttered, he chose rather to check than to punish it.
					Accordingly, having detected certain conspiracies and nocturnal assemblies, he
					went no farther than to intimate by a proclamation that he knew of them; and as
					to those who indulged themselves in the liberty of reflecting severely upon him,
					he only warned them in a public speech not to persist in their offence. He bore
					with great moderation a virulent libel written against him by Aulus Caecinna,
					and the abusive lampoons of Pitholaiis, most highly reflecting on his
					reputation.</p>

				<p>His other words and actions, however, so far outweigh all his good qualities,
					that it is thought he abused his power, and was justly cut off. For he not only
					obtained excessive honours, such as the consulship every year, the dictatorship
					for life, and the censorship, but also the title of emperor, <note
						anchored="true">The title of emperor was not new in Roman history; 1. It was
						sometimes given by the acclamations of the soldiers to those who commanded

						permanent, and was generally written after the proper name, as <foreign
							xml:lang="la">Cicero imperator</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la">Lentulo

						<note anchored="true">Cicero was the first who received the honour of being

					</note> besides having his statue amongst the kings, <note anchored="true"
						>Statues were placed in the Capitol of each of the seven kings of <placeName
							key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to which an eighth was added in
						honour of Brutus, who expelled the last. The statue of Julius Caesar was
						afterwards raised near them. </note> and a lofty couch in the theatre. He
					even suffered some honours to be decreed to him, which were unbefitting the most
					exalted of mankind: such as a gilded chair of state in the senate-house and on
					his tribunal, a consecrated chariot, and banners in the Circensian procession,
					temples, altars, statues among the gods, a bed of state in the temples, a
					priest, and a college of priests dedicated to himself, like those of Pan; and
					that one of the months should be called by his name. There were, indeed, no
					honours which he did not either assume himself, or grant to others, at his will
					and pleasure. In his third and fourth consulship, he used only the title of the
					office, being content with the power of dictator, which was conferred upon him
					with the consulship; and in both years he substituted other consuls in his room,
					during the three last months; so that in the intervals he held no assemblies of
					the people, for the election of magistrates, excepting only tribunes and ediles
					of the people; and appointed officers, under the name of praefects, instead of
					praetors, to administer the affairs of the city during his absence. The office
					of consul having become vacant, by the sudden death of one of the consuls the
					day before the calends of January [the 1st Jan.], he conferred it on a person
					who requested it of him, for a few hours. Assuming the same licence, and
					regardless of the customs of his country, he appointed magistrates to hold their
					offices for terms of years. He granted the insignia of the consular dignity to
					ten persons of praetorian rank. He admitted into the senate some men who had
					made free of the city, and even natives of Gaul, who were semi-barbarians. He
					likewise appointed to the management of the mint, and the public revenue of the
					state, some servants of his own household; and entrusted the command of three
					legions, which he left at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria"
						>Alexandria</placeName>, to an old catamite of his, the son of his freed-man
					Rufinus.</p>
			</div>

				<p>He was guilty of the same extravagance in the language he publicly used, as Titus
					Ampius informs us; according to whom he said, "The republic is nothing but a
					name, without substance or reality. Sylla was an ignorant fellow to abdicate the
					dictatorship. Men ought to consider what is becoming when they talk with me, and
					look upon what I say as a law." To such a pitch of arrogance did he proceed,
					that when a soothsayer announced to him the unfavourable omen, that the entrails
					of a victim offered for sacrifice were without a heart, he said, "The entrails
					will be more favourable when I please; and it ought not to be regarded as a
					prodigy that a beast should be found wanting a heart."</p>

				<p>But what brought upon him the greatest odium, and was thought an unpardonable
					insult, was his receiving the whole body of the conscript fathers sitting,
					before the temple of Venus Genitrix, when they waited upon him with a number of
					decrees, conferring on him the highest dignities. Some say that, on his
					attempting to rise, he was held down by Cornelius Balbus; others, that he did
					not attempt to rise at all, but frowned on Caius Trebatius, who suggested to him
					that he should stand up to receive the senate. This behaviour appeared the more
					intolerable in him, because, when one of the tribunes of the people, Pontius
						<placeName key="tgn,7004067">Aquila</placeName>, would not rise up to him,
					as he passed by the tribunes' seat during his triumph, he was so much offended,
					that he cried out, "Well then, you tribune, Aquila, oust me from the

					person, without this proviso, "if Pontus Aquila will give me leave."</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="79">
				<p>To this extraordinary mark of contempt for the senate, he added another affront
					still more outrageous. For when, after the sacred rites of the Latin festival,
					he was returning home, amidst the immoderate and unusual acclamations of the
					people, a man in the crowd put a laurel crown, encircled with a white
						fillet,<note anchored="true">The white fillet was one of the insignia of
						royalty. Plutarch, on this occasion, uses the expression, <foreign

					</note> on one of his statues; upon which, the tribunes of the people, Epidius
					Marullus, and Caesetius Flavus ordered the fillet to be removed from the crown,
					and the man to be taken to prison. Caesar, being much concerned either that the
					idea of royalty had been suggested to so little purpose, or, as was said, that
					he was thus deprived of the merit of refusing it, reprimanded the tribunes very
					severely, and dismissed them from their office. From that day forward, he was
					never able to wipe off the scandal of affecting the name of king, although he
					replied to the populace when they saluted him by that title, "I am Caesar, and
					no king." And at the feast of the Lupercalia,<note anchored="true">The
						Lupercalia was a festival, celebrated in a place called the Lupercal, in the
						month of February, in honour of Pan. During the solemnity, the Luferci, or
						priests of that god, ran up and down the street naked, with only a girdle of
						goat's skin round their waist, and thongs of the same in their hands; with
						which they struck those they met, particularly married women, who were
						thence supposed to be rendered prolific. </note> when the consul Antony
					placed a crown upon his head in the rostra several times, he as often put it
					away, and sent it to the Capitol for <placeName key="tgn,1125260"
						>Jupiter</placeName>, the Best and the Greatest. A report was very current,
					that he had a design of withdrawing to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria"
						>Alexandria</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>,
					whither he proposed to transfer the imperial power, to drain <placeName
						key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> by new levies, and to leave the
					government of the city to be administered by his friends. To this report 'it was
					added, that in the next meeting of the senate, Lucius Cotta, one of the fifteen,
						<note anchored="true">Persons appointed to inspect and expound the Sibylline
						books. </note> would make a motion, that as there was in the Sibylline books
					a prophecy, that the Parthians would never be subdued but by a king, Caesar
					should have that title conferred upon him.</p>

				<p>For this reason the conspirators precipitated the execution of their design,<note

					their assent to the proposal. Instead, therefore, of caballing any longer
					separately, in small parties, they now united their counsels; the people
					themselves being dissatisfied with the present state of affairs, both privately
					and publicly condemning the tyranny under which they lived, and calling on
					patriots to assert their cause against the usurper. Upon the admission of
					foreigners into the senate, a hand-bill was posted up in these words: "A good
					deed! let no one shew a new senator the way to the house." These verses were
					likewise currently repeated: <quote xml:lang="en"><l>The Gauls he dragged in

					removal of Cesetius and Marullus from their office, they were found to have a
					great many votes at the next election of consuls. Some one wrote under the
					statue of Lucius Brutus "Would you were now alive !" and under the statue of
					Caesar himself these lines: <quote xml:lang="en"><l>Because he drove from

					<quote xml:lang="la"><l>Brutus, quia reges ejecit, consul primus factus est:</l>

						Martius</placeName> when he was taking the votes of the tribes, or some bf

				<p>Casar had warning given him of his fate by indubitable omens. A few months

					sepulchres, in building countryhouses, and were the more eager at the work,

					anecdote as a fabulous or silly invention, it was circulated upon the authority
					of Caius Balbus, an intimate friend of Caesar's. A few days likewise before his
					death, he was informed that the horses, which, upon his crossing the Rubicon, he
					had consecrated, and turned loose to graze without a keeper, abstained entirely
					from eating, and shed floods of tears. The soothsayer Spurinna, observing

					which he intended to propose to the senate; but Decimus Brutus advising him not
					to disappoint the senators, who were numerously assembled, and waited his
					coming, he was prevailed upon to go, and accordingly set forward about the fifth
					hour. In his way, some person having thrust into his hand a paper, warning him
					against the plot, he mixed it with some other documents which he held in his

				<head>Remarks on Julius Caesar</head>
				<p>The termination of the civil war between Caesar and Pompey forms a new epoch in
					the Roman History, at which a Republic, which had subsisted with unrivalled
					glory during a period of about four hundred and sixty years, relapsed into a
					state of despotism, whence it never more could emerge. So sudden a transition
					from prosperity to the ruin of public freedom, without the intervention of any
					foreign enemy, excites a reasonable conjecture, that the constitution in which
					it could take place, however vigorous in appearance, must have lost that
					soundness of political health which had enabled it to endure through so many
					ages. A short view of its preceding state, and of that in which it was at the
					time of the revolution now mentioned, will best ascertain the foundation of such
					a conjecture.</p>
				<p>Though the Romans, upon the expulsion of Tarquin, made an essential change in the
					political form of the state, they did not carry their detestation of regal
					authority so far as to abolish the religious institutions of Numa Pompilius, the
					second of their kings, according to which, the priesthood, with all the
					influence annexed to that order, was placed in the hands of the aristocracy. By
					this wise policy a restraint was put upon the fickleness and violence of the
					people in matters of government, and a decided superiority given to the Senate
					both in the deliberative and executive parts of administration. This advantage
					was afterwards indeed diminished by the creation of Tribunes of the people; a
					set of men whose ambition often embroiled the Republic in civil dissensions, and
					who at last abused their authority to such a degree, that they became
					instruments of aggrandizement to any leading men in the state who could purchase
					their friendship. In general, however, the majority of the Tribunes being
					actuated by views which comprehended the interests of the multitude, rather than
					those of individuals, they did not so much endanger the liberty, as they
					interrupted the tranquillity, of the public; and when the occasional commotions
					subsided, there remained no permanent ground for the establishment of personal
					usurpation.</p>
				<p>In every government, an object of the last importance to the peace and welfare of
					society is the morals of the people; and in proportion as a community is
					enlarged by propagation, or the accession of a multitude of new members, a more
					strict attention is requisite to guard against that dissolution of manners to
					which a crowded and extensive capital has a natural tendency. Of this the Romans
					became sensible in the growing state of the Republic. In the year of the City
					312, two magistrates were first created for taking an account of the number of
					the people, and the value of their estates; and soon after, they were invested
					with the authority not only of inspecting the morals of individuals, but of
					inflicting public censure for any licentiousness of conduct, or violation of
					decency. Thus both the civil and religious institutions concurred to restrain
					the people within the bounds of good order and obedience to the laws; at the
					same time that the frugal life of the ancient Romans proved a strong security
					against those vices which operate most effectually towards sapping the
					foundations of a state.</p>
				<p>But in the time of Julius Casar the barriers of public liberty were become too
					weak to restrain the audacious efforts of ambitious and desperate men. The
					veneration for the constitution, usually a powerful check to treasonable
					designs, had been lately violated by the usurpations of Marius and Sylla. The
					salutary terrors of religion no longer predominated over the consciences of men.
					The shame of public censure was extinguished in general depravity. An eminent
					historian, who lived at that time, informs us, that venality universally
					prevailed amongst the Romans; and a writer who flourished soon after, observes,
					that luxury and dissipation had encumbered almost all so much with debt, that
					they beheld with a degree of complacency the prospect of civil war and
					confusion.</p>
				<p>The extreme degree of profligacy at which the Romans were now arrived is in
					nothing more evident, than that this age gave birth to the most horrible
					conspiracy which occurs in the annals of human kind, viz. that of Catiline. This
					was not the project of a few desperate and abandoned individuals, but of a
					number of men of the most illustrious rank in the state; and it appears beyond
					doubt, that Julius Caesar was accessory to the design, which was no less than to
					extirpate the Senate, divide amongst themselves both the public and private
					treasures, and set <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> on fire. The
					causes which prompted to this tremendous project,'it is generally admitted, were
					luxury, prodigality, irreligion, a total corruption of manners, and above all,
					as the immediate cause, the pressing necessity in which the conspirators were
					involved by their extreme dissipation.</p>
				<p>The enormous debt in which Caesar himself was early involved, countenances an
					opinion that his anxiety to procure the province of <placeName key="tgn,1000070"
						>Gaul</placeName> proceeded chiefly from this cause. But during nine years
					in which he held that province, he acquired such riches as must have rendered
					him, without competition, the most opulent person in the state. If nothing more,
					therefore, than a splendid establishment had been the object of his pursuit, he
					had attained to the summit of his wishes. But when we find him persevering in a
					plan of aggrandizement beyond this period of his fortunes, we can ascribe his
					conduct to no other motive than that of outrageous ambition. He projected the
					building of a new Forum at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, for
					the ground only of which he was to pay $4,ooo000,000; he raised legions in
						<placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> at his own charges; he
					promised such entertamments to the people as had never been known at <placeName
						key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> from the foundation of the city. All
					these circumstances evince some latent design of procuring such a popularity as
					might give him an uncontrolled influence in the management of public affairs.
					Pompey, we are told, was wont to to say, that Caesar not being able, with all
					his riches, to fulfil the promises which he had made, wished to throw everything
					into confusion. There may have been some foundation for this remark: but the
					opinion of Cicero is more probable, that Caesar's mind was seduced with the
					temptations of chimerical glory. It is observable that neither Cicero nor Pompey
					intimates any suspicion that Caesar was apprehensive of being impeached for his
					conduct, had he returned to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in a
					private station. Yet, that there was reason for such an apprehension, the
					positive declaration of L. Domitius leaves little room to doubt: especially when
					we consider the number of enemies that Caesar had in the Senate, and the
					coolness of his former friend Pompey ever after the death of Julia. The proposed
					impeachment was founded upon a notorious charge of prosecuting measures
					destructive of the interests of the commonwealth, and tending ultimately to an
					object incompatible with public freedom. Indeed, considering the extreme
					corruption which prevailed amongst the Romans at this time, it is more than
					probable that Caesar would have been acquitted of the charge, but at such an
					expense as must have stripped him of all his riches, and placed him again in a
					situation ready to attempt a disturbance of the public tranquillity. For it is
					said, that he purchased the friendship of Curio, at the commencement of the
					civil war, with a bribe little short of half a million sterling.</p>
				<p>Whatever Caesar's private motive may have been for taking arms against his
					country, he embarked in an enterprise of a nature the most dangerous: and had
					Pompey conducted himself in any degree suitable to the reputation which he had
					formerly acquired, the contest would in all probability have terminated in
					favour of public freedom. But by dilatory measures in the beginning, by
					imprudently withdrawing his army from <placeName key="tgn,1000080"
						>Italy</placeName> into a distant province, and by not pursuing the
					advantage he had gained by the vigorous repulse of Caesar's troops in their
					attack upon his camp, this commander lost every opportunity of extinguishing a
					war which was to determine the fate, and even the existence, of the Republic. It
					was accordingly determined on the plains of Pharsalia, where Caesar obtained a
					victory which was not more decisive than unexpected. He was now no longer
					amenable either to the tribunal of the Senate or the power of the laws, but
					triumphed at once over his enemies and the constitution of his country.</p>
				<p>It is to the honour of Caesar, that when he had obtained the supreme power, he
					exercised it with a degree of moderation beyond what was generally expected by
					those who had fought on the side of the Republic. Of his private life either
					before or after this period, little is transmitted in history. Henceforth,
					however, he seems to have lived chiefly at <placeName key="perseus,Rome"
						>Rome</placeName>, near which he had a small villa, upon an eminence,
					commanding a beautiful prospect. His time was almost entirely occupied with
					public affairs, in the management of which, though he employed many agents, he
					appears to have had none in the character of actual minister. He was in general
					easy of access: but Cicero, in a letter to a friend, complains of having been
					treated with the indignity of waiting a considerable time amongst a crowd in an
					anti-chamber, before he could have an audience. The elevation of Caesar placed
					him not above discharging reciprocally the social duties in the intercourse of
					life. He returned the visits of those who waited upon him, and would sup at
					their houses. At table, and in the use of wine, he was habitually temperate.
					Upon the whole, he added nothing to his own happiness by all the dangers, the
					fatigues, and the perpetual anxiety which he had incurred in the pursuit of
					unlimited power. His health was greatly impaired: his former cheerfulness of
					temper, though not his magnanimity, appears to have forsaken him; and we behold
					in his fate a memorable example of illustrious talents rendered, by inordinate
					ambition, destructive to himself, and irretrievably pernicious to his country.
