<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>
<p>CHREMES and Phania were brothers, citizens of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. Chremes going to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, leaves his daughter, Pasibula, in the care of his brother Phania, who, afterward setting sail with Pasibula for <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, is wrecked off the Isle of <placeName key="perseus,Andros City">Andros</placeName>. Escaping with their lives, they are kindly received by a native of the island; and Phania soon afterward dies there. The Andrian changes the name of the girl to Glycerium, and brings her up, as his own child, with his daughter Chrysis. On his death, Chrysis and Glycerium sail for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to seek their fortune there. Chrysis being admired by several Athenian youths, Pamphilus, the son of Simo, an opulent citizen, chances to see Glycerium, and falls violently in love with her. She afterward becomes pregnant by him, on which he makes her a promise of marriage. In the mean time, Chremes, who is now living at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and is ignorant of the fate of Pasibula, agrees with Simo, the father of Pamphilus, to give Philumena, another daughter, in marriage to Pamphilus. While these arrangements are being made, Chrysis dies; on which Simo accidentally discovers his son's connection with Glycerium. Chremes, also coming to hear of it, declines the match, having no idea that Glycerium is really his own daughter. Simo, however, in order to test his son's feelings, resolves to pretend that the marriage-day is fixed. Meeting Pamphilus in the town, he desires him to go home and prepare for the wedding, which is to take place immediately. In his perplexity, the youth has recourse to his servant Davus, who, having heard of the refusal of Chremes, suspects the design of Simo. At this conjuncture, Charinus, a friend of Pamphilus, who is enamored of Philumena, but has been rejected by her father, entreats Pamphilus to put off the marriage, for at least a few days. Disclosing his own aversion to the match, Pamphilus readily engages to do this. In order the more effectually to break it off, Davus advises Pamphilus to pretend a readiness to comply with his father's wishes, supposing that of course Chremes will steadily persist in his refusal. Pamphilus does as he is advised, on which Simo again applies to Chremes, who, after some entreaty, gives his consent. Just at this conjuncture, Glycerium is delivered of a son; and by the advice of Davus, it is laid before the door of Simo's house. Chremes happening to see it there, and ascertaining that Pamphilus is its father, again refuses to give him his daughter. At this moment, Crito, a native of <placeName key="perseus,Andros">Andros</placeName>, arrives, who, being a relative of Chrysis, has come to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to look after her property. Through him, Chremes discovers that Glycerium is no other than his long-lost daughter, Pasibula; on which he consents to her immediate marriage with Pamphilus, who promises Charinus that he will use his best endeavors to obtain for him the hand of Philumena.

It is not agreed what are the meanings of the respective terms, but in the present Translation the following theory has been adopted: The words "<foreign lang="la">dextrae</foreign>" and "<foreign lang="la">sinistrae</foreign>" denote the kind of flute, the former being treble, the latter bass flutes, or, as they were sometimes called, "<foreign lang="la">incentiveae</foreign>" or "<foreign lang="la">succentivae</foreign>;" though it has been thought by some that they were so called because the former were held with the right hand, the latter with the left.

<head>THE SUMMARY OF C. SULPITIUS APOLLINARIS.</head>
<p>PAMPHILUS seduces Glycerium, wrongfully supposed to be a sister of a Courtesan, an Andrian by birth; and she having become pregnant, he gives his word that she shall be his wife; but his father has engaged for him another, the daughter of Chremes; and when he discovers the intrigue he pretends that the nuptials are about to take place, desiring to learn what intentions his son may have. By the advice of Davus, Pamphilus does not resist; but Chremes, as soon as he has seen the little child born of Glycerium, breaks off the match, and declines him for a son-in-law. Afterward, this Glycerium, un-expectedly discovered to be his own daughter, he bestows as a wife on Pamphilus, the other on Charinus.

<sp><speaker>THE PROLOGUE.</speaker><p>THE POET, when first he applied his mind to writing, thought that the only duty which devolved on him was, that the Plays he should compose might please the public. But he perceives that it has fallen out entirely otherwise; for he is wasting his labor in writing Prologues, not for the purpose of relating the plot, but to answer the slanders of a malevolent old Poet.<milestone n="7" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A malevolent old Poet</lemma>: He alludes to Luscus Lanuvinus, or Lavinius, a Comic Poet of his time, but considerably his senior. He is mentioned by Terence in all his Prologues except that to the Hecyra, and seems to have made it the business of his life to run down his productions and discover faults in them.</note> Now I beseech you, give your attention to the thing which they impute as a fault. Menander composed the Andrian<milestone n="9" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Composed the Andrian</lemma>: This Play, like that of our author, took its name from the Isle of <placeName key="perseus,Andros City">Andros</placeName>, one of the <placeName key="tgn,7011270">Cyclades</placeName> in the <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean Sea</placeName>, where Glycerium is supposed to have been born. Donatus, the Commentator on Terence, informs us that the first Scene of this Play is almost a literal translation from the Perinthian of Menander, in which the old man was represented as discoursing with his wife just as Simo does here with Sosia. In the Andrian of Menander, the old man opened with a soliloquy.</note> and the Perinthian.<milestone n="9" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">And the Perinthian</lemma>: This Play was so called from Perinthus, a town of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, its heroine being a native of that place.</note> He who knows either of them well, will know them both; they are in plot not very different, and yet they have been composed in different language and style. What suited, he confesses he has transferred into the Andrian from the Perinthian, and has employed them as his own. These parties censure this proceeding; and on this point they differ from him, that Plays ought not to be mixed up together. By being thus knowing, do they not show that they know nothing at all? For while they are censuring him, they are censuring Naevius, Plautus, and Ennius,<milestone n="18" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Noevius, Plautus, and Ennius</lemma>: Ennius was the oldest of these three Poets. Naevius a contemporary of Plautus. See a probable allusion to his misfortunes in the Miles Gloriosus of Plautus, l. 211.</note> whom our Poet has for his precedents; whose carelessness he prefers to emulate, rather than the mystifying carefulness<milestone n="21" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The mystifying carefulness</lemma>: By "<foreign lang="la">obscuram diligentiam</foreign>" he means that formal degree of precision which is productive of obscurity.</note> of those parties. Therefore, I advise them to be quiet in future, and to cease to slander; that they may not be made acquainted with their own misdeeds. Be well disposed, then; attend with unbiased mind, and consider the matter, that you may determine what hope is left; whether the Plays which he shall in future compose anew, are to be witnessed, or are rather to be driven off the stage.

<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> I await your will.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> I am not changed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> If I have done or am doing aught that is pleasing to you, Simo, I am glad that it has been done; and that the same has been gratifying to you, I consider sufficient thanks.

But tell me, in one word, what it is that you want with me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> I'll do so. In the first place, in this affair I give you notice: this, which you suppose to be such, is not a real marriage.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Why do you pretend it then ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> You shall hear all the matter from the beginning; by that means you'll be acquainted with both my son's mode of life and my own design, and what I want you to do in this affair. For after he had passed youthfulness,<milestone n="51" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">After he had passed from youthfulness</lemma>: "Ephebus" was the name given to a youth when between the ages of sixteen and twenty.</note> Sosia, and had obtained free scope of living, (for before, how could you know or understand his disposition, while youthful age, fear, and a master<milestone n="54" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">And a master</lemma>: See the Notes to the Translation of the Bacchides of Plautus, l. 109, where Lydus, a slave, appears as the <foreign lang="la">"paedagogus,"</foreign> or <quote lang="la">"magister,"</quote> of Pistoclerus.</note> were checking him ?)----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> That's true.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> What all young men, for the most part, do,--devote their attention to some particular pursuit, either to training horses or dogs for hunting, or to the philosophers;<milestone n="57" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Or to the philosophers</lemma>: It was the custom in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> with all young men of free birth to apply themselves to the study of philosophy, of course with zeal proportioned to the love of learning in each.

There is something sarcastic here, and indeed not very respectful to the "philosophers," in coupling them as objects of attraction with horses and hounds.</note> in not one of these did he engage in particular beyond the rest, and yet in all of them in a moderate degree. I was pleased.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Not without reason; for this I deem in life to be especially advantageous; that one do nothing to excess.<milestone n="61" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Nothing to excess</lemma>: <quote lang="la">"Ne quid nimis."</quote> This was one of the three sentences which were inscribed in golden letters in the Temple of Apollo at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>.

He is unfortunately only a Protatic or introductory character, as we lose sight of him after this Act.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Such was his mode of life; readily to bear and to comply with all; with whomsoever he was in company, to them to resign himself; to devote himself to their pursuits; at variance with no one; never preferring himself to them. Thus most readily you may acquire praise without envy, and gain friends.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> He has wisely laid down his rule of life; for in these days obsequiousness begets friends; sincerity, dislike.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Meanwhile, three years ago,<milestone n="69" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Meanwhile, three years ago</lemma>: The following remark of Donatus on this passage is quoted by Colman for its curiosity. " The Author has artfully said three years, when he might have given a longer or a shorter period; since it is probable that the woman might have lived modestly one year; set up the trade the next; and died the third. In the first year, therefore, Pamphilus knew nothing of the family of Chrysis; in the second, he became acquainted with Glycerium; and in the third, Glycerium marries Pamphilus, and finds her parents."</note> a certain woman from <placeName key="perseus,Andros City">Andros</placeName> removed hither into this neighborhood, driven by poverty and the neglect of her relations, of surpassing beauty and in the bloom of youth.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Ah! I'm afraid that this Andrian will bring some mischief.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> At first, in a modest way, she passed her life with thriftiness and in hardship, seeking a livelihood with her wool and loom. But after an admirer made advances, promising her a recompense, first one and then another; as the disposition of all mankind has a downward tendency from industry toward pleasure, she accepted their proposals, and then began to trade upon her beauty. Those who then were her admirers, by chance, as it often happens, took my son thither that he might be in their company. Forthwith I said to myself, " He is surely caught; he is smitten."<milestone n="78" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">He is smitten</lemma>: <quote lang="la">"Habet,"</quote> literally "He has it." This was the expression used by the spectators at the moment when a Gladiator was wounded by his antagonist. In the previous line, in the words <quote lang="la">"captus est,"</quote> a figurative allusion is made to the <foreign lang="la">"retiarius,"</foreign> a Gladiator who was provided with a net, with which he endeavored to entangle his opponent.</note> In the morning I used to observe their servant-boys coming or going away; I used to make inquiry, "Here, my lad, tell me, will you, who had Chrysis yesterday?" for that was the name of the Andrian <stage>touching SOSIA on the arm</stage>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> I understand.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Phaedrus, or Clinias, or Niceratus, they used to say; for these three then loved her at the same time. "Well now, what did Pamphilus do?" "What ?

Just so on another day I made inquiry, but I discovered nothing whatever that affected Pamphilus. In fact, I thought him sufficiently proved, and a great pattern of continence; for he who is brought into contact with dispositions of that sort, and his feelings are not aroused even under such circumstances, you may be sure that he is already capable of undertaking the governance of his own life. This pleased me, and every body with one voice began to say all kinds of flattering things, and to extol my good fortune, in having a son endowed with such a disposition. What need is there of talking? Chremes, influenced by this report, came to me of his own accord, to offer his only daughter as a wife to my son, with a very large portion. It pleased me; I betrothed him; this was the day appointed for the nuptials.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> What then stands in the way? Why should they not take place ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> You shall hear. In about a few days after these things had been agreed on, Chrysis, this neighbor, dies.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Bravo! You've made me happy. I was afraid for him on account of Chrysis.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Then my son was often there, with those who had admired Chrysis; with them he took charge of the funeral; sorrowful, in the mean time, he sometimes wept with them in condolence. Then that pleased me. Thus I reflected: "He by reason of this slight intimacy takes her death so much to heart; what if he himself had wooed her? What will he do for me his father?" All these things I took to be the duties of a humane disposition and of tender feelings. Why do I detain you with many words? Even I myself,<milestone n="116" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Even I myself</lemma>: Cooke remarks here: " A complaisant father, to go to the funeral of a courtesan, merely to oblige his son !"</note> for his sake, went forth to the funeral, as yet suspecting no harm.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Ha! what is this?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> You shall know. She is brought out; we proceed. In the mean time, among the females who were there present, I saw by chance one young woman of beauteous form.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Very likely.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> And of countenance, Sosia, so modest, so charming, that nothing could surpass. As she appeared to me to lament beyond the rest, and as she was of a figure handsome and genteel beyond the other women, I approached the female attendants ;<milestone n="123" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The female attendants</lemma>: "Pedissequae." These <quote lang="la">"pedissequae,"</quote> or female attendants, are frequently alluded to in the Plays of Plautus. See the Notes to Bohn's Translation.</note> I inquired who she was. They said that she was the sister of Chrysis. It instantly struck my mind: "Ay, ay, this is it; hence those tears, hence that sympathy."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> How I dread what you are coming to !</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> The funeral procession meanwhile advances; we follow; we come to the burying-place.<milestone n="128" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To the burying-place</lemma>: <quote lang="la">"Sepulcrum"</quote> strictly means, the tomb or place for burial, but here the funeral pile itself. When the bones were afterward buried on the spot where they were burned, it was called <foreign lang="la">"bustum."</foreign></note> She is placed upon the pile; they weep. In the mean time, this sister, whom I mentioned, approached the flames too incautiously, with considerable danger. There, at that moment, Pamphilus, in his extreme alarm, discovers his well-dissembled and long-hidden passion; he runs up, clasps the damsel by the waist. "My Glycerium," says he, "what are you doing? Why are you going to destroy yourself?" Then she, so that you might easily recognize their habitual attachment, weeping, threw herself back upon him--how affectionately !</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> What do you say?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> I returned thence in anger, and hurt at heart: and yet there was not sufficient ground for reproving him. He might say; " What have I done? How have I deserved this, or offended, father ? She who wished to throw herself into the flames, I prevented; I saved her." The defense is a reasonable one.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> You judge aright; for if you censure him who has assisted to preserve life, what are you to do to him who causes loss or misfortune to it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Chremes comes to me next day, exclaiming: "Disgraceful conduct!"--that he had ascertained that Pamphilus was keeping this foreign woman as a wife. I steadfastly denied that to be the fact. He insisted that it was the fact. In short, I then left him refusing to bestow his daughter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> Did not you then reprove your son?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Not even this was a cause sufficiently strong for censuring him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> How so? Tell me.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> " You yourself, father," he might say, "have prescribed a limit to these proceedings. The time is near, when I must live according to the humor of another; meanwhile, for the present allow me to live according to my own."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> What room for reproving him, then, is there left?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> If on account of his amour he shall decline to take a wife, that, in the first place, is an offense on his part to be censured. And now for this am I using my endeavors, that, by means of the pretended marriage, there may be real ground for rebuking him, if lie should refuse; at the same time, that if that rascal Davus has any scheme, he may exhaust it now, while his knaveries can do no harm: who, I do believe, with hands, feet, and all his might, will do every thing; and more for this, no doubt, that he may do me an ill turn, than to oblige my son.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> For what reason ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Do you ask? Bad heart, bad disposition. Whom, however, if I do detect ---- But what need is there of talking? If it should turn out, as I wish, that there is no delay on the part of Pamphilus, Chremes remains to be prevailed upon by me; and I do hope that all will go well. Now it's your duty to pretend these nuptials cleverly, to terrify Davus; and watch my son, what he's about, what schemes he is planning with him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SOSIA</speaker><p> 'Tis enough; I'll take care; now let's go in-doors.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> <stage>to himself.</stage> Assuredly, Davus, there's no room for slothfulness or inactivity, so far as I've just now ascertained the old man's mind about the marriage; which if it is not provided against by cunning, will be bringing either myself or my master to ruin. What to do, I am not determined; whether I should assist Pamphilus or obey the old man. If I desert the former, I fear for his life; if I assist him, I dread the other's threats, on whom it will be a difficult matter to impose. In the first place, he has now found out about this amour; with hostile feelings he watches me, lest I should be devising some trickery against the marriage. If he discovers it, I'm undone; or even if he chooses to allege any pretext, whether rightfully or wrongfully, he will consign me headlong to the mill. To these evils this one is besides added for me. This Andrian, whether she is his wife, or whether his mistress, is pregnant by Pamphilus.

Oh, faith of Gods and men! shall I by no device be able to escape this alliance with Chremes? In how many ways am I contemned, and held in scorn? Every thing done, and concluded!

I was amazed; think you that I was able to utter a single word, or any excuse, even a frivolous, false, or lame one? I was speechless. But if any one were to ask me now what I would have done, if I had known this sooner, why, I would have done any thing rather than do this. But now, what course shall I first adopt? So many cares beset me, which rend my mind to pieces; love, sympathy for her, the worry of this marriage; then, respect for my father, who has ever, until now, with such an indulgent disposition, allowed me to do whatever was agreeable to my feelings. Ought I to oppose him ? Ah me! I am in uncertainty what to do.</p></sp>

Colman thus takes him to task for this observation: "This two-edged reflection, glancing at once on Terence and the ladies, is, I think, very ill-founded. The delay of Mysis, on seeing the emotion of Pamphilus, is very natural; and her artful endeavors to interest Pamphilus on behalf of her mistress, are rather marks of her attention than neglect."</note></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Pamphilus, if you do that, you behold me this day for the last time.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Why so</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Ah me! I dread to tell it; prithee, do you tell it, Byrrhia.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BYRRHIA</speaker><p> I'll tell it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> What is it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BYRRHIA</speaker><p> He's in love with your betrothed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Assuredly he's not of my way of thinking. Come now, tell me, have you had any more to do with her, Charinus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Oh Pamphilus, nothing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> How much I wish you had.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Now, by our friendship and by my affection, I do beseech you, in the first place, not to marry her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> For my own part I'll use my endeavors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> But if that can not be, or if this marriage is agreeable to you----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Agreeable to me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Put it off for some days at least, while I go elsewhere, that I may not be witness.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Now listen, once for all: I think it, Charinus, to be by no means the part of an ingenuous man, when he confers nothing, to expect that it should be considered as an obligation on his part. I am more desirous to avoid this match, than you to gain it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> You have restored me to life.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Now, if you can do any thing, either you yourself, or Byrrhia here, manage, fabricate, invent, contrive some means, whereby she may be given to you; this I shall aim at, how she may not be given to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> I am satisfied.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> How do you know ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> You shall know. Your father just now laid hold of me; he said that a wife was to be given you to-day, and many other things as well, which just now I haven't time to relate. Hastening to you immediately, I ran on to the Forum that I might tell you these things. When I didn't find you, I ascended there to a high place.<milestone n="356" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To a high place</lemma>: He probably alludes to some part of the Acropolis, the citadel, or higher part of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, which commanded a view of the lower town.</note> I looked around; you were nowhere. There by chance I saw Byrrhia, his servant <stage>pointing to CHARINUS</stage>. I inquired of him; he said he hadn't seen you. This puzzled me. I considered what I was to do. As I was returning in the mean time, a surmise from the circumstances themselves occurred to me: " How now,--a very small amount of good cheer; lie out of spirits; a marriage all of a sudden; these things don't agree."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> But to what purpose this ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> I forthwith betook myself to the house of Chremes. When I arrived there--stillness before the door;<milestone n="362" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Stillness before the door</lemma>: Madame Dacier observes that this remark is very appropriately made by Davus, as showing that the marriage was clearly not intended by Chremes.

<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> You say well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Proceed.</p></sp>

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> I understand; a considerable indication.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Do these things seem to accord with a wedding ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> I think not, Davus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Think, do you say ? You don't view it rightly; the thing is certain.

<stage>PAMPHILUS and DAVUS.</stage>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> What then does my father mean? Why does he thus make pretense?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> I'll tell you. If now he were angry with you, because Chremes will not give you a wife, he would seem to himself to be unjust, and that not without reason, before he has ascertained your feelings as to the marriage, how they are disposed. But if you refuse to marry her, in that case he will transfer the blame to you; then such disturbances will arise.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> I will submit to any thing from him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> He is your father, Pamphilus. It is a difficult matter. Besides, this woman is defenseless. No sooner said than done; he will find some pretext for driving her away from the city.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Driving her away ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Aye, and quickly too.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Tell me then, Davus, what am I to do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Say that you will marry her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> <stage>starting.</stage> Ha!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> What's the matter ?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> What, am I to say so?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Why not?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Never will I do it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Don't say so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Don't attempt to persuade me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Consider what will be the result of it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> That I shall be deprived of the one, and fixed with the other.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Not so. In fact, I think it will be thus: Your father will say: "I wish you to marry a wife to-day." You reply: " I'll marry her." Tell me, how can he raise a quarrel with you ? Thus you will cause all the plans which are now arranged by him to be disarranged, without any danger; for this is not to be doubted, that Chremes will not give you his daughter. Therefore do not hesitate in those measures which you are taking, on this account, lest he should change his sentiments. Tell your father that you consent; so that although he may desire it, he may not be able to be angry at you with reason. For that which you rely on, I will easily refute; "No one," you think, "will give a wife to a person of these habits." But he will find a beggar for you, rather than allow you to be corrupted by a mistress. If, however, he shall believe that you bear it with a contented mind, you will render him indifferent; at his leisure he will look out for another wife for you; in the mean time something lucky may turn up.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Do you think so?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> It really is not a matter of doubt.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Consider to what you are persuading me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Nay, but do be quiet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Well, I'll say it; but, that he mayn't come to know that she has had a child by me, is a thing to be guarded against; for I have promised to bring it up.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Oh, piece of effrontery.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> She entreated me that I would give her this pledge, by which she might be sure she should not be deserted.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> It shall be attended to; but your father's coming. Take care that he doesn't perceive that you are out of spirits.</p></sp></div1>

On these words Colman rakes the following just observations: " Other Commentators have also stumbled at this passage; but if in the words 'followed him hither,' we suppose 'him' (hunc) to refer to Simo, the difficulty is removed; and that the pronoun really does signify Simo, is evident from the circumstance of Pamphilus never having left the stage since the disappearance of Byrrhia. Simo is also represented as coming on the stage homeward, so that Byrrhia might easily have followed him along the street; and it is evident that Byrrhia does not allude to Pamphilus from the agreeable surprise which he expresses on seeing him there so opportunely for the purpose."</note> <stage>pointing to SIMO</stage> as he came hither.

That is a true proverb which is wont to be commonly quoted, that "all had rather it to be well for themselves than for another."

Colman has the following remarks: "Donatus observes on this Scene between Byrrhia, Simo, Pamphilus, and Davus, that the dialogue is sustained by four persons, who have little or no intercourse with each other; so that the Scene is not only in direct contradiction to the precept of <persName>Horace</persName>, excluding a fourth person, but is also otherwise vicious in its construction. Scenes of this kind are, I think, much too frequent in Terence, though, indeed, the form of the ancient Theatre was more adapted to the representation of them than the modern. The multiplicity of speeches aside is also the chief error in this dialogue; such speeches, though very common in dramatic writers, ancient and modern, being always more or less unnatural."</note> <stage>(Exit.)</stage>

Of this, then, I now warn you, master, that it will happen,

that you may be aware of it. Don't you hereafter be saying that this was done through the advice or artifices of Davus. I wish this suspicion of yours to be entirely removed from myself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> How do you know that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> I've heard so, and I believe it: many things combine for me to form this conjecture. In the first place then, she declared that she was pregnant by Pamphilus; that has been proved to be false.

<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> What do you say to this? When you perceived that they were adopting this plan, why didn't you tell Pamphilus immediately?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> Why, who has induced him to leave her, but myself? For, indeed, we all know how desperately he loved her. Now he wishes for a wife. In fine, do you intrust me with that affair; proceed however, as before, to celebrate these nuptials, just as you are doing, and I trust that the Gods will prosper this matter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Very well; be off in-doors; wait for me there, and get ready what's necessary to be prepared. <stage>DAVUS goes into the house.</stage> He hasn't prevailed upon me even now altogether to believe these things, and I don't know whether what he has said is all true; but I deem it of little moment; this is of far greater importance to me--that my son himself has promised me. Now I'll go and find Chremes; I'll ask him for a wife for my son; if I obtain my request, at what other time rather than to-day should I prefer these nuptials taking place? For as my son has promised, I have no doubt but that if he should prove unwilling, I can fairly compel him. And look! here's Chremes himself, just at the very time.

<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> And I for you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> You meet me at a welcome moment. Some persons have been to me, to say that they had heard from you, that my daughter was to be married to your son to-day; I've come to see whether they are out of their senses or you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Listen; in a few words you shall learn both what I want of you, and what you seek to know.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> I am listening; say what you wish.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> By the Gods, I do entreat you, Chremes, and by our friendship, which, commencing with our infancy, has grown up with our years, and by your only daughter and by my own son (of preserving whom the entire power lies with you), that you will assist me in this matter; and that, just as this marriage was about to be celebrated, it may be celebrated.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> O, don't importune me; as though you needed to obtain this of me by entreaty. Do you suppose I am different now from what I was formerly, when I promised her? If it is for the advantage of them both that it should take place, order her to be sent for. But if from this course there would result more harm than advantage for each, this I do beg of you, that you will consult for their common good, as though she were your own daughter, and I the father of Pamphilus.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> It really is so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> After this fashion, i'faith, I tell you, "the quarrels of lovers are the renewal of love."
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Well--this I beg of you, that we may prevent it. While an opportunity offers, and while his passion is cooled by affronts, before the wiles of these women and their tears, craftily feigned, bring back his love-sick mind to compassion, let us give him a wife. I trust, Chremes, that, when attached by intimacy and a respectable marriage, he will easily extricate himself from these evils.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> How then can you be sure of that, unless you make the experiment?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> But for that experiment to be made upon a daughter is a serious thing----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Why look, all the inconvenience in fine amounts to this--possibly, which may the Gods forfend, a separation may take place.

<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> What is one to say to all this? If you feel persuaded that this is beneficial, I don't wish that any advantage should be denied you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> I am aware; you have been influenced by your own inclination.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Hold; you do not yet know all.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> For my part, I certainly do know that you are about to marry her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Why are you torturing me to death? Listen to this. He <stage>pointing to DAVUS</stage> never ceased to urge me to tell my father that I would marry her; to advise and persuade me, even until he compelled me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Who was this person?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Davus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Davus! For what reason?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> I don't know; except that I must have been  under the displeasure of the Gods, for me to have listened to him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Is this the fact, Davus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> It is the fact.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> <stage>starting.</stage> Ha! What do you say, you villain? Then may the Gods send you an end worthy of your deeds. Come now, tell me, if all his enemies had wished him to be plunged into a marriage, what advice but this could they have given?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> I have been deceived, but I don't despair.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> <stage>ironically.</stage> I'm sure of that.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> This way it has not succeeded; we'll try another. Unless, perhaps, you think that because it failed at first, this misfortune can not now possibly be changed for better luck.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Certainly not; for I quite believe that if you set about it, you will be making two marriages for me out of one.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> I owe you this, Pamphilus, in respect of my servitude, to strive with hands and feet, night and day; to submit to hazard of my life, to serve you. It is your part, if any thing has fallen out contrary to expectation, to forgive

me. What I was contriving has not succeeded; still, I am using all endeavors; or, do you yourself devise something better, and dismiss me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> I wish to; restore me to the position in which you found me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAVUS</speaker><p> I'll do so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> But it must be done directly.</p></sp>

Patrick, however, observes with some justice, that the word <quote lang="la">"concrepuit"</quote> may here allude to the creaking of the hinges.

<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> Enough already, enough, Simo, has my friendship toward you been proved. Sufficient hazard have I begun to encounter; make an end of your entreaties, then. While I've been endeavoring to oblige you, I've almost fooled away my daughter's prospects in life.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Nay but, now in especial, Chremes, I do beg and entreat of you, that the favor, commenced a short time since in words, you'll now complete by deeds.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> See how unreasonable you are from your very earnestness; so long as you effect what you desire, you neither think of limits to compliance, nor what it is you request of me; for if you did think, you would now forbear to trouble me with unreasonable requests.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> What unreasonable requests?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHREMES</speaker><p> Do you ask? You importuned me to promise my daughter to a young man engaged in another attachment, averse to the marriage state, to plunge her into discord and a marriage of uncertain duration; that through her sorrow and her anguish I might reclaim your son. You prevailed; while the case admitted of it I made preparations. Now it does not admit of it; you must put up with it; they say that she is a citizen of this place; a child has been born; do cease to trouble us.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> By the Gods, I do conjure you not to bring your mind to believe those whose especial interest it is that he should be as degraded as possible. On account of the marriage, have all these things been feigned and contrived. When the reason for which they do these things is removed from them, they will desist.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> What, pray?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> He is bound.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Father, he is not rightly bound.
<milestone n="956" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">He is not rightly bound</lemma>: <quote lang="la">"Non recte vinctus;"</quote> meaning "it was not well done to bind him." The father pretends to understand him as meaning (which he might equally well by using the same words), <foreign lang="la">"non satis stricte,"</foreign> "he wasn't tightly enough" bound; and answers "I ordered that he should be," referring to his order for Davus to be bound hand and foot. Donatus justly observes that the disposition of the old gentleman to joke is a characteristic mark of his thorough reconciliation.</note></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> But I ordered to that effect.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Prithee, do order him to be set at liberty,</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Well, be it so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> But immediately.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> I'm going in.</p></sp>

<milestone n="961" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Their joys are their own</lemma>: Westerhovius remarks that he seems here to be promulgating the doctrine of Epicurus, who taught that the Deities devoted themselves entirely to pleasure and did not trouble themselves about mortals. Donatus observes that these are the doctrines of Epicurus, and that the whole sentence is copied from the Eunuch of Menander; to which practice of borrowing from various Plays, allusion is made in the Prologue, where he mentions the mixing of plays; <foreign lang="la">"contaminari fabulas."</foreign></note> For immortality has been obtained by me, if no sorrow interrupts this delight.

Grant us your applause.<milestone n="982" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Grant us your applause</lemma>: <quote lang="la">"Plaudite."</quote> Colman has the following remark at the conclusion of this Play: "All the old Tragedies and Comedies acted at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> concluded in this manner. <foreign lang="la">'Donec cantor vos "Plaudite" dicat,'</foreign> says Horace. Who the 'cantor' was, is a matter of dispute. Madame Dacier thinks it was the whole chorus; others suppose it to have been a single actor; some the prompter, and some the composer. Before the word 'Plaudite' in all the old copies is an <foreign lang="greek">*w,</foreign> which has also given rise to several learned conjectures. It is most probable, according to the notion of Madame Dacier, that this <foreign lang="greek">*w,</foreign> being the last letter of the Greek alphabet, was nothing more than the mark of the transcriber to signify the end, like the Latin word <foreign lang="la">'Finis'</foreign> in modern books; or it might, as Patrick supposes, stand for <foreign lang="greek">*wdos,</foreign> 'cantor,' denoting that the following word 'Plaudite' was spoken by him. After 'Plaudite' in all the old copies of Terence stand these two words, <foreign lang="la">'Calliopins recensui;'</foreign> which signify, 'I, Calliopius, have revised and corrected this piece.' And this proceeds from the custom of the old critics, who carefully revised all Manuscripts, and when they had read and corrected any work, certified the same by placing their names at the end of it."</note>
