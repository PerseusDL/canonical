                        Hannibal encamps on the banks of the Anio, within three miles of Rome.
					Attended by two thousand horsemen, he advances close to the Colline
					gate to take a view of the walls and situation of the city. On two suc-
					cessive days the hostile armies are hindered from engaging by the severity
					of the weather. Capua taken by Quintus Fulvius and Appius Claudius;
					the chief nobles die, voluntarily, by poison. Quintus Fulvius having con-
					demned the principal senators to death, at the moment they are actually
					tied to the stakes, receives despatches from Rome, commanding him to
					spare their lives, which he postpones reading until the sentence is executed.
					Publius Scipio, offering himself for the service, is sent to command in
					Spain; takes New Carthage in one clay. Successes in Sicily. Treaty
					of friendship with the Aetolians. War with Philip, king of Macedonia,
					and the Acarnanians.

                    THE consuls, Cneius Fulvius Centumalus and Publius Sulpicius Galba, having entered on their office on the ides of March, assembled the senate in the Capitol, and took the opinion of the fathers on the state of the republic, the manner of conducting the war, and on what related to the provinces and the armies.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Quintus Fulvius and Appius Claudius, the consuls of the former year, were continued in command;
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    and the armies which they before had were assigned to them, it being added that they should not withdraw from Capua, which they were besieging, till they had taken it.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    The Romans were now solicitously intent upon this object, not from resentment so much, which was never juster against any city, as from the consideration that as this city, so celebrated and powerful, had by its defection drawn away several states, so when reduced it would bring back their minds to respect for

                    the former supreme government.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Two praetors also of the former year, Marcus Junius and Publius Sempronius, were each continued in command of the two legions which they had under them, the former in Etruria, the latter in Gaul.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Marcus Marcellus also was continued in command, that he might, as proconsul, finish the war in Sicily with the army he had there.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    If he wanted recruits he was to take them from the legions which Publius Cornelius, the propraetor, commanded in Sicily, provided he did not choose any soldier who
                    <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/>
                    was of the number of those whom the senate had refused to allow to be discharged, or to return home till the war was put an end to.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    To Caius Sulpicius, to whose lot Sicily had fallen, the two legions which Publius Cornelius had commanded were assigned, to be recruited from the army of Cneius Fulvius, which had been shamefully beaten, and had experienced a dreadful loss the year before in Apulia.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    To soldiers of this description the senate had assigned the same period of service as to those who fought at Cannae; and as an additional mark of ignominy upon both, they were not allowed to winter in towns, or to build huts for wintering within the distance of ten miles from any town.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    To Lucius Cornelius, in Sardinia, the two legions which Quintus Mucius had commanded were assigned; if recruits were wanted, the consuls were ordered to enlist them.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    To Titus Otacilius and Marcus Valerius was allotted the protection of the coasts of Sicily and Greece, with the legions and fleets which they had commanded. The Greek coast had fifty ships with one legion; the Sicilian, a hundred ships with two legions.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    Twenty-three legions were employed by the Romans in carrying on the war this year by land and sea.

                    In the beginning of the year, on a letter from Lucius Marcius being laid before the senate, they considered his achievements as most glorious; but the title of honour which he assumed (for though he was neither invested with the command by the order of the people, nor by the direction of the fathers, his letter ran in this form,
                    <quote>The proprietor to the senate</quote>
                    ) gave offence to a great many.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    It was considered as an injurious precedent for generals to be chosen by the armies, and for the solemn ceremony of elections, held under auspices, to be transferred to camps and provinces, and (far from the control of the laws and magistrates) to military thoughtlessness.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    And though some gave it as their opinion, that the

                    sense of the senate should be taken on the matter, yet it was thought more advisable that the discussion should be postponed till after the departure of the horsemen who brought the letter from Marcius.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    It was resolved, that an answer should be returned respecting the corn and clothing of the army, stating, that the senate would direct its attention to both those matters; but that the letter should not be addressed to Lucius Marcius, proprietor, lest he should consider that as already determined which was the very point they reserved for discussion.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    After the horsemen were dismissed, it was the first thing the consuls brought before the senate;
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    and the opinions of all to a man coincided, that the plebeian tribunes should be instructed to consult the commons with all possible speed, as to whom they might resolve to send into Spain to take the command of that army which had been under the conduct of Cneius Scipio.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    The plebeian tribunes were instructed accordingly, and the question was published. But another contest had pre-engaged the minds of the people: Caius Sempronius Blaesus, having brought Cneius Fulvius to trial for the loss of the army in Apulia, harassed him with invectives in the public assemblies:
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>

                        had by indiscretion and ignorance brought their armies into most perilous situations, but none, save Cneius Fulvius, had corrupted his legions by every species of excess before he betrayed them to the enemy; it might therefore with truth be said, that they were lost before they saw the enemy, and that they were defeated, not by Hannibal, but by their own general.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        No man, when he gave his vote, took sufficient pains in ascertaining who it was to whom he was intrusting an army.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                        What a difference was there between this man and Tiberius Sempronius! The latter, having been intrusted with an army of slaves, had in a short time brought it to pass, by discipline and authority, that not one of them in the field of battle remembered his condition and birth, but they became a protection to our allies and a terror to our enemies. They had snatched, as it were, from the very jaws of Hannibal, and restored to the Roman people, Cumae, Beneventum, and other towns.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        But Cneius Fulvius had infected with the vices peculiar to slaves, an army of Roman citizens, of honourable parentage and liberal education; and had thus made them insolent and turbulent among their allies, inefficient and dastardly among their ene-

                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                        But, by Hercules, it was no wonder that the troops did not stand their ground in the battle, when their general was the first to fly; with him, the greater wonder was, that any had fallen at their posts, and that they were not all the companions of Cneius Fulvius in his consternation and his flight.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        Caius Flaminius, Lucius Paullus, Lucius Posthumius, Cneius and Publius Scipio, had preferred falling in the battle to abandoning their armies when in the power of the enemy. But Cneius Fulvius was almost the only man who returned to Rome to report the annihilation of his army.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                        It was a shameful crime that the army of Cannae should be transported into Sicily, because they fled from the field of battle, and not be allowed to return till the enemy has quitted Italy; that the same decree should have been lately passed with respect to the legions of Cneius Fulvius;
                        <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                        while Cneius Fulvius himself has no punishment inflicted upon him for running away, in a battle brought about by his own indiscretion; that he himself should be permitted to pass his old age in stews and brothels, where he passed his youth, while his troops, whose only crime was that they resembled their general, should be sent away in a manner into banishment, and suffer an ignominious service.

                        that in consequence of their having in the most turbulent manner demanded battle, they were led into the field, not on the day they desired, for it was then evening, but on the following; that they were drawn up at a suitable time and on favourable ground; but either the reputation or the strength of the enemy was such, that they were unable to stand their ground.

                    He was twice accused, and the penalty was laid at a fine. On the third accusation, at which witnesses were produced, he was not only overwhelmed with an infinity of disgraceful charges, but a great many asserted on oath, that the flight and

                    panic commenced with the praetor, that the troops being deserted by him, and concluding that the fears of their general were not unfounded, turned their backs; when so strong a feeling of indignation was excited, that the assembly clamorously rejoined that he ought to be tried capitally.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    This gave rise to a new controversy;

                    for when the tribune, who had twice prosecuted him as for a finable offence, now, on the third occasion, declared that he prosecuted him capitally; the tribunes of the commons being appealed to, said,

                    Upon this, Sempronius said, that he charged Cneius Fulvius with the crime of treason; and requested Caius Calpurnius, the city praetor, to appoint a day for the comitia.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Another ground of hope was then tried by the accused, viz. if his brother, Quintus Fulvius, could be present at his trial, who was at that time flourishing in the fame of his past achievements and in the near expectation of taking Capua.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    Fulvius wrote to the senate, requesting the favour in terms calculated to excite compassion, in order to save the life of his brother; but the fathers replied, that the interest of the state would not admit of his leaving Capua.

                    Cneius Fulvius, therefore, before the day appointed for the comitia arrived, went into exile to Tarquinii, and the commons resolved that it was a legal exile.

When Hannibal saw the destruction of the cohort of Spaniards, and that the camp of the enemy was defended with the utmost vigour, giving up the assault, he began to withdraw his standards, making his infantry face about, but throwing out his cavalry in the rear lest the enemy should pursue them closely.

                    This fleet setting out from Rhegium, was met at Sacriportus, about fifteen miles from the city, by Democrates, with an equal number of Tarentine ships. It happened that the Roman was then coming with his sails up, not expecting an approaching contest;

Rarely elsewhere have regular fleets engaged with so much spirit, for they fought for what was of greater importance than the fleets themselves.

The prows joined together remained stationary, while the sterns were moved round by the force of their adversaries' oars.

After an agreement had been entered into by means of these persons, and the mode of carrying it into execution concerted, the Nu- midians seized on a gate which leads towards the sea, having driven the guards from it, or put them to the sword, and then received into the city a party of Romans sent for that purpose;
