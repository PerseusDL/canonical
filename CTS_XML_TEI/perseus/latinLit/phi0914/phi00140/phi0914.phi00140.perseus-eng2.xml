                <argument>
                    <p> When Philip had ordered the children of those whom he had put to death, to
                        be sought after as hostages, Theoxena, fearing the king's passion for her
                        own children and those of her sister, who were still quite young, brought
                        forward swords and a cup in which there was poison, and persuaded them to
                        escape, by putting an end to their existence, the mockery that awaited them;
                        after administering which advice, she in company with her husband plunged
                        headlong from the ship into the sea. The quarrels between Perseus and
                        Demetrius, the sons of Philip, king of Macedon, are related; arid how that
                        Demetrius was first assailed by accusations invented through his brother's
                        guile, and among the rest, an impeachment for parricide and aspiring to the
                        throne, and at last, since he was the friend of the Roman people, cut off by
                        poison; and the king- dom of Macedon, on the death of Philip, fell to
                        Perseus. It contains likewise the exploits successfully achieved by very
                        many commanders in Liguria, and against the Celtiberians in Spain. Under the
                        Janiculum, in the field of L. Petillius, the secretary, the books of Numa
                        Pompilius were found by the labourers of the field, enclosed in a stone
                        chest, written in both Latin and Greek characters; in which, when the
                        praetor, to whom they had been brought, had read very many things calculated
                        to overthrow the present system of religion, he swore to the senate that
                        their being read and preserved would be detrimental to the state. And by a
                        decree of the senate they were burned in the Comitium. The colony of Aquilia
                        was planted. Philip, worn out by the pangs of conscience, because,
                        influenced by the false information of his other son Perseus, he had by
                        poison removed from life's scene his son Demetrius, both resolved on the
                        punishment of Perseus and desired to leave his friend Antigonus, rather than
                        him, as his successor. But, whilst forming this project, he was hurried off
                        by death. Perseus received the kingdom. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> AT the commencement of the next year, the
                    consuls and praetors determined the provinces by lot. For the consuls there was
                    no province to be decreed, except Liguria. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The
                    city jurisdiction fell to Marcus Ogulnius Gallus; that among foreigners, to
                    Marcus Valerius; of the Spains, the Hither, to Marcus Fulvius Flaccus; the
                    Farther, to Publius Manlius; Sicily, to Lucius Caecilius Denter; and Sardinia,
                    to Caius Terentius Istra. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The consuls were
                    ordered to hold levies, for <pb n="1855" xml:id="p.1855"/> Quintus Fabius had
                    written from Liguria, that the Apuani seemed inclined to a renewal of
                    hostilities, and that it was to be feared that they would make an irruption into
                    the district of Pisae. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> From the Spains, also,
                    they received intelligence that the Hither province was in arms; that the war
                    still continued with the Celtiberians: that, in the Farther province, because
                    the praetor had been for a long time indisposed, military discipline was relaxed
                    by intemperance and inactivity. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> For these
                    reasons it was decreed that new armies should be raised; four legions for
                    Liguria, that each might contain five thousand two hundred foot, and three
                    hundred horse, and to these same were added, fifteen thousand foot and eight
                    hundred horse of the Latin allies. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> These were
                    to complete the two consular armies. They were ordered, also, to enrol seven
                    thousand foot and four hundred horse, of the allies and Latins, and to send them
                    into Gaul to Marcus Marcellus, whose command was prolonged on the expiration of
                    his consulship. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> There were ordered to be
                    levied, of Roman citizens, four thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry, and
                    of the allies, seven thousand infantry with three hundred cavalry, which should
                    be also led into both Spains. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And to Quintus
                    Fabius Labeo, with the army which he had in Liguria, was the command prolonged
                    for a year. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The spring of this year was remarkable for
                    storms. On the day before the feast of Pales, a tremendous hurricane arose about
                    mid-day, and made havoc in many places, both sacred and common. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> It threw down the brazen statues in the Capitol; tore away
                    a gate from the temple of Luna, which is on the Aventine, and fastened it to the
                    back parts of the temple of Ceres; overturned other statues in the Circus
                    Maximus, together with the pillars on which they stood; tore off several cupolas
                    from the roofs of temples, and scattered them in an unseemly manner. <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> This storm was converted into a prodigy, and the
                    aruspices ordered it to be attended to. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At the
                    same time expiation was made, because it had been reported that a three-footed
                    mule was born at Reate, and that the temple of Apollo, at Formiae and at Caieta,
                    was struck with lightning. On account of these prodigies, a sacrifice of twenty
                    larger victims was offered, and there was a supplication of one day's
                    continuance. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> About the same time information
                    was obtained from a letter of Aulus Terentius, the <pb n="1856" xml:id="p.1856"
                    /> propraetor, that Publius Sempronius, after being sick for more than a year,
                    had died in the Farther province: on this account the praetors were ordered to
                    set out sooner for Spain. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The foreign
                    embassies were then brought before the senate; and first, those of the kings
                    Eumenes and Pharnaces, and of the Rhodians, complaining of the sufferings of the
                    inhabitants of Sinope. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> There came also, about
                    the same time, the ambassadors of Philip, the Achaeans, and Lacedaemonians.
                    Answers were given to these, after Marcius, who had been sent to inspect the
                    affairs of Greece and Macedonia, had first received an audience. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> To the Asiatic kings and the Rhodians, they answered,
                    that the senate would send ambassadors to examine into those matters. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Marcius had increased their anxiety respecting
                    Philip; for, he acknowledged that the latter had acquiesced with the will of the
                    senate in such a manner, as to render it very evident, that he would conform to
                    it no longer than necessity obliged him; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> nor
                    was it difficult to see, that he intended to renew hostilities, and that every
                    thing which he then said and did had a tendency that way. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Now, in the first place, he removed almost the whole body
                    of the citizens, with their families, from the maritime cities, into Emathia,
                    which is its modern name, it was formerly called Paeonia; <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> he gave up those cities to be inhabited by Thracians, and
                    other barbarians, thinking that this kind of people would prove more faithful to
                    him in case of a war with Rome. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This
                    proceeding caused great discontent over all Macedonia; and of those who, with
                    their wives and children, left their dwellings, few concealed their grief in
                    silence; and, their hatred overcoming their fear, imprecations against the king
                    were heard, as they proceeded along in groups. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    His mind, rendered savage by these things, entertained suspicions of all men,
                    places, and seasons; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> at last he began to
                    confess openly, that he had nothing sufficiently safe without seizing and
                    confining the sons of those whom he had destroyed, and sending them out of the
                    world at different times. </p>
                <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> This cruelty, horrible in itself, the
                    calamities of one particular family rendered still more so. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> Philip had, many years before, put to death Herodicus, a
                    Thessalian of distinction; and afterwards his sons-in-law. His daughters were
                    left widows, having each a little son. The names of the women <pb n="1857"
                        xml:id="p.1857"/> were Theoxena and Archo. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Theoxena, though courted by many, rejected every offer of marriage. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> Archo married a certain Poris, by far the first of
                    the Aenean nation; and, after bearing him many children, died, leaving them all
                    quite young. Theoxena then, in order that her sister's children might be
                    educated under her own inspection, married Poris, <milestone n="5??"
                        unit="section"/> and as if she herself had borne them all, treated her own
                    and her sister's sons with the same affectionate care. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> When she heard of the king's order for seizing the children
                    of the persons who had been put to death, supposing that they were destined to
                    afford sport not only to the king's lust, but to that of his guards, she formed
                    in her mind a horrid project, and had the hardiness to declare, that she would
                    kill them <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> all with her own hand, rather than
                    they should come into the power of Philip. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    Poris, abhorring the mention of such a dreadful deed, told her that he would
                    carry them away to Athens, to some faithful friends, and would himself accompany
                    them in their flight. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They all went from
                    Thessalonica to Aenea, to a stated sacrifice, which they offer yearly, with
                    great solemnity, in honour of Aeneas, the founder of the nation. Having spent
                    the day there, in the anniversary feast, about the third watch, when all were
                    asleep, they embarked in a vessel ready prepared by Poris, as if intending to
                    return to Thessalonica; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> but their design was
                    to cross over to Eubœa. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> However, daylight
                    surprised them at a small distance from the land, struggling in vain against a
                    contrary wind, and the king's officers, who commanded the garrison of the port,
                    despatched an armed bark to bring back their ship, with a strict injunction not
                    to return without it. When they were now drawing nigh, Poris was intently
                    occupied in animating the rowers and sailors, and, at times, raising his hands
                    towards heaven, supplicated the gods to assist him. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> Meanwhile, the woman, with desperate fury recurring to the
                    shocking design which she had long premeditated, dissolves some poison, and
                    produces swords; then, placing the cup in their view, and unsheathing the
                    swords, she says, <quote> Death is our only refuge. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> These paths lead thither, by whichever of them each

                    that most people uttered imprecations on himself and his children; which curses
                    being in a short time heard by all the gods, caused him to vent his cruelty on

                    every day, and that no hope was left him of obtaining the crown save by the

                    appearance of rejecting with scorn any such overtures, because they entertained
                    higher expectations from Demetrius. Afterwards Philip's animosity to the Romans
                    increased every day, which Perseus fomented; but Demetrius, with all his might,
                    opposed. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Foreseeing the fatal doom of the

                    the hopes of the more powerful, they united themselves to Perseus. <milestone

                    for war, to which he had already of his own accord turned his attention.

                    Yesterday, on occasion of the purification, the military exercise and mock

                    to your house to supper. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Father, do you think
                    that I, to whom they came in arms, that they might drink with me, would have
                    supped there with unarmed guests. Do you think that I would have been in no
                    danger from their swords by night, when they almost killed me with stakes, of
                    which you were a spectator. Why, Demetrius, did you come at that time of night;
                    why an enemy come to a person provoked; why with young men in arms? <milestone

                    the gate had been open, you would be preparing my funeral at this moment, in
                    which you are hearing my complaint. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> I do not,
                    as an accuser, urge any thing for the purpose of accusation; nor by collecting
                    doubtful circumstances, in a train of artful arguments. For what can he say?
                    Does he deny that he came to my gate with a large party, or that there were
                    armed men with him? <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Send for the persons,

                    If I brought before you any who had been caught within my doors in arms, you

                    And what they wanted, in the day, my brother's guests took to themselves in the

                    their hopes of honour and fortune in the Romans, and in him who is all-powerful
                    with the Romans? Nor, in truth, do they prefer him merely to me, his elder

                    before the Romans with no less mental ardour than they had contended for it with
                    the sword, even in the field of battle. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The
                    Carthaginians claimed the ground first, as having been the property of their
                    ancestors; and next, because it had come to them from Syphax. Masinissa urged,
                    that <quote> he had retaken possession of it as part of his father's kingdom,
                        and held it under the law <pb n="1874" xml:id="p.1874"/> of nations; and
                        that he had the advantage, both in the merits of his cause and in the
                        present possession. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> That, in this
                        discussion, he had no other fear, than lest the moderation of the Romans
                        might operate to his loss, whilst they dreaded the appearance of any
                        partiality to a king who was their friend and ally, in prejudice to the
                        common enemy of him and them. </quote>
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The deputies did not alter the right of
                    possession, but referred the cause entire to the senate at Rome. There was
                    nothing done afterwards in Liguria. The inhabitants, at first, retired into
                    pathless forests; and afterwards, disbanding their army, separated in every
                    direction among the villages and forts. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                    consuls, too, wished to disband their forces, and consulted the senators on this
                    matter. They ordered that one of them should discharge his troops, and come to
                    Rome to elect magistrates for the year; and that the other, with his legions,
                    should pass the winter at Pisae. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A report
                    prevailed, that the transalpine Gauls were arming their young men, and it was
                    not known on what quarter of Italy that multitude would pour itself. The consuls
                    settled the matter between them, —that Cneius Baebius should go home to the
                    elections, because his brother, Marcus Baebius, was a candidate for the

                    infested by robberies committed by foreign piratical ships. The Massilians made
                    the same complaint, with regard to the ships of the Ligurians. <milestone n="5"

                    Roman citizens with two hundred horse, and six thousand foot and three hundred
                    horse of the Latin confederates. Nor was the business of the fleet neglected.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The consuls were ordered to constitute
                    duumvirs for conducting that department; by whom, twenty ships which they had
                    launched were to be manned with Roman citizens who had been in servitude; with

                    on the right, as far as Marseilles; the other, that on the left, extending to

                    year, and reported from abroad. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It rained
                    blood in the courts of the temples of Vulcan and Concord, and the priests
                    reported that spears moved, and that the image of Juno Sospita at Lanuvium shed
                    tears. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> There was a pestilence in the country,
                    in the market towns and market-places: and so violent was it in the city, that
                    Libitina could scarcely supply the requisites for burying the dead. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> These prodigies, and the mortality, alarmed the
                    senate so much, that they ordered the consuls to sacrifice to such gods as they
                    thought proper, victims of the larger kinds, and likewise the decemvirs to
                    consult the books. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Pursuant to their
                    direction, a supplication for one day was proclaimed, to be performed at every
                    shrine in Rome. On the authority of these same, both the senate voted, and the
                    consuls announced, that there should be a supplication and holidays for three
                    days throughout the whole of Italy. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The
                    pestilence raged with so great fury, that when, in consequence of the revolt of
                    the Corsicans, and a war raised in Sardinia by the Iliensians, it seemed good,
                    that, from among the Latin allies, eight thousand foot and three hundred horse
                    should be raised, whom Marcus Pinarius the praetor should convey with him into
                    Sardinia; —the <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> consuls returned a
                    representation, that so great a number of men had died, and so many were sick,
                    in every place, that the number of soldiers could not be made up. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> The praetor was ordered to take from Cneius Baebius,
                    proconsul, <pb n="1876" xml:id="p.1876"/> who was in winter quarters at Pisae,
                    as many soldiers as would make up the deficiency, and transport them from thence
                    to Sardinia. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> To Lucius Duronius the praetor,
                    to whose lot Apulia had fallen, was given in addition the charge of making
                    inquiry concerning the Bacchanalians; for some remaining seeds of the evils,
                    formerly excited by those people, had shown themselves there the year before.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The inquiries were rather commenced under
                    the praetor, Lucius Pupius, than brought to any issue; the senate therefore
                    ordered the new praetor to cut up that evil by the roots, lest it might spread
                    again more extensively. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The consuls, also, by

                    and Pharnaces of Pontus. No further answer was given to these, than that the

                    gave an account, to the satisfaction of the senate, of the recovery of Messene,
                    and the settlement of affairs there. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> From
                    Philip, king of Macedonia, came two ambassadors also, —Philocles and Appelles;
                    not on any business with the senate, but rather to pry into and inquire
                    concerning the correspondence with the Romans, of which Perseus had accused
                    Demetrius, and, particularly, into that with Titus Quintius, concerning the
                    kingdom, to the prejudice of his brother. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The
                    king had employed these men, believing them unbiassed and inclined in favour of
                    neither party; but they were accomplices and agents of Perseus, in his
                    treacherous designs against his brother. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Demetrius, ignorant of all except the villanous scheme of his brother which had
                    lately broke out, at first neither utterly despaired, nor yet entertained much
                    hope of being reconciled with his father; but afterwards he trusted less and
                    less every day to Philip's affection, having observed that an audience with him
                    was prevented by his brother. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Wherefore, not
                    to increase the suspicions he laboured under, he used extreme circumspection in

                        xml:id="p.1877"/> mention of, and communication with, the Romans; to such a
                    degree as to wish that they should not write, as he knew that his father's mind

                    and thence he led it on into Maedica. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He had
                    been seized with an earnest desire of ascending to the summit of Mount Haemus,
                    for he gave credit to a vulgar opinion, that from thence could be seen at once
                    the Pontic and Adriatic Seas, the river Danube, and the Alps; and he thought
                    that the having a view of all those places, would be of no small consequence
                    towards forming his plans of a war with Rome. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    On inquiry, from people acquainted with the country, respecting the ascent to

                    was access for a small party, lightly accoutred, that he might soothe with

                    he first asked his opinion, <quote> whether, as the difficulty of the journey

                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He added, that, if he should resolve to
                    proceed, he could not forget the caution of Antigonus, respecting undertakings
                    of that kind; who being tossed about by a violent storm, when he had all his
                    family in the same ship with him, was said to have advised his sons to remember,
                    and hand down to their children, this maxim: <quote> never to have the hardihood
                        to rush into danger themselves, and their whole family together. </quote>
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He would therefore attend to this warning, and
                    not expose his two sons at once to the chance of those perils, which were
                    represented to lie in his way; and as he meant to take his elder son with him,
                    he would send back the younger into Macedon, as a reserve to his hopes, and as
                    guardian of the kingdom." <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> It did not escape
                    Demetrius that he was sent out of the way, that he might not be present at their
                    deliberations, when, in view of those places, they should consult which were the
                    shortest roads to the Adriatic Sea and to Italy, and what was the general plan
                    to be pursued in the war. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He was obliged
                    however not only to obey his father on the occasion, but to express <pb n="1878"
                        xml:id="p.1878"/> his approbation of the measure, lest a reluctant obedience
                    might beget suspicion. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> In order that his
                    journey into Macedonia might be safe, Didas, one of the king's general officers,

                    himself by every kind of obsequiousness into the most familiar communication
                    with Demetrius, so as to draw from him all his secrets, and to pry into his
                    hidden thoughts. The prince, therefore, set out with a guard more dangerous to

                    ascended the lower parts of the hills, the fatigue was moderate; but as they
                    advanced upwards, they found the ground more thickly covered with woods, and
                    many places impassable. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They then came to a
                    part of the way so shaded by the thickness of the trees, and the branches so

                    seen in other places, the whole tract was covered with so thick a fog, that they
                    were impeded no less than if they were journeying by night. At last, on the

                    coming down they did not discountenance the vulgar opinion, more, I suppose,
                    lest the folly of the journey should be exposed to derision, than that it was
                    there possible to see those seas, and mountains, and rivers, so widely distant
                    from each other. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They were all greatly
                    fatigued by the difficulty of the way; and chiefly the king himself, in

                    Pulcher, and Caius Terentius Istra. The year was rendered remarkable by a

                    Both the chests had inscriptions in Greek and Latin letters, one signifying that

                    containing seven books, not only entire, but apparently quite fresh. Seven were
                    in Latin, and related to the pontifical law; and seven in Greek, containing the

                    Afterwards, when they became publicly spoken of in consequence of many others
                    reading them, Quintus Petillius, the city praetor, having a desire to read those
                    books, borrowed them from Lucius Petillius, with whom he was familiarly

                    governor of this province, who, because he heard that the Celtiberians were
                    arming their young men, drew together all the succours he could procure from the

                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Early in spring, he marched his army into
                    Carpetania, and fixed his camp close to the town of Aebura, in which he posted a

                    was level, and convenient for fighting, and here the Spaniards stood waiting for

                    successive days, while the others constantly drew up theirs, and formed in the

                    and from that time the Celtiberians, because they had not an opportunity of
                    engaging, remained quiet in their camp; their cavalry only advanced as
                    out-posts, to be ready in case of any movement being made by Fulvius. <milestone

                    therefore, thinking that they were now drawn far enough from their camp, to
                    hinder them from giving it any succour, as he had his troops already formed
                    within the works, burst out from three sides at once; and at the same time
                    raised the shout, not only to inspire ardour for the fight, but also that the

                    refuge, and that their only hope now lay in their arms, they renewed the combat
                    afresh, with greater obstinacy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Their centre
                    was pressed hard by the fifth legion; but their men advanced with more
                    confidence against the left wing, where they saw that the Romans had posted the

                    had not the seventh legion come to its support. At the same time, the troops

                    long in coming, not because they were unwilling to give assistance, but that
                    after they had begun their march the roads were rendered impassable, and the

                    supposing either that it was removed to the other side, or that the enemy had

                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> However, there were about twelve thousand

                    of the assembly. After this the pontiffs were prevented by religious scruples

                    Flaccus was nominated by the college; but Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, was elected

                    it by storm; then, after having received hostages and placed a garrison, he
                    proceeded to attack their forts and ravage the country with fire, until he
                    arrived at another very strong city, (the Celtiberians call it <milestone

                    works, deputies came out from the town, whose speech partook of all the
                    simplicity of the earliest times, not dissembling their wishes to continue the

                    deliberate apart from them. By the permission of Gracchus they went; and in a

                    given them. After drinking off the first cups, they asked a second time, causing
                    thereby loud laughter from those present, at minds so unpolished, and ignorant
                    of all civilization. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The eldest of them then
                    says, <quote>We have been sent by our nation to ask, on what do you rely that

                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> To this question Gracchus answered, that

                    the besieged city. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When the townsmen had from

                    intervened, when he saw a body of his own troops flying back, according to the

                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He had his army drawn up within the trench
                    in readiness for this very opportunity. He therefore delayed only so long as to
                    allow his own men to retreat into the camp by a free passage; then, raising the

                    their trenches; and at last beaten out of them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"

                    yoke; within a few days he received the submission of a hundred and three towns;
                    he got immense booty. He then marched back to Alce, whence he came, and set
                    about besieging that city. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The townsmen

                    And then at last they sent envoys, and surrendered themselves, and every thing
                    belonging to them, to the Romans. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Great

                    it was evident that it was a disorder of the mind rather than of the body, and

                    Philip happened very seasonably for the purpose of gaining time and collecting

                    Bastarnians, in consequence of long solicitation, set out from their own abodes,
                    with a large force of infantry and cavalry, and crossed the Danube. <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> Antigonus and Cotto (the latter was a Bastarnian of
                    distinction, and Antigonus had been sent, much against his will, with this same
                    Cotto, as ambassador, to persuade his countrymen to take arms) went forward, to
                    carry intelligence of this to the king; but at a small distance from Amphipolis
                    a rumour, and then authentic information, acquainted them with the king's death;

                        unit="section"/> It had been arranged in this manner; — Philip was to
                    procure for the Bastarnians a safe passage through Thrace, and supplies of
                    provisions. In order to be able to effect this, he had courted the chieftains in
                    that country by presents, having pledged his faith that the Bastarnians should
                    march through it in a peaceable body. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It was
                    proposed to exterminate the nation of the Dardanians, and to establish

                    <pb n="1913" xml:id="p.1913"/> from which measure a double advantage would
                    accrue, if both the Dardanians, a nation ever hostile to Macedonia, and
                    anxiously looking to the unfortunate periods of its kings, would be removed out
                    of the way; and the Bastarnians, having left their wives and children in
                    Dardania, might be sent to ravage Italy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> That
                    the road to the Adriatic Sea and Italy was through the country of the
                    Scordiscians, and that the army could not be led by any other way; that the
                    Scordiscians would readily grant a passage to the Bastarnians, for they would
                    have no dislike to people resembling themselves in language and manners, and
                    would probably join them in an expedition, when they saw that they were on their
                    way to the plunder of a most opulent nation. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    The remaining plans were accommodated to every kind of event that might take
                    place; for if the Bastarnians would be cut off by the Romans, still the removal
                    of the Dardanians, and the booty to be gained from the remains of the former,
                    and the full possession of Dardania, would prove a consolation; <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> or if they should be successful, then, while the Romans
                    would be employed in the Bastarnian war, he might recover what he had lost in

                    the report of Philip's death, neither the Thracians were easily dealt with, nor
                    would the Bastarnians be content with what they could purchase; nor could they

                    attacked them when already in dismay, they themselves then said, that the gods
