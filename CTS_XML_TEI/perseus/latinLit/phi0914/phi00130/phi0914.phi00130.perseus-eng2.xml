                    <p> Scipio, aided by Masinissa, defeats the Carthaginians, Syphax and Hasdrubal,
                        in several battles. Syphax taken by Laelius and Masinissa. Masinissa
                        espouses Sophonisba, the wife of Syphax, Hasdrubal's daughter; being
                        reproved by Scipio, he sends her poison, with which she puts an end to her
                        life. The Carthaginians, reduced to great extremity by Scipio's repeated
                        victories, call Hannibal home from Italy; he holds a conference with Scipio
                        on the subject of peace, and is again defeated by him in battle. The
                        Carthaginians sue for peace, which is granted them. Masinissa reinstated in
                        his kingdom. Scipio returns to Rome; his splendid triumph; is surnamed
                        Africanus. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> CNEIUS SERVILIUS and Caius Servilius Geminus,
                    the consuls in the sixteenth year of the Punic war, having consulted the senate
                    respecting the state, the war, and the provinces, they decreed that the consuls
                    should arrange between themselves, or draw <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/>
                    lots, which of them should have the province of Bruttium, to act against
                    Hannibal, and which that of Etruria and Liguria; that the consul to whose lot
                    Bruttium fell should receive the army from Publius Sempronius; <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> that Publius Sempronius, who was continued in command as
                    proconsul for a year, should succeed Publius Licinius, who was to return to
                    Rome. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In addition to the other qualifications
                    with which he was adorned in a degree surpassed by no citizen of that time, for
                    in him were accumulated all the perfections of nature and fortune, Licinius was
                    also esteemed eminent in war. He was at once a man of noble family and great
                    wealth; possessing a fine person and great bodily strength. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> He was considered an orator of the highest order, both in
                    respect of judicial eloquence, and also when engaged in promoting or opposing
                    any measure in the senate, or before the people. He was also accurately skilled
                    in the pontifical law. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> In addition to all
                    these recommendations, the consulship enabled him to acquire military glory. The
                    senate adopted the same course in the decree with respect to the province of
                    Etruria and Li- <pb n="1284" xml:id="p.1284"/> guria as had been observed with
                    regard to Bruttium. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Marcus Cornelius was
                    ordered to deliver his army to the new consul, and with continued command to
                    hold himself the province of Gaul, with those legions which the praetor Lucius
                    Scribonius had commanded the former year. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                    consuls then cast lots for their provinces: Bruttium fell to the lot of Caepio,
                    Etruria to the lot of Servilius Geminus. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                    provinces of the praetors were then put to the lot. Paetus Aelius obtained the
                    city jurisdiction; Publius Lentulus, Sardinia; Publius Villius, Sicily;
                    Quinctilius Varus, Ariminum, with two legions which had served under Lucretius
                    Spurius. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Lucretius also was continued in
                    command that he might complete the building of the town of Genoa, which had been
                    destroyed by Mago the Carthaginian. Publius Scipio was continued in command for
                    a period not limited in point of time, but the object he had to achieve, namely,
                    till the war in Africa had been brought to a termination; <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> and a decree was passed, ordering a supplication to be made
                    that the circumstance of his crossing over into Africa might be beneficial to
                    the Roman people, the general himself, and his army. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Three thousand men were enlisted for Sicily,
                    and lest any fleet should go thither from Africa, as all the efficient troops
                    that province had possessed had been transported into Africa, it was resolved
                    that the sea-coast of that island should be guarded with forty ships. Villius
                    took with him into Sicily thirteen ships, the rest consisted of the old ones,
                    which were repaired. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Marcus Pomponius, the
                    praetor of the former year, who was continued in command, having been placed at
                    the head of this fleet, put on board the fresh soldiers brought from Italy.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The senate assigned by a decree an equal
                    number of ships to Cneius Octavius, who was also a praetor of the former year,
                    with a similar privilege of command, for the protection of the coast of
                    Sardinia. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Lentulus the praetor was ordered to
                    furnish two thousand soldiers to put on board it. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> The protection of the coast of Italy was assigned to Marcus
                    Marcius, a praetor of the former year, with the same number of ships; for it was
                    uncertain to what quarter the Carthaginians would send a fleet, though it was
                    supposed that they would attack any quarter which was destitute of defence.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The consuls, in conformity with a decree
                    of the senate, enlisted three thousand soldiers for this fleet, and two city
                    legions with a view to the <pb n="1285" xml:id="p.1285"/> hazards of war.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Spains were assigned to the former
                    generals, Lucius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus, who were continued in
                    command, and retained their former armies. The operations of the war on the part
                    of the Romans this year were carried on with twenty legions in all, and one
                    hundred and sixty ships of war. The praetors were ordered to proceed to their
                    provinces. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Directions were given to the
                    consuls, that before they left the city they should celebrate the great games
                    which Titus Manlius Torquatus, when dictator, had vowed to be exhibited in the
                    fifth year, if the condition of the state remained unaltered. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> Accounts of prodigies brought from several places excited
                    fresh superstitious fears in the minds of men. It was believed that crows had
                    not only torn with their beaks some gold in the Capitol, but had even eaten it.
                    At Antium mice gnawed a golden crown. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> An
                    immense quantity of locusts filled the whole country around Capua, nor could it
                    be made appear satisfactorily whence they came. At Reate a foal was produced
                    with five feet. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> At Anagnia at first scattered
                    fires appeared in the sky, afterwards a vast meteor blazed forth. At Frusino a
                    circle surrounded the sun with a thin line, which was itself afterwards included
                    within the sun's disc which extended beyond it. <milestone n="12" unit="section"
                    /> At Arpinum the earth sank into an immense gulf, in a place where the ground
                    was level. When one of the consuls was immolating the first victim, the head of
                    the liver was wanting. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> These prodigies were
                    expiated with victims of the larger kind. The college of pontiffs gave out to
                    what gods sacrifice was to be made. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> After these matters were finished, the consuls
                    and praetors set out for their provinces. All, however, made Africa the great
                    object of their concern, as though it had been allotted to them; whether it was
                    because they saw that the welfare of the state and the issue of the war turned
                    upon the operations there, or that they might oblige Scipio, on whom the whole
                    state was then intent. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Accordingly, not only
                    from Sardinia, as has been before mentioned, but from Sicily also and Spain,
                    clothing and corn, and from Sicily arms also, together with every kind of
                    stores, were conveyed thither. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Nor did Scipio
                    at any time during the winter relax in any of the various military operations in
                    which he was engaged on all sides. He continued the siege of Utica. His camp was
                    within sight of Hasdrubal. The Carthaginians had launched <pb n="1286"
                        xml:id="p.1286"/> their ships, and had a fleet prepared and equipped to
                    intercept his supplies. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Amid these occupations
                    he had not even lost sight of his endeavours to regain the friendship of Syphax,
                    whose passion for his bride he thought might now perhaps have become satiated
                    from unlimited enjoyment. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> From Syphax he
                    received terms of peace with the Carthaginians, with proposals that the Romans
                    should evacuate Africa, and the Carthaginians Italy, rather than any ground of
                    hope that he would desert their cause if the war proceeded. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> For my part I am of opinion, and in this I am countenanced
                    by the majority of writers, that these negotiations were carried on through
                    messengers, rather than that Syphax himself came to the Roman camp to hold a
                    conference, as Antias Valerius relates. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> At
                    first the Roman general scarcely allowed these terms to be mentioned, but
                    afterwards, in order that there might exist a plausible pretext for his
                    emissaries to go frequently into the camp of the enemy, he rejected these same
                    terms in a more qualified manner, holding out a hope that they might eventually
                    come to an agreement by agitating the question on both sides. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The winter huts of the Carthaginians, which were
                    constructed from materials hastily collected out of the fields, were almost
                    entirely of wood. The Numidians, particularly, lay for the most part in huts
                    formed of interwoven reeds, and covered with mats, dispersed up and down without
                    any regard to order; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> while some of them,
                    having chosen the situations for their tents without waiting for orders, lay
                    even without the trench and rampart. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> These
                    circumstances having been reported to Scipio, gave him hopes that he might have
                    an opportunity of burning the enemy's camp. </p>
                <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> In company with the ambassadors whom he sent
                    to Syphax, he also sent some centurions of the first rank, of tried valour and
                    prudence, dressed as servants, in lieu of soldiers' drudges; <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> in order that, while the ambassadors were engaged in
                    conference, they might ramble through the camp, one in one direction and another
                    in another, and thus observe all the approaches and outlets, the situation and
                    form both of the camp in general and of its parts; where the Carthaginians lay,
                    where the Numidians, and what was the distance between the camp of Hasdrubal and
                    that of the king; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and that they might at the
                    same time acquaint themselves with their customary mode of stationing outposts
                    and watches, and learn <pb n="1287" xml:id="p.1287"/> whether they were more
                    open to stratagem by night or by day. During the frequent conferences which were
                    held, several different persons were purposely sent, in order that every
                    circumstance might be known to a greater number. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                    /> When the more frequent agitation of the matter had given to Syphax a daily
                    increasing hope of peace, and to the Carthaginians through him, the Roman
                    ambassadors at length declared that they were forbidden to return to their
                        <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> general unless a decisive answer was
                    given, and that, therefore, if his own determination was now fixed, he should
                    declare it, or if Hasdrubal and the Carthaginians were to be consulted, he
                    should consult them. That it was time either that an accommodation should be
                    settled or the war vigorously prosecuted. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    While Hasdrubal was consulted by Syphax, and the Carthaginians by Hasdrubal, the
                    spies had time to inspect every thing, and Scipio to get together what was
                    necessary for the accomplishment of his project. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                    /> In consequence of the mention and prospect of a peace, neglect arose among
                    the Carthaginians and Numidians, as is usually the case, to take precautions in
                    the mean time that they might not suffer an attack of the enemy. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> At length an answer was returned; and as the Romans
                    appeared excessively eager for peace, advantage was taken of that circumstance
                    to add certain unreasonable conditions, which afforded Scipio a very seasonable
                    pretext for putting an end to the truce according to his wishes; and telling the
                    king's messenger that he would refer the matter to his council, he answered him
                    the next day. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He said, that while he alone had
                    in vain endeavoured to restore peace, no one else had desired it. That he must,
                    therefore, carry word back that Syphax must hope for peace on no other condition
                    than his abandonment of the Carthaginians. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Thus he put an end to the truce, in order that he might be free to execute his
                    designs without breaking his faith; and, launching his ships, for it was now the
                    beginning of spring, he put on board machines and engines, with the purpose of
                    assaulting Utica from the sea. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> He also sent
                    two thousand men to seize the eminence which commanded that place, and which he
                    had before occupied, at once with the view of turning the attention of the enemy
                    from the design he was endeavouring <milestone n="12??" unit="section"/> to
                    effect to another object of concern, <pb n="1288" xml:id="p.1288"/> and to
                    prevent any sally or attack which might be made from the city upon his camp,
                    which would be left with a slight force to protect it, while he himself went
                    against Syphax and Hasdrubal. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Having made these preparations, he called a
                    council, and after ordering the spies to give an account of the discoveries they
                    had made, and requesting Masinissa, who was acquainted with every circumstance
                    relating to the enemy, to state what he knew, lastly, he himself laid before the
                    council the plan proposed for the following night. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> He gave directions to the tribunes, that when, after the
                    breaking up of the council, the trumpets had sounded, they should immediately
                    march the legions out of the camp. Agreeably to his commands, the standards
                    began to be carried out about sun-set. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> About
                    the first watch they formed the troops in marching order. At midnight, for it
                    was seven miles' march, they came up at a moderate pace to the camp of the
                    enemy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Here Scipio assigned a part of his
                    forces, together with Masinissa and the Numidians, to Laelius, ordering them to
                    fall upon the camp of Syphax, and throw fire upon it. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Then taking each of the commanders, Masinissa and Laelius,
                    aside, he implored them separately to make up by diligence and care for the
                    absence of that foresight which the night rendered it impossible to exercise.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He said, that he should himself attack
                    Hasdrubal and the Carthaginian camp; but that he should not begin till he saw
                    the fire in that of the king. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Nor did this
                    delay him long; for when the fire thrown upon the nearest huts had taken effect,
                    immediately communicating with all those which were within the shortest
                    distance, and those connected with them in regular succession, it spread itself
                    throughout the whole camp. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The confusion and
                    alarm which took place, in consequence of so widely extended a fire breaking out
                    during the night, were as great as might naturally be expected; but as they
                    concluded that it was the effect of chance, and not produced by the enemy, or
                    connected with the war, they rushed out in a disorderly manner, without their
                    arms, to extinguish the <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> flames, and fell in
                    with armed enemies, particularly the Numidians, who on account of their
                    knowledge of the king's camp were placed by Masinissa in convenient places at
                    the openings of the passes. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Many perished in
                    the <pb n="1289" xml:id="p.1289"/> flames in their beds while half asleep; and
                    many, tumbling over one another in their haste to escape, were trampled to death
                    in the narrow passages of the gates. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When first the Carthaginian sentinels, and
                    afterwards the rest, roused by the terrifying effects of a tumult by night,
                    beheld the light emitted from the flames, they also, labouring under the same
                    delusion, imagined that the fire had originated from accidental causes;
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> while the shout raised amidst the
                    slaughter and wounds, being of a confused kind, prevented their distinguishing
                    whether it was occasioned by the trepidation of an alarm by night. <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> Accordingly, rushing out one and all at every gate,
                    each man taking the nearest road, without their arms, as not suspecting any
                    hostile attack, and carrying with them only such things as might be useful in
                    extinguishing the flames, they fell upon the Roman troops. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> After all these had been slain, not only with the animosity
                    of enemies, but also that no one might escape as a messenger, Scipio immediately
                    attacked the gates, which were unguarded in consequence of the confusion;
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> and, having thrown fire upon the nearest
                    huts, at first the flames blazed forth with great fury, in several places at
                    once, in consequence of the fire having been applied to different parts, but
                    afterwards extending themselves along the contiguous huts, they suddenly
                    enveloped the whole camp in one general conflagration. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Men and cattle scorched with the flames blocked up the
                    passages of the gates, first in a terrible rush to escape, and afterwards with
                    their prostrate bodies. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Those who got out of
                    the way of the fire were cut off by the sword, and the two camps were involved
                    in one common destruction. The two generals, however, and out of so many
                    thousand troops only two thousand foot and five hundred horsemen, escaped, half
                    armed, a great many of them being wounded and scorched. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Forty thousand men were either slain or destroyed by the
                    flames, and above five thousand captured. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Among the captured were many Carthaginian nobles, eleven senators, with a
                    hundred and seventy-four military standards, above two thousand seven hundred
                    Numidian horses, and six elephants. Eight elephants were destroyed either by
                    fire or sword, and a great quantity of arms taken. All the latter the general
                    dedicated to Vulcan and burnt. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Hasdrubal, in his flight, had made for the

                    few attendants; and hither all those who survived, following the footsteps of
                    their general, had betaken themselves. But afterwards, fearing lest he should be
                    given up to Scipio, he quitted that city. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Soon
                    after, the Romans were received there with open gates; nor was any act of
                    hostility committed, because the inhabitants had surrendered voluntarily.
                    Shortly after, two other cities were captured and plundered. The booty found
                    there, together with what had been rescued from the camps when burning, and from
                    the flames, was given up to the soldiers. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Syphax took up a position in a fortified place about eight miles off. Hasdrubal
                    hastened to Carthage, lest the apprehensions occasioned by the recent disaster
                    should lead to any timorous measures. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> So great
                    was the consternation created there on the first receipt of the news, that it
                    was fully anticipated that Scipio, suspending his operations against Utica,
                    would immediately lay siege to Carthage. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The
                    suffetes, therefore, who form with them an authority similar to the consular,
                    summoned the senate, when the three following opinions were given. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> The first proposed, that a decree should be passed to
                    the effect, that ambassadors should be sent to Scipio to treat of peace; the
                    second, that Hannibal should be recalled to defend his country from a war which
                    threatened its annihilation; the third breathed the spirit of Roman constancy
                    under adversity; it recommended that the losses of the army should be repaired,
                    and that Syphax should be exhorted not to abandon the war. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> The latter opinion prevailed, because it was that which
                    Hasdrubal, who was present, and all the members of the Barcine faction,
                    preferred. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> After this, the levy commenced in
                    the city and country, and ambassadors were despatched to Syphax, who was himself
                    employing every effort to restore the war; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> for
                    his wife had prevailed upon him, not, as heretofore, by caresses, powerful as
                    they are in influencing the mind of a lover, but by prayers and appeals to his
                    compassion, imploring him, with streaming eyes, not to betray her father and her
                    country, nor suffer Carthage to be consumed by the same flames which had reduced
                    the camps to ashes. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> In addition to this, the
                    ambassadors informed him of a circumstance which had occurred very seasonably to
                    raise their hopes; that they had met with four thousand Celtiberians in the
                    neighbourhood of a city named Abba, a fine body of young <pb n="1291"
                        xml:id="p.1291"/> men who had been enlisted by their recruiting officers in
                    Spain; and that Hasdrubal would very soon arrive with a body of troops by no
                    means contemptible. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Accordingly, he not only
                    returned a kind answer to the ambassadors, but also showed them a multitude of
                    Numidian rustics, whom he had lately furnished with arms and horses; and at the
                    same time assured them that he would call out all the youth in his kingdom.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He said, he well knew that the loss
                    sustained had been occasioned by fire, and not by battle, and that he was
                    inferior to his adversary in war who was overcome by force of arms. <milestone
                        n="13" unit="section"/> Such was the answer given to the ambassadors; and,
                    after a few days, Hasdrubal and Syphax again united their forces. This army
                    consisted of about thirty-five thousand fighting men. </p>
                <milestone n="8" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Scipio, considering that Syphax and the
                    Carthaginians could make no further efforts, gave his whole attention to the
                    siege of Utica, and was now bringing up his engines to the walls, when he was
                    diverted from his purpose by a report of the renewal of the war; <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> and, leaving small forces merely to keep up the
                    appearence of a siege by sea and land, he set out himself with the main strength
                    of his army to meet the enemy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At first he
                    took up his position on an eminence about five miles distant from the king's
                    camp. The next day, coming down with his cavalry into a place called the great
                    plains, which lay at the foot of that eminence, he spent the day in advancing up
                    to the outposts of the enemy, and provoking them by skirmishing attacks.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> During the ensuing two days, irregular
                    excursions were made by both sides alternately, but nothing worthy of notice was
                    achieved. On the fourth day, both sides came down in battle-array. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> The Romans placed their principes behind the
                    spearmen, which latter formed the front line, and the triarii they stationed in
                    reserve; the Italian cavalry they opposed to the enemy in the right wing, the
                    Numidians and Masinissa on the left. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Syphax
                    and Hasdrubal, placing the Numidians against the Italian cavalry, and the
                    Carthaginians opposite to Masinissa, received the Celtiberians into the centre
                    of their line, to face the Roman legions. Thus arranged, they then commenced the
                    encounter. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> At the first charge, both the
                    wings, the Numidians and Carthaginians, were together driven from their ground;
                    for neither could the Numidians, who consisted principally of rustics, sustain
                        <pb n="1292" xml:id="p.1292"/> the shock of the Roman cavalry, nor the
                    Carthaginians, who were also raw soldiers, withstand Masinissa, who, in addition
                    to other circumstances, was rendered formidable by his recent victory.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The Celtiberian line, though stript of the
                    support of both the wings, stood their ground; for neither did any hope of
                    safety by flight present itself, as they were ignorant of the country, nor could
                    they expect pardon from Scipio, against whom, though he had deserved well both
                    of them and their nation, they had come into Africa to fight for hire.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Surrounded, therefore, on all sides by the
                    enemy, they died with obstinate resolution, falling one upon another; and, while
                    the attention of all was turned upon them, Syphax and Hasdrubal gained a
                    considerable space of time to effect their escape. The victors, fatigued with
                    the slaughter, which had continued for a greater length of time than the battle,
                    were interrupted by the night. </p>
                <milestone n="9" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The next day Scipio sent Laelius and
                    Masinissa, with all the Roman and Numidian cavalry, and the light infantry, to
                    pursue Syphax and Hasdrubal. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He himself, with
                    the main strength of the army, reduced the neighbouring towns, which were all
                    subject to the Carthaginians, some by holding out hopes to them, some by
                    threats, and others by force. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At Carthage,
                    indeed, the consternation was extreme; and it was fully anticipated there, that
                    Scipio, who was carrying his arms to the different places around, would, after
                    having rapidly subdued all the neighbouring parts, suddenly attack Carthage
                    itself. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Their walls were repaired and
                    protected with outworks; and every man individually exerted himself to the
                    utmost in collecting from the country the requisites for holding out against a
                    protracted siege. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Mention was seldom made of
                    peace, but not so seldom of sending deputies to recall Hannibal. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> The majority of them urged that the fleet, which had
                    been equipped to intercept the convoys of the enemy, should be sent to surprise
                    the ships stationed near Utica, which were lying in an unguarded state. It was
                    also urged that they might perhaps overpower the naval camp, which was left

                    chiefly inclined to the latter plan, though they thought, nevertheless, that

                    should the operations of the fleet succeed in the highest degree, the siege of

                    therefore launched the following day, and, at the same time, the deputies set
                    out for Italy; and, their position stimulating them, every thing was done with
                    the greatest expedition; each man considering, that the safety of all was
                    betrayed in whatever degree he remitted his own individual exertions. <milestone

                    with the spoils of many cities, sent his prisoners, and other booty, to his old
                    camp at Utica, and, as his views were now fixed on Carthage, he seized on Tunes,
                    which was abandoned in consequence of the flight of the garrison. <milestone

                    employed in raising a rampart, descried the fleet of the enemy, on its way to
                    Utica from Carthage. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Desisting from their
                    work, therefore, orders for marching were given, and the troops began to move
                    with the utmost haste, lest the ships which were turned towards the land, and
                    occupied with the siege, and which were far from being in a condition for a
                    naval battle, should be surprised and overpowered. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> For how could ships, carrying engines and machines, and
                    either converted to the purposes of transports, or brought up to the walls so as
                    to afford the means of mounting up, in lieu of a mound and bridges, resist a
                    fleet, with nothing to impede its movements, furnished with every kind of naval
                    implement, and prepared for action. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Scipio,
                    therefore, contrary to his usual practice in naval engagements, drew the ships
                    of war, which might have been employed in defending the rest, into the rear, and
                    formed them into a line near the land; opposing to the enemy a row of
                    transports, four deep, to serve as a wall; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    and, lest these same transports should be thrown into disorder during the
                    confusion of the battle, he bound them together by placing masts and yard-arms
                    across them, from one vessel to the other; and, by means of strong ropes,
                    fastened them together, as it were, by one uninterrupted bond. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> He also laid planks upon them, so as to form a free passage
                    along the line, leaving spaces under these bridges of communication by which the
                        <pb n="1294" xml:id="p.1294"/> vessels of observation might run out towards
                    the enemy, and retreat with safety. Having hastily made these arrangements, as
                    well as the time would permit, he put on board the transports about a thousand
                    picked men, to keep off <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> the enemy, with a
                    very large store of weapons, particularly missiles, that they might hold out,
                    however long the contest lasted. Thus prepared, and on the watch, they waited
                    the approach of the enemy. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The Carthaginians,
                    who, if they had made haste, would, on the first assault, have surprised their
                    adversaries while every thing was in a state of confusion, from the hurry and
                    bustle attending the preparations, were so dismayed at their losses by land, and
                    thereby <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> had lost so much confidence even in
                    their strength by sea, in which they had the advantage, that, after consuming
                    the day, in consequence of the slow rate at which they sailed, about sun-set
                    they put in to a harbour which the Africans call Ruscino. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> The following day, at sun-rise, they drew up their ships
                    towards the open sea, as for a regular naval battle, and with the expectation
                    that the Romans would come out to engage them. <milestone n="11" unit="section"
                    /> After they had continued stationary for some time, and saw that no movement
                    was made on the part of the enemy, then, at length, they attacked the
                    transports. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The affair bore no resemblance to
                    a naval fight, but rather had the appearance of ships attacking walls. The
                    transports had considerably the advantage in respect of height; <milestone
                        n="13" unit="section"/> and as the Carthaginians had to throw their weapons
                    upward, against a mark which was above them, most of them failed of taking
                    effect; while the weapons thrown from the transports from above fell with

                    lighter kind of barks, which went out through the spaces left under the
                    flooring, which formed a communication between the ships, were at first run down
                    by the mere momentum and bulk of the ships of war; <milestone n="15"
                        unit="section"/> and afterwards they proved a hinderance to the troops
                    appointed to keep the enemy off; for as they mixed with the ships of the enemy,
                    they were frequently under the necessity of withholding their weapons for fear,
                    by a misdirected effort, they <milestone n="16??" unit="section"/> should fall
                    on their friends. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> At length, beams with iron
                    hooks at their ends, called harpoons, began to be thrown from the Carthaginian
                    upon the Roman ships; and, as they could not cut the harpoons themselves, <pb
                        n="1295" xml:id="p.1295"/> nor the chains suspended by which they were
                    thrown upon their ships, as each of the ships of war of the enemy, being pulled
                        <milestone n="18??" unit="section"/> back, drew with it a transport,
                    connected with it by a harpoon, you might see the fastenings by which the
                    transports were joined together rent asunder, and in another part a series of
                    many vessels dragged away together. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> In this
                    manner chiefly were all the bridges of communication torn to pieces, and
                    scarcely had the troops who fought in front time to leap to the second line of
                    ships. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> About six transports were towed away
                    to Carthage, where the joy felt was greater than the occasion warranted; but
                    their delight was increased from the reflection, that, in the midst of so many
                    successive disasters and woes, one event, however trifling, which afforded
                    matter of joy, had unexpectedly occurred; <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                    besides which, it was manifest that the Roman fleet would have been well nigh
                    annihilated, had not their own commanders been wanting in diligence, and had not
                    Scipio come up to its assistance in time. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> It happened about the same time, that Laelius
                    and Masinissa having arrived in Numidia after a march of about fifteen days, the
                    Massylians, Masinissa's hereditary kingdom, placed themselves under the
                    protection of their king with the greatest joy, as they had long wished him
                    among them. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> After the commanders and garrisons
                    of Syphax had been expelled from thence, that prince kept himself within the
                    limits of his original dominions, but without any intention of remaining quiet.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Subdued by the power of love, he was
                    spurred on by his wife and father-in-law; and he possessed such an abundance of
                    men and horses, that a review of the resources of his kingdom, which had
                    flourished for so many years, was calculated to infuse spirit into a mind even
                    less barbarous and impetuous than his. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Wherefore, collecting together all who were fit for service, he distributed
                    among them horses, armour, and weapons. He divided his horsemen into troops, and
                    his infantry into cohorts, as he had formerly learnt from the Roman centurions.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> With an army not less than that which he
                    had before, but almost entirely raw and undisciplined, he set out to meet the
                    enemy, and pitched his camp at a short distance from them. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> At first a few horsemen advanced cautiously from the
                    outposts to reconnoitre, and being compelled to retire, from a discharge of
                    javelins, they ran <pb n="1296" xml:id="p.1296"/> back to their friends. Then
                    skirmishing parties were sent out from both sides, and the vanquished, fired
                    with indignation, returned to the encounter with increased numbers. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> This is the usual incitement of battles between
                    cavalry, when the victors are joined by more of their party from hope, and the
                    vanquished from resentment. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Thus, on the
                    present occasion, the action commencing with a few, at last the whole body of
                    the cavalry on both sides poured out to join in it, from the zeal excited by the
                    contest. While the cavalry only were engaged, it was scarcely possible to
                    withstand the numbers of the Masaesylians, which Syphax sent out in immense
                    bodies. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But afterwards, when the Roman
                    infantry, suddenly coming up between the troops of horse which made way for
                    them, gave stability to their line, and checked the enemy, who were charging
                    furiously, at first the barbarians slackened their speed, then halted, and were
                    in a manner confounded at this novel kind of battle. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> At length, they not only retired before the infantry, but
                    were unable to sustain the shock even of the cavalry, who had assumed courage
                    from the support of the infantry. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> By this
                    time the legions also were approaching; when, indeed, the Masaesylians not only
                    dared not await their first charge, but could not bear even the sight of the
                    standards and arms; so powerful was either the recollection of their former
                    defeats, or their present fears. </p>

                    to danger, he could stop their flight, being thrown from his horse, which was
                    severely wounded, was overpowered, and being made prisoner, was dragged alive
                    into the presence of Laelius; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> a spectacle
                    calculated to afford peculiar satisfaction to Masinissa. <milestone n="2"

                    a great number of men fled. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The number of the
                    slain in this battle was not so great as the victory was important, because the
                    cavalry only had been engaged. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Not more than
                    five thousand were slain, and less than half that number were made prisoners in
                    an attack upon the camp, to which the multitude, dismayed at the loss of their
                    king, had fled. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Masinissa declared that
                    nothing could be more highly gratifying to him than, having gained this victory,
                    to go now and visit his hereditary dominions, <pb n="1297" xml:id="p.1297"/>
                    which he had regained after having been kept out of them so long a time; but it
                    was not proper in prosperity any more than in adversity to lose any time.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> That if Laelius would allow him to go
                    before him to Cirta with the cavalry and the captive Syphax, he should overpower
                    the enemy while all was in a state of consternation and dismay; and that Laelius
                    might follow with the infantry at a moderate rate. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Laelius assenting, he advanced to Cirta, and ordered the
                    principal inhabitants to be called out to a conference. But as they were not
                    aware of what had befallen their king, he was unable to prevail upon them,
                    either by laying before them what had passed, by threats, or by persuasion,
                    until the king was presented to their view in chains. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> A general lamentation arose at this shocking exhibition,
                    and while some deserted the walls in a panic, others, who sought to ingratiate
                    themselves with the victor, suddenly came to an agreement to throw open the
                    gates. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Masinissa, having sent troops to keep
                    guard near the gates, and at such parts of the wall as required it, that no one

                    distinguished both by his arms and also by his habiliments, she concluded, as
                    was really the case, that he was the king; and, falling down at his knees, thus

                    His accusations against Masinissa derived credibility from the fact of the

                    of arms, without consulting or waiting for Laelius, and with such precipitate
                    haste, that on the very day on which he saw the captive enemy he united himself
                    with her in matrimony, and performed the nuptial rite in the presence of the
                    household gods of his enemy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This conduct
                    appeared the more heinous to Scipio, because when a very young man in Spain he
                    had not allowed himself to be influenced by the beauty of any captive. While

                    received them both with a cheerful countenance, and having bestowed upon them
                    the highest commendations before a full assembly of his officers, he took
                    Masinissa aside and thus addressed him: <quote> I suppose, Masinissa, that it

                    nor would the line of the enemy have stood unbroken, had not Mago, as soon as he
                    saw the cavalry in motion, immediately brought into the action his elephants,
                    which he kept in readiness. The horses were so terrified at the snorting, the
                    smell, and appearance of these animals, that the aid of the cavalry was rendered
                    ineffectual. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As the Roman horseman had the

                    which they threw upon them failed of taking effect, as they were close together,

                    in his thigh, which was transfixed, and carried off the field almost lifeless,

                    he, after slaying a hundred thousand fighting men at Trasimenus and Cannae, had
                    suffered his strength to wear away around Casilinum, Cumae, and Nola, Amid these

                    Rome that both Mago and Hannibal had taken their departure. But the delight
                    occasioned by this twofold source of joy was diminished by the reflection that
                    their commanders had wanted either spirit or strength sufficient to detain them,
                    for they had been charged by the senate to do so; <milestone n="2"

                    of one general and his army. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> About the same

                    They laid down in the vestibule of the senate-house two hundred and fifty

                    besides, presents and ships to convey them back into Spain. Some of the older
                    senators then observed, that men were less powerfully affected by prosperity
                    than adversity. That they themselves remembered what terror and consternation
                    had been occasioned by the passage of Hannibal into Italy; what disasters and
                    what lamentations had followed that event. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    When the camp of the enemy was seen from their walls, what vows were poured

                    a present blessing so ungratefully, they would not be very mindful of it when it

                    declared, that he had not only crossed the Alps, but the Iberus also, without

                    previously on the Saguntines also, on his own individual responsibility.

                    removed out of the senate-house, the senators began to be asked their opinions.
                    Marcus Livius recommended, that Caius Servilius, the consul nearest home, should
                    be sent for, that he might be present at the proceedings relative to the peace;
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> for as it was impossible that any subject

                    and had filled the office of dictator, said that, since Publius Scipio, by
                    destroying the armies and by devastating the lands of the enemy, had reduced
                    them to such a state that they were compelled as supplicants to sue for peace;
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> and as no one could estimate with more
                    truth the intentions with which it was solicited, than he who was prosecuting
                    the war before the gates of Carthage; the peace should be rejected or adopted on
                    the advice of none other than Scipio. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Marcus
                    Valerius Laevinus, who had been twice consul, endeavoured to show that those who
                    had come were spies, and not ambassadors; that they ought to be ordered to
                    depart from Italy; that guards should be sent with them to their very ships, and
                    that Scipio should be written to not to relax in prosecuting the war. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> Laelius and Fulvius added, that Scipio had grounded
                    his hopes of effecting a peace on Hannibal and Mago not being recalled from
                    Italy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He considered that the Carthaginians
                    would practise every species of dissimulation, in expectation of the arrival of
                    those generals and their armies, and then, forgetful of all treaties, however
                    recent, and all gods, would proceed with the war. For these reasons they were
                    the more disposed to adopt the opinion of Levinus. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The ambassadors were dismissed without having accomplished

                    not heed his letter, Publius Sulpicius, who was created dictator for this very

                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The remainder of the year he employed in

                    During the time of the truce, Lentulus the praetor sent over into Africa, from

                    until he arrived almost within sight of Africa, at first the wind dropped, but
                    afterwards changing to the south-west, it dispersed his ships in every
                    direction. He himself with the ships of war, having struggled through the
                    opposing billows by the extraordinary exertions of his rowers, made the

                        unit="section"/> the rest were driven on shore directly opposite the city,
                    near the warm baths. The whole occurrence was within sight of Carthage, and,

                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The magistrates summoned the senate, and
                    the people were yelling in the vestibule of the senate-house, lest so great a

                    an assembly, made up almost of a mixture of the senate and people, that

                        unit="section"/> Scipio, therefore, considering that the malignity of their
                    offence was heightened by the fact, that, though they had solicited peace and a

                    immediately despatched Lucius Baebius, Lucius Sergius, and Lucius Fabius, as

                    Carthaginian fleet was stationed at Utica, and from this three quadriremes were
                    despatched, which suddenly attacked the Roman quinquereme from the main sea,
                    while doubling the promontory, either owing to a message sent from Carthage that
                    this should be done, or that Hasdrubal, who commanded the fleet, perpetrated the

                    neither could they strike it with their beaks from the rapidity with which it

                    All the tribes nominated Publius Scipio. Nevertheless, the consuls put the

                    the coast of Sicily with twenty men of war, and a thousand soldiers; and Marcus

                    their anxiety and fears were further increased from the circumstance, that,
                    whereas they had been accustomed to carry on war for several years, in different
                    parts of Italy, and within their view, with languid hopes, and without the
                    prospect of bringing it to a speedy termination, Scipio and Hannibal had
                    stimulated the minds of all, as generals prepared for a final contest.

                    defeated in a pitched battle, that Syphax had been made prisoner, that they had
                    been driven out of Spain and Italy, and that all this had been effected by the
                    valour and conduct of Scipio alone, they regarded him with horror, as a general

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Hannibal had by this time arrived at
                    Adrumetum; <pb n="1318" xml:id="p.1318"/> from which place, after employing a
                    few days there in refreshing his soldiers, who had suffered from the motion by
                    sea, he proceeded by forced marches to Zama, roused by the alarming statements
                    of messengers, who brought word, that all the country around Carthage was filled
                    with armed troops. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Zama is distant from
                    Carthage a five days' journey. Some spies, whom he sent out from this place,
                    being intercepted by the Roman guard, and brought before Scipio, he directed
                    that they should be handed over to the military tribunes, and, after having been
                    desired fearlessly to survey every thing, to be conducted through the camp
                    wherever they chose; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> then, asking them whether
                    they had examined every thing to their satisfaction, he assigned them an escort,
                    and sent them back to Hannibal. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Hannibal
                    received none of the circumstances which were reported to him with feelings of
                    joy; for they brought word that, as it happened, Masinissa had joined the enemy
                    that very day, with six thousand infantry and four thousand horse; but he was
                    principally dispirited by the confidence of his enemy, which, doubtless, was not
                    conceived without some ground. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Accordingly,
                    though he himself was the originator of the war, and by his coming had upset the
                    truce which had been entered into, and cut off all hopes of a treaty, yet
                    concluding that more favourable terms might be obtained if he solicited peace
                    while his strength was unimpaired, than when vanquished, he sent a message to
                    Scipio, requesting permission to confer with him. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> I have no means of affirming whether he did this on his own

                        unit="section"/> Valerius Antias says, that after having been beaten by
                    Scipio in a battle, in which twelve thousand armed men were slain, and one
                    thousand seven hundred made prisoners, he came himself with ten other deputies
                    into the camp to Scipio. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> However, as Scipio
                    did not decline the proposal for a conference, both the generals, by concert,
                    brought their camps forward in order to facilitate their meeting by shortening
                    the distance. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Scipio took up his position not
                    far from the city Naragara, in a situation convenient not only for other
                    purposes, but also because there was a watering place within a dart's throw.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Hannibal took possession of an eminence
                    four miles thence, safe and convenient in every respect, except that he had a

                        command when you had scarcely yet attained the military age, though all your
                        enterprises were of the boldest description, in no instance has fortune
                        deserted you. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Avenging the death of your
                        father and uncle, you have derived from the calamity of your house the high
                        honour of distinguished valour and filial duty. You have recovered Spain,
                        which had been lost, after driving thence four Carthaginian armies.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> When elected consul, though all
                        others wanted courage to defend Italy, you crossed over into Africa; where
                        having cut to pieces two armies, having at once captured and burnt two camps
                        in the same hour; having made prisoner Syphax, a most powerful king, and
                        seized so many towns of his dominions and so many of ours, you have dragged
                        me from Italy, the possession of which I had firmly held for now sixteen
                        years. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Your mind, I say, may possibly be
                        more disposed to conquest than peace. I know the spirits of your country aim

                        me, too, a similar fortune once shone. But if with prosperity the gods would
                        also bestow upon us sound judgment, we should not only consider those things
                        which have happened, but those also which may occur. Even if you should
                        forget all others, I am myself a sufficient instance of every vicissitude of
                        fortune. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> For me, whom a little while ago
                        you saw advancing my standards to the walls of Rome, after pitching my camp
                        between the Anio and your city, you now behold here, bereft of my two
                        brothers, men of consummate bravery, and most renowned generals, standing
                        before the walls of my native <pb n="1321" xml:id="p.1321"/> city, which is
                        all but besieged, and deprecating, in behalf of my own city, those
                        severities with which I terrified yours. In all cases, the most prosperous
                        fortune is least to be depended upon. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                        While your affairs are in a favourable and ours in a dubious state, you
                        would derive honour and splendour from granting peace; while to us who
                        solicit it, it would be considered as necessary rather than honourable. A
                        certain peace is better and safer than a victory in prospect; the former is
                        at your own disposal, the latter depends upon the gods. <milestone n="19"

                        consider your own strength, then also place before your view the power of
                        fortune, and the fluctuating nature of war. On both sides there will be
                        arms, on both sides human bodies. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> In
                        nothing less than in war do events correspond (with men's calculations).
                        Should you be victorious in a battle, you will not add so much to that
                        renown which you now have it in your power to acquire by granting peace, as
                        you will detract from it should any adverse event befall you. The chance of
                        a single hour may at once overturn the honours you have acquired and those
                        you anticipate. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> Every thing is at your
                        own disposal in adjusting a peace; but, in the other case, you must be
                        content with that fortune which the gods shall impose upon you. <milestone
                            n="23" unit="section"/> Formerly, in this same country, Marcus Atilius
                        would have formed one among the few instances of good fortune and valour,
                        if, when victorious, he had granted a peace to our fathers when they
                        requested it; but by not setting any bounds to his success, and not checking
                        good fortune, which was elating him, he fell with a degree of ignominy
                        proportioned to his elevation. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> It is
                        indeed the right of him who grants, and not of him who solicits it, to

                        upon ourselves the fine. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> We do not refuse
                        that all those possessions on account of which the war was begun should be

                        both by sea and land. <milestone n="27" unit="section"/> I cannot deny that
                        you have reason to suspect the Carthaginian faith, in consequence of their
                        insincerity lately in soliciting a peace and while awaiting the decision.
                            <pb n="1322" xml:id="p.1322"/> The sincerity with which a peace will be
                        observed, depends much, Scipio, on the person by whom it is sought.
                            <milestone n="28" unit="section"/> Your senate, as I hear, refused to
                        grant a peace in some measure because the deputies were deficient in

                        now solicit peace; who would neither ask for it unless I believed it
                        expedient, nor will I fail to observe it for the same reason of expedience
                        on account of which I have solicited it. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>
                        And in the same manner as I, because the war was commenced by me, brought it
                        to pass that no one regretted it till the gods began to regard me with
                        displeasure; so will I also exert myself that no one may regret the peace
                        procured by my means. </quote>

                        they may not receive, as the reward of their perfidy, the concessions which
                        they formerly stipulated, by expunging them now from the conditions of the

                    Different grounds of hope and fear were represented to different persons.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The view of the Carthaginians was
                    directed to the walls of their city, their household gods, the sepulchres of
                    their ancestors, their children and parents, and their trembling wives; they
                    were told, that either the destruction of their city and slavery or the empire
                    of the world awaited them; that there was nothing intermediate which they could
                    hope for or fear. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> While the general was thus
                    busily employed among the Carthaginians, and the captains of the respective
                    nations among their countrymen, most of them employing interpreters among troops
                    intermixed with those of different nations, the trumpets and cornets of the
                    Romans sounded; and such a clamour arose, that the elephants, especially those
                    in the left wing, turned round upon their own party, the Moors and Numidians.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Masinissa had no difficulty in increasing
                    the alarm of the terrified enemy, and deprived them of the aid of their cavalry
                    in that wing. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> A few, however, of the beasts
                    which were driven against the <pb n="1326" xml:id="p.1326"/> enemy, and were not
                    turned back through fear, made great havoc among the ranks of the velites,
                    though not without receiving many wounds themselves; <milestone n="15"
                        unit="section"/> for when the velites, retiring to the companies, had made
                    way for the elephants, that they might not be trampled down, they discharged
                    their darts at them, exposed as they were to wounds on both sides, those in the
                    van also keeping up a continual discharge of javelins; until, driven out of the
                    Roman line by the weapons which fell upon them from all quarters, these
                    elephants also put to flight even the cavalry of the Carthaginians posted in
                    their right wing. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Laelius, when he saw the
                    enemy in disorder, struck additional terror into them in their confusion. </p>
                <milestone n="34" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The Carthaginian line was deprived of the
                    cavalry on both sides, when the infantry, who were now not a match for the
                    Romans in confidence or strength, engaged. In addition to this there was one
                    circumstance, trifling in itself, but at the same time producing important
                    consequences in the action. On the part of the Romans the shout was uniform, and
                    on that account louder and more terrific; while the voices of the enemy,
                    consisting as they did of many nations of different languages, were dissonant.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The Romans used the stationary kind of
                    fight, pressing upon the enemy with their own weight and that of their arms; but
                    on the other side there was more of skirmishing and rapid movement than force.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Accordingly, on the first charge, the
                    Romans immediately drove back the line of their opponents; <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> then pushing them with their elbows and the bosses of their
                    shields, and pressing forward into the places from which they had pushed them,
                    they advanced a considerable space, as though there had been no one to resist
                    them, those who formed the rear urging forward those in front when they
                    perceived the line of the enemy giving way; which circumstance itself gave great
                    additional force in repelling them. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> On the
                    side of the enemy, the second line, consisting of the Africans and
                    Carthaginians, were so far from supporting the first line when giving ground,
                    that, on the contrary, they even retired, lest their enemy, by slaying those who
                    made a firm resistance, should penetrate to themselves also. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Accordingly, the auxiliaries suddenly turned their backs,
                    and facing about upon their own party, fled, some of them into the second line,
                    while others slew <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> those who did not receive
                    them into their ranks, since before they did not <pb n="1327" xml:id="p.1327"/>
                    support them, and now refused to receive them. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    And now there were, in a manner, two contests going on together, the
                    Carthaginians being compelled to fight at once with the enemy and with their own
                    party. Not even then, however, did they receive into their line the terrified
                    and exasperated troops; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> but, closing their
                    ranks, drove them out of the scene of action to the wings and the surrounding
                    plain, lest they should mingle these soldiers, terrified with defeat and wounds,
                    with that part of their line which was firm and fresh. But such a heap of men
                    and arms had filled the space in which the auxiliaries a little while ago had
                    stood, that it was almost more difficult to pass through it than through a close
                    line of troops. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The spearmen, therefore, who
                    formed the front line, pursuing the enemy as each could find a way through the
                    heap of arms and men, and streams of blood, threw into complete disorder the
                    battalions and companies. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The standards also
                    of the principes had begun to waver when they saw the line before them driven
                    from their ground. Scipio, perceiving this, promptly ordered the signal to be
                    given for the spearmen to retreat, and, having taken his wounded into the rear,
                    brought the principes and triarii to the wings, in order that the line of
                    spearmen in the centre might be more strong and secure. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> Thus a fresh and renewed battle commenced, inasmuch as they
                    had penetrated to their real antagonists, men equal to them in the nature of
                    their arms, in their experience in war, in the fame of their achievements, and
                    the greatness of their hopes and fears. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> But
                    the Romans were superior both in numbers and courage, for they had now routed
                    both the cavalry and the elephants, and having already defeated the front line,
                    were fighting against the second. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Laelius and Masinissa, who had pursued the
                    routed cavalry through a considerable space, returning very opportunely, charged
                    the rear of the enemy's line. This attack of the cavalry at length routed them.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Many of them, being surrounded, were slain
                    in the field; and many, dispersed in flight through the open plain around, were
                    slain on all hands, as the cavalry were in possession of every part. Of the
                    Carthaginians and their allies, above twenty thousand were slain on that day;
                    about an equal number were captured, with a hundred and thirty-three military
                    standards, and eleven elephants. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Of the
                    victors as many as two thousand fell. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Han- <pb

                    expedient both in the battle and before the engagement; having, according to the
                    admission of Scipio, and every one skilled in military science, acquired the
                    fame of having marshalled his troops on that day with singular judgment.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He placed his elephants in the front, in
                    order that their desultory attack, and insupportable violence, might prevent the
                    Romans from following their standards, and preserving their ranks, on which they
                    placed their principal dependence. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Then he
                    posted his auxiliaries before the line of Carthaginians, in order that men who
                    were made up of the refuse <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> of all nations,
                    and who were not bound by honour but by gain, might not have any retreat open to
                    them in case they fled; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> at the same time that
                    the first ardour and impetuosity might be exhausted upon them, and, if they
                    could render no other service, that the weapons of the enemy might be blunted in
                    wounding them. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Next he placed the Carthaginian
                    and African soldiers, on whom he placed all his hopes, in order that, being
                    equal to the enemy in every other respect, they might have the advantage of
                    them, inasmuch as, being fresh and unimpaired in strength themselves, they would
                    fight with those who were fatigued and wounded. The Italians he removed into the
                    rear, separating them also by an intervening space, as he knew not, with
                    certainty, whether they were friends or enemies. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> Hannibal, after performing this as it were his last work of
                    valour, fled to Adrumetum, whence, having been summoned to Carthage, he returned
                    thither in the six and thirtieth year after he had left it when a boy;
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> and confessed in the senate-house that he
                    was defeated, not only in the battle, but in the war, and that there was no hope
                    of safety in any thing but in obtaining peace. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Immediately after the battle, Scipio, having
                    taken and plundered the enemy's camp, returned to the sea and his ships, with an
                    immense booty, news having reached <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> him that
                    Publius Lentulus had arrived at Utica with fifty men of war, and a hundred
                    transports laden with every kind of stores. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Concluding that he ought to bring before Carthage every thing which could
                    increase the consternation already existing there, after sending Laelius to Rome
                    to report his victory, he ordered Cneius Octavius to conduct the legions thither
                    by land; and, setting out himself from Utica with the fresh fleet of Lentulus,

                    of Carthage. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When he had arrived within a
                    short distance, he was met by a Carthaginian ship decked with fillets and
                    branches of olive. There were ten deputies, the leading men in the state, sent
                    at the instance of Hannibal to solicit peace; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    to whom, when they had come up to the stern of the general's ship, holding out
                    the badges of suppliants, entreating and imploring the protection and compassion
                    of Scipio, the only answer given was, that they must come to Tunes, to which
                    place he would move his camp. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> After taking a
                    view of the site of Carthage, not so much for the sake of acquainting himself
                    with it for any present object, as to dispirit the enemy, he returned to Utica,
                    having recalled Octavius to the same place. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As
                    they were proceeding thence to Tunes, they received intelligence that Vermina,
                    the son of Syphax, with a greater number of horse than foot, was coming to the
                    assistance of the Carthaginians. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A part of his
                    infantry, with all the cavalry, having attacked them on their march on the first
                    day of the Saturnalia, routed the Numidians with little opposition; and as every
                    way by which they could escape in flight was blocked up, for the cavalry
                    surrounded them on all sides, fifteen thousand men were slain, twelve hundred
                    were taken alive, with fifteen hundred Numidian horses, and seventy-two military
                    standards. The prince himself fled from the field with a few attendants during
                    the confusion. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The camp was then pitched near
                    Tunes in the same place as before, and thirty ambassadors came to Scipio from
                    Carthage. These behaved in a manner even more calculated to excite compassion
                    than the former, in proportion as their situation was more pressing; but from
                    the recollection of their recent perfidy, they were heard with considerably less

                        That they should furnish corn, and pay for the auxiliaries until the

                    were at once indisposed for peace and unfit for war, Hannibal, indignant that

                    at such a juncture, laid hold of Gisgo with his own hand, and dragged him from

                    among the people, the soldier, disconcerted at the liberties which the citizens
                    took, thus addressed them: <quote> Having left you when nine years old, I have

                    Having thus apologized for his indiscretion, he discoursed largely concerning

                    Antiochus; and that when Scipio demanded above every thing that Hannibal should

                    Tiberius Claudius was directed to conduct the fleet with speed into Sicily, and
                    cross over from that place into Africa. The other consul, Marcus Servilius, was
                    directed to stay at the city until the state of affairs in Africa was

                    proceeded slowly with every thing connected with the equipment and sailing of

                    according to the custom handed down by tradition, was expiated by a nine days'

                    Thus the Carthaginians, being allowed to depart from Rome, when they had gone

                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> They delivered up their men-of-war, their

                    is said that Hannibal was observed laughing; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    and when Hasdrubal Haedus rebuked him for laughing amid the public grief, when
                    he himself was the occasion of the tears which were shed, he said: <quote> If,
                        as the expression of the countenance is discerned by the sight, so the

                        to you that that laughter which you censure came from a heart not elated

                        And yet it is not so ill-timed as those absurd and inconsistent tears of

                    manner as Felix was applied to Sulla, and Magnus to Pompey, in the memory of our
