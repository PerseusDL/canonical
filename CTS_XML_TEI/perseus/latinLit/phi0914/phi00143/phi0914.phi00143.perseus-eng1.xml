                        practice was to plunder a city which had been stormed, and spare one which
                        surrendered (XXXVII. xxxii. 12). </note> to entice the dwellers in the
                    walled city of Carnuns. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> After he had been
                    unable either to induce them to surrender or to capture them by blockade, in
                    order that his soldiery might not be worn out by two sieges and gain nothing, he
                    plundered the city which he had previously left untouched. </p>

                        The active sector of his province of Italy (XLII. xxxii. 4). </note> which
                    had fallen to his lot, and made a vain attempt to lead his legions through
                    Illyricum into Macedonia. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The consul's venture
                    on this journey became known to the senate through an <pb n="p.5"/> embassy from
                    Aquileia, which complained that their <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 171</note> colony was new <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified">It had been founded ten years before, cf. XL. xxxiv.
                        2.</note> and weak and had been as yet insufficiently fortified against the
                    surrounding hostile tribes of Histrians and Illyrians; <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> on their requesting that the senate should concern itself
                    with means for fortifying this colony, they were asked if they wished this
                    matter to be entrusted to Gaius Cassius the consul, but replied that Cassius,
                    having mustered his army at Aquileia, had set out through Illyricum for
                    Macedonia. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This report seemed unbelievable at
                    first, and the senators each thought to himself that perhaps a campaign against
                    the Carnians or Histrians had been begun. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Then
                    the envoys from Aquileia said that they knew and dared assert nothing more than
                    that thirty days' grain had been issued to the soldiery, and that guides who
                    knew the roads from Italy into Macedonia had been sought out and taken along.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Then indeed the senate was incensed that
                    the consul had such effrontery as to leave his own district, trespass upon his
                    colleague's, lead his army by a dangerous, untried route <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified"> Cassius would either have had to traverse
                        uninterruptedly mountainous country, as he followed the coast, or to go far
                        inland, approximately to the line of the modern railway to Saloniki, as
                        Philip planned for the Bastarnae; but these would have been aided by
                        friendly tribes, whereas Cassius would have been beyond aid. The Romans had
                        always used the short sea-route from Brundisium to Illyricum and Greece,
                        little as they liked seafaring. </note> among foreign peoples, and leave
                    open to so many tribes the way into Italy. <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified"> The most recent threat from this direction had been in
                        186- <date when="-0183">183 B.C.</date> , cf. XXXIX. xxii. 6, xlv. 6-7, liv,
                        though the Transalpine Gauls who had moved in near Aquileia had acted
                        peaceably enough. Cf. the plans of Philip for an invasion of Italy by the
                        Bastarnae, XL. lvii. </note>
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> A full senate decreed that the praetor Gaius
                    Sulpicius should name three envoys from among the senators, who should that very
                    day set out from the city and with all possible speed overtake the consul
                    Cassius, wherever he might be; <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> they were to
                    declare to him that he must not engage in war with any people unless <pb n="p.7"
                    /> the senate had determined on war against them. <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified"> Strictly speaking, both the senate and the people had
                        to approve the undertaking of a war; cf. the condemnations of similar
                        unauthorized forays in XXXVIII. xlv. 5 and XLI. vii. 7-8. </note>
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 171</note> The
                    following envoys set out: Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, Marcus Fulvius, Publius
                    Marcius Rex. Fear for the consul and his army displaced for the present any
                    consideration of fortifying Aquileia. </p>

                    <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Next, envoys of several peoples from each of
                    the Spains were presented to the senate. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> After
                    complaining of the greed and arrogance of Roman officials, <note anchored="true"

                        time, cf. below, vii-viii. </note> they begged of the senate on bended knees
                    that it would not permit them, its allies, to be more wretchedly despoiled and
                    harassed than its enemies. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Since they
                    complained of other acts of injustice also and it was in fact obvious that money
                    had been extorted, the task was assigned to the praetor Lucius Canuleius, to
                    whom Spain <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The two provinces

                    envoys, who had been summoned to the senate-house, and they were ordered to name
                    their advocates. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They named four, Marcus <pb

                    grain, nor compel the Spaniards to sell their five-per-cent quotas <note

                        in order to help maintain the flow of grain to Italy. Whereas in Sicily
                        tithes of grain constituted a tax traditional in the region and continued by

                        the Romans as overlords seems to have been in money, or perhaps in precious

                    Aetolian territory; thence on the second day they arrived at Stratus. <milestone

                    River, Perseus expected the Aetolians to come streaming out of every gate to put
                    themselves under his protection, he found that the gates were closed and that on
                    the very night when he had arrived a Roman garrison, under the staff-officer
                    Gaius Popilius, had been received. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The leading
                    men, driven by the influence of Archidamus while he was there, had summoned the
                    king, but had become less active when Archidamus had gone out to meet Perseus,
                    and had given an opportunity to the opposing party of summoning Popilius with a
                    thousand infantry from Ambracia. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Cf.

                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Just in time, too, came Dinarchus, the chief
                    of cavalry <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> This officer was second in
                        command of the Aetolian League, cf. XXXVIII. xi. 7. </note> of the Aetolian
                    League, with six hundred infantry and a hundred cavalry. It was well known that
                    he had come to Stratus as if on his way to Perseus, but then, changing his mind
                    with his <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> luck, had joined the Romans,
                    against whom he had come. Popilius, for his part, was not more off his guard
                    than he should have been, considering the fickle temperaments which encompassed
                    him. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He at once took control of the keys of
                    the gates and the guarding of the walls, and removed to the citadel, ostensibly
                    as <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> its garrison, Dinarchus and his
                    Aetolians, along with the young men of Stratus. <milestone n="8" unit="section"

                    distance with missiles, pitched his camp five miles from the city across the
                    river Petitarus. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> There he called a council
                    and, although Archidamus and the Epirote deserters tried to keep him where he
                    was, when the leading Macedonians were of the opinion that he should not fight
                    against the unfavourable season of the year without having arranged for
                    supplies, since the <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> blockaders were bound
                    to feel the want of them before the blockaded, especially when winter-quarters
                    of the enemy were not far distant, Perseus in fear moved his camp into
                    Aperantia. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Taken by the Aetolians

                    regard for Archidamus and his influence with that people, by general agreement
                    received Perseus; Archidamus himself, with a garrison of eight hundred men, was
                    put in charge of the city. </p>

                    when he had come, the king returned to Macedonia; Appius, however, was drawn
                    away from the siege of Phanote by the report that Perseus was marching on
                    Stratus. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Cleuas, following with a force of
                    vigorous young men beneath the almost impassable spurs of the mountains, killed
                    about a thousand men of the burdened column and captured about two hundred.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> After passing over the narrows, Appius
                    remained in camp a few days in the plain which they call Meleon. Meanwhile
                    Cleuas, taking along Philostratus, who had five hundred of the Epirote people,
                    crossed over to the territory of <pb n="p.83"/> Antigonea. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> The Macedonians set out to plunder; <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 169</note> Philostratus with his
                    detachment settled down in ambush in a hidden spot. When armed men sallied forth
                    from Antigonea against the scattered plunderers, as they pursued in too open
                    order after these fugitives, they burst into the valley ambushed by the enemy.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> After the killing there of about a
                    thousand and the capturing of nearly a hundred, the campaign was successfully
                    conducted everywhere, and they moved their camp near the settled camp of Appius,
                    so that no violence might be inflicted by the Roman army on their allies.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Appius, who was wasting time to no purpose
                    in these parts, after sending away the forces of Chaonians, The sprotians and
                    whatever other Epirotes there were, retired to Illyricum with his Italian
                    soldiers, divided his men in winter-quarters among the allied cities of the
                    Parthini, and himself returned to Rome to offer sacrifices. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> Perseus sent to Cassandrea to act as its garrison a
                    thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry recalled from the people of the
                    Penestae. The envoys returned from Gentius with the same reply. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> On the one hand, Perseus did not cease thereafter to make
                    overtures to him by sending embassy after embassy, and, on the other hand,
                    although it was obvious how much reinforcement Gentius could provide, yet he
                    could not induce himself to incur expense for a matter of the greatest
                    importance in every respect. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Cf.
