                        Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, the censor, spoiled the temple of Juno at La-
cinium of the marble tiles, to roof a temple which he was dedicating.
The tiles were returned by a decree of the senate. Eumenes, the king of
Asia, complained before the senate of Perseus, the king of Macedon; the
outrages of the latter are laid before the Roman people. And when a
war was proclaimed against him on account of these, Publius Licinius
Crassus, the consul to whom it was intrusted, passed over into Ma-
cedon, and in trifling expeditions and cavalry actions, fought with
Perseus in Thessaly, by no means successfully. An arbiter was
appointed by the senate to decide concerning land disputed between
Masinissa and the Carthaginians. Ambassadors were sent to request
of the allied states and kings, that they would abide by their agreements,
as the Rhodians wavered. The lustrum was closed by the censors.
Two hundred and fifty-seven thousand two hundred and thirty-one
citizens were rated. It includes besides, the successes gained over the
Corsicans and Ligurians.

                    When Lucius Postumius Albinus and Marcus Popilius Laenas brought before the senate first of all the distribution of the provinces, Liguria was assigned the joint province of both, with directions that they should enlist new legions, by which they would hold that province (two were decreed to each); and also ten thousand foot and six hundred horse of the Latin confederates;
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    and as a supplement to the army in Spain, three thousand Roman foot and two hundred horse.

                    One thousand five hundred Roman foot and one hundred horse wore ordered to be raised; with which the praetor, to whose lot Sardinia might fall, should cross over to Corsica, and carry on the war there;
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    and it was further ordered, that in the mean time the former praetor, Marcus Atilius, should obtain the province of Sardinia. The praetors then cast lots for their provinces.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Aulus Atilius Serranus obtained the city jurisdiction; Caius Cluvius Saxula, that between natives and foreigners; Numerius Fabius Buteo, Hither Spain; Mar-

                    The senate resolved that, before the magistrates went abroad, Lucius Postumius should go into Campania, to fix the bounds between the lands which were private property and those which belonged to the public; for it was understood that individuals, by gradually extending their bounds, had taken possession of a very considerable share of the common lands.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    He, being enraged with the people of Praeneste because, when he had gone thither as a private individual to offer sacrifice in the temple of Fortune, no honour had been paid him, either in public or private, by the people of Praeneste, before he set out from Rome, sent a letter to Praeneste, ordering the chief magistrate to meet him, and to provide him lodging at the public expense; and that, at his departure, cattle should be ready to carry his baggage. No consul before him ever put the allies to any trouble or expense whatever.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    Magistrates were furnished with mules, tents, and every other requisite for a campaign, in order that they might not make any such demands.

                    They had private lodgings, in which they behaved with courtesy and kindness, and their houses at Rome were always open to their hosts with whom they used to lodge.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Ambassadors indeed sent to any place, on a sudden emergency, demanded each a single horse in the several towns through which their journey lay; but the allies never contributed any other portion of the expense of the Roman magistrates.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    The resentment of the consul, which, even if well founded, ought not to have been exerted during his office, and the

                    too modest or too timid acquiescence of the Praenestines, gave to the magistrates, as if by an approved precedent, the privilege of imposing orders of this sort, which grew more burdensome daily.

                    In the beginning of this year the ambassadors, who had been sent to Aetolia and Macedon, returned, and reported that "they had not been able to obtain an interview with Perseus, as some of his court said that he was abroad, others that he was sick; both of which were false pretences.

That in Aetolia, likewise, the dissensions grew daily more violent; and the leaders of the contending parties were not to be restrained by their authority."

                    daily expected, the senate resolved, that before it broke out, all prodigies should be expiated, and the favour of such gods, as should be found expressed in the books of the Fates, invoked by supplications.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    It was said that at Lanuvium the appearance of large fleets was seen in the air; that at Privernum black wool grew out of the ground; that in the territory of Veii, at Remens, a shower of stones fell;
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    and that the whole Pomptine district was covered with clouds of locusts; also that in the Gallic province, where a plough was at work, fishes sprung up from under the earth as it was turned.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    On account of these prodigies the books of the Fates were accordingly consulted, and the decemvirs directed both to what gods, and with what victims, sacrifloes should be offered; likewise that a supplication should be performed, in expiation of the prodigies; and also that another, which had been vowed in the preceding year for the health of the people, should be celebrated, and likewise a solemn festival.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly, sacrifices were offered in accordance with the written directions of the decemvirs.

                    In the same year, the temple of Juno Lacinia was uncovered. Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, the censor, was erecting a temple to Equestrian Fortune, which he had vowed when praetor during the Celtiberian war, with anxious desire that it should not be surpassed by any other at Rome, either in size or magnificence.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Thinking that he would add a very great ornament to this temple if the tiles were marble, he went to Bruttium, and stripped off about the half of those belonging to the temple of the Lacinian Juno; for he computed that so many would be sufficient to cover the one he was building.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Ships were in readiness to take on board the materials, while the allies were deterred by the authority of the censor from preventing the sacrilege.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    When the censor returned, the marble was landed and carried to the temple; but though he made no mention of the place from which it was brought, yet such an affair could not be concealed.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly, considerable murmuring arose in the senate; from all sides of the house a demand was made that the consuls should lay that matter before the senate. When the censor, on being summoned, appeared in the senate-house, they all, both separately and in a body, inveighed against him with great asperity.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    They cried out that

                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        Though created censor for the purpose of regulating men's manners, and bound in duty, according to long-established rules, to enforce the repairing of edifices for public worship, and the keeping them in due order, he had nevertheless gone about through the cities of the allies, stripping the roofs of their sacred buildings, and even demolishing them.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        In a word, what might be deemed scandalous if practised on private houses, he committed against the temples of the immortal gods; and that he involved the Roman people in the guilt of impiety, building temples with the ruins of temples; as if the deities were not the same in all places, but that some should be decorated with the spoils of others.

                    when the question was put, they unanimously concurred in voting, that a contract should be entered into for carrying the tiles back to the temple, and that atonements should be offered to Juno.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    What regarded the atonements was carefully executed; the contractors made a report that they were obliged to leave the marble in the court of the temple, because no workman could be found who knew how to replace the same.

                    Of the praetors who set out for the provinces, Numerius Fabius, on his way to Hither Spain, died at Marseilles.

                    Therefore when this was announced by envoys from Marseilles, the senate resolved that Publius Furius and Cneius Servilius, to whom successors had been sent, should cast lots to determine which of them should hold the government of Hither Spain, with a continuation of authority; and the lot determined, very fortunately, that Publius Furius, whose province it had formerly been, should continue.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    During the same year, on its appearing that large tracts of land in Gaul and Liguria, which had been taken in war, lay unoccupied, the senate passed a decree, that those lands should be dis- tributed in single shares;

                    and Aulus Titilius, city praetor, in pursuance of the said decree, appointed ten commissioners for that purpose, namely, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Caius Cassius, Titus Aebutius Carus, Caius Tremellius, Publius Cornelius Cethe- gus, Quintus and Lucius Appuleius, Marcus Caecilius, Caius

                    During the same time in which these transactions took place, ambassadors came to Rome from Aetolia with representations of the quarrels and dissensions subsisting in that country; likewise Thessalian ambassadors, announcing the transactions in Macedon.

                    Perseus, revolving in his mind the war, which had been resolved on during the life-time of his father, endeavoured, by sending embassies, and by promising a great deal more than he performed, to attach to himself not only the commonwealth of Greece, but also each particular state.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    However the feelings of the majority were inclined in his favour, and much better disposed towards him than Eumenes, although all the states of Greece, and most of the leading men, were under obligations to the latter for benefits and gifts; and although he so conducted himself in his sovereignty, that the cities which were under his dominion would not exchange their condition for that of any free state.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    On the contrary, there was a general report that Perseus, after his father's death, had killed his wife with his own hand;

                    Although he had rendered himself infamous by many other murders, both of his own relations and of others, and possessed not one good quality to recommend him, yet the Grecian states in general gave him the preference to Eumenes, who was so affectionate towards his relations, so just towards his subjects, and so liberal towards all mankind;

                    either because they were so prejudiced by the fame and dignity of the Macedonian kings, as to despise a kingdom lately formed, or were led by a wish for a change in affairs, and wished him to be exposed to the arms of the Romans.

                    The Aetolians were not the only people in a state of distraction, on account of the intolerable burden of their debts: the Thessalians were in the same situation; and the evil, acting by contagion like a pestilence, had spread into Perrhaebia also.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    As soon as it was known that the Thessalians were in arms, the senate sent

                    He severely reprimanded the leaders of both parties; and after cancelling so much of the debts as had been accumulated by iniquitous usury, which he did with the consent of the greater part of the creditors themselves, he ordered the remaining just debts to be discharged by annual payments.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Affairs in Perrhaebia were arranged in the same manner by the same Appius. In the mean time, Marcellus, at Delphi, gave a hearing to the disputes of the Aetolians, which they maintained with no less hostile acrimony than they had shown against each other in the heat of their civil war.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    Perceiving that they vied with each other in inconsiderate violence, he did not choose to make any determination, to lighten or aggravate the grievances of either party, but required of both alike to cease from hostilities, and, forgetting what was past, to put an end to their quarrels.

                    But the city, from the nature of its situation and the strength of the garrison, was impregnable; he therefore gave up the design, and turning his route to Perrhaebia, having taken Mallaea at the first assault, he demolished it; and after reducing Tripolis, and the rest of Perrhaebia, returned to Larissa.

                    From that place he sent home Eumenes and Attalus, and quartered Misagenes and his Numidians, for the winter, in the nearest towns of Thessaly. One half of his army he distributed through Thessaly, in such a manner that all had commodious winter

                    He sent Quintus Mucius, lieutenant-general, with two thousand men, to secure Ambracia, and dismissed all the allied troops belonging to the Grecian states, except the Achaeans. With the other half of his army he marched into the Achaean Phthiotis; where, finding Pteleum deserted by the inhabitants, he levelled it to the ground.

                    He received the voluntary surrender of Antron, and he then marched against Larissa: this city was likewise deserted, the whole multitude taking refuge in the citadel, to which he laid siege.

                    First the Macedonians, who constituted the king's garrison, withdrew through fear; and then the townsmen, on being abandoned by them, surrendered immediately. He then hesitated whether he should first attack Demetrias, or take a view of affairs in Bœotia.

                    The Thebans, being harassed by the Coronaeans, pressed him to go into Bœotia; wherefore, in compliance with their entreaties, and because that country was better adapted for winter quarters than Magnesia, he led his army thither.
