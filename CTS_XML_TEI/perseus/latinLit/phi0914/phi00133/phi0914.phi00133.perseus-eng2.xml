                        Titus Quinctius Flamininus, proconsul, gains a decisive victory over Philip
at Cynoscephalae. Caius Sempronius Tuditanus, praetor, cut off by the

and liberty to Greece. Lucius Furius Purpureo and Marcus Claudius
Marcellus, consuls, subdue the Boian and Insubrian Gauls. Triumph
of Marcellus. Hannibal, alarmed at an embassy from Rome concerning
him, flies to Antiochus, king of Syria, who was preparing to make war
on the Romans.

                    SUCH were the occurrences of the winter. In the beginning of spring, Quinctius, having summoned Attalus to Elatia, and being anxious to bring under his authority the nation of the Bœotians, who had until then been wavering in their dispositions, marched through Phocis, and pitched his camp at the distance of five miles from Thebes, the capital of Bœotia.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Next day, attended by one company of soldiers, and by Attalus, together with the ambassadors, who had come to him in great numbers from all quarters, he proceeded towards the city, having ordered the spearmen of two legions, being
                    <pb n="1441" xml:id="p.1441"/>
                    two thousand men, to follow him at the distance of a mile.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    About midway, Antiphilus, praetor of the Bœotians, met him: the rest of the people stood on the walls, watching the arrival of the king and the Roman general.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Few arms and few soldiers appeared around them —the hollow roads, and the valleys, concealing from view the spearmen, who followed at a distance. When Quinctius drew near the city, he slackened his pace, as if with intention to salute the multitude, who came out to meet him;
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    but the real motive of his delaying was, that the spearmen might come up.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    The townsmen pushed forward, in a crowd, before the lictors, not perceiving the band of soldiers who were following them close, until they arrived at the general's quarters. Then, supposing the city betrayed and taken, through the treachery of Antiphilus, their praetor, they were all struck with astonishment and dismay.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    It was now evident that no room was left to the Bœotians for a free discussion of measures in the assembly, which was summoned for the following day.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    However, they concealed their grief, which it would have been both vain and unsafe to have discovered.

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
                    When the assembly met, Attalus first rose to speak, and he began his discourse with a recital of the kindnesses conferred by his ancestors and himself on the Greeks in general, and on the Bœotians in particular.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    But, being now too old and infirm to bear the exertion of speaking in public, he lost his voice and fell;
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    and for some time, while they were carrying him to his apartments, (for he was deprived of the use of one half of his limbs,) the proceedings of the assembly were for a short time suspended.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Then Aristaenus spoke on the part of the Achaeans, and was listened to with the greater attention, because he recommended to the Bœotians no other measures than those which he had recommended to the Achaeans.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    A few words were added by Quinctius, extolling the good faith rather than the arms and power of the Romans.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    A resolution was then proposed, by Dicaearchus of Plataea, for forming a treaty of friendship with the Roman people, which was read; and no one daring to offer any opposition, it was received and passed by the suffrages of all the states of Bœotia.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    When the assembly broke up, Quinctius made no longer stay at Thebes than the sudden accident to Attalus made necessary.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    When it appeared that the force of the disorder had not

                    brought the king's life into any immediate danger, but had only occasioned a weakness in his limbs, he left him there, to use the necessary means for recovery, and returned to Elatia, from whence he had come.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Having now brought the Bœotians, as formerly the Achaeans, to join in the confederacy, while all places were left behind him in a state of tranquillity and safety, he bent his whole attention towards Philip, and the remaining business of the war.

                    Philip, on his part, as his ambassadors had brought no hopes of peace
                    <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/>
                    from Rome, resolved, as soon as spring began, to levy soldiers through every town in his dominions: but he found a great scarcity of young men;

                    for successive wars, through several generations, had very much exhausted the Macedonians, and, even in the course of his own reign, great numbers had fallen, in the

                    naval engagements with the Rhodians and Attalus, and in those on land with the Romans. Mere youths, therefore, from the age of sixteen, were enlisted;
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    and even those who had served out their time, provided they had any remains of strength, were recalled to their standards.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Having, by these means, filled up the numbers of his army about the vernal equinox, he drew together all his forces to Dius: he encamped them there in a fixed post;
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    and, exercising the soldiers every day, waited for the enemy.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    About the same time Quinctius left Elatia, and came by Thronium and Scarphea to Thermopylae. There he held an assembly of the Aetolians, which had been summoned to meet at Heraclea, to determine with what number of auxiliaries they should follow the Roman general to the war.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    On the third day, having learned the determination of the allies, he proceeded from Heraclea to Xyniae; and, pitching his camp on the confines between the Aenians and Thessalians, waited for the Aetolian auxiliaries.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    The Aetolians occasioned no delay. Six hundred foot and four hundred horse, under the command of Phaeneas, speedily joined him; and then Quinctius, to show plainly what he had waited for, immediately decamped.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    On passing into the country of Phthiotis, he was joined by five hundred

                    Cretans of Gortynium, whose commander was Cydantes, with three hundred Apollonians, armed nearly in the same manner; and not long after, by Amynander, with one thousand two hundred Athamanian foot.

                    from Elatia, and considering that, on the approaching contest, his kingdom was at hazard, thought it advisable to make an encouraging speech to his soldiers;
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    in which, after he had expatiated on many topics often alluded to before, respecting the virtues of their ancestors, and the military fame of the Macedonians, he touched particularly on those considerations which at the time threw the greatest damp on their spirits, and on those by which they might be animated to some degree of confidence.

                    To the defeat thrice suffered at the narrow passes near the river Aous, by the phalanx of the Macedonians, he opposed the repulse given by main force to the Romans at Atrax:

                    and even with respect to the former case, when they had not maintained possession of the pass leading into Epirus, he said,

                        the first fault was to be imputed to those who had been negligent in keeping the guards; and the second, to the light infantry and mercenaries in the time of the engagement; but that, as to the phalanx of the Macedonians, it had stood firm on that occasion; and would for ever remain invincible, on equal ground, and in regular fight.

                    This body consisted of sixteen thousand men, the prime strength of the army, and of the kingdom. Besides these, he had two thousand targeteers, called Peltastae; of Thracians, and Illyrians of the tribe called Trallians, the like number of two thousand; and of hired auxiliaries, collected out of various nations, about one thousand; and two thousand horse. With this force the king waited for the enemy.

                    The Romans had nearly an equal number; in cavalry alone they had a superiority, by the addition of the Aetolians.

                    Quinctius, having decamped to Thebes in Phthiotis, and having received encouragement to hope that the city would be betrayed to him by Timon, a leading man in the state, came up close to the walls with only a small number of cavalry and some light infantry.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    So entirely were his expectations disappointed, that he was not only obliged to maintain a fight with the enemy who sallied out against him, but would have incurred a fearful conflict had not both infantry

                    and cavalry been called out hastily from the camp, and come up in time. Not meeting with that success which he had too inconsiderately expected, he desisted from any further attempt to take the city at present.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    He had received certain information of the king being in Thessaly; but as he had not

                    yet discovered into what part of it he had come, he sent his soldiers round the country, with orders to cut timber and prepare palisades.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Both Macedonians and Greeks had palisades; but the latter had not adopted the most convenient mode of using them, either with respect to carriage, or for the purpose of strengthening their fortifications.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    They cut trees both too large and too full of branches for a soldier to carry easily along with his arms: and after they had fenced their camp with a line of these, the demolition of their palisade was no difficult matter;
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    for the trunks of large trees appearing to view, with great intervals between them, and the numerous and strong shoots affording the hand a good hold, two, or at most three young men, uniting their efforts, used to pull out one tree, which, being removed,
                    <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/>
                    a breach was opened as wide as a gate, and there was nothing at hand with which it could be stopped up.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    But the Romans cut light stakes, mostly of one fork, with three, or at the most four branches; so that a soldier, with his arms slung at his back, can conveniently carry several of them together;
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    and then they stick them down so closely, and interweave the branches in such a manner, that it cannot be seen to what main stem any branch belongs; besides which, the boughs are so sharp, and wrought so intimately with each other, as to leave no room for a hand to be thrust between;
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    consequently an enemy cannot lay hold of any thing capable of being dragged out, or, if that could be done, could he draw out the branches thus intertwined, and which mutually bind each other.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    And even if, by accident, one should be pulled out, it leaves but a small opening, which is very easily filled up.

                    Next day Quinctius, causing his men to carry palisades with them, that they might be ready to encamp on any spot, marched forward a short way, and took post about six miles from Pherae;
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    whence he sent scouts to discover in what part of Thessaly the king was, and what appeared to be his intention.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Philip was then near Larissa, and as soon as he learned that the Roman general had removed from Thebes, being equally impatient for a decisive engagement, he proceeded towards the enemy, and pitched his camp about four miles from Pherae.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    On the day following, some light troops went out from both camps, to seize on certain hills, which overlooked the city. When, nearly at equal distance from the

                    and sending messengers to their respective camps for directions, how they were to proceed on this unexpected meeting with the enemy, waited their return in quiet.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    For that day, they were recalled to their camps, without having commenced any engagement. On the following day, there was a battle between the cavalry, near the same hills, in which the Aetolians bore no small part; and in which the king's troops were defeated, and driven into their camp.

                    The public revenues were partly wasted through neglect, partly embezzled, and divided among some leading men and magistrates; insomuch, that there was not money sufficient for the regular annual payment of the tribute to the Romans, so that private persons seemed to be threatened with a heavy tax.

Accordingly, they instigated the Romans against Hannibal, who were seeking a pretext for indulging their hatred against him.
