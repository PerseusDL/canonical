                    were being celebrated in the circus, a rumour in the audience suddenly swept
                    over the whole auditorium that a battle had been fought in Macedonia and the
                    king beaten; then the buzz increased; finally there arose shouting and clapping,
                    as if a definite report of victory had arrived. <milestone n="2" unit="section"
                    /> The magistrates were astonished and sought after the originator of this
                    sudden rejoicing. When no such person was found, the rejoicing as if for an
                    established fact died away, but the happy omen lurked nevertheless in men's
                    minds. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> After confirmation came through the
                    genuine report on the arrival of Fabius, Lentulus, and Metellus, men rejoiced
                    both in the actual victory and in the prophetic power of their spirits. The
                    story is told of a second rejoicing by the mob at the circus, which seemed no
                    less genuine. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> On the sixteenth of <pb

                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 168</note> it is said
                    that a messenger who said he came from Macedonia handed despatches wreathed with
                    laurel to the consul Gaius Licinius as he was going up to start the
                    chariot-race. When the race was over, the consul mounted his chariot and as he
                    was being driven back to the reserved seats, showed the despatches to the
                    people. At the sight of them the people at once forgot the show and rushed down
                    into the arena. On the spot, the consul summoned the senate, had the despatches
                    read, and on motion of the Fathers, announced to the people before the
                    magistrates' seats that his colleague Lucius Aemilius had fought a pitched
                    battle with King Perseus, that the Macedonian army had been slaughtered and
                    routed, that the king had fled with but few followers, and that all the cities
                    of Macedonia had come under the sway of the Roman people. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> On hearing this, shouting with great clapping of hands
                    began; the games were deserted and most of the people took home the glad news to
                    their wives and children. This was the twelfth day after the battle had taken
                    place in Macedonia. </p>

                    senate-house, a thanksgiving was voted, and a resolution passed that the consul
                    should discharge men whom he had under oath, <note anchored="true"

                        such special soldiers, as contrasted with a regular levy. But the reason for
                        large numbers at this time may be the failure of the consul in Italy to
                        qualify as commander of Roman troops (see below, xii. 12) and the consequent
                        holding at Rome of Roman levies intended for him. </note> except soldiers
                    and sailors, and that the question of dismissing soldiers and sailors should be
                    put when the envoys who had sent the messenger ahead should arrive from the
                    consul Lucius Aemilius. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> On the twenty-fifth
                    day of September, about the <pb n="p.253"/> second hour the envoys entered the
                    city, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The envoys seem not to have
                        hurried, or to have been delayed by adverse winds in crossing the Adriatic;

                        included, below, xli. 3. </note> and made <note anchored="true"

                    drawing after them a huge crowd of people who met them at every point on their
                    way, and proceeded to escort them. The senate happened to be in the
                    senate-house; the consul presented the envoys there. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> They were kept there just long enough to explain how large
                    the king's forces of infantry and cavalry had been, how many thousand of them
                    had been slain and how many captured, with the loss of how few of our men this
                    great slaughter of the enemy had been accomplished, and how hastily the king had
                    fled; it was thought, the envoys said, that he would make for Samothrace; the
                    fleet was ready to pursue, and it would be impossible for him to slip away
                    either by land or sea. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> On being brought before
                    a meeting shortly thereafter, the envoys related the same facts. Joy broke out
                    anew when the consul proclaimed that all sacred buildings should be opened;
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> from the meeting, each citizen went of
                    his own accord to offer thanks to the gods, and all over the city the temples of
                    the immortal gods were filled with a huge throng, not only of men, but of women
                    too. </p>
                <p> The senate was recalled to the senate-house, voted that thanksgiving for the
                    glorious achievement of the consul Lucius Aemilius should be observed for five
                    days at all the banquet-tables of the gods, and ordered sacrifice offered with
                    the larger victims. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The ships which were
                    moored in the Tiber ready and equipped to be sent to Macedonia, if circumstances
                        <pb n="p.255"/> demanded it, were to be put ashore and housed in <note

                    ship-sheds; the sailors were to be discharged after receiving their year's pay,
                    and with them, all those who had taken the oath before the consul. It was voted
                    to discharge all soldiers who were in Corcyra, at Brundisium, along the
                    Adriatic, or in the territory of Larinum —for an army had been distributed among
                    all these places, to enable Gaius Licinius to bring aid to his colleague, if the
                    situation demanded it. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> At a meeting a
                    thanksgiving was proclaimed to the people for the eleventh of October and the

                    relate that the ambassadors of the Rhodians, who had not yet been dismissed
                    after the announcement of victory, were summoned to the senate, as if in mockery
                    of their foolish pride, and that there Agepolis, their chief, spoke as follows:
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> the envoys had been sent by the Rhodians
                    to bring about peace between the Romans and Perseus, since the war between them

                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 168</note> the Romans themselves. The
                    good fortune of the Roman people had been kind to the Rhodians in giving them
                    the opportunity, now that the war had been brought to an end by other means, of
                    congratulating the Romans on their glorious victory. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> This was the speech of the Rhodian. </p>
                <p> The answer of the senate was that the Rhodians had sent that embassy through
                    concern neither for the welfare of Greece nor for the outlays of the Roman
                    People, but on behalf of Perseus. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For had
                    their concern been as alleged, their envoys should have been sent when Perseus
                    had led his army into Thessaly and for two years was besieging some Greek cities
                    and alarming others with the threat of attack. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    At that time, there had been not a word about peace from the Rhodians. After
                    they had heard that the Romans had overcome the passes and crossed into
                    Macedonia, and that Perseus was surrounded, then the Rhodians sent an embassy
                    for no other purpose than to snatch Perseus from the impending disaster. With
                    this reply, the envoys were dismissed. </p>

                    hardly be determined whether the senate would be more disposed to grant his

                    Stratius, a physician, was with him, sent to Rome by the uneasy Eumenes

                        Attalus. (See XLII. xvi. 9 and the note, Vol. XII, p. 339, for the view that
                        Attalus III was actually the son of Attalus II). An illegitimate son of

                    added to the foreign war, no halt could be called. What he was considering was
                    simply preventing his brother from dying as king in order to rob himself of his

                    preserving the kingdom, coupled as it was with family loyalty, would still be

                    brothers as told in legend, the fate of Perseus seemed to be a notable example,

                    order had been established in Epirus, and the troops distributed in winter
                    quarters among suitable cities, Anicius returned to Illyricum, summoned the
                    chief men from all his theatre of operations, and held a conference at Scodra,
                    where the five commissioners from Rome had arrived. There he announced as
                    officer in charge, on the advice of his council, that the Roman senate and
                    people gave the Illyrians their freedom; he would remove his garrisons from all

                    but tax-exemption as well would be granted, he said, to the people of Issa and

                    Olcinium, because they had gone over to the Romans while Gentius was still
                    undefeated. The Daorsi would also be granted tax-exemption, because they had
                    abandoned Caravantius and gone over with their arms to the Romans. On the people
                    of Scodra, the Dassarenses, the Selepitani, and the rest of the Illyrians a tax
                    was laid of half what they had paid to the king. Next, Anicius divided Illyricum
                    into three parts. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He made the first of these

                <p> XXVII. While these events were occurring in Illyricum, Paulus sent his son
                    Quintus Maximus, who had by this time returned from Rome, to sack Aeginium and
                    Agassae before the arrival of the ten commissioners. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> In the case of Agassae, the reason was that, although they
                    had surrendered their city to the consul Marcius with a voluntary request for
                    alliance with Rome, they had again gone over to Perseus. The fault of Aeginium
                    was recent; because they did not believe the rumour about the Roman victory,
                    they had cruelly treated as enemies certain soldiers who had entered their city.
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> This seems to be another version,
                        or another phase, of the episode recorded in XLIV. xlvi. 3; if, as seems
                        likely, Aeginium was in north-western Thessaly, its adherence to Perseus was
                        more of a fault; but Paulus seems to have been looking for reasons which
                        would justify the acquisition of plunder by the army. If, as Livy's
                        arrangement implies, but does not make certain, these events occurred a year
                        after the fall of Perseus, the justification for them is thin. Assuming this
                        time interval, however, we may suppose that the arrangements of the senate
                        (xvii. 1) were made with the benefit of advice from Paulus, and that Paulus'
                        sightseeing mentioned below was more in order than it would have been soon
                        after the battle of Pydna. </note> Paulus also sent Lucius Postumius to sack

                    double the amount to each centurion, and three times as much to the cavalry; the
                    allies of the Latin Name received as much as the Romans, and the sailors as much

                    proceeded from the gate to the Forum and the judgment-seat of Quintus Cassius
                    the <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> praetor. A crowd gathered from all sides;
                    Prusias announced that he had come to bring greetings to the gods who inhabited
                    the city of Rome, and to the senate and the Roman People, and to congratulate
                    them on their victory over King Perseus and King Gentius, and on the extension
                    of their empire by placing the Macedonians and Illyrians under their <milestone

                    the senate for him on that very day, if he pleased, Prusias asked for a two-day
                    interval, during which he might visit the temples of the gods, the city, and his
                    friends and <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> guest-friends. There was assigned
                    to him as escort Lucius Cornelius Scipio the quaestor, who had also <pb

                    at Rome in the Capitol and one at Praeneste to Fortune. This vow, he said, was
                    for the victory of Rome; and he asked that the alliance with him should be
                    renewed, and that the land taken from King Antiochus, which had been assigned to
                    no one by the Roman People and was being held by Galatians, should be given to
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> him. Last of all, he placed his son
                    Nicomedes under the protection of the senate. </p>
                <p> He was aided by the good-will of all those who had been commanders in <milestone

                    were granted; as to the land, the answer was that envoys would be sent to look
                    the matter over; if this land belonged to the Roman People and had been assigned
                    to no one, they would consider Prusias most worthy of receiving it as a
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> gift; if, on the other hand, it was shown
                    not to have belonged to Antiochus, and therefore not to have come into the
                    possession of the Roman People, or that it had been presented to the Galatians,
                    then Prusias must pardon the Roman People, if they were unwilling to wrong
                    anyone in the process of making him a <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    present. A gift, said the senate, could not be pleasing even to the recipient,
                    if he knew that the giver would take it away again whenever he <milestone n="13"
                        unit="section"/> pleased. The senate accepted the commission to protect his
                    son Nicomedes. How great was the care with which <pb n="p.409"/> the Roman

                <p> With this answer, Prusias was dismissed. Gifts were ordered given him of a value
                    of . . . <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">The amount has been lost from

                    Nicomedes gifts to the same amount as had been given to Masgaba, the son of King
                    Masinissa. It was further voted that the victims and other requisites for
                    sacrifice should be furnished at public expense to the king, just as to Roman
                    magistrates, whether he wished to sacrifice at Rome or <milestone n="16"
                        unit="section"/> Praeneste. Also twenty war-vessels from the fleet at
                    Brundisium were to be assigned to his <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> use;
                    until the king should reach the fleet presented to him, Lucius Cornelius Scipio
                    was to escort him uninterruptedly, and to provide for the expenses of the king
                    and his suite, until he boarded ship. </p>
                <p> They say that the king was wonderfully pleased with this expression of good-will
                    toward himself on the part of the Roman <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    People. He refused to have gifts bought for himself, but instructed his son to
                    accept the gift of the Roman People. Such is the account of Prusias given by
                    Roman <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> writers. Polybius reports <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified">XXX. 18 (19. 16).</note> that this king
                    was unworthy of the dignity of so high a title; that he was accustomed to meet
                    envoys with his head shaved, while he wore a freedman's cap and called himself
                    the freedman of the Roman People, giving this as his reason for wearing the
                    emblem of this <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> class. Polybius further says
                    that when Prusias entered the senate-house at Rome, he fell down and kissed the
                    threshold of the <pb n="p.411"/> senatehouse, hailed the senate as his
