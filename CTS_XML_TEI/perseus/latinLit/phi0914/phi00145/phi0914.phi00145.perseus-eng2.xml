                    <p>
                        Perseus was captured by Aemilius Paulus in Samothrace. When Anti-
ochus, king of Syria, was besieging Ptolemy and Cleopatra, king and
queen of Egypt, and ambassadors were sent to him by the senate, to
order him to desist from besieging a king in alliance with Rome, on his
being informed of the mandates of the senate, he answered, that he
would consider what line of conduct he should adopt. Then Popilius,
one of the ambassadors, described, with his wand, a circle around the
king, and ordered him to give a decided answer before he passed it.
By which decided conduct he compelled the king to desist from the war.
The embassies of the nations and king, that came to congratulate the
Romans, were admitted into the senate-house, with the exception of the
embassy from the Rhodians, which was excluded because their feelings
in that war were opposed to the Roman people. The next day, when
the question was put
                        <quote>that war should be proclaimed against them,</quote>
                        the
Rhodian ambassadors pleaded the cause of their country before the senate,
and were dismissed in a manner that rendered it uncertain whether they
were looked on as enemies or allies. Macedon was reduced to the form
of a Roman province. Aemilius Paulus triumphed; although his own
soldiers opposed him, because they were dissatisfied with their share of
the plunder, and Servius Sulpicius Galba spoke against him: Perseus
and his three sons preceded his triumphal chariot. Still the joy of this
triumph was not unmingled, for it was rendered remarkable by the death
of his two sons: one of whom died before his father's triumph; the
death of the other speedily followed. The ceremony of the conclusion of
the census was performed by the censors. Three hundred and twelve
thousand eight hundred and five citizens were enrolled. Prusias, king
of Bithynia, came to Rome, to congratulate the senate on the victory
gained over Macedon; and committed his son Nicomedes to the charge
of the senate: being full of servility, he called himself the freed-man of
the Roman people.

                    ALTHOUGH Quintus Fabius, Lucius Lentulus, and Quintus Metellus, who were sent with the news of the victory, made all possible haste to Rome, yet they found rejoicings for that event anticipated there.

                    The fourth day after the battle with Perseus, while games were exhibiting in the circus, a faint rumour spread itself suddenly among the people through
                    <pb n="2116" xml:id="p.2116"/>
                    all the seats,

                    The rumour gathered strength, until at last arose shouting and clapping of hands, as if certain tidings of victory were brought to them.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    The magistrates were surprised, and caused inquiry to be made for the originator of this sudden rejoicing;
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    but as none was found, the joy of course vanished, since the matter was uncertain; yet the prestige of conquest still remained impressed on their minds;
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    and when, on the arrival of Fabius, Lentulus, and Metellus, the fact was established by authentic information, they rejoiced on a twofold account, â€”on that of the victory, and their happy presage of it.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    This exultation in the circus is related in another manner, with equal appearance of probability: that on the fifteenth day before the calends of October, being the second day of the Roman games, as the consul Licinius was going down to give the signal for the race, a courier, who said he came from Macedon, delivered to him a letter decorated with laurel.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    As soon as he had started the chariots, he mounted his own, and as he rode back through the circus to the seats of the magistrates, showed to the people the embellished tablets, at the sight of which the multitude, regardless of the games, ran down at once into the middle of the area.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    The consul held a meeting of the senate on the spot; and after reading the letter to them, by their direction told the people, before the seats of the magistrates, that
                    <quote>
                        his colleague, Lucius Aemilius, had fought a general engagement with Perseus; that the Macedonian army was beaten and put to flight;
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        that the king had fled with few attendants; and that all the states of Macedon had submitted to the Romans.
                    </quote>
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    On hearing this, a universal shouting and clapping of hands arose among the commons; and most of them, leaving the games, hastened home to communicate the joyful tidings to their wives and children.

                    This was the thirteenth day after the battle was fought in Macedon.

                    On the following day a meeting of the senate was held in the council-chamber, and a general supplication was voted, and likewise a decree of the senate was passed, that the consul should disband all his troops, excepting the legionary soldiers and seamen;
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    and that their disbandment should be taken into consideration as soon as the deputies from the consul Aemilius, who had sent forward the courier, should

                    arrive in town.

                    On the sixth day before the calends of October, about the second hour, the deputies came into the city, and proceeded directly to the tribunal in the forum, drawing after them, wherever they went, an immense crowd, composed of those who went forth to meet and escort them.

                    The senate happened to be then in the council-chamber, and the consul introduced the deputies to them. They were detained there no longer than to give an account,

                        how very numerous the king's forces of horse and foot had been; how many thousands of them were killed, how many taken; with what small loss of men the Romans had made such havoc of the enemy, and with how small a retinue Perseus had fled;

                        that it was supposed he would go to Samothrace, and that the fleet was ready to pursue him; so that he could not escape, either by sea or land.

                    They were then brought out into the assembly of the people, where they repeated the same particulars, and the general joy was renewed in such a degree, that no sooner had the consul published an order,

                        that all the places of worship should

                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    The senate, being re-assembled, ordered thanksgivings in all the temples, during five days, for the glorious successes obtained by the consul Lucius Aemilius, with sacrifices of the larger kinds of victims.

                    They also voted that the ships, which lay in the Tiber fit for sea, and ready to sail for Macedon, in case the king had been able to maintain the contest, should

                    and, together with these, all who had taken the military oath to the consul; that all the soldiers in Corcyra and Brundusium, on the coast of the Hadriatic and in the territory of Larinum, (for in all these places had troops been cantoned, in order that the consul Licinius might, if occasion required, take them over to reinforce his colleague,) should be disbanded.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    The thanksgiving was fixed, by proclamation in the assembly, for the fifth day before the ides of October, and the five days following.

                    On account of these services, under the conduct and auspices of the praetor, Lucius Anicius, the senate voted a supplication of three days' continuance, and it was accordingly appointed, by proclamation, to be performed on the fourth, third, and second days before the ides of November.

                    Some writers tell us that the Rhodian ambassadors, who had not yet been dismissed, were, when the news of the victory was received, called before the senate in order to expose their absurd arrogance.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    On this occasion, Agesipolis, their principal, spoke to this effect: that

                        because the war subsisting between them was injurious and burdensome to all Greece, and expensive and detrimental to the Romans themselves; but that fortune had acted very kindly, since, by terminating the war after another manner, it afforded them an opportunity of congratulating the Romans on a glorious victory.

                    This was the discourse of the Rhodians. The senate returned the following answer: that
                    <quote>
                        the Rhodians had sent that embassy, not through anxiety for the interests of Greece, or for the expenses of the Roman people, but merely from their wish to serve Perseus.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        For, if their concern had been such as they pretended, they should have sent ambassadors at the time when Perseus, leading an army into Thessaly, had continued, for two years, to besiege some of the cities of Greece, and to terrify others with denunciations of vengeance.

                        All this time not the least mention of peace was made by the Rhodians; but when they heard that the Romans had passed the defiles, and penetrated into Macedon, and that Perseus was held enclosed by them, then they sent an embassy, from no other motive whatever, but a wish to rescue Perseus from the impending danger.

                    Perseus felt that he must, now that he was conquered, forego the name of king, and consequently sent another letter, inscribed simply with his name, in which he made a request, and obtained it too, that some persons should be sent to him, with whom he might confer on the state and condition of his affairs.

                    Three ambassadors were accordingly despatched, Publius Lentulus, Aulus Postumius Albinus, and Aulus Antonius; but nothing was effected by this embassy, for Perseus clung with all the energy of despair to the regal title, while Paullus insisted on an absolute submission of himself, and every thing belonging to him, to the honour and clemency of the Roman people.

The only pretence they alleged for it was, the necessity for adjourning the entire deliberation concerning the Rhodians until the return of the general and the ten commissioners from Macedon, who, after most carefully weighing the matter ac- cording to the communications received in their letters and tab- lets, were likely to give certain information relative to the feelings which each state had borne towards Perseus or the Romans.

But although the violent and impetuous attempt of the praetor had been defeated by corresponding firmness on the part of the tribune, still anxiety did not as yet leave the minds of the Rhodians; for the senators bore them a most unfriendly feel- ing; so that the Rhodians were relieved from the impending evil for the present, rather than completely rescued from it. Therefore, when a meeting of the senate was granted to them, after requesting it for a long time and frequently, on their introduction by the consul they lay at first for a long time with their persons prostrated on the ground; afterwards, when the consul raised them up and ordered them to speak, Asty- medes, whose appearance was most calculated to excite pity, spoke to the following effect: "Conscript fathers, this grief and degradation of allies, who enjoyed your friendship a short time ago, cannot fail to be pitied even by those who are

The next day all the most beautiful and most magnificent arms of the Mace- donians were carried along on many waggons; and these arms were glittering with all the brightness of steel, or lately polished brass, and were piled up in such a manner with regard to one another, that although they seemed to be heaped up in masses rather than artificially arranged, yet they presented to the eye a striking appearance, owing to this very fortuitous and con- fused arrangement: helmets were mixed with shields, and coats of mail with greaves, and Cretan targets, and Thracian bucklers, and quivers, in one heap with the bridles of horses, and naked swords exposing their threatening points, and Macedonian spears projecting from the sides. And as all these arms were loosely bound together, whenever they clashed with one another in the carriage, they sent forth a certain terrible and martial sound, so that not even the arms of the conquered could

Young men, begirt with bands of exquisite workmanship, led the bulls along; and to them were added as companions, boys who bore golden and silver goblets. Then followed the persons who bore the coined gold in seventy-seven vases, each of which contained three talents, like those in which the silver was carried. Then was seen the sacred goblet, ten talents in weight, adorned with precious gems, which Paullus had ordered to be made,

A band of captives followed, namely, Bethys, the son of king Cotys, who had been sent by his father into Macedon as a hostage, and subsequently taken by the Romans along with the children of Perseus; then the children of Perseus themselves, accom- panied by a band of tutors and guardians, who in tears stretched forth their hands mournfully to the spectators, and instructed the boys to implore suppliantly the mercy of the victorious people. There were two sons and one daughter who excited the greater commiseration in the spectators, because they themselves, on account of their age,

Therefore the majority of the spectators could not refrain from tears, and a sort of silent grief saddened the minds of all, and prevented them from en- joying real pleasure, as long as the children met their gaze. Behind his children walked Perseus with his wife, in a mourn- ing robe, dressed in sandals, after the Greek custom, like a person stupified and astonished, whom the greatness of his calamities seemed to have deprived of reason. Then followed a crowd of friends and acquaintances, in whose countenances deep grief was depicted, for whenever they gazed on the king they

Aemilius smiled at the dastardly spirit of the wretch, and said,

                    The consuls of this year, after merely ravaging the lands of the Ligurians, as the enemy never brought an army into the field, returned to Rome to elect new magistrates, without having performed any matter of importance; and on the first day on which the assembly could meet, they appointed Marcus Claudius Marcellus, and Caius Sulpicius Gallus, consuls. Lucius Livius, Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, Aulus Licinius Nerva, Publius Rutilius Calvus, Publius Quintilius Varus, and Marcus Fonteius, were elected praetors on the next day.

                    There was an intercalation made in the calendar this year, which took place on the day after the feast of Terminus. One of the augurs, Caius Claudius, died this year, and Titus Quintus Flamininus was chosen in his place by the college. The flamen quirinalis, Quintus Fabius Pictor, died also. This year king Prusias arrived at Rome with his son Nicomedes.
