                        the consul. The consul's successes in Spain. Titus Quinctius Flamininus
                        finishes the war with the Lacedaemonians and the tyrant Nabis; makes peace
                        with them, and restores liberty to Argos. Separate seats at the public
                        games, for the first time, appointed for the senators. Colonies sent forth.
                        Marcus Porcius Cato triumphs on account of his successes in Spain. Further
                        successes in Spain against the Boians and Insubrian Gauls. Titus Quinctius
                        Flamininus, having subdued Philip, king of Macedonia, and Nabis, the
                        Lacedaemonian tyrant, and restored all Greece to freedom, triumphs for three
                        days. Carthaginian ambassa- dors bring intelligence of the hostile designs
                        of Antiochus and Hannibal. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> AMID the serious concerns of important wars,
                    either scarcely brought to a close or impending, an incident intervened, trivial
                    indeed to be mentioned, but which, through the zeal of the parties concerned,
                    issued in a violent contest. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Marcus Fundanius
                    and Lucius Valerius, plebeian tribunes, proposed to the people the repealing of
                    the Oppian law. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This law, which had been
                    introduced by Caius Oppias, plebeian tribune, in the consulate of Quintus Fabius
                    and Tiberius Sempronius, during the heat of the Punic war, enacted that <quote>
                        no woman should possess more than half an ounce of gold, or wear a garment
                        of various colours, or ride in a carriage drawn by horses, in a city, or any
                        town, or any place nearer thereto than one mile; except on occasion of some
                        public religious solemnity. </quote>
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Marcus and Publius Junius Brutus, plebeian
                    tribunes, supported the Oppian law, and declared, that they would never suffer
                    it to be repealed; while many of the nobility stood forth to argue for and
                    against the motion proposed. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Capitol was
                    filled with crowds, who favoured or opposed the law; nor could the matrons be
                    kept at home, either by advice or shame, nor even by the commands of their
                    husbands; but beset every street and pass in the city, beseeching the men as
                    they went down to the forum, that in the present flourishing state of the
                    commonwealth, when the private fortune of all was daily in- <pb n="1491"
                        xml:id="p.1491"/> creasing, they would suffer the women to have their former
                    ornaments of dress restored. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This throng of
                    women increased daily, for they arrived even from the country towns and
                    villages; and they had at length the boldness to come up to the consuls,
                    praetors, and magistrates, to urge their request. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> One of the consuls, however, they found especially
                    inexorable — Marcus Porcius Cato, who, in support of the law proposed to be
                    repealed, spoke to this effect: — </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> "If, Romans, every individual among us had
                    made it a rule to maintain the prerogative and authority of a husband with
                    respect to his own wife, we should have less trouble with the whole sex.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But now, our privileges, overpowered at
                    home by female contumacy, are, even here in the forum, spurned and trodden under
                    foot; and because we are unable to withstand each separately, we now dread their
                    collective body. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> I was accustomed to think it
                    a fabulous and fictitious tale, that, in a certain island, the whole race of
                    males was utterly extirpated by a conspiracy of the women. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> But the utmost danger may be apprehended equally from
                    either sex, if you suffer cabals, assemblies, and secret consultations to be
                    held: scarcely, indeed, can I determine, in my own mind, whether the act itself,
                    or the precedent that it affords, is of more pernicious tendency. The latter of
                    these more particularly concerns us consuls, and the other magistrates: the
                    former, yourselves, my fellow-citizens. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> For,
                    whether the measure proposed to your consideration be profitable to the state or
                    not, is to be determined by you, who are about to go to the vote. As to the
                    outrageous behaviour of these women, whether it be merely an act of their own,
                    or owing to your instigations, Marcus Fundanius and Lucius Valerius, it
                    unquestionably implies culpable conduct in magistrates. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> I know not whether it reflects greater disgrace on you,
                    tribunes, or on the consuls: on you certainly, if you have, on the present
                    occasion, brought these women hither for the purpose of raising tribunitian
                    seditions; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> on us, if we suffer laws to be
                    imposed on us by a secession of women, as was done formerly by that of the
                    common people. It was not without painful emotions of shame, that I, just now,
                    made my way into the forum through the midst of a band of women. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> Had I not been restrained by respect for the modesty
                    and dignity of some individuals among them, rather than of the whole number, and
                    been unwilling that they should be <pb n="1492" xml:id="p.1492"/> seen rebuked
                    by a consul, I should have said to them, 'What sort of practice is this, of
                    running out into public, besetting the streets, and addressing other women's
                    husbands? <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Could not each have made the same
                    request to her husband at home? Are your blandishments more seducing in public
                    than in private; and with other women's husbands, than with your own? <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/> Although if the modesty of matrons confined them
                    within the limits of their own rights, it did not become you, even at home, to
                    concern yourselves about what laws might be passed or repealed here.' Our
                    ancestors thought it not proper that women should perform any, even private
                    business, without a director; but that they should be ever under the control of
                    parents, brothers, or husbands. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> We, it seems,
                    suffer them, now, to interfere in the management of state affairs, and to
                    introduce themselves into the forum, into general assemblies, and into
                    assemblies of election. For, what are they doing, at this moment, in your
                    streets and lanes? What, but arguing, some in support of the motion of the
                    plebeian tribunes; others, for the repeal of the law? <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> Will you give the reins to their intractable nature, and
                    their uncontrolled passions, and then expect that themselves should set bounds
                    to their licentiousness, when you have failed to do so? <milestone n="13"
                        unit="section"/> This is the smallest of the injunctions laid on them by
                    usage or the laws, all which women bear with impatience: <milestone n="14"
                        unit="section"/> they long for liberty; or rather, to speak the truth, for
                    unbounded freedom in every particular. For what will they not attempt, if they
                    now come off victorious? </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> "Recollect all the institutions respecting the
                    sex, by which our forefathers restrained their undue freedom, and by which they
                    subjected them to their husbands; and yet, even with the help of all these
                    restrictions, you can scarcely keep them within bounds. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> If, then, you suffer them to throw these off one by one, to
                    tear them all asunder, and, at last, to be set on an equal footing with
                    yourselves, can you imagine that they will be any longer tolerable by you?
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The moment they have arrived at an
                    equality with you, they will have become your superiors. But, forsooth, they
                    only object to any new law being made against them: they mean to deprecate, not
                    justice, but severity. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Nay, their wish is,
                    that a law which you have admitted, established by your suffrages, and confirmed
                    by the practice and experience of so many years to be beneficial, should <pb
                        n="1493" xml:id="p.1493"/> now be repealed; that is, that, by abolishing one
                    law, you should weaken all the rest. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> No law
                    perfectly suits the convenience of every member of the community: the only
                    consideration is, whether, upon the whole, it be profitable to the greater part.
                    If, because a law proves obnoxious to a private individual, that circumstance
                    should destroy and sweep it away, to what purpose is it for the community to
                    enact general laws, which those, with reference to whom they were passed, could
                    presently repeal? <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> I should like, however, to
                    hear what this important affair is which has induced the matrons thus to run out
                    into public in this excited manner, scarcely restraining from pushing into the
                    forum and the assembly of the people. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Is it to
                    solicit that their parents, their husbands, children, and brothers may be
                    ransomed from captivity under Hannibal? By no means: and far be ever from the
                    commonwealth so unfortunate a situation. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Yet,
                    even when such was the case, you refused this to their prayers. But it is not
                    duty, nor solicitude for their friends; it is religion that has collected them
                    together. They are about to receive the Idaean Mother, coming out of Phrygia
                    from Pessinus! What motive, that even common decency will allow to be mentioned,
                    is pretended for this female insurrection? <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Why, say they, that we may shine in gold and purple; that, both on festal and
                    common days, we may ride through the city in our chariots, triumphing over
                    vanquished and abrogated law, after having captured and wrested from you your
                    suffrages; and that there may be no bounds to our expenses and our luxury. </p>

                    <quote> Often have you heard me complain of the profuse expenses of the women
                        —often of those of the men; and that not only of men in private stations,
                        but of the magistrates: <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> and that the state
                        was endangered by two opposite vices, luxury and avarice; those pests, which

                        These I dread the more, as the circumstances of the commonwealth grow daily
                        more prosperous and happy; as the empire increases; as we have now passed
                        over into Greece and Asia, places abounding with every kind of temptation
                        that can inflame the passions; and as we have begun to handle even royal
                        treasures: so much the more do I fear that these matters will bring us into
                        captivity, rather than we them. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Believe
                        me, those statues from Syracuse were brought into this city with hostile

                        —propitious as they are, and I hope will continue to be, if we allow them to

                        memory of our fathers, Pyrrhus, by his ambassador Cineas, made trial of the
                        dispositions, not only of our men, but of our women also, by offers of
                        presents: at that time the Oppian law, for restraining female luxury, had
                        not been made; and yet not one woman accepted a present. What, think you,
                        was the reason? <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> That for which our
                        ancestors made no provision by law on this subject: there was no luxury
                        existing which needed to be restrained. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As
                        diseases must necessarily be known before their remedies, so passions come
                        into being before the laws which prescribe limits to them. What called forth
                        the Licinian law, restricting estates to five hundred acres, but the
                        unbounded desire for enlarging estates? <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>

                            the Cincian law, about ten years before this time, the advocates who
                            pleaded in the courts received fees and presents: and as all or most of
                            these were senators, the plebeians are here represented as tributary to
                            the senate. By the above law they were forbidden to receive either fees
                            or presents. </note> had become <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                        vassals and tributaries to the senate? It is not therefore in any degree
                        surprising, that no want of the Oppian law, or of any other, to limit the
                        expenses of the women, was felt at that time, when they refused to receive
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> gold and purple that was thrown in
                        their way, and offered to their acceptance. If Cineas were now to go round
                        the city with his presents, he would find numbers of women standing in the
                        public streets to receive them. There are some passions, the causes or
                        motives <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> of which I can no way account
                        for. For that that should not be lawful for you which is permitted to
                        another, may perhaps naturally excite some degree of shame or indignation;
                        yet, when the dress of all is alike, why should any one of you fear, lest
                        she should not be an object of observation? Of all kinds of shame, the
                        worst, surely, is <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> the being ashamed of
                        frugality or of poverty; but the law relieves you with regard to both; since
                        that which you have not it is unlawful for you to possess. This
                        equalization, says the rich matron, is <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                        the very thing that I cannot endure. Why do not I make <pb n="1495"
                            xml:id="p.1495"/> a figure, distinguished with gold and purple? Why is
                        the poverty of others concealed under this cover of a law, so that it should
                        be thought that, if the law permitted, they would have such things as they
                        are not now able to procure? Romans, do you wish to excite among your wives
                        an emulation of this sort, that the rich <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                        should wish to have what no other can have; and that the poor, lest they
                        should be despised as such, should extend their expenses beyond their means?
                        Be assured, that when a woman once begins to be ashamed of what she ought
                        not to be ashamed <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> of, she will not be
                        ashamed of what she ought. She who can, will purchase out of her own purse;
                        she who cannot, will ask her husband. Unhappy is the husband, both he who
                        complies with the <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> request, and he who
                        does not; for what he will not give himself, he will see given by another.
                        Now, they openly solicit <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> favours from
                        other women's husbands; and, what is more, solicit a law and votes. From
                        some they obtain them; although, with regard to yourself, your property, or
                        your children, they would be inexorable. So soon as the law shall cease to
                        limit the expenses of your wife, you yourself will never be able to do so.
                        Do not suppose that the matter will hereafter be in the same state in which
                        it was before the law was made on the subject. It is safer that a wicked man
                            <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> should even never be accused, than
                        that he should be acquitted; and luxury, if it had never been meddled with,
                        would be more tolerable than it will be, now, like a wild beast, irritated
                        by having been chained, and then let loose. My opinion is, that the Oppian
                        law ought, on no account, to be repealed. Whatever determination you may
                        come to, I pray all the gods to prosper it. </quote>

                    Then Lucius Valerius spoke thus in support of the measure which he himself had
                    introduced: —"If private persons only had stood forth to argue for and against

                    matrons, than in arguing against the measure proposed; and even went so far as
                    to mention a doubt, whether the matrons had committed the conduct which he
                    censured in them spontaneously or at our instigation. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> I shall defend the measure, not ourselves: for the consul
                    threw out those insinuations against us, rather for argument's sake, than as a

                    cabal and sedition; and, sometimes, secession of the women: because the matrons
                    had requested of you, in the public streets, that, in this time of peace, when
                    the commonwealth is flourishing and happy, you would repeal a law that was made

                    austere. What new thing, let me ask, have the matrons done in coming out into

                    how often they have done the same, and always to the advantage of the public. In
                    the earliest period of our history, even in the reign of Romulus, when the
                    Capitol had been taken by the Sabines, and a pitched battle <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> was fought in the forum, was not the fight stopped by the
                    interposition of the matrons between the two armies? When, after the expulsion
                    of the kings, the legions of the Volscians, under the command of Marcius
                    Coriolanus, were encamped at the fifth stone, did not the matrons turn away that
                    army, which would have overwhelmed this city? Again, when Rome was taken by the
                    Gauls, whence was the city ransomed? Did not the matrons, by unanimous
                    agreement, bring their gold into the public treasury? In the late war, not to go
                    back <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> to remote antiquity, when there was a
                    want of money, did not the funds of the widows supply the treasury? And when
                    even new gods were invited hither to the relief of our distressed affairs, did
                    not the matrons go out in a body to the sea-shore to receive the Idaean Mother?
                    The cases, you will say, are dis- <pb n="1497" xml:id="p.1497"/> similar. It is

                    chastity of our females? Now, is there a man among you who does not know that
                    this is a new law, passed not more than twenty years ago, in the consulate of

                    abandoning themselves to luxury on its being repealed? For, if that law had been
                    passed for the purpose of setting a limit to the passions of the sex, there
                    would be reason to fear lest the repeal of it might operate as an incitement to

                    passed, the time itself will show. Hannibal was then in Italy, victorious at

                    on condition of their price being paid to the owners at the end of the war. The

                    and other matters, which the exigencies of the war required, to be paid for at

                        alive, but of being buried with it when dead; and shall we interdict the use
                        of purple to women alone? <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> And when you,
                        the husband, may wear purple in your great coat, will you not suffer your

                        caparisoned than your wife is clothed? <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> But
                        with respect to purple, which will be worn out and consumed, I can see an
                        unjust, indeed, but still a sort of reason, for parsimony; but with respect
                        to gold, in which, excepting the price of the workmanship, there is no
                        waste, what objection can there be? It rather serves as a reserve fund for
                        both public and private exigencies, as you have already experienced. He says
                        there will be no emulation between individuals, when no one is possessed of

                        grief and indignation to all, when they see those ornaments allowed to the
                        wives of the Latin confederates of which they themselves have been deprived;
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> when they see those riding through the

                        obliged to follow on foot, as if the seat of empire were in the country of
                        the others, not in their own. This would hurt the feelings even of men, and
                        what do you think must be its effect on those of weak women, whom even
                        trifles can disturb? <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Neither offices of

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> At that time, as at present, Emporiae
                    consisted of two towns, separated by a wall. One was inhabited by Greeks from
                    Phocaea, whence the Massilians also derive their origin; the other by Spaniards.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The Greek town, being open towards the
                    sea, had but a small extent of wall, not above four hundred paces in circuit;
                    but the Spanish town, being farther back from the sea, had a wall three thousand
                    paces in circumference. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> A third kind of
                    inhabitants was added by the deified Caesar settling a Roman colony there, after
                    the final defeat of the sons of Pompey. At present they are all incorporated in
                    one mass; the Spaniards first, and, at length, the Greeks; having been adopted
                    into the Roman citizenship. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Whoever had, at
                    that period, observed the Greeks exposed on one side to the open sea, and on the
                    other to the Spaniards, a fierce and warlike race, would have wondered by what
                    cause they were preserved. Deficient in strength, they guarded against danger by
                    regular discipline; of which, among even more powerful people, the best
                    preservative is fear. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> That part of the wall
                    which faced the country, they kept strongly fortified, having but one gate, at
                    which some one of the magistrates was continually on guard. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> During the night, a third part of the citizens kept watch
                    on the walls, posting their watches, and going their rounds, not merely from the
                    force of custom, or in compliance with the law, but with as much vigilance as if
                    an enemy were at their gates. They never admitted any Spaniard into the city,
                    nor did they go outside the walls without precaution. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> The passage to the sea was open to every one: but, through
                    the gate, next to the Spanish town, none ever passed, but in a large body; these
                    were generally the third division, which had watched on the walls the preceding
                    night. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The cause of their going out was this:
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> the Spaniards, ignorant of maritime
                    affairs, were fond of trafficking with them, and glad of an opportunity of
                    purchasing, for their own use, the foreign goods, which the others imported in
                    their ships; and, at the same time, of finding a market for the produce of their
                    lands. The desire of this mutual intercourse caused the Spanish town to be
                    freely open to the Greeks. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> They were thus the
                    more protected as being sheltered under the friendship of the Romans, which they

                    possessed of equal resources, as the Massilians. On this account they received

                    short delay, he spent the whole time in exercising his men. It happened to be

                    expected. The enemy, thinking that the Romans retired through fear, rushed out
                    of the gate, and filled the whole space between their own camp and the line of
                    their adversaries. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> While they were hastily
                    marshalling their troops, the consul, who had all his in readiness, and in
                    regular array, attacked them when in disorder. He caused the cavalry from <pb

                    those on the right were immediately repulsed, and, retiring in disorder, spread
                    confusion among the infantry also. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> On seeing
                    this, the consul ordered two chosen cohorts to march round the right flank of
                    the enemy, and show themselves on their rear, before the two lines of infantry
                    could close. The alarm which this gave the enemy, which had been thrown to a
                    disadvantage by the cowardice of the Roman horse, restored the fight to an
                    equality. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But such a panic had taken
                    possession of both the cavalry and infantry of the right wing, that the consul
                    laid hold of several with his own hand, and turned them about with their faces

                    were both hard pressed in in front; and looked back, with timidity, at the

                    and large javelins, they drew their swords, the battle, in a manner, began anew.

                    fatigue, he reanimated their courage by bringing up into the fight some
                    subsidiary cohorts from the second line. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> These
                    formed a new front, and being fresh themselves, and with fresh weapons attacking
                    the wearied enemy in the form of a wedge, by a furious onset they first forced
                    their way through them; and then, when they were once broken, scattered them and

                    their camp across the fields with all the speed they could make. When Cato saw
                    the rout become general, he rode back to the second legion, which had been
                    posted in reserve, and ordered the standards to be borne before it, and that it
                    should advance in quick motion, and attack the camp of the enemy. <milestone

                    forward beyond his rank, he himself rode up and struck them with his javelin,

                        unit="section"/> By this time the camp of the enemy was attacked, though the
                    Romans were kept off from the works by stones, poles, and weapons of every sort.
                    But, on the arrival of the fresh legion, <pb n="1507" xml:id="p.1507"/> the
                    assailants assumed new courage, and the enemy fought with redoubled fury in
                    defence of their rampart. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The consul
                    attentively examined every place himself, that he might break in at that quarter
                    where he saw the weakest resistance. At a gate on the left, he observed that the
                    guard was thin, and thither he led the first-rank men and spearmen of the second
                    legion. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The party posted at the gate were not
                    able to withstand their assault; while the rest, seeing the enemy within the
                    rampart, abandoned the defence of the camp, and threw away their standards and
                    arms. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Great numbers were killed at the gates,
                    being stopped in the narrow passages by the throng of their own men; and the
                    soldiers of the second legion cut off the hindmost, while the rest were
                    plundering the camp. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> According to the account
                    of Valerius Antias, there were above forty thousand of the enemy killed on that
                    day. Cato himself, who was certainly no disparager of his own merits, says that
                    a great many were killed, but he specifies no number. </p>

                    deserving of commendation in three particulars. First, in leading round his army
                    so far from his camp and fleet, as to fight the battle in the very middle of the
                    enemy, that his men might look for no safety but in their courage. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> Secondly, in throwing the cohorts on the enemy's
                    rear. Thirdly, in ordering the second legion, when all the rest were disordered
                    by the eagerness of their pursuit, to advance at a full pace to the gate of the
                    camp, in compact and regular order under their standards. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> He delayed not to improve his victory; but having sounded a
                    retreat, and brought back his men laden with spoil, he allowed them a few hours
                    of the night for rest; and then led them out to ravage the country. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> They spread their depredations the wider, as the
                    enemy were dispersed in their flight; and this circumstance, no less than the
                    defeat of the preceding day, obliged the Spaniards of Emporiae, and those of
                    their neighbourhood, to make a submission. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Many also, belonging to other states, who had made their escape to Emporiae,
                    surrendered; all of whom the consul received with kindness, and after refreshing
                    them with victuals and wine, dismissed to their several homes. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> He quickly decamped thence, and wherever the army proceeded
                    on its march, he was met by ambassadors, surrendering their respective states;
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> so that, by the <pb n="1508"

                    the Ebro was in a state of perfect subjection; and the Roman prisoners, and
                    those of their allies and the Latin confederates, who by various chances had
                    fallen into the hands of the enemies in Spain, were brought back by the
                    barbarians, as an offering to the consul. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A
                    rumour afterwards spread abroad, that Cato intended to lead his army into
                    Turditania; and it was given out, with equal falsehood, that he meant to proceed
                    to the remote inhabitants of the mountains. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> On

                    but the Roman, marching thither, reduced them to subjection without any battle
                    worthy of narration. Not very long after, when the consul returned to Tarraco,
                    and before he removed to any other place, the same persons revolted again.

                    of three proposals: first, to come over, if they wished, it, to the Romans, and
                    receive double the pay for which they had agreed with the Turditanians:

                    determined on war, they should appoint a day and place to decide the matter with
                    him by arms. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Celtiberians desired a day's
                    time for consideration; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> and an assembly was
                    held, but in great confusion, from the Turditanians mingling in it, so that no

                    uncertain whether there was to be war or peace with the Celtiberians, the
                    Romans, nevertheless, just as though the latter were determined on, brought
                    provisions from the lands and forts of the enemy, and soon ventured to go within
                    their fortifications, relying on private truces, as they would on a common

                    not to stir from that spot until he himself should come to them; and then he led
                    round the rest of the men to the farther side of the town. The greater part of
                    his auxiliary troops were Suessetanians, and these he ordered to advance and

                    their arms and standards, and remembering how often they had themselves, with

                    often defeated and routed them in pitched battles, hastily threw open a gate,

                    was silence and solitude, in consequence of the Lacetanians having sallied out

                    these censures on the Aetolians, the Roman general said, that <quote> he had

                        incensed against those people, that the general resentment required rather
                        to be appeased than irritated. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Satisfied,
                        therefore, with the sentiments entertained of the Romans, and of the
                        Aetolians, he would simply put this question: What was the general opinion
                        concerning war with Nabis, in case of his refusing to restore Argos to the
                        Achaeans? </quote> When all had pronounced for war, he recommended to them,

                    each state in proportion to its ability. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He
                    even sent an ambassador to the Aetolians; rather to make them disclose their

                    tribunes, to bring up the army from Elatia. To the ambassadors of Antiochus,
                    who, at this time, proposed to treat of an alliance, he answered, that <quote>
                        he could say nothing on the subject in the absence of the ten ambassadors.

                    Next day they marched down into the plains of Argos, and fixed their post about

                    Quinctius, when commencing an enterprise of no easy nature, king Eumenes and the

                    Covered galleries were soon brought up; the wall was undermined, and, at the

                    frequent shocks given with these, one of the towers was thrown down, and, by its
                    fall, the adjoining wall on each side was laid flat. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> The Romans, on this, attempted to force in, both on the
                    side next the port, to which the approach was more level than to the rest,
                    hoping to divert the enemy's attention from the more open passage, and, at the
                    same time, to enter the breach caused by the falling of the wall. <milestone

                    into the town, when the assault was suspended by the prospect which was held out
                    of the surrender of the city. This, however, was subsequently dissipated.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Dexagoridas and Gorgopas commanded there,
                    with equal authority. Dexagoridas had sent to the Roman general a message that

                    time and the mode of proceeding had been agreed on, he was slain as a traitor by
                    Gorgopas, and the defence of the city was maintained with redoubled vigour by
                    this single commander. The further prosecution of the siege would have been much
                    more difficult, had not Titus Quinctius arrived with a body of four thousand
                    chosen men. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> He showed his army in order of
                    battle, on the brow of a hill at a small distance from the city; and, on the
                    other side, Lucius Quinctius plied the enemy hard with his engines, both on the
                    quarter of the sea, and of the land; on which Gorgopas was compelled to adopt
                    that proceeding, which, in the case of another, he had punished with death.

                    Pellene, with a thousand mercenary soldiers, and two thousand Argives, came to

                    the enemy, and that he was totally excluded from the sea, he considered that he
                    must yield to fortune. He first sent a messenger into the Roman camp, to learn
                    whether permission would be given to send ambassadors. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> This being consented to, Pythagoras came to the general,
                    with no other commission than to propose a conference between that commander and
                    the tyrant. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> A council was summoned on the
                    proposal, and every one present agreeing in opinion that a conference should be

                    came, with moderate escorts, to some hills in the interjacent ground; and
                    leaving their cohorts there, in posts open to the view of both parties, they
                    went down to the place of meeting; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Nabis
                    attended by a select party of his body-guards; Quinctius by his brother, king
                    Eumenes, Sosilaus, the Rhodian, Aristaenus, praetor of the Achaeans, and a few

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Then the tyrant, having the choice given him
                    either to speak first or to listen, began thus: <quote> Titus Quinctius, and you
                        who are present, if I could collect from my own reflections the reason of
                        your having either declared or actually made war against me, I should have
                        waited in silence the issue of my destiny. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        But in the present state of things, I could not repress my desire of
                        knowing, before I am ruined, the cause for which my ruin is resolved on.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> And in truth, if you were such men as
                        the Carthaginians are represented to be,-men who considered the obligation
                        of faith, pledged in alliances, as in no degree sacred, I should not wonder
                        if you were the less scrupulous with respect to your conduct towards me.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> But, instead of that, when I look at
                        you, I perceive that you are Romans: men who allow treaties to be the most
                        solemn of religious acts, and faith, pledged therein, the strongest of human
                        ties. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Then, when I look back at myself, I
                        am confident I am one who, as a member of the community, am, in common with
                        the rest of the Lacedaemonians, included in a treaty subsisting with you, of
                        very ancient date; and likewise have, lately, during the war with Philip,
                        concluded anew, in my own name, a personal friendship and alliance with you.
                        But it appears I have violated and cancelled that treaty, by holding
                        possession of the city of Argos. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> In what
                        manner shall I defend this? <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> By the
                        consideration of the fact, <pb n="1522" xml:id="p.1522"/> or of the time.
                        The consideration of the fact furnishes me with a twofold defence: for, in
                        the first place, in consequence of an invitation from the inhabitants
                        themselves, and of their voluntary act of surrender, I accepted the
                        possession of that city, and did not seize it by force. In the next place, I
                        accepted it, when the city was in league with Philip, not in alliance with
                        you. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Then the consideration of the time
                        acquits me, inasmuch as when I was in actual possession of Argos, the
                        alliance was entered into between you and me, and you stipulated that I
                        should send you aid against Philip, not that I should withdraw my garrison
                        from that city. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> In this dispute,
                        therefore, so far as it relates to Argos, I have unquestionably the
                        advantage, both from the equity of the proceeding, as I gained possession of
                        a city which belonged not to you, but to your enemy; and as I gained it by
                        its own voluntary act, and not by forcible compulsion; <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> and also from your own acknowledgment; since, in the
                        articles of our alliance, you left Argos to me. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> But then, the name of tyrant, and my conduct, are
                        strong objections against me: that I call forth slaves to a state of
                        freedom; that I carry out the indigent part of the populace, and give them
                        settlements in lands. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> With respect to the
                        title by which I am styled, I can answer thus: That, let me be what I may, I
                        am the same now that I was at the time when you yourself, Titus Quinctius,
                        concluded an alliance with me. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> I
                        remember, that I was then styled king by you; now, I see, I am called
                        tyrant. If, therefore, I had since altered the style of my office, I might
                        have an account to render of my fickleness: as you choose to alter it, that
                        account should be rendered by you. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> As to
                        what relates to the augmenting the number of the populace, by giving liberty
                        to slaves, and the distribution of lands to the needy; on this head, too, I
                        might defend myself by a reference to time. <milestone n="15" unit="section"
                        /> These measures, of what complexion soever they are, I had practised
                        before you formed friendship with me, and received my aid in the war against
                        Philip. But, if I did the same things, at this moment, I would not say to
                        you, how did I thereby injure you, or violate the friendship subsisting
                        between us? <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> but that, in so doing, I
                        acted agreeably to the practice and institutions of my ancestors. Do not
                        estimate what is done at Lacedaemon by the standard of your own laws and
                        constitution. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> There is no necessity for
                        comparing <pb n="1523" xml:id="p.1523"/> particular institutions: you are
                        guided in your choice of a horseman, by the quantity of his property; in
                        your choice of a foot soldier, by the quantity of his property; and your
                        plan is, that a few should abound in wealth, and that the body of the people
                        should be in subjection to them. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> Our
                        lawgiver did not choose that the administration of government should be in
                        the hands of a few, such as you call a senate; or that this or that order of
                        citizens should have a superiority over the rest: but he considered that, by
                        equalizing the property and dignity of all, he should multiply the number of
                        those who were to bear arms for their country. <milestone n="19"

                        that the sum of the whole might be comprised in few words: that, since I
                        first commenced a friendship with you, I have given you no just cause to

                    the city, sent persons to bring up all the marine forces from Gythium; and, in

                    take a view of the situation of the place. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In
                    former times, Sparta had no wall; of late, the tyrants had built walls in the
                    places where the ground was open and level; but the higher places, and those
                    more difficult of access, they secured by placing guards of soldiers instead of
                    fortifications. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When he had sufficiently
                    examined every circumstance, having resolved on making a general assault, he
                    surrounded the city with all his forces, the number of which, Romans and allies,
                    horse and foot, naval and land forces, all together, amounted to fifty thousand
                    men. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Some brought scaling-ladders, some
                    fire-brands, some other matters, wherewith they might not only assail the enemy,
                    but strike terror. The orders were, that on raising the shout, all should
                    advance at once, in order that the Lacedaemonians, being alarmed at the same
                    time in every quarter, might be at a loss where, first, to make head, or whither
                    to bring aid. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The main force of his army he
                    formed in three divisions, and ordered one to attack on the side of the Phœbeum,
                    another on that of the Dictynneum, and the third near a place called
                    Heptagoniae, all which are open places without walls. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Though surrounded on all sides by such a violent alarm, the

                    confusion that prevailed all around, as to become incapable either of giving
                    proper directions, or of hearing what was said, and to lose, not only his

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> For some time the Lacedaemonians maintained
                    their ground against the Romans, in the narrow passes; and three armies, on each
                    side, fought, at one time, in different places. <milestone n="2" unit="section"
                    /> Afterwards, when the heat of the contest increased, the contest was, by no
                    means, an equal one: for the Lacedaemonians fought with missile arms, against
                    which the Roman soldiers, by means of their large shields, easily defended
                    themselves, and many of their blows either missed, or were very weak; <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> for, the narrowness of the place causing them to be
                    closely crowded together, they neither had room to discharge their weapons with
                    a previous run, which gives great force to them, nor clear and steady footing
                    while they made their throw <pb n="1531" xml:id="p.1531"/> Of those, therefore,
                    discharged against the <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> front of the Romans,
                    none pierced their bodies, few even their shields; but several were wounded by
                    those who surrounded them from higher places. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    And presently, when they advanced a little, they were hurt unawares, both with
                    javelins, and tiles also thrown from the tops of the houses. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> On this they raised their shields over their heads; and
                    joining them so close together as to leave no room for injury from such random
                    casts, or even for the insertion of a javelin, by a hand within reach, they
                    pressed forward under cover of this tortoise fence. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> For some time the narrow streets, being thronged with a
                    multitude of their own soldiers, and also of the enemy, considerably retarded
                    the progress of the Romans; but when once, by gradually pushing back the enemy,
                    they gained the wider streets of the city, the impetuosity of their attack could
                    no longer be withstood. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> While the
                    Lacedaemonians, having turned their backs, fled precipitately to the higher
                    places, Nabis, being utterly confounded, as if the town were already taken,
                    began to look about for a way to make his escape. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> Pythagoras, while in other respects he displayed the spirit
                    and conduct of a general, was now the sole means of saving the city from being
                    taken. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> For he ordered the buildings nearest
                    to the wall to be set on fire; and these being instantly in a blaze, those who,
                    on another occasion, would have brought help to extinguish the fire, now helping
                    to increase it, the roofs tumbled on the Romans; <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> and not only fragments of the tiles, but also the
                    half-burned timber, reached the soldiers: the flames spread wide, and the smoke
                    caused a degree of terror even greater than the danger. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> In consequence, the Romans who were without the city, and
                    were just then making the principal attack, retired from the wall; and those who
                    were within, fearing lest the fire, rising behind them, should put it out of
                    their power to rejoin the rest of the army, began to retreat. Whereupon
                    Quinctius, seeing how matters stood, ordered a general retreat to be sounded.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> —Thus, being at length recalled from a

                    in a continual alarm during the three succeeding days; sometimes harassing them
                    with assaults, sometimes <pb n="1532" xml:id="p.1532"/> enclosing several places

                    disdain, ordering him to quit the camp; but afterwards, on his suppliant
                    entreaties, and throwing himself at his feet, he admitted him to an audience.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The purport of his discourse, at first,
                    was, an offer of implicit submission to the will of the Romans; but this availed

                    truce should be made on the conditions delivered in writing a few days before,
                    and the money and hostages were accordingly received. <milestone n="5"

                    of Pythagoras, with the strongest part of his garrison, looked now with contempt

                    passed by only three senators in the whole, none of whom had enjoyed the honour
                    of a curule office. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They obtained, on another
                    account, the highest degree of credit with that body; for, at the celebration of
                    the Roman games, they ordered the curule aediles to set apart places for the
                    senators, distinct from those of the people, whereas, hitherto, all the
                    spectators used to sit promiscuously. Of the knights, also, very few were
                    deprived of their horses; nor was severity shown towards any rank of men. The
                    gallery of the temple of Liberty, and the Villa Publica, were repaired and
                    enlarged by the same censors. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The sacred

                    thrown into prison, procured men who were to set fire by night to several parts
                    of the city at once, in order that, while the town was thrown into consternation
                    by this nocturnal disturbance, the prison might be broken open. <milestone n="8"

                    the affair was laid before the senate. Pleminius was thrown into a lower
                    dungeon, and there put to death. </p>

                    ordered his men to take arms, and kept them quiet, under arms, for some time;
                    both to add to the foolish confidence of the enemy, and to arrange his troops at

                    legion, had taken a course often tried in desperate conflicts; snatching the
                    standards from the officers who carried them, and throwing them among the enemy.

                    on the opposite side of the camp. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The Gauls
                    had broke in by the Quaestorian gate, and had slain the quaestor, Lucius
                    Postumius, surnamed Tympanus, with Marcus Atinius and Publius Sempronius,
                    praefects of the allies, <pb n="1538" xml:id="p.1538"/> who made an obstinate

                    /> The camp in that part had been taken, when a cohort of those who are called
                    Extraordinaries, having been sent by the consul to defend the Quaestorian gate,
                    killed some who had got within the rampart, drove out the rest, and opposed
                    others who were attempting to break in. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> About
                    the same time, the fourth legion, and two cohorts of Extraordinaries, burst out
                    of the gate; and thus there were three battles, in different places, round the
                    camp; while the various kinds of shouts raised by them, called off the attention
                    of the combatants from their own immediate conflict to the uncertain casualties
                    which threatened their friends. The battle was maintained until mid-day with
                    equal strength, and with nearly equal hopes. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    At length, the fatigue and heat so far got the better of the soft relaxed bodies
                    of the Gauls, who are incapable of enduring thirst, as to make most of them give
                    up the fight; and the few who stood their ground, were attacked by the Romans,
                    routed, and driven to their camp. The consul then gave the signal for retreat,
                    on which the greater part retired; but some, eager to continue the fight, and
                    hoping to get possession of the camp, pressed forward to the rampart, on which
                    the Gauls, despising their small number, rushed out in a body. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> The Romans were then routed in turn, and compelled, by
                    their own fear and dismay, to retreat to their camp, which they had refused to
                    do at the command of their general. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Thus now
                    flight and now victory alternated on both sides. The Gauls, however, had eleven
                    thousand killed, the Romans but five thousand. The Gauls retreated into the
                    heart of their country, and the consul led his legions to Placentia. <milestone

                    required too much time, it was referred to the ten ambassadors, some of whom had
                    conferred with the king in Asia, or at Lysimachia. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Directions were given to Titus Quinctius, that, in

                    ambassadors, and should give them such answer as comported with the dignity and
                    interest of the Roman people. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> At the head of
                    the embassy were Menippus and Hegesianax; the former of whom said, that <quote>

                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Now, there were three kinds of
                        treaties, by which kings and states formed friendships with each other: one,
                        when terms were dictated to a people vanquished in war; for after all their
                        possessions have been surrendered to him who has proved superior in war, he
                        has the sole power of judging and determining what portion of them the
                        vanquished shall hold, and of what they shall be deprived. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> The second, when parties, equally matched in war,
                        conclude a treaty of peace and friendship on terms of equality; for then
                        demands are proposed and restitution made, reciprocally, in a convention;
                        and if, in consequence of the war, confusion has arisen with respect to any
                        parts of their properties, the matter is adjusted on the footing either of
                        an- <pb n="1547" xml:id="p.1547"/> cient right or of the mutual convenience
                        of the parties. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The third kind was, when
                        parties who had never been foes, met to form a friendly union by a social
                        treaty: these neither dictate nor receive terms, for that is the case
                        between a victor and a party vanquished. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                        As Antiochus came under this last description, he wondered, he said, that
                        the Romans should think it becoming to dictate terms to him; as to which of
                        the cities of Asia they chose should be free and independent, which should
                        be tributary, and which of them the king's troops and the king himself
                        should be prohibited to enter. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> That a

                        after they had been seized by the Thracians, Antiochus had, with equal
                        honour, recovered by force of arms; as well as others which had been
                        deserted, —as Lysimachia, for instance, he had repeopled, by calling home

                        in another country, he was still able to propagate designs for changing the

                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Aristo, being summoned, contended for his
                    innocence; and urged, as his strongest defence, that he had brought no letter to

                    satisfactory reason for his coming, and was chiefly embarrassed by the fact

                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> A warm debate ensued; some earnestly

                    while others insisted, that there were not sufficient grounds for such violent

                        step that afforded a bad precedent; for that the same would happen to the

                    Aristo practised on the Carthaginians a Carthaginian artifice; for having early

                    city, over the tribunal where the magistrates daily sat, he went on board his
                    ship at the third watch, and fled. Next day, when the suffetes had taken their
                    seats to administer justice, the tablet was observed, taken down, and read.

                    being thus thrown on the state, less pains were taken in searching into the

                    however, it was determined, that ambassadors should be sent to Rome, to
                    represent the affair to the consuls and the senate, and, at the same time, to

                    were looked on with jealousy by others, and were full of dissensions among

                    that, at such a conjuncture, he might successfully encroach on their rights; and
                    accordingly he laid waste their country along the sea-coast, and compelled
                    several cities, which were tributary to the Carthaginians, to pay their taxes to

                    tract, but, with respect to a considerable part of it, disputed the right of
                    possession with the Carthaginians; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> and when he
                    learned that they were sending to Rome, both to justify their conduct, and, at

                    What contributed chiefly to strengthen a suspicion of evil designs, was, that

                        solicited as a favour a passage through that very district, as being
