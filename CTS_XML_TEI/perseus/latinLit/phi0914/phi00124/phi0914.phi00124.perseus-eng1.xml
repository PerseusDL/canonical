                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> HAVING returned from Campania to the land of
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 215</note> the
                    Bruttii, Hanno, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> He had been with
                        Hannibal around Nola, and was sent back to the country of the Bruttii;
                        XXIII. xlvi. 8. </note> with the Bruttii as supporters and guides, attacked
                    the Greek cities, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Operations against
                        Regium, Locri and Croton, barely mentioned in XXIII. xxx. 6 ff., are given
                        here in greater detail. It is late autumn, <date when="-0215">215
                            B.C.</date>
                    </note> which were all the more ready to remain in alliance with Rome because
                    they saw that the Bruttii, whom they both hated and feared, had gone over to the
                    side of the Carthaginians. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Regium was the
                    first city to be attacked, and some days were spent there to no purpose.
                    Meantime the Locrians hastily brought grain and wood and the other things needed
                    to supply their wants from the farms into the city, also that no booty might be
                    left for the enemy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> And every day a larger
                    crowd poured out of all the gates. Finally there were left in the city only six
                    hundred men, who were made to repair walls and gates and to carry arms to the
                    battlements. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Against the multitude made up of
                    all ages and classes, wandering about the country, many of the unarmed, Hamilcar
                    the Carthaginian sent out his cavalry. Forbidden to injure anyone, they
                    interposed their squadrons merely to shut off from the city those who had
                    scattered in flight. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The commander himself,
                    after capturing higher ground from which he could see the country and the city,
                    ordered a cohort of Bruttii <pb n="p.177"/> to go up to the walls and call out
                    the chief men of <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        215</note> the Locrians to a conference, and with a promise of Hannibal's
                    friendship to encourage them to surrender the city. In the conference the
                    Bruttians at first were not believed at all. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Then, when the Carthaginians were seen on the hills, and a few returning
                    fugitives repeatedly asserted that all the rest of the multitude were in the
                    power of the enemy, overcome by fear, they answered that they would consult the
                    people. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> An assembly being at once called, all
                    the fickle preferred political change and a new alliance; also those whose
                    relations had been shut off outside the city by the enemy had mortgaged their
                    affections, having virtually given hostages. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    And the few silently approved of steadfast loyalty, rather than dared to declare
                    and defend it. Hence surrender to the Carthaginians was voted with apparently
                    unquestioned unanimity. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> After Lucius Atilius,
                    commander of the garrison, and the Roman soldiers who were with him had been
                    secretly led down to the harbour and put on ships to be carried to Regium, they
                    admitted Hamilcar and the Carthaginians into the city on condition that a treaty
                    be made at once on fair terms. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The promise of
                    such a treaty was almost broken after they surrendered, when the Carthaginian
                    charged that the Roman had been allowed by trickery to go away, while the
                    Locrians pleaded that he had escaped unaided. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    Also the cavalry pursued him in the hope that possibly the current in the strait
                    might delay the ships or bring them to shore. They did not indeed overtake the
                    men they were pursuing, but they sighted other ships crossing the strait from
                    Messana to Regium. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Not directly
                        opposite Messana, but about seven miles to the southeast. </note> It was the
                    Roman soldiers sent by Claudius, the <pb n="p.179"/> praetor, to garrison and
                    hold the city. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> And so the <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 215</note> siege of
                    Regium was at once raised. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Peace was granted
                    the Locrians by Hannibal's order: they were, namely, to live in freedom under
                    their own laws, the city to be open to the Carthaginians, the harbour in the
                    power of the Locrians, the alliance to rest upon this basis: that the
                    Carthaginian should help the Locrian, the Locrian the Carthaginian, in peace and
                    in war. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Thus the Carthaginians were withdrawn from the
                    strait, though the Bruttians were indignant because they had left Regium and
                    Locri untouched, the cities which they had counted upon plundering. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> And so without aid they enlisted and armed 15,000 of
                    their young men and set out to besiege Croton, another Greek city and on the
                    sea, believing <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> that it would be a great
                    addition to their resources if they should hold a fortified city and harbour on
                    the seacoast. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> It troubled them that they did
                    not quite dare not to call the Carthaginians to their aid, for fear they might
                    seem to have failed to act as became allies. At the same time they feared that,
                    if the Carthaginian should again be rather an arbiter of peace than a helper in
                    war, fighting to secure freedom for Croton might be profitless, as previously
                    for Locri. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> And thus it seemed best to send
                    legates to Hannibal and gain assurance from him that Croton when captured should
                    belong to the Bruttians. Hannibal having replied that decision in the matter lay
                    with those on the ground, thus referring them to Hanno, they obtained no
                    definite answer from Hanno. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He did not wish a
                    city well-known and rich to be plundered, and he was hoping that, while the
                        <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> Bruttian was besieging them and the
                    Carthaginians <pb n="p.181"/> obviously neither approving nor helping the siege,
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 215</note> they
                    would all the more promptly come over to his side. At Croton there was among the
                    citizens no one policy or common preference. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    One malady, so to speak, had attacked all the city-states of Italy, that the
                    common people were at odds with the upper class, the senate inclining to the
                    Romans, the common people drawing the state to the side of the Carthaginians.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This disagreement in the city was reported
                    to the Bruttians by a deserter: that Aristomachus was the leader of the
                    plebeians and advised surrender of the city; also that in the sparsely inhabited
                    city, with its walls at a great distance, there were only scattered posts and
                    guards of the senators; that wherever plebeians were on guard there was free
                    access to the city. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> With the deserter as
                    adviser and leader the Bruttians completely encircled the city, and being
                    admitted by the plebeians, they took the whole city by assault, with the
                    exception of the citadel. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The optimates held
                    the citadel, having previously prepared a place of refuge for such an emergency.
                    To it Aristomachus also fled, as though he had advised surrendering the city to
                    the Carthaginians, not to the Bruttians. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The city of Croton had a wall with a circuit
                    of twelve miles before the coming of Pyrrhus to Italy. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> Since the desolation caused by that war scarcely half of
                    the city was inhabited. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> According to
                        XXIII. xxx. 6 the city now had less than 2000 inhabitants. </note> The river
                    which had flowed through the middle of the city now flowed past, outside the
                    quarters which had numerous houses, and the citadel was far from the inhabited
                    portions. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Six miles from the famous city was a
                    temple more <pb n="p.183"/> famous than the city itself, that of Lacinian Juno,
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Cp. XXIII. xxxiii. 4. At that
                        temple, the most celebrated shrine in Magna Graecia, Polybius found and used
                        Hannibal's own inscription in Punic and Greek, recording his successes
                        (Polyb. III. xxxiii. 18; lvi. 4), a document which Livy barely mentions
                        (XXVIII. xlvi. 16). A single column of the temple still stands on the
                        promontory. Livy is correct in regard to the distance from the city of
                        Croton ( <hi rend="italics">ca.</hi> 9 km.). </note>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 215</note> revered
                    by all the surrounding <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> peoples. There a sacred
                    grove, which was enclosed by dense woods and tall fir-trees, had in its centre
                    luxuriant pastures, where cattle of all kinds, being sacred to the goddess, used
                    to pasture without any <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> shepherd. And at night
                    the flocks of each kind would return separately to their stalls, being never
                    harmed by wild beasts lying in wait, nor by the dishonesty of <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> men. Therefore great profits were made from the cattle, and
                    out of the profits a massive golden column <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified"> Coelius the historian said that Hannibal, finding it
                        was not merely plated, decided to carry it away, but was deterred by a
                        dream; Cicero <hi rend="italics">de Div.</hi> I. 48. </note> was wrought and
                    consecrated. And the temple was famous for its wealth also, not merely for its
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> sanctity. They give it some pretended
                    marvels also, as generally in places so noted. It is reported that in the space
                    in front of the temple there is an altar whose ashes are never stirred by any
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> wind. But the citadel of Croton, on one
                    side overhanging the sea, while the other slopes down toward the country, was
                    once protected merely by its natural situation, but later encircled with a wall
                    also, where, along the cliffs on the farther side, it had been taken by ruse of
                    Dionysius, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Who captured Croton about
                            <date when="-0389">389 B.C.</date> and is said to have held it twelve
                        years. </note> tyrant of <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Sicily. In that
                    citadel, sufficiently safe, as it seemed, the optimates of Croton were at the
                    time maintaining themselves, besieged even by their own plebs as well as by the
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Bruttians. Finally the Bruttians, seeing
                    that the citadel was for their resources impregnable, were of necessity
                    constrained to beg aid of <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Hanno. He attempted
                    to compel the Crotonians to surrender on condition that they <pb n="p.185"/>
                    permit a colony of Bruttians to be established there, <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 215</note> and allow the city,
                    desolate and depopulated by wars, to recover its old-time <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> numbers. But among them all he prevailed upon no one except
                    Aristomachus. They claimed that they would sooner die than mingle with the
                    Bruttians and change to the rites, customs and laws, and presently even the
                    language, of another <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> people. Aristomachus,
                    since he was unable by persuasion to bring them to surrender and could find no
                    opportunity to betray the citadel, as he had betrayed the city, alone went over
                    to <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Hanno. Soon after that the Locrian legates
                    entered the citadel with Hanno's consent and persuaded them to allow themselves

                    Hieronymus at his very first appearance showed how different everything was,

                    all the tortures which pass human endurance, pretending to be mastered by his
                    sufferings, he turned informer against the innocent instead of against his
                    accomplices, and falsely stated that Thraso was responsible for the plan: that
                    they would not have ventured upon such an undertaking if they had not relied
                    upon so powerful a leader. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He also named

                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> His mentioning Thraso made the
                    information particularly credible to the mind of the tyrant. Accordingly Thraso
                    was forthwith handed over for execution, and the rest, equally innocent, shared
                    his punishment. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Not one of the accomplices
                    either hid himself or fled, though their partner in the plot was long under

                    asking him not to be rash in changing his loyalty. Hieronymus sent ambassadors
                    to Carthage to make a treaty in accordance with the alliance arranged with
                    Hannibal. The agreement was that, after they had driven the Romans out of Sicily

                    With this hope the Tarentines were sent away. He himself had conceived a great

                    and famous but also a seaport, and favourably placed in the direction of
                    Macedonia, and that accordingly King Philip, if he should cross into Italy,

                    thousand men and the place was defended by a wall also, not merely by nature.
                    There the Carthaginian tarried three days, attacking the garrison from every

                    was ravaging the country, he likewise left the city and pitched camp about a

                    he had been aware that there was murmuring in the column, as they asked whether

                    And he had written to the senate, not so much what they wanted as what they had

                    announced that the time had come for them to gain the freedom for which they so

                    the whole senate, for they had been consulted by him and had given him
                    permission in the matter of their freedom. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He
                    then read the letter of the consul and the decree of the senate. Upon that a

                    Romans more than that enemies' heads were made the price of freedom. For when a
                    man had boldly slain an enemy, in the first place he was wasting time in cutting

                        unit="section"/> and then, as his right hand was occupied in holding the

                    the spiritless and the fearful. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When the
                    tribunes of the soldiers reported' this to Gracchus: that they were not wounding
                    a single enemy standing, but butchering the fallen; and that in the soldier's
                    right hands there were human heads instead of swords, he ordered the command at

                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Their courage, he said, was sufficiently
                    clear and conspicuous, and for active men freedom would be beyond a doubt.
                    Thereupon the battle Was renewed, and the cavalry also charged the enemy.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Since the Numidians met this charge
                    gallantly and the cavalry battle was no less spirited than that of the infantry,
                    the issue was for the second time made doubtful. While the commanders on both
                    sides heaped abuse, the Roman on the Bruttians and Lucanians, so many times
                    defeated and subdued by their ancestors, the Carthaginian on the Roman slaves

                    declared that they had no reason to hope for freedom, unless on that day the

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Those words at last so fired their courage
                    that, as though they were suddenly different men, they raised a shout again and

                    the gates or on the wall. And the Romans, pursuing in almost unbroken column,
                    fought an entirely new battle while hemmed in by the enemies' wall. <milestone

                    slashed the Carthaginians from the rear and also hindered their flight.

                    without even seeing the enemy, was sternly rebuked by the consul, who went so
                    far as to say that it was his fault that the disaster suffered at Cannae was not

                    against an evil which they knew. As for civil strife, the Syracusans had heard
                    from their fathers, rather than seen for themselves, what disasters it brings.

                    For the present he approved of sending representatives to Adranodorus, to

                    began a session of the senate, which in the reign of Hiero had indeed continued
                    to be the council of state, yet since his death had not been called together nor
                    consulted about anything until that day. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When

                    oft-repeated utterance of Dionysius the tyrant, that one should leave a tyranny,
                    not on horseback, but dragged by the feet. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> It
                    was easy, she said, to give up the possession of an exalted station at any

                    said, not that he wished to separate his cause from that of the people, but

                    free, and that the common good was the aim of all, he had not hesitated to
                    surrender to the city his own person and in addition all that had been confided
                    to his honour and protection, since the man who had given that charge had been
                    destroyed by his own madness. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Turning then to

                    thanks at all the temples of the gods. On the next day elections for the naming
                    of magistrates were held. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Among the first so
                    named was Adranodorus, the rest largely assassins of the tyrant. Two who were
                    not even present, Sopater and Dinomenes, were elected. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> These, hearing what had been done at Syracuse, brought the

                    was on the Island was also transferred to Achradina. And that part of the wall
                    which shut off the Island from the rest of the city by a needlessly strong
                    fortification was thrown down by common consent. The other <pb n="p.251"/>

                    suspicion as seeking some opportunity for a revolution, they first came before

                        unit="section"/> They stated that, having been sent by Hannibal to
                    Hieronymus as his friend and ally, they had obeyed the orders of the man to whom
                    their own commander wished them to be obedient. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                    /> They wished to return to Hannibal; but since the way was unsafe while the
                    Romans were at large everywhere in Sicily, they asked the senators to give them
                    some escort to conduct them to Locri <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        >Cf. i. 2 ff.</note> in Italy. The senate, they said, would gain great
                    favour with Hannibal by a small service. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This
                    request was readily granted; for the senate greatly desired the departure of the
                    king's generals, as men skilled in military art, and, what was more, needy also
                    and daring. But they took no active steps to carry out their wish with the

                    from the crews of the Romans, at another even among the lowest of the people,
                    made charges against the senate and the aristocrats: <milestone n="11"

                    /> The latter was at length wearied by admonitions of his wife: that it was now
                    the time to seize the power, while everything was confused by the new freedom
                    not yet organized; while the soldiers one met were fattened on the king's pay;
                    while generals sent by Hannibal and familiar with the soldiers could aid the
                    undertaking. Accordingly he formed a plot with Themistus, whose wife was Gelo's
                    daughter, and after a few days rashly revealed it to one Aristo, a tragic actor,
                    to whom he had been in the habit of confiding other secrets. This man's family
                    and station were respectable and not tarnished by his artistic profession, since
                    among the Greeks nothing of the sort brings discredit. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> And so thinking that the loyalty he owed to his native city
                    took precedence, he reports the matter to the magistrates. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> They, finding from trustworthy information that this was
                    not unfounded, conferred with the older men, placed a guard at the doors on
                    their advice, and when Themistus and Adranodorus had entered the senate, slew
                    them. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> And after the confusion resulting from
                    an act even more terrible in appearance than in reality, since others were
                    unaware of the reason, they at length secured silence and brought the informer
                    into the Senate House. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He first told
                    everything in order: that the conspiracy had taken its start from the marriage
                    of Gelo's daughter Harmonia, uniting her with Themistus; <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> that African and Spanish auxiliaries had been made ready

                    moreover that a force of mercenaries accustomed to the orders of Adranodorus had
                    been provided, to occupy the Island again. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He
                    then set forth in detail what was to be done, and by whom, and pictured the
                    whole conspiracy manned and armed. And to the senators indeed they appeared to
                    have been slain with as much justice as Hieronymus. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> But in front of the Senate House there was shouting by the
                    mixed crowd unacquainted with the situation. Uttering wild threats, they were
                    checked by the corpses of the conspirators before the entrance to the Senate
                    House, in such fear that they silently followed the orderly populace to the
                    assembly. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Sopater was instructed by the

                    he were prosecuting them, he charged that every act of violence or impiety
                    committed since the death of Hiero had been done by Adranodorus and Themistus.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> For what could Hieronymus, a boy who had
                    hardly reached puberty, have done of his own motion? His guardians and teachers,
                    shielded by the embitterment directed against another, had been the real kings.
                    Accordingly they ought to have perished either before Hieronymus or at least
                    with Hieronymus. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But though doomed already and
                    marked for death, they had contrived fresh crimes since the death of the tyrant,

                    win the kingdom which he had sought in vain openly and above board, and could
                    not be won over even by the bestowal of public office. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> For among those who gained liberty for the state, he, a

                        unit="section"/> But their autocratic temper was due to their royal
                    consorts, Hiero's daughter married to the one, Gelo's daughter to the other.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Following this statement there arose in
                    all parts of the assembly a shout that none of those women ought to live, nor

                        unit="section"/> What of it that, if Adranodorus' plans had succeeded, the

                    no danger was indeed feared from her, that nevertheless the royal family was
                    hated. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Therefore they should send them far
                    from Syracuse and Sicily and bid them to be carried away to Alexandria, the wife

                    see some men drawing swords. Then ceasing entreaties for herself, she urgently
                    begged them at least to spare the girls —an age on which even enraged enemies do

                    upon the girls spattered with B.C. 214 their mother's blood. Beside themselves
                    for grief and fear, as though insane, they dashed out of the chapel with such
                    speed that, if there had been any escape to the street, they would have caused a

                    to encourage the men of the other party, the false charges apparently had
                    received strong confirmation. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> And at first the

                    decided to summon the people to an assembly. There while some inclined in one
                    direction, some in another, and an uprising was not far away, Apollonides, one
                    of the leading citizens, made a speech which was well-advised, considering the
                    crisis. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He said that neither the prospect of
                    safety nor that of destruction had ever been nearer to any state. <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> For if with one mind they should all incline, whether
                    to the Romans or to the Carthaginians, no state would be in a more highly
                    favoured and happier condition. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> If they pulled
                    in different directions, war between Carthaginians and Romans would not be more
                    cruel than that among the Syracusans themselves, since within the same walls
                    each side would have its own armies, its own weapons, its own generals.
                    Accordingly they must make the greatest effort to reach agreement. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> Which alliance was the more advantageous was a
                    question decidedly subordinate and of far less weight. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Yet Hiero's authority ought to be followed in choosing
                    allies rather than that of Hieronymus; in other words, a friendship which had
                    proved happy for fifty years should be preferred to one unknown at present and
                    formerly faithless. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For their decision it was
                    also of considerable importance that they could decline the Carthaginians' offer
                    of peace without necessarily waging war with them at once. With the Romans they
                    must straightway have either peace or-war. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                    less of party passion the speech seemed to have, the greater was its influence.
                    To the magistrates and picked senators they added a military council also.
                    Commanders of units and prefects of auxiliaries as well were ordered to take
                    part in the deliberations. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> After the question
                    had been repeatedly debated with <pb n="p.267"/> great contention, finally, as

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Not many days had elapsed, when ambassadors
                    from Leontini arrived, pleading for a force to defend their territory. The
                    request of this embassy seemed very timely for the purpose of relieving the city
                    of a disorderly and turbulent multitude and of sending away its leaders.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Hippocrates as magistrate was ordered to
                    lead the deserters thither. Many of the mercenary auxiliaries followed, making
                    four thousand armed men. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> That enterprise gave
                    joy both to the senders and the sent; for the one party were given a
                    long-desired opportunity for revolution, and the other rejoiced also to think
                    that the dregs of the city had been drained off. But they relieved the diseased
                    body, so to speak, merely for the moment, only to have it relapse presently into
                    a more serious ailment. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> For Hippocrates began,
                    at first with stealthy raids, to ravage lands on the border of the Roman
                    province. Later, when Appius had sent troops to protect the farms of the allies,
                    he made an attack with all his forces upon the unit on, guard duty facing him,
                    and many were slain. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Marcellus, being informed
                    of this, at once sent legates to Syracuse, to say that the promised peace had
                    been broken, and that a reason for war would never be wanting unless Hippocrates
                    and Epicydes should be sent far away, not merely from Syracuse, but from all
                    Sicily. Epicydes, to avoid being present under an accusation brought against his
                    absent brother, or else failing to do his part in provoking war, went likewise
                    to Leontini; and seeing that its citizens were sufficiently <pb n="p.269"/>
                    aroused against the Roman people, began also to <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 214</note> estrange them from the
                    Syracusans. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For, he explained, the Syracusans
                    had made an alliance with the Romans with the provision that all the states
                    which had been subject to the kings should be under their rule; <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> that now they were not satisfied with freedom, without also
                    being lords and masters. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They must therefore
                    report to them that the Lenities likewise thought it right that they should be
                    free, either because it was on the soil of their city that the tyrant fell, or
                    because there for the first time men shouted the summons to liberty, and
                    deserting the king's generals flocked to Syracuse. Accordingly either that
                    clause, he said, must be removed from the treaty, or else an alliance on such
                    terms was not to be accepted. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The multitude
                    was easily persuaded, and when the legates of the Syracusans complained of the
                    slaughter of the <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> Roman guard-post and also
                    bade Hippocrates and Epicydes go away to Locri or wherever they preferred,
                    provided they withdrew from Sicily, the people replied with spirit that they had
                    not instructed the Syracusans to make a treaty for them with the Romans, and
                    that they were not bound by treaties not of their own making. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> This was reported to the Romans by the Syracusans, who
                    stated that the men of Leontini were not subject to their authority; <milestone
                        n="12" unit="section"/> and that consequently the Romans would make war upon
                    them without violating the treaty made with Syracuse; also that they would
                    themselves not refuse to give help in the war, on condition that, when reduced
                    to subjection, the Leontini should again be under their authority, as had been
                    settled in the treaty. </p>

                    by the slaughter of men of the guard while negotiations were pending, that they
                    took the city at the first assault. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Hippocrates and Epicydes, on seeing that the walls were being taken and gates
                    forced, sought refuge with a few men in the citadel. Thence they fled secretly
                    by night to Herbesus. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Probably

                    column of eight thousand men, were met at the river Mylas by a messenger,
                    reporting that the city <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        >Leontini.</note> had been captured, but for the rest mingling the false
                    with the true: <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> that a general massacre of
                    soldiers and townspeople had occurred, and no adults, he thought, had survived;
                    that the city had been plundered, the property of the wealthy given away.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> On hearing news so terrible the column
                    halted, and in the general excitement the commanders —and they were Sosis and

                    The appearance of well-founded alarm had been lent to the falsehood by the
                    scourging and beheading of deserters, about two thousand men. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> But not one of the Leontinians or of the other soldiers had
                    been injured after the capture of the city; and, except what had been lost in
                    the first confusion of the capture of the city, all their property was being
                    restored to them. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And the soldiers,
                    complaining that their comrades had been betrayed to their death, could neither

                    and Epicydes, thinking that their plan to put themselves at the mercy of the

                    the report of the slaughter of their comrades, was not so much one which at

                    and the city guarded. But not all were afraid of the same persons or hated the
                    same men. Among the whole military class and a large part of the common people
                    the Roman name was hated. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> As for the generals
                    and a few of the best citizens, although they had been misled by the false news,
                    they were nevertheless more circumspect in the face of a danger more immediately
                    impending. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> And already Hippocrates <pb

                    common home, against attack by the Romans. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> By
                    this time one of the gates of the Hexapylon had been opened, and by it they had
                    begun to be admitted, when the generals intervened. And at first by their
                    military authority and by threats, then by using their personal influence to
                    restrain them, finally, when all was without affect, disregarding dignity they
                    prayed them not to betray their native city to former minions of the tyrant and
                    present seducers of the army. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But the ears of
                    the excited crowd were deaf to all that; and the gates were being forced with no
                    less violence from within than from without, and when all had been forced, the
                    column was admitted through the whole breadth of the Hexapylon. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> The generals with the younger citizens flee for refuge to
                    Achradina. The mercenary soldiers and deserters and such royal troops as were at
                    Syracuse swell the column of the enemy. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Thus
                    Achradina also is taken by assault, and all the magistrates, except those who
                    escaped in the midst of the uproar, are slain. Night put an end to the

                    assorted multitude elected Hippocrates and Epicydes generals. And Syracuse,
                    after the light of liberty had shone upon it for a short time, had fallen back
                    into its old-time servitude. </p>

                    by Appius by way of the harbour on a five-banker. The four-banker sent in

                    their entering the city, Hippocrates and Epicydes and their retinue advanced
                    beyond the gate to meet them. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The speaker for
                    the Romans said he was not bringing war, but aid and comfort to the Syracusans,
                    both to those who, escaping from the midst of the slaughter, had sought refuge
                    with the Romans, and to those who, subdued by their fear, were enduring a
                    slavery more shameful, not only than exile, but even than death; and that the
                    Romans would not leave the atrocious slaughter of their allies unavenged.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Accordingly, if a safe return to their
                    native city should be open to those who had sought refuge with the Romans, if
                    those responsible for the slaughter should be surrendered and their freedom and
                    laws restored to the Syracusans, there was no need of arms. If those conditions
                    should not be met, the Romans would wage war against every man who caused delay.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In reply Epicydes said that, if their
                    message had been addressed to his colleague and himself, they would have given
                    them an answer. When the Syracusan state should be under the control of the men
                    to whom they came, then let them return. Should they make war, they would find
                    from actual experience that to attack Syracuse was by no means the same as <pb

                <p> Thereupon began the siege of Syracuse at the same time by land and by sea, by

                    having taken Leontini by a panic and the first assault, the Romans did not doubt
                    that at some point they would make their way into a city immense and widely
                    scattered, they brought all their equipment for besieging cities up to the

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> And an undertaking begun with so vigorous an

                    Finally, that his own men might discharge their bolts at the enemy without

                    the hopes of the other city-states which were on the side of the Carthaginians

                    their positions above and around the theatre, being already familiar with the

                    range, he decided to attack just at that part of the city which was best
                    defended by walls, because he saw that that was the most carelessly guarded.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He assembled everything useful for siege
                    operations, selected from the entire army the pick of the centurions, and placed
                    tribunes who were brave men in command of them. And he assigned them six hundred
                    soldiers —all that seemed necessary —and ordered them to carry ladders to that

                        unit="section"/> There was a low, narrow gate there, as the street, leading
                    through a deserted part of the city, was not much frequented. He ordered them
                    first to climb over the wall by means of their ladders, and then to open that
                    gate from the inside, or else break down the bars, and then, holding a part of
                    the city, to give the signal on a trumpet for the rest of the troops to move up.

                    These commands were carried out with spirit, and a circumstance which seemed
                    likely to hamper action proved of the greatest help to secrecy. Heavy rain
                    beginning at midnight forced the guards and sentries to slip away from their

                    from being heard clearly, and then, gentler and more monotonous as they

                    These were the first troops with which the Carthaginians, to prevent any

                    They fought at first in darkness and in narrow streets. The Romans gained

                    what the Arpini meant, for what offence on the part of the Romans, or for what

                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 213</note> had an
                    enemy who relied upon infantry battles, and if he wished to be a match for him
                    in military strength he too must acquire infantry. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> And for that purpose his kingdom was supplied with men in
                    great numbers, but they did not understand the art of arming and equipping them
                    and placing them in battle-line. Everything was formless and unmethodical, as if
                    a mob had been gathered by chance. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The legates
                    replied that for the present they would do as he desired, after receiving his
                    pledge to send back the man at once, if their generals should not approve of
                    their action. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Quintus Statorius was the name
                    of the one who remained with the king. With the two Romans the king sent three
                    legates from the Numidians to Spain, to receive confirmation from the Roman
                    generals. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He further instructed them at once
                    to persuade Numidians who were auxiliaries in the forces of the Carthaginians to
                    desert them. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> And Statorius out of the mass of
                    young men enrolled infantry for the king, organized them almost in the Roman
                    manner, taught them in formation and evolution to follow standards and keep
                    their ranks, and to such an extent accustomed them to fortifying and other
                    regular <milestone n="12??" unit="section"/> duties of the soldier that in a
                    short time the king had as much confidence in his infantry as in his cavalry,
                    and in a regular engagement in formal array on level ground he defeated the
                    Carthaginian enemy. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The Romans also in Spain
                    profited greatly by the coming of the king's representatives. For upon the news
                    of their arrival desertions by the Numidians began to be frequent. </p>
                <p> Thus began the friendship of the Romans with Syphax. When the Carthaginians
                    learned of the <pb n="p.333"/> matter they at once sent legates to Gala, who
                    reigned <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 213</note>

                        then became an ally of Rome, and a friend of Scipio. At present he must have

                    </note> seventeen years old, but a young man of such promise that even then it
                    was evident that he would make the kingdom larger and richer than what he had
                    received. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The legates stated that, inasmuch as
                    Syphax had attached himself to the Romans, in order, through alliance with them,
                    to be more powerful against the kings and peoples of Africa, it would be well
                    for Gala too to attach himself as soon as possible to the Carthaginians, before
                    Syphax should cross into Spain or the Romans into Africa. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Syphax could be surprised, they said, while he had as yet
                    no advantage from his treaty with the Romans except the name. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> They easily persuaded Gala to send an army, as his son was
                    begging for the command; and reinforced by the Carthaginian legions, Masinissa
                    defeated Syphax in a great battle. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Thirty
                    thousand men are said to have been slain in that battle. Syphax with a few
                    horsemen fled from the field to the Maurusian Numidians, who live far away, near
                    the Ocean opposite Gades. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> And as the
                    barbarians on hearing of him flocked together from all sides, he soon armed
                    immense forces with which to cross into Spain, separated only by a narrow
                    strait. But Masinissa came with his victorious army, and there by himself,
                    without any help from the Carthaginians, he carried on war against Syphax with
                    great distinction. </p>
                <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>

                <p> In Spain nothing notable occurred except that the <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 213</note> Roman commanders attracted
                    to their side the young men of the Celtiberians at the same pay at which these
                    had made an agreement with the Carthaginians, and more than three hundred
                    Spaniards of the highest rank were sent to Italy to win over their
                    fellow-countrymen who were among Hannibal's auxiliaries. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> This is the only occurrence of that year in Spain that is
                    worthy of record, since the Romans had no mercenary soldiers in their camps
                    previous to the Celtiberians whom they had at that time. </p>
