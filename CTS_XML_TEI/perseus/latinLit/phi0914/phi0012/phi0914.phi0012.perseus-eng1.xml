                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 509</note>
                    their achievements in peace and war, annual magistracies, and laws superior in
                    authority to men will henceforth be my theme. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    This liberty was the more grateful as the last king had been so great a tyrant.
                    For his predecessors so ruled that there is good reason to regard them all as
                    successive founders of parts, at least, of the City, which they added to serve
                    as new homes for the numbers they had themselves recruited. <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified"> This statement is too sweeping, for
                        Livy nowhere attributes any enlargement of the City to Numa. </note>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Nor is there any doubt that the same Brutus
                    who earned such honour by expelling the haughty Tarquinius, would have acted in
                    an evil hour for the commonwealth had a premature eagerness for liberty led him
                    to wrest the power from any of the earlier kings. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> For what would have happened if that rabble of shepherds
                    and vagrants, having deserted their own peoples, and under the protection of
                    inviolable sanctuary having possessed themselves of liberty, or at least
                    impunity, had thrown off their fear of kings only to be stirred by the ruffling
                    storms of tribunician demagogues, breeding quarrels with the senators of a city
                    not their own, <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> before ever the pledges of wife
                    and children and love of the very place and soil (an affection of slow growth)
                    had firmly united their aspirations? The nation would have crumbled away with
                    dissension before it had matured. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But it was
                    favoured by the mild restraint of the government, which nursed it up to the
                    point <pb n="p.221"/> where its ripened powers enabled it to bear good <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 509</note> fruit of
                    liberty. Moreover you may reckon the beginning of liberty as proceeding rather
                    from the limitation of the consuls' authority to a year than from any diminution
                    of their power compared with that which the kings had exercised. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> All the rights of the kings and all their insignia
                    were possessed by the earliest consuls; only one thing was guarded against â€”that
                    the terror they inspired should not be doubled by permitting both to have the
                    rods. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Brutus was the first to have them, with
                    his colleague's consent, and he proved as determined in guarding liberty as he
                    had been in asserting it. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> To begin with, when
                    the people were still jealous of their new freedom, he obliged them to swear an
                    oath that they would suffer no man to be king in Rome, lest they might later be
                    turned from their purpose by the entreaties or the gifts of princes. <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/> In the next place, that the strength of the senate
                    might receive an added augmentation from the numbers of that order, he filled up
                    the list of the Fathers, which had been abridged by the late king's butcheries,
                    drawing upon the foremost men of equestrian rank until he had brought the total
                    up to three hundred. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> From that time, it is
                    said, was handed down the custom of summoning to the senate the Fathers and the
                    Enrolled, the latter being the designation of the new senators, who were
                    appointed. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Later any senator might be
                        called <hi rend="italics">pater conscriptus,</hi> and it is possible that
                        Livy and Festus (p. 254 M) were misled in supposing that originally the <hi
                            rend="italics">patres</hi> were one class of senators and the <hi
                            rend="italics">conscripti</hi> another. See Conway's note. </note> This
                    measure was wonderfully effective in promoting harmony in the state and
                    attaching the plebs to the Fathers. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        Livy appears to have assumed that the new senators were plebeians, but this
                        is almost certainly wrong. The first definite notice of a plebeian senator
                        occurs at v. xii. 11 ( <date value="-400">400 B.C.</date> ). </note>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Matters of worship then received attention.
                    Certain public sacrifices had habitually been performed by the kings in person,
                    and that their <pb n="p.223"/> absence might nowhere be regretted, a <quote>
                        king of <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                            509</note> sacrifices </quote> was appointed. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> This priesthood they made subordinate to the pontifex, lest
                    the office, in conjunction with the title, might somehow prove an obstacle to
                    liberty, which was at that time their chief concern. Perhaps the pains they took
                    to safeguard it, even in trivial details, may have been excessive. <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> For the name of one of the consuls, though he gave no
                    other offence, was hateful to the citizens. <quote> The Tarquinii had become too
                        used to sovereignty. It had begun with Priscus; Servius Tullius had then
                        been king; but not even this interruption had caused Tarquinius Superbus to
                        forget the throne or regard it as another's; as though it had been the
                        heritage of his family, he had used crime and violence to get it back;
                        Superbus was now expelled, but the supreme power was in the hands of
                        Collatinus. The Tarquinii knew not how to live as private citizens. Their
                        name was irksome and a menace to liberty. </quote>
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Beginning in this way, with a cautious
                    sounding of sentiment, the talk spread through the entire nation, and the plebs
                    had become anxious and suspicious, when Brutus summoned them to an assembly.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> There he first of all recited the oath
                    which the people had taken, that they would suffer no king in Rome, nor any man
                    who might be dangerous to liberty. This oath they must uphold, he said, with all
                    their might, nor make light of anything which bore upon it. He spoke with
                    reluctance, on the man's account, nor would he have broken silence unless he had
                    been forced to do so by his love of country. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    The Roman people did not believe that they had recovered absolute freedom. The
                    royal family, the royal name <pb n="p.225"/> were not only present in the state,
                    but were <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 509</note>
                    actually in authority, an obstacle and a stumbling-block in the way of liberty.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    <quote>This fear,</quote> he cried, <quote> do you yourself remove, Lucius
                        Tarquinius, of your own free will! We are mindful â€”we confess it â€”that you
                        drove out the kings; complete the good work you have begun, and rid us of
                        the royal name. Your possessions shall not only be granted you by the
                        citizens, at my instance, but if they are in any way inadequate they shall
                        be generously increased. Depart our friend, and relieve the state of what
                        is, perhaps, an idle fear. The people are persuaded that with the family of
                        Tarquinius the kingship will vanish from amongst us. </quote>
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The consul was at first prevented from
                    uttering a word by his astonishment at this strange and unexpected turn; then,
                    when he tried to speak, the chief men of the state surrounded him, and with many
                    entreaties made the same request. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The others
                    had little influence over him, but when Spurius Lucretius, his superior in years
                    and dignity, and his father-in-law besides, began to urge him, with mingled
                    entreaty and advice, to permit himself to yield to the unanimous wish of his
                    fellow-citizens, Collatinus became <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> alarmed
                    lest when his year of office should have ended, his misfortunes might be
                    increased by the confiscation of his property and the addition of yet other
                    ignominies. He therefore resigned the consulship, and transferring all his
                    possessions to Lavinium, withdrew from the Roman state. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> In pursuance of a resolution of the senate, Brutus proposed
                    to the people a measure which decreed the exile of all the Tarquinian race. To
                    be his colleague the centuriate comitia, under his presidency, elected Publius
                    Valerius, who had helped him to expel the kings. </p>

                    <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Although no one doubted that the Tarquinii
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 509</note>
                    would presently go to war, their attack was delayed beyond all expectation;
                    while a thing men did not fear at all, to wit a treasonable plot, almost cost
                    Rome her liberty. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> There were among the young
                    men a number of youths, the sons of families not unimportant, whose pleasures
                    had been less confined under the monarchy, who, being of the same age as the
                    young Tarquinii, and their cronies, had grown used to the untrammelled life of
                    princes. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This licence they missed, now that
                    all enjoyed equal rights, and they had got into the way of complaining to each
                    other that the liberty of the rest had resulted in their own enslavement. A king
                    was a man, from whom one could obtain a boon, whether it were just or unjust;
                    there was room for countenance and favour; a king could be angry, could forgive,
                    could distinguish between friend and enemy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    The law was a thing without ears, inexorable, more salutary and serviceable to
                    the pauper than to the great man; it knew no relaxation or indulgence, if one
                    exceeded bounds; and, inasmuch as man is so prone to blunder, it was dangerous
                    to rely on innocence alone. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Thanks to such
                    reflections, they were already infected with disloyalty when envoys from the
                    royal family appeared, who without saying anything about the return of the
                    Tarquinii, sought merely to recover their property. The senate, having given
                    them a hearing, debated the question for several days; for they feared that if
                    they refused to make restitution it would be a pretext for war, if they
                    consented it would be to furnish means and assistance for its prosecution.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Meantime the envoys were <pb n="p.229"/>
                    exerting themselves to a different purpose. Ostensibly <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 509</note> seeking to recover the
                    property, they secretly laid their plans for winning back the kingdom; and, as
                    if in furtherance of their apparent object, they went about sounding the
                    disposition of the youthful nobles. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> To those
                    who gave them a friendly hearing they delivered letters from the Tarquinii, and
                    plotted with them to admit the royal family secretly by night into the City.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The brothers Vitellii and Aquilii were the
                    first to be entrusted with the project. A sister of the Vitellii had married the
                    consul Brutus, and there were sons of this marriage who were now young men,
                    Titus and Tiberius; these were also admitted by their uncles to a share in the
                    design. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> There were besides several other young
                    nobles taken into the secret, but their names are lost in antiquity. <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> The senate meantime had acquiesced in the opinion of
                    those who were in favour of giving back the property. This very fact gave the
                    agents of the exiles an excuse for lingering in the City, for the consuls had
                    granted them time for obtaining vehicles with which to carry away the belongings
                    of the royal family. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> All this time they spent
                    in consultation with the conspirators, whom they urged and at length persuaded
                    to give them letters for the Tarquinii: for otherwise how could the princes be
                    convinced that the statements of their agents regarding matters of such

                    happened that they were dining at the house of the Vitellii, where the

                    enough, about their <pb n="p.231"/> new design. This conversation one of the

                    accusation. When he saw that the letters had been given, he laid the matter
                    before the consuls. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The consuls left their

                    disturbance, completely crushed the plot, being especially careful not to lose
                    the letters. The traitors were thrown into prison forthwith. As for the envoys,
                    it was uncertain for a little while what would be done with them, but,
                    notwithstanding they appeared to have deserved no less than to be treated as

                    This time anger won the day. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They refused to
                    return it, and refused to confiscate it to the state, but gave it up to the

                    they might for ever relinquish hope of making their peace with them. The land of
                    the Tarquinii, lying between the City and the Tiber, was consecrated to Mars and

                    Since this produce of the land might not, for religious reasons, be consumed,
                    the grain was cut, straw and all, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    embankments were added, and work was done, to raise the surface so high above

                    next-of-kin in a wicked conspiracy. His enemies, perceiving that no single
                    claimant was fit to be king, had seized and usurped the power amongst
                    themselves, and had given up his goods to be plundered by the people, that none
                    might be without a share in the guilt. He wished to regain his country and his

                    of their armies, and seizure of their lands. This last plea moved the men of
                    Veii, and they cried out with threatenings that they ought, at all events with a
                    Roman for their commander, to wipe out their disgraces and recover what they had
                    lost in war. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Tarquinienses were influenced
                    by his name and kinship: it seemed a fine thing to them that one of their blood

                    commanded by Arruns Tarquinius, the king's son, while the king himself followed
                    with the legions. Arruns, perceiving a long way off by the consul's lictors that
                    it was he, and then, as they drew nearer together, recognizing Brutus more

                    of the cavalry as well began to fight, and not long after the infantry also
                    appeared. In this battle the advantage was divided, and the fortune of war
                    seemed equally balanced: the right wing on each side was victorious, while the

                    determine which should do it. Horatius received the lot, and Publicola set out
                    to conduct the war against the Veientes. With more bitterness than was
                    reasonable, the friends of Valerius resented that the dedication of so famous a
                    temple should be given to Horatius. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They tried
                    in all sorts of ways to hinder it, but their schemes all came to naught.
                    Finally, when the consul's hand was on the door-post and he was in the midst of
                    his prayers to the gods, they broke in upon the ceremony with the evil tidings
                    that his son was dead, averring that whilst the shadow of death was over his
                    house he could not dedicate a temple. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Whether
                    he did not believe the news to be true, or possessed great fortitude, we are not
                    informed with certainty, nor is it easy to decide. Without permitting himself to
                    be diverted from his purpose by the message, further than to order that the body
                    should be buried, he kept his hand upon the doorpost, finished his prayer, and
                    dedicated the temple. </p>

                    of the lowest; there would be nothing lofty, nothing that stood out above the
                    rest of the state; there was the end of monarchy, the noblest institution known
                    to gods or men. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Porsinna, believing that it
                    was not only a safe thing for the Etruscans that there should be a king at Rome,
                    but an honour to have that king of Etruscan stock, invaded Roman territory with
                    a hostile army. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Never before had such fear
                    seized the senate, so powerful was Clusium in those days, and so great
                    Porsinna's fame. And they feared not only the enemy but their own citizens, lest
                    the plebs should be terror-stricken and, admitting the princes into the City,
                    should even submit to enslavement, for the sake of peace. <milestone n="6"

                    sent to the Volsci and others to Cumae to buy up corn. Again, the monopoly of
                    salt, the price of which was very high, was taken out of the hands of
                    individuals and wholly assumed by the government. Imposts and taxes were removed
                    from the plebs that they might be borne by the well-to-do, who were equal to the

                    one accord, withdrew from their fields into the City, which they surrounded with
                    guards. Some parts appeared to be rendered safe by their walls, others by the
                    barrier formed by the river Tiber. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The bridge
                    of piles almost afforded an entrance to the enemy, had it not been for one man,
                    Horatius Cocles; he was the bulwark of defence on which that day depended the

                    on guard at the bridge when Janiculum was captured by a sudden attack of the
                    enemy. He saw them as they charged down on the run from Janiculum, while his own
                    people behaved like a frightened mob, throwing away their arms and quitting
                    their ranks. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Catching hold first of one and
                    then of another, blocking their way and conjuring them to listen, he called on
                    gods and men to witness that if they forsook their post it was vain to flee;
                    once they had left a passage in their rear by the bridge, there would soon be
                    more of the enemy on the Palatine and the Capitol than on Janiculum. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> He therefore warned and commanded them to break down
                    the bridge with steel, with fire, with any instrument at their disposal; and
                    promised that he would himself receive the onset of the enemy, so far as it
                    could be withstood by a single body. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Then,
                    striding to the <pb n="p.251"/> head of the bridge, conspicuous amongst the

                    himself with his sword and buckler and made ready to do battle at close
                    quarters, confounding the Etruscans with amazement at his audacity. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> Yet were there two who were prevented by shame from
                    leaving him. These were Spurius Larcius and Titus Herminius, both famous for
                    their birth and their deeds. With these he endured the peril of the first rush
                    and the stormiest moment of the battle. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But
                    after a while he forced even these two to leave him and save themselves, for
                    there was scarcely anything left of the bridge, and those who were cutting it
                    down called to them to come back. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Then,
                    darting glances of defiance around at the Etruscan nobles, he now challenged
                    them in turn to fight, now railed at them collectively as slaves of haughty
                    kings, who, heedless of their own liberty, were come to overthrow the liberty of
                    others. They hesitated for a moment, each looking to his neighbour to begin the
                    fight. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Then shame made them attack, and with
                    a shout they cast their javelins from every side against their solitary foe. But
                    he caught them all upon his shield, and, resolute as ever, bestrode the bridge
                    and held his ground; and now they were trying to dislodge him by a charge, when
                    the crash of the falling bridge and the cheer which burst from the throats of
                    the Romans, exulting in the completion of their task, checked them in mid-career
                    with a sudden dismay. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Then Cocles cried,
                        <quote> O Father Tiberinus, I solemnly invoke thee; receive these arms and

                    plough around in one day. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Private citizens
                    showed their gratitude in a striking fashion, in the midst of his official
                    honours, for notwithstanding their great distress everybody made him some gift

                    up the plan of storming the City, and determined to lay siege to it. Placing a
                    garrison on Janiculum, he pitched his camp in the plain by the banks of the
                    Tiber. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He collected ships from every quarter,
                    both for guarding the river, to prevent any corn from being brought into the
                    City, and also to send his troops across for plundering, as the opportunity
                    might present itself at one point or another; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    and in a short time he made all the territory of the Romans so unsafe that not
                    only were they forced to bring all their other property inside the walls, but
                    even their flocks too, nor did anybody dare to drive them outside the gates.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This great degree of licence was permitted
                    to the Etruscans not so much from timidity as design. For Valerius the consul,
                    who was eager for an opportunity of assailing a large number at once, when they
                    should be scattered about and not expecting an attack, cared little to avenge
                    small aggressions, and reserved his punishment for a heavier blow. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> Accordingly, to lure forth plunderers, he issued
                    orders to his people that on the following day a large number of them should
                    drive out their flocks by the <pb n="p.255"/> Esquiline Gate, which was the most
                    remote from the <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        508</note> enemy, believing that they would hear of it, since the blockade
                    and famine were causing desertions on the part of faithless slaves. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> And in fact the enemy did hear of it from a
                    deserter's report, and crossed the river in much greater force than usual, in
                    the hope of making a clean sweep of the booty. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently Publius Valerius directed Titus Herminius to lie in ambush with a
                    small force two miles out on the Gabinian Way, and Spurius Larcius with a body
                    of light-armed youths to take post at the Colline Gate, until the enemy should
                    pass, and then to throw themselves between him and the river, cutting off his
                    retreat. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Of the two consuls, Titus Lucretius
                    went out by the Naevian Gate with several maniples of soldiers, Valerius himself
                    led out some picked cohorts by way of the Caelian Mount. <note anchored="true"

                    envoys from Porsinna. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The king had been so
                    disturbed, what with the hazard of the first attack upon his life, from which
                    nothing but the blunder of his assailant had preserved him, and what with the
                    anticipation of having to undergo the danger as many times more as there were
                    conspirators remaining, that he voluntarily proposed terms of peace to the
                    Romans. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In these terms Porsinna suggested, but
                    without effect, that the Tarquinii should be restored to power, more because he
                    had been unable to refuse the princes this demand upon their behalf than that he
                    was ignorant that the Romans would refuse it. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    In obtaining the return of their lands to the Veientes he was successful; and
                    the Romans were compelled to give hostages if they wished the garrison to be
                    withdrawn from Janiculum. On these terms peace was made, and Porsinna led his

                    even the women were inspired to deeds of patriotism. Thus the maiden Cloelia,
                    one of the hostages, eluded <pb n="p.263"/> the sentinels, when it chanced that
                    the Etruscans had <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        508</note> encamped not far from the bank of the Tiber, and heading a band
                    of girls swam the river and, under a rain of hostile darts, brought them all
                    back in safety to their kinsmen in Rome. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When
                    this had been reported to the king, he was at first enraged and sent emissaries
                    to Rome to demand that the hostage Cloelia be given up, for he made no great
                    account of the others. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Then, admiration
                    getting the better of anger, he asserted that her feat was a greater one than
                    those of Cocles and Mucius, and declared that although in case the hostage was
                    not returned he should regard the treaty as broken, yet if she were restored to
                    him he would send her back safe and inviolate to her friends. Both parties kept
                    their word. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The Romans returned the pledge of
                    peace, as the treaty required; and the Etruscan king not only protected the
                    brave girl but even honoured her, for after praising her heroism he said that he
                    would present her with half the hostages, and that she herself should choose the
                    ones she wished. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> When they had all been
                    brought out it is said that she selected the young boys, because it was not only
                    more seemly in a maiden, but was unanimously approved by the hostages
                    themselves, that in delivering them from the enemy she should give the
                    preference to those who were of an age which particularly exposed them to
                    injury. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> When peace had been established the
                    Romans rewarded this new valour in a woman with a new kind of honour, an

                    represented the maiden seated on a horse. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> This peaceful departure of the Etruscan king
                    from Rome is inconsistent with the custom handed down from antiquity even to our
                    own age, <pb n="p.265"/> among other formalities observed at sales of booty,

                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Such a practice must either have arisen during
                    the war and have been retained when peace was made, or else have had its origin
                    in some kindlier circumstance than would be suggested by the notice that an
                    enemy's goods were to be sold. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The most
                    credible of the traditional explanations is that when Porsinna retired from
                    Janiculum he handed over his camp, well stocked with provisions brought in from
                    the neighbouring fertile fields of Etruria, as a gift to the Romans, who were
                    then in a destitute condition after the long siege. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> These supplies were then sold, lest, if people were given a
                    free hand, they might plunder the camp like an enemy; and they were called the
                    goods of Porsinna rather by way of implying thankfulness for the gift than an
                    auction of the king's property, which was not even in the possession of the
                    Roman People. </p>

                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> On relinquishing his campaign against the
                    Romans, Porsinna was unwilling that he should appear to have led his army into
                    that region to no purpose, and accordingly sent a part of his forces, under his
                    son Arruns, to besiege Aricia. At first the Aricini were paralysed with
                    surprise. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Afterwards the auxiliaries whom they
                    called in from the Latin peoples, and also from Cumae, so encouraged them that
                    they ventured to measure their strength with the enemy in the open field. When
                    the battle began, the attack of the Etruscans was so impetuous that they routed
                    the Aricini at the first charge. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Cumaean
                    levies, employing skill to meet force, swerved a little to one side, and when
                    the enemy had swept by them, faced about and attacked them in the rear, with the
                        <pb n="p.267"/> result that the Etruscans, caught between two lines, <note

                    very small number of them, having lost their leader and finding no nearer
                    refuge, drifted to Rome, unarmed and with all the helplessness and the dejected
                    aspect of suppliants. There they were kindly received and were quartered about
                    among the citizens. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When their wounds had
                    healed, some departed for their homes to report the hospitality and kindness
                    they had met with, but many were persuaded to remain in Rome by the affection
                    they felt for their hosts and for the City. To these a place of residence was
                    allotted which was afterwards called the Vicus Tuscus. </p>

                    Publicola. In the latter year an embassy was sent to Rome for the last time by
                    Porsinna to negotiate for the restoration of Tarquinius to power. To these
                    envoys the senate replied that they would send representatives to the king, and

                    desired that for all time discussion of that question might be ended, and that
                    where there were so great obligations on both sides there might not be mutual
                    irritation, from the king's seeking that which was incompatible with the liberty

                    free. They had resolved to throw open their gates to enemies sooner than to

                    recourse in this case, as with the consuls, who shared the powers of their
                    office equally, to the assistance of the man's colleague, nor was there any

                    /> With fresh strength and spirit they attacked the weary exiles and cut them to

                    that the cohort of the exiles was nearly cut off by the Roman dictator, took a

                    caught sight of them, and in their midst, conspicuous in dress and

                    Whereupon he hurled himself upon the enemy's commander with so much more

                    They obeyed: they leaped down from their horses, hastened to the front, and
                    covered the front-rankers with their shields. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    It restored at once the courage of the foot to see the young nobles on even

                    the Latin war neither peace nor open hostilities; for while the Volsci had
                    raised levies to send to the aid of the Latins, had the Roman dictator not moved
                    quickly, yet the Romans did move quickly, that they might not have to fight both
                    nations in the same battle Upon this quarrel the consuls led their legions into
                    the country of the Volsci, who, not expecting to be held to account for their
                    design, were surprised and overwhelmed. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They
                    had no thought of resisting, and surrendered as hostages three hundred children

                    they made secret preparations for war, and formed a military alliance with the
                    Hernici, while they also sent out envoys, this <pb n="p.289"/> way and that, to

                    the Latins at Lake Regillus so filled them with rage and hate against anyone who

                    embassy, but seized the Volsci and brought them to Rome. There they delivered
                    them up to the consuls with the information that the Volsci and the Hernici were
                    preparing to attack the Romans. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When this
                    service had been reported to the senate the Fathers were so grateful that they
                    released to the Latins six thousand captives, and referred the question of a
                    treaty, which they had all but refused in perpetuity, to the incoming

                    the word went round that he had commanded companies; yet other military honours
                    were openly ascribed to him by the compassionate bystanders, and the man himself
                    displayed the scars on his breast which bore testimony to his honourable service

                    not only had the enemy's depredations deprived him of his crops, but his cottage

                    finally like an infection they had attacked his person, and he had been carried

                    disquieting news that a Volscian army was advancing to attack the City. This
                    report awoke very different feelings â€”so completely had their dissensions

                        unit="section"/> The commons were jubilant; they said that the gods were
                    taking a hand in punishing the arrogance of the senators. They encouraged one
                    another not to give in their names; it would be better to perish all together
                    than alone. Let the Fathers serve, let the Fathers take up arms, that those

                    their twofold fear â€”of their fellow-citizens and of the enemy â€”they begged
                    Servilius the consul, whose character appealed more to the people than did that
                    of his colleague, that he would extricate the state from <pb n="p.297"/> the

                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Thereupon the consul adjourned the senate and
                    went before the people. There he declared that the Fathers were anxious to
                    consult the interests of the plebs, but that their deliberations concerning that
                    very important part â€”but only a part after all â€”of the state had been broken off
                    by their fears for the entire nation. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It was
                    impossible, when the enemy was almost at the city gates, to consider anything
                    before the war; and even if there should be some slight respite in that regard,
                    it was neither to the credit of the plebs to refuse to arm for their country,
                    unless they should first receive a recompense, nor honourable to the Fathers to
                    be driven by fear into passing measures for the relief of their fellow-citizens
                    which they would have passed later of their own free will. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> He then confirmed his speech by a proclamation in which he
                    commanded that no one should hold a Roman citizen in chains or durance so that
                    he should not be able to give in his name to the consuls, and that none should
                    seize or sell a soldier's property so long as he was in camp, or interfere with
                    his children or his grandchildren. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When this
                    edict had been published, the debtors who were present at once enlisted, and

                    creditors no longer had the right to detain them, and rushed into the Forum to
                    take the military oath. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> It was a great throng,
                    nor were there any soldiers whose courage and usefulness in the Volscian war
                    were more conspicuous. The consul led his troops against the enemy, and pitched

                    remainder of the night was devoted by both armies to sleeping. On the following

                    temper of the soldiers. When there could no longer be any doubt of their great
                    ardour, he finally gave the command for a sortie and released them, eager for
                    the fray. At the very first onset the enemy were routed. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> While they ran, the foot-soldiers struck at them from
                    behind as long as they could keep up the pursuit; then the horsemen drove them
                    panic-stricken clear to their camp. Soon the camp itself had been surrounded by
                    the legions, and when the Volsci had fled from it in terror, it was taken and
                    plundered. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Next day Servilius led his forces
                    to Suessa Pometia, where the enemy had taken refuge, and within a few days took

                        n="3" unit="section"/> Many stragglers were cut off by the cavalry and, when
                    the column of infantry drew near, no resistance was offered by the Sabine
                    troops. Exhausted not only by their march but by their night of pillage as well,
                    a great part of them had gorged themselves in the farmhouses with food and wine,
                    and had scarcely vigour enough to run away. </p>

                    the Sabine war and ending it, men's hopes next day ran high that peace was now
                    assured in every quarter, when legates from the Aurunci appeared before the
                    senate to say that unless the territory of the Volsci were evacuated they should
                    declare war. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Auruncan army had set out
                    from home at the same time with the legates, and the report that it had already
                    been seen not far from Aricia threw Rome into such a state of confusion that it
                    was impossible to bring the matter regularly before the senate, or to return a
                    peaceful answer to a people who had already drawn the sword, while they
                    themselves were also arming. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They marched on

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Having routed the Aurunci, and having been,
                    within a few days, victorious in so many wars, the Romans were looking for the
                    help which the consul had promised and the senate guaranteed, when Appius,
                    partly out of native arrogance, partly to discredit his colleague, began to
                    pronounce judgment with the utmost rigour in suits to recover debts. In
                    consequence, not only were those who had been bound over before delivered up to
                    their creditors, but others were bound over. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Whenever this happened to a soldier he would appeal to the other consul. The
                    people flocked to the house of Servilius: it was he who had made them promises;
                    it was he whom they reproached, as each rehearsed his services in the wars and
                    displayed the scars he had received. They demanded that he should either lay the
                    matter before the senate or lend his aid as consul to his fellow-citizens, as
                    general to his soldiers. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They moved the consul
                    by this plea, but the situation forced him to temporize, so vehemently was the
                    other side supported, not only by his colleague, but by the entire party of the
                    nobles. And so he steered a middle course, and neither avoided the dislike of
                    the plebs nor gained the goodwill of the Fathers. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> These considered him a pusillanimous consul and an
                    agitator, while the commons held him to be dishonest; and it was soon apparent
                    that he was as cordially hated as Appius. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The
                    consuls had got into a dispute as to which should dedicate the temple to
                    Mercury. The senate referred the case to the people for decision. Whichever
                    consul should, by command of the people, be entrusted with the dedication was to
                    have charge <pb n="p.305"/> of the corn-supply, to establish a guild of
                    merchants, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Mercury was the patron of

                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 495</note> and
                    perform the solemn rites in the presence of the <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                    /> pontifex. The people assigned the dedication to Marcus Laetorius, a centurion
                    of the first rank â€”a choice which would readily be understood as intended not so
                    much to honour Laetorius, to whom a commission had been given which was too
                    exalted for his station in life, as to humiliate the <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> consuls. Appius and the Fathers were furious then, if they
                    had not been before; but the plebeians had plucked up heart and threw themselves
                    into the struggle with far more spirit than they had shown at <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> first. For, despairing of help from consuls and senate,
                    they no sooner beheld a debtor being haled away than they flew to his assistance
                    from every <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> side. It was impossible for the
                    consul's decree to be heard above the din and shouting, and when it had been
                    pronounced nobody obeyed it. Violence was the order of the day, and fear and
                    danger had quite shifted from the debtors to the creditors, who were singled out
                    and maltreated by large numbers in full sight of the <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> consul. To crown these troubles came the fear of a Sabine
                    invasion. A levy was decreed, but no one enlisted. Appius stormed and railed at
                    the insidious arts of his colleague, who, he said, to make himself popular, was
                    betraying the state by his inactivity; and to his refusal to give judgment for
                    debt was adding a fresh offence in refusing to hold the levy as the senate had
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> directed. Nevertheless the welfare of the
                    state was not wholly forgotten, nor the authority of the consulate abandoned; he
                    would himself, single-handed, assert both his own and the senate's <milestone
                        n="12" unit="section"/> majesty. When the usual daily throng of lawless men
                    was standing about him, he gave orders <pb n="p.307"/> to seize one who was a
                    conspicuous leader in their <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 495</note> disturbances. The lictors were already
                    dragging the man away, when he appealed; nor would the consul have granted the
                    appeal, for there was no question what the decision of the people would be, had
                    not his obstinacy been with difficulty overcome, more by the advice and
                    influence of the nobles than by the popular outcry, so steeled was he to endure
                    men's <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> hate. From that moment the trouble grew
                    worse each day, and not only were there open disturbances, but what was far more
                    pernicious, secret gatherings and conferences. At last the consuls whom the
                    plebeians so hated went out of office. Servilius had the goodwill of neither
                    party, but Appius was in high esteem with the senators. </p>

                    upon the consulship. Whereat the plebs, uncertain what sort of consuls they
                    would prove to be, held nightly gatherings, some on the Esquiline and other son
                    the Aventine, lest if they met in the Forum they might be frightened into
                    adopting ill-considered measures, and manage all their business rashly and at
                    haphazard. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> This seemed to the consuls, as
                    indeed it was, a mischievous practice. They laid the matter before the Fathers,
                    but their report could not be discussed in an orderly fashion, so tumultuously
                    was it received, with shouts from every part of the house and expressions of
                    indignation from the senators, that a thing which ought to have been settled by
                    an exercise of consular authority should be invidiously referred by the consuls
                    to the senate. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> It was evident that if only
                    there were magistrates in the nation there would have been no assembly in Rome
                    but the assembly of the people; as it was, the <pb n="p.309"/> government was
                    broken up into a thousand separate <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 494</note> curias and meetings. One single <hi

                    assemblages in a moment. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When the consuls,
                    thus upbraided, asked the Fathers what then they desired them to do, and
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> promised that their conduct of the matter
                    should be no whit less strenuous and stern than the senate wished, it was
                    resolved that they should hold a levy with the utmost severity: it was idleness
                    that made the plebeians lawless. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Having
                    adjourned the senate, the consuls mounted the tribunal and cited the young men
                    by name. When no one answered to his name, the crowd, which surrounded the
                    speaker as in a public meeting, declared that it was impossible to deceive the
                    commons any longer; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> the consuls would never
                    have a single soldier unless a public guarantee were given: liberty must first
                    be restored to every man before arms were given him, that he might fight for his
                    country and his fellow-citizens, not for a master. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> It was clear to the consuls what the senate had bidden them
                    do; but of all those who had uttered truculent speeches within the walls of the
                    curia they found not one at their side to share their odium, and they saw before
                    them a terrible struggle with the people. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly they thought it best, before proceeding to extremities, to consult
                    the senate a second time. When it met, the youngest senators all rushed up in
                    hot haste to the seats of the consuls, bidding them to abdicate their office and

                    one of those who were present. When he stood still without answering, in the
                    midst of a little knot of men who, fearing the possibility of violence, had
                    gathered round him, the consuls sent a lictor to him. <milestone n="3"

                    when the mob turned from the officer, whom they had merely prevented from
                    arresting the man, and assailed the senators, the consuls intervened and checked
                    the brawl, in which no stones had been thrown nor any weapons used, and there
                    were more shouts and expressions of rage than hurts. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> The senate was convened in confusion, and they deliberated
                    in still greater confusion. Those who had been roughly handled demanded an

                    with speeches but with shouts and uproar. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When

                    to deliberate in an orderly manner. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Three
                    proposals were made. Publius Verginius advised against a general relief: only

                    Emissaries from the Latins begged the senate either to send them help or permit
                    them to take up arms themselves in defence of their country. <note

                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> It seemed safer that the Latins should be
                    defended without arming them, than that they should be suffered to resume their
                    weapons. Vetusius the consul was dispatched to them, and this ended the
                    pillaging. The Aequi left the fields, and trusting more to situation than to
                    arms, secured themselves on the summits of the ridges. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> The other consul marched against the Volsci. Lest he too
                    might waste his time, he provoked the <pb n="p.317"/> enemy, chiefly by ravaging

                    /> In numbers the Volsci were somewhat superior, and accordingly they came on in
                    a loose and careless order. The Roman consul did not advance, nor did he allow a
                    response to the enemy's shout. He commanded his men to plant their spears in the
                    ground and stand still until the enemy had come to close quarters; then they
                    were to assail them with all their might, and settle the question with the
                    sword. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The Volsci, weary with running and
                    shouting, hurled themselves upon the Romans, who seemed to be numb with fear.
                    But when the attackers found that their charge was firmly met and saw the swords
                    flash in their faces, they were no whit less confounded than if they had fallen
                    into an ambush, and turned and fled; and even flight was beyond their strength,
                    since they had been running as they entered the battle. <milestone n="14"
                        unit="section"/> The Romans on the contrary, having stood at ease at the
                    beginning of the fight, were fresh and strong; they readily caught up with the
                    exhausted Volsci, and having taken their camp with a rush, pursued their enemies
                    beyond it to Velitrae, where vanquished and victors burst into the city in one
                    body. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> More blood was shed there, in the
                    promiscuous slaughter of all sorts of people, than had been in the battle
                    itself. A very few were granted quarter, having come without arms and given

                    Attacking with his cavalry, he <pb n="p.319"/> made havoc of their centre,

                    the fight at Lake Regillus no other battle of those days was more famous. The
                    dictator entered the City in triumph. In addition to the customary honours a

                    witness the games, and a curule chair was put there for him. <note

                    deprived of the Veliternian land; colonists were sent from the City to Velitrae
                    and a colony was planted. Soon after this there was a battle with the Aequi,
                    though the consul was against it, for it was necessary to approach the enemy
                    from unfavourable ground; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> but his men accused
                    him of dragging out the campaign in order that the dictator might relinquish his
                    office before their return to the City, and his promises thus come to naught, as
                    the consul's promises had done before. Vetusius was thus driven to order an
                    advance at random, up the mountains which confronted him. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> This ill-advised measure the enemy's cowardice turned into
                    success, for before the Romans had come within a spear's throw, the Aequi,
                    appalled at their audacity, abandoned the camp which they had maintained in a
                    highly defensible position, and threw themselves down into the valleys on the
                    other side. There the Romans gained considerable booty and a bloodless victory. </p>

                    treatment of those bound over for debt. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This
                    resolution having failed to pass, the dictator said: <quote> I do not please you

                        had men like me for their spokesmen. For my own part I will not be the means
                        of further disappointing my fellow citizens, nor will I be dictator to no

                    left the Curia and laid down his office. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> It
                    was evident to the people that resentment of their wrongs had caused him to

                    been his fault that it was not being carried out), they attended him as he

                    that if the army should be disbanded there would again be secret gatherings and
                    conspiracies. And so, although the levy had been held by order of the dictator,
                    yet because the men had been sworn in by the consuls they regarded the troops as
                    bound by their oath, and, under the pretext that the Aequi <pb n="p.323"/> had
                    recommenced hostilities, gave orders to lead the <note anchored="true"

                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> This brought the revolt to a head. At
                    first it is said, there was talk of killing the consuls, that men might thus be
                    freed from their oath; but when it was explained to them that no sacred
                    obligation could be dissolved by a crime, they took the advice of one Sicinius,
                    and without orders from the consuls withdrew to the Sacred Mount, which is
                    situated across the river Anio, three miles from the City. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> â€”This version of the story is more general than that given
                    by Piso, namely that the Aventine was the place of their secession. <note

                    their camp with stockade and trench, and continued quietly, taking nothing but
                    what they required for their subsistance, for several days, neither receiving
                    provocation nor giving any. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> There was a great
                    panic in the City, and mutual apprehension caused the suspension of all
                    activities. The plebeians, having been abandoned by their friends, feared
                    violence at the hands of the senators; the senators feared the plebeians who
                    were left behind in Rome, being uncertain whether they had rather they stayed or
                    went. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Besides, how long would the seceding
                    multitude continue peaceable? What would happen next if some foreign war should
                    break out in the interim? <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Assuredly no hope
                    was left save in harmony amongst the citizens, and this they concluded they must

                    They therefore decided to send as an ambassador to the commons Agrippa Menenius,
                    an eloquent man and dear to the plebeians as being one of themselves by birth.

                    now the case, but had each its own ideas and a voice of its own, the other parts
                    thought it unfair that they should have the worry and the trouble and the labour
                    of providing everything for the belly, while the belly remained quietly in their
                    midst with nothing to do but to enjoy the good things which they bestowed upon
                    it; they therefore conspired together that the hands should carry no food to the
                    mouth, nor the mouth accept anything that was given it, nor the teeth grind up
                    what they received. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> While they sought in this
                    angry spirit to starve the belly into submission, the members themselves and the
                    whole body were reduced to the utmost weakness. <milestone n="11" unit="section"

                    and was no more nourished than it nourished the rest, by giving out to all parts
                    of the body that by which we live and thrive, when it has been divided equally

                    was made with the Latin peoples. In order to make this treaty one of the consuls
                    remained in Rome, while the other was dispatched to the Volscian war, and
                    defeated and put to flight the Volsci of Antium. Forcing them to take refuge in

                    town, after which he directed a strong attack upon Corioli. There was in camp at
                    that time amongst the young nobles Gnaeus Marcius, a youth of active mind and
                    ready hand, who afterwards gained the surname of Coriolanus. <milestone n="6"

                    suddenly assailed by a Volscian army from Antium, and simultaneously by the

                    covered the Volsci with confusion â€”as was natural when the city which they had

                    trouble from without and the breach at home had been healed, another and a much

                    first the price of corn went up, from men's failure to cultivate the fields
                    during the withdrawal of the plebs; and this was followed by a famine, such as
                    comes to a beleaguered city. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> It would have
                    meant starvation for the slaves, at least, and the plebeians, had not the

                    south past the Volsci by sea, all the way to Cumae, but even to Sicily â€”so far

                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When grain had been purchased at Cumae the
                    ships were held back by Aristodemus, the tyrant, in satisfaction for the
                    property of the Tarquinii, whose heir he was. Among the Volsci and Pomptini the
                    agents could not even make any purchases, and they were actually in danger from
                    the violence of the people. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> From the Tuscans
                    corn came in by way of the Tiber, and with this the plebs were kept alive. A
                    disastrous war would have been added to the distresses arising from the scarcity
                    of provisions, had not a grievous pestilence descended upon the Volsci just as
                    they were beginning hostilities. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Its ravages
                    so terrified the enemy that even after the worst of it was over they did not
                    fully recover from their fear, and the Romans increased the number of colonists
                    at Velitrae and sent out a new colony to Norba, in the mountains, as a
                    stronghold for the Pomptine country. </p>

                    repressing the commons, and resuming the rights which they had violently

                    the plebs were so angry that they almost resorted to arms. Starvation, they

                    every man saw that he was himself made his <note anchored="true"

                    contempt at first Marcius heard the threats of the tribunes, alleging that the

                    were tribunes not of the Fathers, but of the plebs. But the commons had risen in
                    such a storm of anger that the Fathers had to sacrifice one man to appease them.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> For all that, they resisted the hatred of
                    their adversaries and called upon the private resources of the several senators,
                    as well as the strength of the entire order. At first they tried, by posting

                        citizens of conquered towns, and were recruited by manumissions and
                        immigration. </note> here and there, to frighten persons from coming

                    have said all the members of the senate were on their trial â€”and entreated the
                    plebs to release to them one citizen, one senator; if they were unwilling to
                    acquit him as innocent let them give him up, though guilty, as a favour.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But when Marcius himself, on the day
                    appointed for the hearing, failed to appear, men's hearts were hardened against
                    him. Condemned in his absence, he went into exile with the Volsci, uttering
                    threats against his country, and even then breathing hostility. When he came
                    among the Volsci they received him with a kindness which increased from one day
                    to the next, in proportion as he allowed a greater hatred of his own people to
                    appear, and was more and more frequently heard to utter both complaints and
                    threats. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> His host was Attius Tullius, at that

                    And so, spurred on, the one by his inveterate hatred and <pb n="p.337"/> the

                    be no easy matter to induce the Volscian commons to take up the arms which they
                    had so often unluckily essayed; the destruction of their young men in
                    oft-repeated wars, and finally by the plague, had, they supposed, broken their
                    spirit; artifice must be invoked, where hate had grown dull with lapse of time,

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> It so happened that at Rome preparations were

                        <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the Roman Games (cf. I. xxxv. 9). </note> The
                    reason of the repetition was as follows: at an early hour of the day appointed
                    for the games, before the show had begun, a certain householder had driven his
                    slave, bearing a yoke, through the midst of the circus, scourging the culprit as
                    he went. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The games had then been begun, as
                    though this circumstance had in no way affected their sanctity. Not long after,
                    Titus Latinius, a plebeian, had a dream. He dreamt that Jupiter said that the
                    leading dancer at the games <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> the slave who had been scourged through the

                    sumptuous repetition of the festival the City would be in danger; that Latinius
                    was to go and announce this to the consuls. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Though the man's conscience was by no means at ease, nevertheless the awe he
                    felt at the majesty of the magistrates was too great; he was afraid of becoming
                    a laughing-stock. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Heavy was the price he paid
                    for his hesitation, for a few days later he lost his son. Lest this sudden
                    calamity should leave any uncertainty as to its cause in the mind of the
                    wretched man, the same phantom appeared again before him in his dreams, and
                    asked <pb n="p.339"/> him, as he thought, whether he had been sufficiently <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 491</note> repaid for
                    spurning the gods; for a greater recompense was at hand unless he went quickly
                    and informed the consuls. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This brought the
                    matter nearer home. Yet he still delayed and put off going, till a violent
                    attack of illness suddenly laid him low. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Then
                    at last the anger of the gods taught him wisdom. And so, worn out with his
                    sufferings, past and present, he called a council of his kinsmen and explained
                    to them what he had seen and heard, how Jupiter had so often confronted him in
                    his sleep, and how the threats and anger of the god had been instantly fulfilled
                    in his own misfortunes. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Then, with the
                    unhesitating approval of all who were present, he was carried on a litter to the
                    consuls in the Forum; and thence, by their command, to the Curia, where he had
                    no sooner told the same story to the Fathers, greatly to the wonder of them all,
                    when â€” lo, another miracle! <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> For it is related
                    that he who had been carried into the senate-house afflicted in all his members,

                    which induced them to take precautions, even though they might prove

                    rebellious Volsci and Aequi and, led by Aemilius, defeated them in a successful
                    action. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Yet more of the enemy perished in
                    flight than in the battle, so relentlessly did the cavalry pursue their routed
                    forces. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Castor's temple was dedicated the same
                    year, on the fifteenth of July. It had been vowed during the Latin war by
                    Postumius, the dictator. His son, being made duumvir for this special purpose,
                    dedicated it. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The temple was erected
                        in honour of both Castor and Pollux, but was commonly referred to by the

                            rend="italics">Mil.</hi> 91). The <hi rend="italics">duumviri</hi> were
                        a committee of two, appointed to oversee the construction and dedication of
                        a temple when the man who had vowed it died without accomplishing his task.

                    excited by the charms of the land-law. The tribunes of the plebs endeavoured to
                    recommend their democratic office by a democratic law, while the senators, who
                    thought there was frenzy enough and to spare in the populace, without rewarding
                    it, shuddered at <pb n="p.359"/> the thought of land-grants and encouragements

                    rashness. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The most strenuous of leaders were
                    at hand for the senatorial opposition, in the persons of the consuls. Their
                    party was therefore victorious and not only won an immediate success but,
                    besides, elected as consuls for the approaching year Marcus Fabius, Caeso's
                    brother, and one whom, on account of the prosecution of Spurius Cassius, the
                    people hated even more, namely, Lucius Valerius. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                    /> This year also there was a conflict with the tribunes. Nothing came of the
                    legislation, and its supporters fell into contempt, from boasting of a measure
                    which they could not carry through. The Fabii were thence-forward held in great
                    repute, after their three successive consulships, which had all without
                    interruption been subjected to the proof of struggles with the tribunes;
                    accordingly the office, as if well invested, was permitted to remain some time
                    in that family. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> For the next four
                        years, making seven successive years in all, the Fabii were represented in
                        the consulate. </note>
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> War then broke out with Veii, and the Volsci
                    revolted. But for foreign wars there was almost a superabundance of resources,
                    and men misused them in quarrelling amongst themselves. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> To increase the general anxiety which was now felt,
                    portents implying the anger of the gods were of almost daily occurrence in the
                    City and the country. For this expression of divine wrath no other reason was
                    alleged by the soothsayers, when they had enquired into it both officially and
                    privately, sometimes by inspecting entrails and sometimes by observing the

                    made consuls. This year there was no less discord at home, and the menace of war
                    was greater. The Aequi took up arms, and the Veientes even made a foray into
                    Roman territory. During the increasing anxiety occasioned by these campaigns
                    Caeso Fabius and Spurius Furius were elected to the consulship. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> Ortona, a Latin city, was being besieged by the Aequi;
                    while the Veientes, who by this time had their fill of rapine, were threatening
                    to attack Rome itself. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> These alarms, though
                    they should have restrained the animosity of the plebeians, actually heightened
                    it; and they resumed their custom of refusing service, though not of their own
                    initiative; for it was Spurius Licinius, tribune of the plebs, who, deeming that
                    the moment had come for forcing a land-law on the patricians by the direst
                    necessity, had undertaken to obstruct the preparations for war. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> But he drew upon his own head all the odium attaching to
                    the tribunician office, nor did the consuls inveigh against him more fiercely
                    than did his own colleagues, and with their help the consuls held a levy.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Armies were enlisted for two wars at the
                    same time; the command of one, which was to invade the Aequi, was given to
                    Fabius, while with the other Furius was to oppose the Veientes. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Against the Veientes nothing worth recording was
                    accomplished; and in the Aequian campaign Fabius had somewhat more trouble with
                    his fellow-Romans than with the enemy. That one man, the consul himself,
                    preserved the state, which the army in its hatred of the consul would, so far as
                    it was able, have betrayed. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For when the

                    in <pb n="p.363"/> preparing for the war and in his conduct of it, had so <note

                    up the battle-line that a charge of the cavalry alone sufficed to rout the

                    the exhortation of their hated general, â€”nor even the thought of the immediate

                    recover his courage, compel them to quicken their pace, or, if nothing else, to
                    stand in their ranks. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Contrary to orders they
                    retreated and returned to their camp, in such dejection that you would have

                    against the efficient services of the horse. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Ruinous though their example was, the general found no remedy for it; so true is
                    it that noble minds are oftener lacking in the qualities by which men govern
                    their fellow-citizens than in those by which they conquer an enemy. <milestone

                    hatred of his irritated and embittered soldiers than won increase in military
                    fame. Nevertheless the Fathers held out for the retention of the consulship in
                    the Fabian family. Marcus Fabius was the man they elected, and they gave him
                    Gnaeus Manlius as a colleague. </p>

                    land-law, Tiberius Pontificius. He set out on the same path that Spurius
                    Licinius had trodden, as though Licinius had been successful, and for a time
                    obstructed the levy. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The senators were again
                    thrown into consternation, but Appius Claudius told them that the tribunician
                    power had been overcome the year before, actually for the time being, and
                    potentially <pb n="p.365"/> for ever, since a way had been discovered for <note

                    would always be some tribune who would be willing to gain a personal victory
                    over his colleague, and obtain the favour of the better element, while doing the
                    nation a service. There would be a number of tribunes, if a number should be
                    needed, who would be ready to help the consuls; and a single one was enough,
                    though opposed to all the rest. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Only let the
                    consuls, and the leading senators as well, make a point of winning over, if not

                        n="5" unit="section"/> Acting on the instructions of Appius, the Fathers
                    began as a class to address the tribunes in a courteous and kindly manner; and
                    those who were of consular rank, when it happened that any of them had any
                    private claim upon an individual tribune, brought it about, in part by personal
                    influence, in part by political, that those officials were disposed to use their
                    powers for the good of the state; and four of them, as against one who would
                    have hindered the general good, assisted the consuls to hold the muster. </p>

                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The army then set out for a war with the
                    Veientes, <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> to whose help forces had rallied
                    from every quarter of Etruria, not so much roused by goodwill towards the men of
                    Veii as by hopes that civil discord might effect the downfall of the Roman
                    state. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And indeed the leading men in the
                    councils of all the Etrurian peoples were wrathfully complaining that there
                    would be no end to the power of the Romans unless factional quarrels should set
                    them to fighting amongst themselves. They asserted that this was the only
                    poison, the only decay which had been found to work upon <pb n="p.367"/> opulent
                    states, so as to make great empires transitory. <note anchored="true"

                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> For a long time the Romans had withstood this
                    evil, thanks partly to the prudence of the senate, partly to the patience of the
                    plebs; but they had now come to a crisis. Two states had been created out of
                    one: each faction had its own magistrates, its own laws. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> At first, though they had a way of fiercely opposing the
                    levies, yet when war began they had obeyed their generals. No matter what the
                    condition of things in the City, so long as military discipline held it had been
                    possible to make a stand; but now the fashion of disobeying magistrates was
                    following the Roman soldier even to his camp. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    In their latest war, when the army was already drawn up for battle, and at the
                    very instant of conflict, they had with one accord actually handed over the
                    victory to the conquered Aequi, had deserted their standards, had left their
                    general on the field, and had returned, against his orders, to their camp.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Assuredly if her enemies pressed forward
                    they could vanquish Rome by means of her own soldiers. There needed nothing more
                    than to make a declaration and a show of war; Fate and the gods would of their
                    own will do the rest. Such were the hopes which had led the Etruscans to take up
                    arms, after many a shifting hazard of defeat and victory. <milestone n="45"
                        unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The Roman consuls also felt that they had
                    nothing else to dread but their own forces and their own arms. The recollection
                    of the heinous example set in the last war deterred them from offering battle in
                    a situation where they would be in danger from two armies at the same time.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Accordingly they kept within their camp,
                    restrained by the thought of so grave a peril: time and circumstances would
                    perhaps assuage the anger of the men <pb n="p.369"/> and bring them to their

                    and the other Etruscans were for that reason the more in haste to act; they
                    attempted to provoke the Romans to fight, at first by riding up to their camp
                    and challenging them to come out, and finally, when they gained nothing by this,
                    by shouting insults both at the consuls themselves and at the army. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> They said that their pretended want of harmony
                    amongst themselves had been resorted to in order to conceal their fear, and that
                    the consuls distrusted the courage of their men even more than their loyalty; it
                    was a strange kind of mutiny where armed men were silent and inactive.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> To these taunts they added others upon the
                    newness of their race and origin, partly false and partly true. This abuse,
                    noisily uttered beneath the very rampart and the gates, was endured
                    unconcernedly enough by the consuls. But the inexperienced rank and file,
                    stirred now by indignation and now by shame, were diverted from the thought of
                    their domestic troubles; they were unwilling that their enemies should go
                    unpunished; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> they were unwilling that the
                    patricians, that the consuls should obtain a success; hatred of the foe
                    contended in their bosoms with hatred of their fellow-citizens. At length the
                    former feeling got the upper hand, so proud and insolent was the jeering of the
                    enemy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They gathered in crowds at the
                    praetorium, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The headquarters of the
                        consul, who was originally called praetor. </note> demanded battle,
                    requested that the signal should be given. The consuls, as though considering
                    the matter, put their heads together and conferred for a long time. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> They desired to fight, but it was needful to keep
                    back their desire and conceal it, that by opposition and delay they might
                    stimulate to fury the already eager soldiery. The men were therefore told that
                    the <pb n="p.371"/> thing was premature, that the time for battle had <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 480</note> not yet
                    come; that they must keep within the camp. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Then the consuls issued an order to abstain from fighting, declaring that if any
                    man fought without orders they should treat him as an enemy. Dismissed with
                    these words, the less inclination the soldiers discovered in the consuls the
                    greater became their own eagerness for the fray. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> They were still further exasperated by the enemy, who were
                    much bolder even than before, when the consuls' determination not to fight
                    became known: it was clear that they could insult the Romans with impunity;
                    their soldiers were not trusted with weapons, the affair would culminate in
                    absolute mutiny, and the end of the Roman power had come. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> Relying on these convictions, they charged up to the gates,
                    flung gibes at their defenders, and scarcely refrained from assaulting the camp.
                    At this the Romans could no longer brook their insults; from all over the camp
                    they came running to the consuls. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> There were
                    no more cautious requests, preferred through the chief centurions, but on all
                    sides arose a general clamour. The time was ripe; nevertheless the consuls hung
                    back. Then Fabius, when his colleague, beginning to fear mutiny, was on the
                    point of yielding to the growing tumult, commanded silence by a trumpet-blast
                    and said: <quote> I know, Gnaeus Manlius, that these men have the power to

                    they might even be guilty of some greater enormity, exasperated as they were,

                    were already come to sword-strokes at close quarters, where fighting is the

                    before, was leading the attack on the closely marshalled Veientes, when a
                    Tuscan, exulting in his strength and skill at arms, caught him unawares in the

                    they would have yielded the position, had not the other consul ridden up at a
                    gallop, with some few troops of horse, and calling out that his colleague was
                    alive, and that he himself had defeated and routed the other wing and was come
                    to help them, in that way put a stop to their wavering. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Manlius also showed himself among them, helping to restore
                    the line; and the soldiers, recognizing the features of their two consuls,
                    plucked up courage. At the same time the battle-line of the enemy was now less
                    strong, for, relying on their excess of numbers, they had withdrawn their
                    reserves and dispatched them to storm the Roman camp. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> There, having forced an entrance without encountering much
                    opposition, they were frittering away their time, their thoughts more taken up
                    with the booty than with the battle, when the Roman reserves, which had been
                    unable to withstand the first onset, sent word to the consuls how things stood,
                    and then closed up their ranks, returned to the praetorium, and of themselves
                    resumed the battle. Meanwhile Manlius the consul had ridden back to the camp,
                    and by posting men at all the gates had cut off the enemy's egress. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> In desperation at this turn the Etruscans had been
                    inflamed to the point rather of madness than of recklessness. For when, as they
                    rushed in whatever direction there seemed a prospect of escape, they had made
                    several charges to no purpose, one band of youths made a dash at the consul
                    himself, whose arms made him <pb n="p.379"/> conspicuous. Their first discharge
                    of javelins was parried <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin"
                        >B.C. 480</note> by the soldiers who surrounded him, but after that there
                    was no withstanding their violence. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The consul
                    fell, mortally wounded, and all about him fled. The Etruscans grew more reckless
                    than before; the Romans were driven, quaking with terror, right across the camp,
                    and their case would have been desperate, had <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    not the lieutenants caught up the body of the consul and opened a way for the
                    enemy by one of the gates. By that they burst forth, and escaping in a
                    disordered column, fell in the way of the other, the victorious consul, where
                    they were again cut to pieces, and dispersed in all directions. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> A victory of great importance had been won, but it was
                    saddened by the death of two so famous men. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    The consul therefore made answer to the senate, when it would have voted him a
                    triumph, that if the army could triumph without its general, its services in
                    that war had been so remarkable that he would readily grant his consent; as for
                    himself, when his family was in mourning for the death of Quintus Fabius his
                    brother, and the state was half orphaned by the loss of the other consul, he
                    would not accept a laurel which was blighted with national and private sorrow.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> No triumph ever celebrated was more
                    famous than was his refusal to accept a triumph, so true is it that a seasonable
                    rejection of glory sometimes but increases it. The consul then solemnized, one
                    after the other, the funerals of his colleague and his brother, and pronounced
                    the eulogy of each; but while yielding their meed of praise to them, he gained
                    for himself the very highest praises. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Nor was
                    he unmindful of that policy which he had adopted in the beginning of his

                    attention. For this the Fabii now began to enjoy the favour of the people, nor

                    forward than the plebeians in choosing Caeso Fabius to be consul, along with
                    Titus Verginius. On taking office his first concern was neither war nor the
                    raising of troops nor anything else, save that the prospect of harmony which had
                    been already partly realized should ripen at the earliest possible moment into a
                    good understanding between the patricians and the plebs. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> He therefore proposed at the outset of his term that before
                    one of the tribunes should rise up and advocate a land-law, the Fathers
                    themselves should anticipate him by making it their own affair and bestowing the
                    conquered territory upon the plebs with the utmost impartiality; for it was
                    right that they should possess it by whose blood and toil it had been won.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The senators scorned the proposal, and
                    some even complained that too much glory was spoiling and dissipating that
                    vigorous intellect which Caeso had once possessed. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> In the sequel there were no outbreaks of strife and faction
                    in the City, but the Latins were plagued with incursions of the Aequi. Thither
                    Caeso was dispatched with an army, and passed over into the Aequians' own
                    country to lay it waste. The Aequi retired to their towns and kept within their
                    walls. For this reason there was no memorable battle. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But the Veientes inflicted a defeat on the
                    Romans owing to the rashness of the other consul; and the <pb n="p.383"/> army
                    would have been destroyed if Caeso Fahius <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 479</note> had not come, in the nick
                    of time, to its rescue. Thenceforward there was neither peace nor war with the
                    Veientes, but something very like freebooting. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    In the face of the Roman legions they would retreat into their city; when they
                    perceived the legions to be withdrawn they would make raids upon the fields,
                    evading war by a semblance of peace, and peace in turn by war. Hence it was
                    impossible either to let the whole matter go or to end it. Other wars, too, were
                    immediately threatening â€”like the one with the Aequi and the Volsci, who would
                    observe peace only so long as the suffering involved in their latest defeat was
                    passing away, â€”or were soon to be begun, by the always hostile Sabines and all
                    Etruria. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But the enmity of the Veientes,
                    persistent rather than perilous, and issuing in insults oftener than in danger,
                    kept the Romans in suspense, for they were never permitted to forget it or to
                    turn their attention elsewhere. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Then the
                    Fabian clan went before the senate, and the consul said, speaking for the clan:
                        <quote> A standing body of defenders rather than a large one is required,
                        Conscript Fathers, as you know, for the war with Veii. Do you attend to the

                    upon its shoulders the burden of a state, how the war with Veii has been turned

                    tranquillity of peace, while all the neighbouring nations were being subdued. On

                    And so they now and then drove flocks in the way of the invaders, as if they had
                    come there by accident; and the country folk would flee from their farms and
                    leave them deserted; and rescuing parties of armed men, sent to keep off
                    pillagers, would flee before them in a panic more often feigned than real. By
                    this time the Fabii had conceived such scorn for the enemy that they believed
                    themselves invincible and not to be withstood, no matter what the place or time.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This confidence so won upon them that on

                    arms, and ran down to capture them. Their rashness carried them on at a swift

                    and then the javelins began to fall upon them from every quarter; and as the
                    Etruscans drew together and the Romans were now fenced in by a continuous line
                    of armed men, the harder the enemy pressed them the smaller was the space within

                    There, although the advantage to the Roman side was but slight, still the

                    sent out expeditions far and wide into the territory of the Romans; there was no
                    security anywhere for flocks or country-folk. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    After a time they were caught by the same trick with which they had caught the

                    purpose to lure them on, they plunged into an ambush, and as their numbers
                    exceeded those of the Fabii so did their losses. <milestone n="6" unit="section"

                    the year, by the tribunes Lucius Caedicius and Titus Statius. Unlike Menenius,
                    he did not meet the attacks of the tribunes with entreaties, preferred by
                    himself or the senators, but with high confidence in his innocence and
                    popularity. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He, too, was accused in connection
                    with the battle against the Etruscans at Janiculum. But the fiery courage of the

                    in his own, and he confuted not only the tribunes but the plebs, upbraiding
                    them, in a daring speech, with the condemnation and death of Menenius, to whose
                    father, he declared, the plebs formerly owed their restoration and the

                    of their allies, and threw the enemy into such confusion that, while they were
                    running out in small groups, some one way and some another, to repel the attack
                    of the Romans, he captured the gate against which he had directed his first

                    as though Veii had been surprised. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Some went
                    to the rescue of the Sabines, others assailed the Romans, who were wholly
                    preoccupied with the camp. For a moment the Romans were disconcerted and thrown
                    into disorder; then they, too, faced both ways and made a stand, and the horse
                    which the consul sent into the fight dispersed and routed the Etruscans.

                    danger of Servilius, resisted the measure with the utmost violence. <milestone

                    tribune, haled them to trial. </p>
                <p> Lucius Aemilius and Opiter Verginius entered upon the consulship. Vopiscus
                    Julius I find given as consul in certain annals, instead of Verginius. This year
                    â€”whoever its consuls were â€”Furius and Manlius went about among the people as men
                    accused, in garments of mourning, seeking out the younger patricians, as well as
                    the plebeians. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They advised them, they warned
                    them to forbear from office-holding and the administration of the public
                    business; as for the consular fasces, the purple-bordered toga, and the curule
                    chair, â€”these they should regard in no other light than as the pageantry of
                    burial; for splendid insignia, like the fillets placed on victims, doomed the
                    wearer to death. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But if the consulship was so
                    alluring to them, let them recognize at once that it had been fettered and
                    enslaved by the might of the tribunes; that the consul, as though an attendant
                    upon those officials, must be subject in all <pb n="p.403"/> he did to their
                    beck and call; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> if he should bestir <note

                    believe that the state comprised any other element than the plebs â€”let him call
                    to mind the exile of Gnaeus Marcius, the condemnation of Menenius and his death.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Fired by these speeches, the senators
                    began to hold councils, no longer publicly, but in private, where the people
                    could not learn their plans. In these deliberations there was but one guiding
                    principle, that by fair means or foul the defendants must be got off. The more
                    truculent a suggestion was, the greater was the favour it evoked, and an agent
                    was not wanting for the most daring crime. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    Well then, on the day of the trial the plebeians were in the Forum, on tiptoe
                    with expectation. At first they were filled with amazement because the tribune
                    did not come down; <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    look suspicious, they supposed he had been frightened away by the nobles, and
                    fell to complaining of his desertion and betrayal of the people's cause;
                    finally, those who had presented themselves at the tribune's vestibule brought
                    back word that he had been found dead in his house. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> When this report had spread through all the gathering, the
                    crowd, like an army which takes to flight at the fall of its general, melted
                    away on every side. The tribunes were particularly dismayed, for the death of
                    their colleague warned them how utterly ineffectual to protect them were the
                    laws that proclaimed their sanctity. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Nor did
                    the senators place a proper restraint upon their satisfaction; so far, indeed,
                    was anyone from repenting of the guilty deed that even the innocent desired to
                    be thought its authors, and men openly asserted that chastisement must be
                    employed to curb the power of the tribunes. </p>

                    time the commons were fairly roused to anger, more by the silence of the
                    tribunes than by the consuls' power. They declared that it was all up with their
                    liberty; that men had gone back to their old ways; that with Genucius the

                    the only way was this: that the plebs should undertake their own defence, since
                    they had no one else to help them. Twenty-four lictors were all the retinue of
                    the consuls, and even these were plebeians. Nothing was more contemptible or
                    weaker, if there were any to contemn; it was every man's own imagination that
                    made them great and awe-inspiring. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They had
                    incited one another with arguments of this sort when the consuls sent a lictor
                    to arrest Volero Publilius, a plebeian, who, on the ground that he had been a
                    centurion, denied their right to make him a common soldier. <note

                    respect any right, whether public or private. The consuls, exposed to this
                    furious tempest, were quickly convinced of the insecurity of majesty when
                    unaccompanied with force. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The lictors were

                    welfare above his private grievance, and without attacking the consuls by so
                    much as a word, brought a bill before the people providing that plebeian

                        plebeian magistrates should be chosen by none but plebeians. But this was

                    nobles were sufficiently influential to command. Nevertheless the legislation,

                    Volero tribune: the senators, thinking the quarrel was sure to proceed to

                    unpopularity with the plebs and hostility towards them went back to the

                    only by its author, Volero, but by his colleague Laetorius as well, whose
                    advocacy of it was at once fresher and more acrimonious. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> He was emboldened by the great reputation he enjoyed as a

                    While Volero spoke of nothing but the law, and forbore to inveigh against the

                    with the custom of the Fathers, command the removal of anyone, by virtue of his

                    Claudius was sent against the Volsci; to Quinctius fell the command against the
                    Aequi. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In his conduct in the field Appius
                    displayed the same violence that he had shown in Rome, and it now had freer play
                    because it was not hampered by the tribunes. He hated the plebs with a hatred
                    that surpassed his father's: What? <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Had he been
                    beaten by them? Was it in his consulship, who had been chosen as pre-eminently
                    fitted to resist the tribunician power, that a law had been passed which former
                    consuls had prevented, with less effort and by no means so much hope of success
                    on the part of the patricians? <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> His wrath and
                    indignation at this thought drove his fierce spirit to torment the army with a
                    savage exercise of authority. Yet he was unable by any violence to subdue them,
                    so deeply had their spirits drunk of opposition. <milestone n="7" unit="section"

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Every one of these circumstances was known to
                    the Volsci, and they pressed their enemy the harder, hoping that the Roman army
                    would exhibit the same spirited opposition to Appius which it had evinced
                    towards the consul Fabius. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But Appius found
                    his men far more unruly than had Fabius; for not only were they unwilling to
                    conquer, as the Fabian army had been, but they wished to be conquered. Being
                    drawn out into battle-order, they basely fled and sought their camp; nor did
                    they make a stand until they saw the Volsci advancing against their
                    fortifications and inflicting a disgraceful slaughter upon their rearguard.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This compelled them to exert themselves
                    and fight, with the result that the enemy was dislodged from the stockade in the
                    moment of victory. Yet it was evident enough that the capture of their camp was
                    the only thing at which the Roman soldiers balked, and that elsewhere they
                    rejoiced at their own defeat and ignominy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    These things in no wise daunted the haughty spirit of Appius. But when he would
                    have gone further and have vented his rage upon the army, and was issuing orders
                    for an assembly, the lieutenants and tribunes gathered hurriedly about <pb

                    authority, when its effectiveness all depended on the goodwill of those obeying

                    they would not go to be harangued, and everywhere voices were overheard
                    demanding that the camp be removed from Volscian territory. The victorious enemy
                    had a little while before been almost in their gates and on their wall, and a
                    great disaster was not merely to be apprehended, but was openly hovering before
                    their eyes. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Giving way at last, since the
                    soldiers were gaining nothing but a postponement of their punishment, he
                    relinquished the idea of an assembly, and commanded a march for the following
                    day. At daybreak he caused the signal for departure to be sounded on the
                    trumpet. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> At the very instant when the column
                    was getting clear of the camp, the Volsci, as though set in motion by the same
                    signal, fell upon their rear. Thence the confusion spread to the van, and the
                    panic so disordered the standards and the ranks that it was impossible either to
                    hear commands or to form a line. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Nobody
                    thought of anything but flight, and so demoralised was the rout, as the men
                    escaped over fallen bodies and discarded weapons, that the enemy sooner ceased
                    to pursue than the Romans to flee. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When at
                    last the soldiers had been collected from their scattered flight, the consul,
                    who had followed his men in a vain attempt to call them back, pitched his camp
                    on friendly soil. Then he summoned an assembly and soundly rated them, not
                    without reason, as an army which had been false to military discipline and had
                    deserted its standards. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Asking them all in

                    campaign there subsisted between consul and soldiers an emulation of goodwill
                    and kindness. Not only was it natural to Quinctius to be more gentle, but the
                    unfortunate harshness of his colleague had given him the more reason to be
                    content with his own disposition. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Against this
                    complete harmony between commander and army the Aequi ventured no opposition,
                    but suffered their enemies to devastate their fields at will; and in fact no

                    such exertions in behalf of any man. They felt that the champion of the senate
                    and the guardian of their own dignity, who had stood firm against all sorts of
                    tribunician and plebeian outbreaks, though he had possibly gone too far in the

                    tribunes, plebs, and his own trial with perfect unconcern. He was not one whom
                    the threats of the plebeians or the entreaties of the senate could ever prevail
                    upon, I do not say to put on mourning, or to seek men out with appeals for
                    mercy, but even to soften and subdue in a slight degree the accustomed sharpness

                    ambush nearly resulted in a severe defeat for the Romans, but the courage of the

                    venture to assail, but he captured from the Antiates another town, named Caeno,

                    kept the Roman armies busy, the Sabines advanced clear to the gates of the City

                    yet they carried off immense spoils of men and cattle. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Servilius the consul pursued them with an army, and though
                    he could not overtake the column itself on ground which was suitable for
                    offering battle, he devastated the country so extensively as to leave nothing
                    untouched by the ravages of war, and returned with many times the plunder which
                    the Romans had lost. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Operations in the
                    Volscian country, too, were very successful, thanks both to the general and to
                    his soldiers. First, there was a pitched battle in the open field, with enormous
                    numbers killed and wounded on both sides. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The
                    Romans indeed, whose fewness made them feel their loss more sensibly, would have
                    fallen back, had it not been for a salutary falsehood told by the consul, who
                    shouted that the enemy were running away on the other wing, and so aroused the
                    spirits of his troops. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Romans charged and,
                    believing themselves to be conquering, they conquered. The consul feared lest by
                    pressing the enemy too hard he might cause a renewal of the struggle. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> He therefore gave the signal for the recall. For a
                    few <pb n="p.431"/> days both sides rested, as if they had tacitly agreed <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 469-468</note> on a
                    truce. Meanwhile a great force of men came in from all their tribes to the camp
                    of the Volsci and Aequi. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They made no question
                    but that the Romans, if they had perceived them, would retreat in the night, and
                    accordingly at about the third watch <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        The Romans divided the night into four equal watches, beginning at sunset.
                    </note> they came to attack the camp. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Quinctius stilled the tumult which the sudden alarm had raised, and bidding the
                    soldiers remain quietly in their tents, led out a cohort of Hernici to an
                    outpost, and mounting trumpeters and buglers upon horses, ordered them to blow
                    their instruments in front of the rampart and keep the enemy in suspense till
                    daybreak. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> For the remainder of the night all
                    was so peaceful in camp that the Romans were even able to sleep. But the Volsci,
                    beholding armed foot-soldiers, whom they supposed to be more numerous than they
                    were, and to be Romans; and hearing the stamping and neighing of the horses,
                    which were infuriated not only at finding unaccustomed riders on their backs,
                    but also by the blare of the trumpets, were kept on the alert in anticipation of
                    an attack. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> As soon as it was light, the Romans, who <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 468</note> were fresh
                    and had enjoyed a good sleep, were led out into line of battle. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> The Volsci, weary from standing and from loss of sleep,
                    were driven back at the first assault; though it was rather a retreat than a
                    rout, for behind them were hills, to which, under cover of the first line, they
                    withdrew safely and in good order. The consul ordered a halt when his army
                    reached rising ground. The infantry could hardly be restrained, noisily
                    demanding permission to press on after the fleeing enemy. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Still more ardent were the cavalry. They swarmed about the
                    general, and shouted that <pb n="p.433"/> they were going on before the
                    standards. While the <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin"
                        >B.C. 468</note> consul was hesitating, feeling certain of the valour of his
                    troops but doubtful of the ground, the men cried out that they were going, and
                    instantly made good their word. Planting their spears in the ground, that they
                    might be the lighter for the ascent, they went up at a run. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> The Volsci, having discharged their javelins at the first
                    onset, picked up the stones which lay about under their feet, and flung them at
                    their enemies as they mounted. Confused by this rain of missiles from above, the
                    left wing of the Romans was nearly overwhelmed, and had already begun to
                    retreat, when the consul, reproaching them at once with rashness and with
                    cowardice, succeeded in shaming them out of their fear. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> First they made a resolute stand; then, after holding their
                    ground and returning blow for blow, they even dared to press forward and,
                    renewing their cheers, set their line in motion; then with another rush they
                    struggled upward and scaled the height; and they were just emerging upon the
                    summit of the ridge, when the enemy turned and fled. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Running at full speed, and almost in one body, the pursued
                    and the pursuers reached the Volscian camp, which was captured in the panic.
                    Those of the Volsci who succeeded in escaping made for Antium, and to Antium
                    marched the Roman army also. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> After a blockade
                    of a few days the place surrendered; the besiegers had not delivered any new
                    attack, but the Volsci had lost heart from the moment of their unsuccessful
                    battle and the capture of their camp. </p>
