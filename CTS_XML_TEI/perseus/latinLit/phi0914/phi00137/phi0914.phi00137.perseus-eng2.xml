                    <p> Lucius Cornelius Scipio the consul, having as lieutenant Publius Scipio
                        Africanus, (who had declared that he would be his brother's lieutenant if
                        the province of Greece was decreed to him, when that province appeared
                        likely to be assigned to Caius Laelius, who had great influence in the se-
                        nate,) set out to wage war against Antiochus, and was the first Roman
                        general that ever passed over into Asia. Aemilius Regillus, with the
                        assistance of the Rhodians, fought successfully against the royal fleet of
                        Antiochus at Myonnesus. The son of Africanus, having been taken by
                        Antiochus, was sent back to his father. Manius Acilius Glabrio tri- umphed
                        over Antiochus, whom he had driven out of Greece, and over the Aetolians.
                        Antiochus being subsequently conquered by Lucius Cornelius Scipio, with the
                        aid of Eumenes, son of Attalus, and king of Pergamus, peace was granted to
                        hint on these terms-that he should evacuate all the provinces on this side
                        Mount Taurus. The kingdom of Eumenes, through whose assistance Antiochus had
                        been conquered, was enlarged. Some states were granted to the Rhodians too,
                        who also had assisted them. The colony of Bononia was founded. Aemilius
                        Regillus, who had conquered the admirals of Antiochus in a naval engagement,
                        triumphed. Lucius Cornelius Scipio, who had brought the war with Antiochus
                        to a conclu- sion, was called Asiaticus, attaining to an equality with his
                        brother by this surname. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Lucius CORNELIUS SCIPIO and Caius Laelius
                    being consuls, no business, after the duties of religion, was transacted in the
                    senate prior to that of the Aetolians. Not only their ambassadors were urgent,
                    because they had a truce of a short period, but they were aided by Titus
                    Quinctius also, who had then returned to Rome from Greece. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> The Aetolians, as being persons to whom there was more hope
                    in the mercy of the senate than in their cause, acted suppliantly, weighing
                    their by-gone services against their recent misconduct. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> But when <pb n="1656" xml:id="p.1656"/> present, they were
                    importuned by questions of the senators, wringing from them an acknowledgment of
                    their guilt rather than replies, and when ordered to depart from the senate,
                    they caused a great contest. Resentment had more power in their case than
                    compassion; for the senate were incensed against them not merely as enemies, but
                    as an uncivilized and unsocial race. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> After it
                    had been contested several days, it was at last resolved, that peace should
                    neither be granted nor refused. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Two conditions
                    were offered them, either that they should yield to the senate unconditional
                    power over them, or pay one thousand talents, <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified"> 193,750 <hi rend="italics">l.</hi>
                    </note> and have the same friends and enemies. To them, desirous to elicit in
                    what things they should give to the senate unconditional power over them, no
                    positive answer is given; but being thus dismissed, without having concluded a
                    peace, they were ordered to quit the city that very day, and Italy within
                    fifteen days. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They then began to debate
                    concerning the provinces for the consuls. Both of these wished for Greece.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Laelius had a powerful interest in the
                    senate; and when the senate had ordered that the consuls should either cast lots
                    for the provinces, or settle them between themselves, he observed, that they
                    would act with more propriety in leaving that matter to the wisdom of the
                    senators, than to the decision of lot. To this Scipio, an answer being given
                    that he would take advice how he ought to act, having spoken to his brother
                    alone, and having been desired by him to leave it unhesitatingly to the senate,
                    answered his colleague that he would do what he recommended. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> When this plan, either original or supported by precedents
                    of a record now lost by antiquity, being referred to the senate, had aroused
                    them by the expectation of a contest, Publius Scipio Africanus said, that
                        <quote> if they decreed that province to his brother, Lucius Scipio, he
                        would go along with him, as his lieutenant-general. </quote>
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This proposal being received with universal
                    approbation, put an end to all dispute. The senate were well pleased to make the
                    trial, whether king Antiochus should have more effectual aid in the vanquished
                    Hannibal, or the Roman consul and legions in his conqueror Africanus; and they
                    almost all voted Greece to Scipio, and Italy to Laelius. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> The praetors then cast lots for their provinces: Lucius
                    Aurunculeius obtained the city jurisdiction; Cneius Fulvius, the foreign; Lucius
                    Aemilius Regil- <pb n="1657" xml:id="p.1657"/> lus, the fleet; Publius Junius
                    Brutus, the Tuscans; Marcus Tuccius, Apulia and Bruttium; and Caius Atinius,
                    Sicily. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Then to the consul to whom the province of
                    Greece had been decreed, in addition to the army which he was about to receive
                    from M. Acilius, (but they were two legions,) three thousand Roman foot and one
                    hundred horse, and of the Latin confederates five thousand foot and two hundred
                    horse, are added as a reinforcement; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> and it
                    was further ordered, that if, when he arrived in his province, he would judge it
                    conducive to the public interest, he should be at liberty to carry over the army
                    into Asia. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> To the other consul was decreed an
                    army entirely new; two Roman legions, and of the Latin confederates fifteen
                    thousand foot and six hundred horse. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Quintius
                    Minucius was ordered to remove his forces out of Liguria (for he had written,
                    that the province was completely subdued, and that the whole nation of the
                    Ligurians had surrendered) into the country of the Boians, and to give up the
                    command to Publius Cornelius, proconsul. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The
                    two city legions, enlisted the year before, about to be brought home from the
                    country in which Cornelius had fined the conquered Boians, were assigned to
                    Marcus Tuccius, praetor, together with fifteen thousand foot and six hundred
                    horse, of the Latin confederates, to occupy Apulia and Bruttium. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> Orders were given to Aulus Cornelius, a praetor of
                    the preceding year, who occupied Bruttium with an army, that if the consul
                    judged it proper, he should <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> transport his
                    legions into Aetolia, and give them to Manius Acilius, provided the latter was
                    inclined to remain there; but if Acilius wished to come to Rome, that then Aulus
                    Cornelius should stay in Aetolia with that army. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                    /> It was resolved that Caius Atinius Labeo should receive from Marcus Aemilius
                    the province of Sicily, and the army there; and should, if he deemed it proper,
                    enlist in the province itself two thousand foot and one hundred horse, for a
                    reinforcement. Publius Junius Brutus was ordered to raise a new army for
                    Tuscany, consisting of one Roman legion, and ten thousand foot of the allies and
                    Latin nation, and four hundred horse. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Lucius
                    Aemilius, whose province was the sea, was ordered to receive from Marcus Junius,
                    praetor of the former year, twenty <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> ships of
                    war, with their crews, and himself to enlist one thousand marines and two
                    thousand foot soldiers, with which ships and soldiers he <pb n="1658"
                        xml:id="p.1658"/> was to sail to Asia, and receive the command of the fleet
                    from Caius Livius. To the governors of the two Spains and Sardinia, their
                    command is prolonged for a year, and the same armies were decreed them.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Sicily and Sardinia were, this year,
                    assessed in two-tenths of their corn. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> All the
                    corn from Sicily was ordered to be carried into Aetolia, to the army there; of
                    that to be collected from Sardinia, one-half to Rome, and the other half into
                    Aetolia, for the same use as the corn from Sicily. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> It was judged proper, that, previous to the
                    departure of the consuls for their provinces, the prodigies should be expiated
                    under the direction of the pontiffs. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The
                    temple of Juno Lucina, at Rome, was struck by lightning in such a manner, that
                    the summit and the folding-doors were much damaged. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> At Puteoli, the wall and a gate were struck by lightning in
                    several parts, and two men killed. It was clearly proved, that, at Nursia, in
                    the midst of a calm, a tempest suddenly burst forth; and there also two freemen
                    were killed. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The Tusculans reported, that a
                    shower of earth fell in their country; and the Reatines, that a mule brought
                    forth young in theirs. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> These prodigies were
                    expiated, and the Latin festival was celebrated a second time, because the
                    flesh-meat, which ought to be given to the Laurentians, had not been given them.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> There was also a supplication made on
                    account of those religious fears; the decemvirs gave directions from the books,
                    to which of the gods it should be performed. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Ten free-born youths, and ten virgins, all of whom had their fathers and mothers
                    living, were employed in that ceremony; and the decemvirs sacrificed sucklings
                    by night. Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, before he left the city, erected
                    an arch on the Capitol, facing the road by which we ascend to it, with seven
                    gilded statues and two horses, and placed two marble cisterns in the front of
                    the arch. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> During that period, forty-three of
                    the principal Aetolians, among whom were Damocritus and his brother, were
                    brought to Rome by two cohorts, sent by Manius Acilius, and were thrown into the
                    prison called Lautumiae, or the quarry. Lucius Cornelius the consul ordered the
                    cohorts after that to return to the army. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Ambassadors came from Ptolemy and Cleopatra, king and queen of Egypt,
                    congratulating the Romans because the consul Manius Acilius had driven king
                    Antiochus out of Greece, <pb n="1659" xml:id="p.1659"/> and advising that they
                    should carry over their army into Asia. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> For
                        <quote> all places, not only in Asia, but also in Syria, were filled with
                        consternation; and the king and queen of Egypt would be prepared to do those
                        things which the senate should direct. </quote>
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Thanks were returned to the king and queen,

                    what was necessary to be done at Rome, gave public notice, in an assembly of the
                    people, that the soldiers, whom he himself had enlisted for a reinforcement, and
                    those who were in Bruttium with Aulus Cornelius, proprietor, should all meet him
                    at Brundusium on the ides of July. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He likewise
                    appointed three lieutenants-general, Sextus Digitius, Lucius Apustius, and Caius
                    Fabricius Luscinus; who were to bring together ships from all parts of the
                    sea-coast to Brundusium; and now, every thing being ready, he set out from the
                    city in his military robe of state. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> About five
                    thousand volunteers of the Romans and allies, who had served out their
                    campaigns, under the command of Publius Africanus, attended the consul at his
                    departure, and gave in their names. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At the
                    time in which the consul set out to the war during the celebration of the
                    Apollinarian games, on the fifth day before the ides of July, though the sky was
                    serene, the light was obscured in the middle of the day, when the moon passed
                    beneath the orb of the sun. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> L. Aemilius
                    Regillus, to whom the sea had fallen as his province, set out at the same time.
                    To Lucius Aurunculeius this business was assigned by the senate, that he should
                    build thirty quinqueremes and twenty triremes, because there was a report that
                    Antiochus, since the engagement at sea, was fitting out a much larger fleet.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Aetolians, after the ambassadors
                    brought back word from Rome that there was no hope of peace, although their
                    whole seacoast, which was opposite to Peloponnesus, was ravaged by the Achaeans,
                    regarding the danger more than their losses, seized on Mount Corax, in order to
                    shut up the pass against the Romans; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> for they
                    had no doubt that they would return in the beginning of spring to the siege of
                    Naupactum. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> It appeared better to Acilius, who
                    knew that this was expected, to attempt a thing that was not anticipated, and to
                    lay <pb n="1660" xml:id="p.1660"/> siege to Lamia; for the garrison had been
                    reduced by Philip almost to a state of desperation; <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> and being then off their guard, because they feared no such
                    attempt, might be surprised by himself. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Marching from Elatia, he formed his first encampment in the enemy's country, on
                    the banks of the river Sperchius, and decamping thence in the night, he at break
                    of day attacked the town with a line of troops that encircled it. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> As is usual in an unexpected affair, great
                    consternation and tumult ensued; yet the besieged, with greater resolution than
                    any one could suppose them capable of under such a sudden alarm, when the men
                    fought, and the women brought weapons of every kind, and stones, to the walls,
                    defended the city for that day, although the scaling ladders were raised against
                    the walls. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> About mid-day, Acilius, the signal
                    for retreat being given, drew off his men to their camp. After their bodies were
                    refreshed by food and rest, before he dismissed the meeting in the Praetorium,
                    he gave them notice, <quote> to be ready and under arms before day; and that
                        they were not to return to their tents until the city should be taken. </quote>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Next day, at the same hour as before, having
                    began the assault in a greater number of places, as not only the strength, but
                    also the weapons, and above all, the courage of the garrison began to fail, he
                    took the town in the space of a few hours. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> One
                    half of the spoil found there was sold in parcels; the other was divided among
                    the soldiers; and a council was held to determine what he should next undertake.
                    No one approved of going against Naupactum, while the pass at Corax was occupied
                    by the Aetolians. That, however, the summer campaign might not be an idle one,
                    and that the Aetolians might not through his supineness possess the peace that
                    they could not obtain from the senate, Acilius resolved to besiege Amphissa; his
                    army was led thither from Heraclea by Œta. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Having encamped under the walls, he proceeded to attack the town, not by general
                    assault, as at Lamia, but by regular approaches. The ram was brought up to the
                    walls in many places at once; and though these were shaken by it, yet the
                    townsmen never attempted to provide or contrive any sort of defence against such
                    a description of mechanism. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> All their hope was
                    in arms and courage. By frequent sallies they much annoyed not only the advanced
                    guards of the Romans, but even those who were employed at the works and
                    machines. <pb n="1661" xml:id="p.1661"/>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> However, the wall was broken down in many
                    places, when word was brought, that his successor, having landed his army at
                    Apollonia, was coming through Epirus and Thessaly. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> The consul came with thirteen thousand foot and five
                    hundred horse. He had already arrived at the Malian bay; and after that, to his
                    messengers sent forward to Hypata, to order a surrender of the city, this
                    response was given, that they would do nothing except by the common consent of
                    the Aetolians: that the siege of Hypata might not detain him while Amphissa was
                    not yet recovered, having sent forward his brother Africanus, he leads his
                    forces to Amphissa. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> A little before their
                    arrival, the towns-people having abandoned the city, for it was now, for the
                    most part, stripped of its walls; all, armed and unarmed, retired into the
                    citadel, which they deemed an impregnable fortress. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> The consul pitched his camp at the distance of about six
                    miles from the town; and thither came ambassadors from the Athenians,
                    addressing, first, Publius Scipio, who preceded the main body as before
                    mentioned, and afterwards the consul, with earnest supplications in favour of
                    the Aetolians. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They received a milder answer
                    from Africanus, who, wishing for an honourable pretext for relinquishing the
                    Aetolian war, was directing his views towards Asia and king Antiochus, and had
                    recommended to the Athenians to persuade, not only the Romans, but the Aetolians
                    likewise, to prefer peace to war. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> By the
                    advice of the Athenians a numerous embassy of the Aetolians came speedily from
                    Hypata, and the discourse of Africanus, whom they addressed first, augmented
                    their hopes of peace; for he mentioned, that <quote> many nations and states,
                        first in Spain, and afterwards in Africa, had thrown themselves on his
                        protection; and that, in all of them, he had left greater monuments of
                        clemency and kindness than of military prowess. </quote> The business seemed
                    to be concluded, when the consul, on being applied to, repeated the very same
                    answer with which they had been driven off by the senate. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> When the Aetolians were thunderstruck at this, as if they
                    had never heard it before, (for they now perceived that no progress was made
                    either from the Athenian embassy or the favourable reply of Africanus,) they
                    said that they wished to consult their countrymen on the affair. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> They then returned to Hypata, nor were their
                    plans cleared of difficulties. For they had no means of paying the thousand <pb

                    submission, they dreaded lest cruelty should be inflicted on their persons.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They, therefore, ordered the same
                    ambassadors to return to the consul and Africanus, and to request, that if they
                    meant in reality to grant them peace, and not merely to amuse them with a
                    prospect of it, frustrating the hopes of the wretched, they would either remit
                    some part of the money required to be paid, or order that the unconditional
                    submission should not extend to their persons. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Nothing was accomplished whereby the consul might change his resolution; and
                    that embassy, also, was dismissed without effect. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> The Athenian ambassadors accompanied them. And Echedemus,
                    their principal in the embassy, recalled to hope the Aetolians, dejected by so
                    many repulses, and deploring with unavailing lamentations the hard fate of their
                    nation —by advising them to request a suspension of arms for six months, in
                    order that they might send an embassy to Rome. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    He urged that "the delay could add nothing to their present calamities, which
                    were already severe in the extreme; but that, if time intervened, their present
                    calamities might be alleviated by many chances. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                    /> Agreeably to this advice of Echedemus, the same ambassadors were sent again;
                    who, making their first application to Publius Scipio, obtained, through him,
                    from the consul, a suspen- sion of arms for the time they desired: <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> and the siege of Amphissa being raised, Manius
                    Acilius, the army being delivered to the consul, left the province; and the
                    consul returned from Amphissa into Thessaly, with intention of leading his
                    troops into Asia through Macedonia and Thrace. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    Here Africanus said to his brother, Lucius Scipio, "I also, Lucius Scipio,
                    approve of the route which you adopt. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But the
                    whole matter rests on the inclinations of Philip; for if he be faithful to our

                    support and aid an army on a long march. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But
                    if he should fail in this, you will find no safety in any part of Thrace. In my
                    opinion, therefore, the king's disposition ought in the first place to be
                    discovered. He will be best tested if the person who shall be sent will come

                    cups: that very relaxation of mind removed all suspicion of any intention of
                    changing his measures. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> His guest was kindly
                    entertained for the present; and next day he saw provisions in abundance already
                    prepared for the army, bridges made over rivers, and roads fortified where the

                    magnificence, and accompanied them on their march. Much pleasantry and good
                    humour appeared in him, which recommended him much to Africanus, a man who, as
                    he was unparalleled in other respects, was not averse to courteousness

                    entirely excluded from the sea. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It occurred to
                    him that he had been defeated when the Rhodian fleet was absent; if this fleet
                    were present in an engagement, (and the Rhodians would certainly not be guilty
                    of being late a second time,) he required a vast number of ships to equal the

                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> For this reason, he sent Hannibal into

                    the scarcity of corn was also galling, on account of which the ships also and

                        honourable to treat of peace at that time, nor could an end be put to the

                        can we, shut up as we are, within our walls, and besieged, with honour
                        accept terms of peace? Or to whom shall that treaty be valid, which we shall
                        conclude, without the presence of the consul, without a vote of the senate,
                        and without an order of the Roman people? <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        For, let me ask, supposing the matter concluded by you, would you
                        immediately go home to Italy, and carry away your fleet and army, or would
                        you wait to know the consul's determination on the case; what the senate
                        should decree, or the people order? <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> It
                        remains therefore that you must stay in Asia, that your troops being led
                        back again into winter quarters, the war being given over, must exhaust the
                        allies in furnishing provisions; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> and then,
                        if it seem fit to those who have the power of determining, we must begin the

                        before winter, if no relaxation from our present vigorous movements is made
                        by delay. </quote>
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This opinion prevailed; and the answer given
                    to Antiochus was, that they could not treat of peace before the arrival of the
                    consul. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Antiochus, peace being tried for in
                    vain, ravaged, first, the territory of Elaea, then that of Pergamus; and,
                    leaving there his son Seleucus, marched in a hostile manner to Adramyttium,
                    whence he proceeded to a rich tract of country called the Plain of Thebes, a
                    city celebrated in one of Homer's poems; and in no other place in Asia did the

                    At the same time, Aemilius and Eumenes also, sailing round with the fleet, came

                    Diophanes, having observed all these particulars from the lofty city of

                    took post at a small distance from the enemy's guard, waiting his opportunity.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Both the people in Pergamus thought that
                    it was madness rather than daring, and the enemy, after observing his party for
                    a short time, as soon as they saw no movement among them, did not change their
                    usual negligence, ridiculing moreover the smallness of their number. <milestone

                    terrified, but the horses also; and when they broke their collars, they caused

                    same place. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> During many hours, both parties
                    intently awaited the assault, as if it were about to take place immediately.
                    When it was not far from sun-set, the usual time of their returning to the main
                    camp, the king's troops, forming in close order, began to retire in a body,

                    Diophanes did not stir until they were out of sight; and then he rushed on their
                    rear-guard with the same vehemence as before, and again excited such dismay and
                    confusion, that, though the hindmost were put to the sword, not one of them
                    halted to fight; they were driven into their camp in confusion, and scarcely

                    daring exertions of the Achaeans obliged Seleucus to decamp, and quit the
                    territory of Pergamus. Antiochus, having learned that the Romans and Eumenes
                    were come to protect Adramyttium, made no attempt on that city, but ravaged the
                    country adjoining. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He afterwards reduced

                    all taken at the first assault. He then returned through Thyatira to Sardis.
                    Seleucus, remaining on the sea-coast, was a terror to one party, a protection to
                    the other. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Roman fleet, with Eumenes and
                    the Rhodians, retired, first to Mitylene, and then to Elaea, whence they had set

                    was surpassingly adorned with them,) they then passed over to the city.

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> It was then resolved that Eumenes should
                    return home, and make every necessary preparation for the passage of the consul
                    and his army over the Hellespont; and that the Roman and Rhodian fleets should
                    sail back to Samos, and remain stationed there, that Polyxenidas might not make
                    any movement from Ephesus. The king returned to Elaea, the Romans and Rhodians
                    to Samos. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> There, Marcus Aemilius, brother of

                    in order that they might take up a position there, against a fleet which was

                    consequence of the unwholesomeness of the place, and of the season of the year,
                    (for it was now the middle of summer,) and of the unusual stench, diseases began
                    to spread with violence, particularly among the rowers, an event which they did

                    The king's fleet had been the slower in its passage, the season of the Etesiae
                    being opposed to them, for this is the periodical time for the northwest winds.
                    The Rhodians had thirty-two quadriremes and four triremes. In the king's fleet
                    were thirty-seven ships of the larger rates; among which were three of seven,
                    and four of six banks of oars; and besides these, ten triremes. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> They discovered too, from some watch-tower, that the
                    Rhodians were at hand. Both fleets, at the dawn of the next day, moved out of
                    port, as if resolved to come to an immediate engagement; and, as soon as the
                    Rhodians passed the promontory that stretches into the deep from Sida, they
                    descried the enemy, and were observed by them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    On the king's side, Hannibal had the command of the left squadron, which
                    stretched away seaward; Apollonius, one of the nobles, had the command of the
                    right, and they had their ships already formed in a line a-head. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> The Rhodians approached in a long line. First was the
                    admiral's ship, with Eudamus in it; Chariclitus brought up the rear; and
                    Pamphilidas commanded the centre division. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    When Eudamus saw the enemy's line formed and ready for battle, he pushed out
                    towards the main, ordering the ships that followed to form, regularly, as they
                    came up, in line of battle. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This caused
                    confusion at first; for he had not stretched out to the main far enough for the
                    line of all the ships to form in the direction of the land, and he himself
                    hurrying on with precipitation, with only five ships, engaged with Hannibal; the
                    rest, having received orders to form their line, did not come up. <milestone

                    expertness of their men in nautical business, quickly freed the Rhodians from
                    all embarrassment. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They pushed out hastily
                    towards the main, and each made room next the land for the one immediately
                    behind; and when any made a stroke with its beak against a ship of the enemy, it
                    either shattered its prow, or swept off its oars; or passing by it in the clear
                    space <pb n="1680" xml:id="p.1680"/> between the vessels, made an attack on its
                    stern. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> One of the king's seven-banked ships
                    being sunk with one stroke, by a Rhodian vessel of much smaller size,
                    discouraged them very much. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Therefore the
                    right wing of the enemy was now undoubtedly verging to flight. Hannibal, in the
                    open sea, by means chiefly of his superior number of ships, pressed hard on
                    Eudamus, who surpassed him in every other respect: and he would have surrounded
                    him were it not that, on the signal being given from the admiral's fleet, (by
                    which it is usual to collect together the fleet when dispersed,) all the ships
                    which had conquered on the right wing came speedily to bear aid to their own
                    party. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This made Hannibal himself, with all
                    his division, betake themselves to flight; while the Rhodians could not pursue,
                    because their rowers being most of them sick, were therefore the sooner wearied.

                    with food on the sea where they brought to, Eudamus, observing the enemy towing,

                    little more than twenty that were going off uninjured, commanded silence from
                    the castle of the commander's ship, and then called out, <quote>Arise, and feast

                    ordered the trumpets to sound, to call in such as might have straggled into the
                    country, and sent the tribunes into the city, to hasten the soldiers and sailors
                    on board. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The confusion was not less than if
                    the place were on fire, or taken by an enemy; some running to call out the men;
                    others hurrying to the ships, while the orders of the officers were confounded
                    by irregular shouts, amid which the trumpets raised their din, until at length
                    the crowd collected at the ships. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Here
                    scarcely could each know his own ship, or make his way through the tumult; and
                    the disorder would probably have been productive of much mischief, on land and
                    sea, had not Aemilius, in the commander's ship, sailed out first <pb n="1686"
                        xml:id="p.1686"/> into the main; where, receiving those following, he put
                    each into its own place, so as to form a line abreast: <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> and Eudamus, with the Rhodian fleet, waited at the shore,
                    that the men might be embarked without confusion, and that every ship might
                    leave the harbour as soon as it was ready. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> By
                    these means, the foremost division formed under the eye of the praetor, while
                    the rear was brought up by the Rhodians; and then the whole line, in as regular
                    order as if within sight of the foe, advanced into the open sea. They were
                    between Myonnesus and the promontory of Corycus, when they first got sight of
                    the enemy. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The king's fleet, which was coming
                    in a long line, with only two vessels abreast, then formed themselves in order
                    of battle, stretching out their left division so far, as that it might enclose
                    the right of the Romans. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When Eudamus, who
                    commanded in the rear, perceived that the Romans could not form an equal front,
                    but were just on the point of being surrounded, he pushed up his ships. They
                    were Rhodians, by far the fastest sailers of any of the fleet; and having filled
                    up the deficiency in the extent of the line, he opposed his own ship to the
                    commander's, on board of which was Polyxenidas. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Now the entire fleets in every part were
                    engaged in action. On the side of the Romans eighty ships were fighting, of
                    which twenty-two were Rhodian. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The enemy's
                    fleet consisted of eighty-nine ships, and they had of the largest rates, three
                    of six, and two of seven banks. In the strength of the vessels, and valour of
                    the soldiers, the Romans had greatly the advantage of the king's party, as had
                    the Rhodians in the activity of their vessels, the skill of the pilots, and the
                    dexterity of the rowers. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> However, those which
                    carried fire before them were the greatest terror to the enemy: and what was the
                    sole cause of their preservation when they were surrounded at Panormus, proved
                    here the principal means of victory. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> For when
                    the king's ships, through fear of the fire, had turned aside, in order to avoid
                    at the same time encountering the enemy's prow with their own, they could not
                    strike their antagonist with the beaks, but exposed the side of their ships to
                    his strokes; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> and if any did venture an
                    encounter, it was immediately overspread with the fire that was poured in; while
                    the men were more alarmed at the fire than the battle. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> How- ever, the bravery of the soldiers, as is generally the
                    case, <pb n="1687" xml:id="p.1687"/> chiefly availed in deciding the battle. For
                    the Romans, having broke through the centre of the enemy's line, tacked about
                    and fell upon the rear of the division which was engaged with the Rhodians; and,
                    in an instant of time, both Antiochus's centre division, and the ships on the
                    left, were surrounded and sunk. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The squadron
                    on the right, which was still entire, was terrified rather by the disaster of
                    their friends, than by any immediate danger threatening themselves; but, when
                    they saw the others surrounded, and Polyxenidas's ship deserting its associates,
                    and sailing away, having quickly hoisted their topsails, they betook themselves
                    to flight, (and they steering for Ephesus had a favourable wind,) having lost
                    forty-two ships in that battle; of which thirteen struck, and fell into the
                    hands of the Romans; the rest were burned or sunk. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Two Roman ships were shattered, and several were much
                    damaged. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> One Rhodian vessel was taken by an
                    extraordinary casualty; for, on its striking a Sidonian ship with its beak, its
                    anchor, thrown out by the force of the shock, caught fast hold of the other's
                    prow with its fluke, as if it were a grappling-iron thrown in. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> Great confusion ensuing thereon, when the Rhodians, who
                    wished to disengage themselves from the enemy, pulled back, its cable being
                    dragged forcibly, and at the same time entangled with the oars, swept off one
                    side of them. The very ship, which, when struck, had grappled with it, took the
                    Rhodian galley in its weakened state. The naval battle at Myonnesus was fought
                    principally in this manner. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> By which Antiochus being terrified, because,
                    as he was driven from the possession of the sea, he despaired of being able to
                    defend his distant possessions, ordered the garrison to be withdrawn from
                    Lysimachia, which plan was ill devised, as the event subsequently proved, lest
                    it should be there cut off by the Romans. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> As
                    it was easy for him, not only to defend Lysimachia from the first attack of the
                    Romans, but to protract the siege through the whole winter; and by thus
                    prolonging the time, to reduce the besiegers to the extremity of want; and in
                    the mean time try the hope of peace, as opportunities should present themselves.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But, after the defeat at sea, he not only
                    gave up Lysimachia, but even raised the siege of Colophon, and retired to
                    Sardis. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Here, bending all his thoughts to one
                    single object, that of meeting the enemy in <pb n="1688" xml:id="p.1688"/> the
                    field, he sent into Cappadocia, to Ariarathes, to request assistance, and to
                    every other place within his power, to collect forces. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Aemilius Regillus, after his victory at sea, proceeded to
                    Ephesus, having drawn up his ships before the harbour, when he had extorted from
                    the enemy a final acknowledgment of their having surrendered the dominion of the
                    sea, sailed to Chios, to which he had directed his course from Samos, before the
                    sea-fight. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> As soon as he had refitted the
                    ships that had been damaged in the battle, he sent off Lucius Aemilius Scaurus,
                    with thirty others, to the Hellespont, to transport the army; and decorating the
                    Rhodian vessels with naval spoils, and allowing them a part of the booty, he
                    ordered them to return home. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Rhodians
                    energetically took the lead, and proceeded to assist in transporting the
                    consul's forces, and when they had completed that service also, then at length
                    returned to Rhodes. The Roman fleet sailed from Chios to Phocaea. This city
                    stands at the bottom of a bay, and is of an oblong shape. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The wall encompasses a space of two miles and a half in
                    length, and then contracts on both sides into a very narrow wedge-like form,
                    which place they call Lampter (or the light-house). The breadth here extends one
                    thousand two hundred paces; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> and a tongue of
                    land stretching out about a mile into the sea, divides the bay nearly in the
                    middle, as if with a line; where it is connected with the main land by a narrow
                    isthmus, it has two very safe harbours, turned to each side. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> The one that fronts the south they call Naustathmos, (the
                    station for ships,) from the circumstance of its being capable of containing a

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When the Roman fleet had taken possession of
                    these very safe harbours, the praetor thought proper, before he attempted the
                    fortifications, either by escalade or works, that persons should be sent to
                    sound the disposition of the magistrates and principal people in the place: when
                    he saw them obstinate, he determined to attack the city in two places at the
                    same time. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> One part was thinly occupied by
                    private dwellings, temples of the gods occupying a great deal of the ground.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In that part first, having brought up the
                    battering-ram, he began to shake the wall and towers; <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> and when the multitude within ran thither to defend that
                    spot, the battering-ram, were applied in the other quarter, and the walls <pb

                        n="5" unit="section"/> On the fall of which, when some of the Roman soldiers
                    were making an assault over the scattered masses of ruins, others attempted to
                    scale walls; the townsmen made such an obstinate resistance, as plainly showed
                    that they had a firmer dependence on their arms and courage, than on their
                    fortifications. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The praetor, compelled by the
                    danger of the soldiers, sounded a retreat, that he might not expose them
                    incautious to his opponents, maddened with despair and rage. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> The fighting being ended, the besieged did not, even then,
                    think of rest; but all hastened from every quarter, to strengthen the walls, and
                    to raise new ones in the place of those that had been demolished. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> While they were busily employed in this manner,
                    Quintus Antonius, being sent by the praetor, came to them, who, after having
                    blamed their obstinacy, assured them that <quote> the Romans were more anxious
                        than they were themselves that the battle should not be carried on to the
                        destruction of the city. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> If they would
                        desist from their madness, Aemilius would allow them to capitulate on the
                        same terms on which they had formerly surrendered to Caius Livius. </quote>
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> When they heard this, having taken five days'
                    time to deliberate, and having in the mean time tried the hope of aid from
                    Antiochus, after that the ambassadors sent to the king had brought back word
                    that there was no aid in him, they opened their gates, stipulating that they
                    should suffer nothing hostile. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> When the
                    troops were marching into the city, and the praetor had proclaimed that it was
                    his pleasure that the surrendered townsmen should be spared, there arose an
                    universal clamour, <quote> that it was shameful that the Phocaeans, who had
                        never been faithful to any alliance, and had always been bitter in enmity,
                        should escape with impunity. </quote> After which words, as if a signal had
                    been given by the praetor, they ran, in parties, every way, to plunder the city.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Aemilius, at first, began to resist, and
                    call them back, saying, that <quote> towns taken by storm, and not such as
                        surrendered, were plundered; and that, even with regard to the former, the

                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> But rage and avarice were too strong for his
                    authority; wherefore, despatching heralds through all parts of the city, he
                    ordered, that all persons of free condition should come to him in the forum,
                    that they should not be injured: and in all things which were in his power, the

                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> He restored to them their city, their

                    evacuated by its garrison. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> This latter event
                    gave much more satisfaction than even the success at sea; especially after they
                    came thither, and were hospitably received in the city, filled with provisions
                    of all sorts, as if provided for the arrival of the army; when, in besieging the

                    been previously got ready, by the care of king Eumenes, they crossed over,
                    without confusion, as if to friendly shores, no one opposing, and the ships
                    putting in at several different places. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This
                    raised to a high degree the spirits of the Romans, who saw the passage into Asia
                    left open to them; which thing they supposed would cost them a severe struggle.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They afterwards remained encamped a

                    gave him great hope that this might be attained; for he had imagined, that as

                    of many nations, dissimilar both in their persons and armour. There was a body
                    of sixteen thousand men armed after the manner of the Macedonians, which were
                    called a phalanx. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> This formed the centre, and
                    was divided in front into ten parts. These parts were separated by two elephants
                    placed between each two; the line of soldiers was thirty-two ranks deep from
                    point to rear. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This was the main strength of
                    the king's army, and it exhibited a formidable sight, both in the other
                    particulars of its appearance, and in the elephants towering so high among the
                    soldiers. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They were of huge bulk, and the
                    caparisons of their foreheads and crests, and the towers fixed on their backs,
                    with four armed men standing on each tower, besides the managers of the beasts,
                    gave them a terrific appearance. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> On the right
                    side of the phalanx, he placed five hundred Gallograecian horsemen. To these he
                    joined three thousand horsemen clad in complete armour, whom they call
                    Cataphracti, or mailed. To these were added a brigade of near a thousand horse,
                    which they called Agema. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They were Medes, all
                    picked men, with a mixture of horsemen from many other nations in that part of
                    the world. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Adjoining <pb n="1697"

                    On the same side, a little farther on towards the wing, was the royal cohort;
                    these were called Argyraspides, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Silver

                    five hundred Mysian archers. Four thousand Cyrtaean slingers and Elymaean
                    archers mixed together covered the flank of the wing. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> Next to the left flank of the phalanx, stood one thousand
                    five hundred Gallograecian horse, and two thousand Cappadocians, (which were
                    sent by king Ariarathes,) wearing the same kind of armour; <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> then, auxiliaries of all kinds mixed together, two thousand
                    seven hundred; then, three thousand mailed horsemen; then, one thousand other
                    horsemen, being a royal cohort, equipped with lighter coverings for themselves
                    and their horses, but, in other respects, not unlike the rest; they were mostly
                    Syrians, with a mixture of Phrygians and Lydians. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> In the front of this body of cavalry were the chariots
                    armed with scythes, and a kind of camels called dromedaries. These were ridden
                    by Arabian archers, who carried thin swords four cubits long, that they might be
                    able to reach the enemy from so great a height. <milestone n="12" unit="section"

                    auxiliaries placed on the right wing, and sixteen elephants, separated by a
                    small interval. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The king himself was in the
                    right wing; the command of the left he gave to his son Seleucus, and Antipater,
                    the son of his brother; the centre was intrusted to three, Minio, Zeuxis, and
                    Philip, the master of the elephants. </p>

                    up in clouds, spread a general darkness; and the moisture issuing from it, and
                    coming from the southward, wetted every thing. This circumstance, which was
                    scarcely any inconvenience to <pb n="1698" xml:id="p.1698"/> the Romans, was
                    very disadvantageous to the king's troops. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> For
                    the indistinctness of the light did not take away from the Romans the view of
                    all parts of their line, since it was of moderate length; and the moisture
                    tended but little to blunt their swords and javelins, as they were almost all
                    heavy-armed troops. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The king's soldiers, as
                    the line was so extensive, could not even see their wings from the centre, much
                    less could those at the extremities see one another; and then, the moisture
                    relaxed the strings of their bows, their slings, and the thongs of their
                    javelins. Besides, the armed chariots, by means of which Antiochus had trusted
                    utterly to disorder the enemy's line, turned the terror of their operations on
                    their owners. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The manner in which they were
                    armed was this: from the yoke, on both sides of the pole, they had lances <note

                        have arisen principally from their misinterpretation of the word cuspis;
                        which in the classics is no where used as the edge of a cutting, but the
                        point of a piercing instrument —differt a mucrone, quae est acies gladii.
                        —Facciolati. That the cuspides, here spoken of, must have been piercing,
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> not cutting instruments, is likewise
                        proved from the meaning of the word <quote>transfigerent,</quote> which is
                        never used in reference to a cutting instrument. Taking it for granted,
                        then, that the <quote>cuspitibus decem cubita</quote> were spears ten feet
                        long, fastened to the pole and extended from the yoke, I can easily
                        understand how <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> they, being so long, were
                        likely to clear the way far in front of the horses, while the
                            <quote>falces</quote> on either side were intended to cut down those
                        that escaped the cuspides; and this being the case, I see no necessity for
                        Scheffer's reading, <quote>cubito,</quote> which Crevier also seems to
                        favour, and Drakenborch's <quote>duo</quote> for <quote>decem;</quote> both
                        of which seem to have been adopted, owing to the seeming improbability of
                        cutting weapons so long, and proportionably heavy, being attached to the
                        poles of chariots. </note> ten cubits <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    long, projecting like horns, to transfix any thing that came in their way. At
                    each extremity of the yoke, two scytheblades projected, one on a line with the
                    yoke, the other on its lower side, pointing to the ground; the former to cut
                    through any thing that might come within its reach on <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> the side, the other to catch such as fell, or endeavoured
                    to go under it. At each extremity of the axle of the wheels, two scythe-blades
                    were fastened in the same manner. The king, as we mentioned before, had placed
                    the chariots so armed in the front, because if they were placed in the rear, or
                    between the ranks, they must be driven through their own soldiers. <milestone

                    of that sort might be rendered as dangerous to one side as the other, if an

                    regular battle, ordered the Cretan bowmen, and slingers, and javelin-bearers,
                    with some troops of horse, not in a body, but scattering themselves as widely as
                    possible, to rush forwards, and pour weapons on them from all sides at once.
                    This storm, as it were, partly by the wounds made by the missile <milestone
                        n="11??" unit="section"/> weapons thrown from every quarter, and partly by
                    the discordant shouts raised, so terrified the horses, that immediately, as if
                    unbridled, they galloped about at random. The light infantry, the
                    lightly-accoutred slingers, and the active Cretans, quickly evaded their
                    encounter. The horsemen, following them, increased the tumult and the terror of
                    the horses and camels, which were likewise affrighted, the clamour being
                    multiplied and increased by the rest of the crowd of bystanders. By these means,
                    the chariots were driven <milestone n="12??" unit="section"/> out of the ground
                    between the two lines. When this fruitless mimicry of war was over, both parties

                    terrified at the turn and disorder of the chariots, betook them- selves to
                    flight, leaving all exposed as far as the post of the mailed horsemen;

                    the weight of their coverings and armour, were put to the sword. The whole left
                    wing then gave way, and the auxiliaries, posted between the cavalry and the
                    phalanx, being thrown into confusion, the terror spread even to the centre.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Here the ranks were broken, and by the
                    flying soldiers rushing in between them, the use of their long spears, called by
                    the Macedonians sarissas, was hindered. The Roman legions advanced and
                    discharged their javelins among them in disorder. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Even the elephants, standing in the way, did not deter the

                    the onset of the animal, and, getting at one side of it, either to ply it with
                    darts, or, if they could come near enough, to wound its sinews with their
                    swords. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The front of the centre was now almost

                    cowardice and disgraceful flight. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He then
                    proceeded to threats, —that if they did not obey his orders, they would rush
                    blindly on their own destruction. At last he gave orders to his own men to kill
                    the foremost of the runaways, and with sword-wounds to drive the crowd of
                    fugitives back against the enemy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The greater
                    fear now overcame the less. Compelled by the danger on either side, they first
                    halted, and then returned to the encounter, and Aemilius, with his guard,
                    consisting of two thousand men of distinguished valour, gave a vigorous check to

                    more severe loss by the chariots, elephants, and camels intermixed, and by their
                    own disorderly crowd; for, after they once broke their ranks, they rushed, as if
                    blind, one upon another, and were trodden to death by the trampling of the
                    beasts. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> In the camp also there was great
                    slaughter committed, rather greater than even in the field; for the flight of

                    Lucius Aemilius Paulus. Not long after, Lucius Scipio arrived in the city; and,
                    that he might not be inferior to his brother in point of a surname, he chose to
                    be called Asiaticus. He spoke largely of his services both before the senate and
                    a general assembly. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> There were some who judged
                    that the war was greater by fame than by real difficulty; for it was terminated
                    entirely by one memorable engagement; and that the glory of that victory had
                    been stripped of its bloom at Thermopylae. But, to any person judging
                    impartially, it must appear, that the fight at Thermopylae was with the
                    Aetolians, rather than with the king. For with how small a portion of his own
                    strength did Antiochus engage in that battle! <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    whereas, in the other, in Asia, the strength of the whole Asiatic continent
                    stood combined; for he had collected auxiliaries of all nations from the most
                    remote quarters of the east. Justly, therefore, were the greatest possible
                    honours paid to the immortal gods, for having rendered a most important victory
                    easy in the acquisition; and a triumph was decreed to the commander. He
                    triumphed in the intercalary month, the day before the calends of March; which
                    triumph was greater in the display to the eye than that of Africanus his
                    brother, yet if we recall to our memory the circumstances, and estimate the
                    dangers and difficulty, it was no more to be compared to it, than if you would
