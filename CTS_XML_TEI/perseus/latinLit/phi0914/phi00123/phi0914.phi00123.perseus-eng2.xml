                <argument>
                    <p> The Campanians revolt to Hannibal. Mago is sent to Carthage to announce the
                        victory of Cannœ. Hanno advises the Carthaginian senate to make peace with
                        the Romans, but is overborne by the Barcine faction. Claudi- us Marcellus
                        the praetor defeats Hannibal at Nola. Hannibal's army is enervated in mind
                        and body by luxurious living at Capua. Casilinum is besieged by the
                        Carthaginians, and the inhabitants reduced to the last extremity of famine.
                        A hundred and ninety-seven senators elected from the equestrian order.
                        Lucius Postumius is, with his army, cut off by the Gauls. Cneius and Publius
                        Scipio defeat Hasdrubal in Spain, and gain possession of that country. The
                        remains of the army, defeated at Cannœ, are sent off to Sicily, there to
                        remain until the termination of the war. An alliance is formed between
                        Philip, king of Macedon, and Hannibal. Sempronius Gracchus defeats the
                        Campanians. Successes of Titus Manlius in Sardinia: he takes Hasdrubal the
                        general, Mago, and Han- no prisoners. Claudius Marcellus again defeats the
                        army of Hannibal at Nola, and the hopes of the Romans are revived as to the
                        results of the war. </p>
                </argument>
                <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> AFTER the battle of Cannae, Hannibal, having
                    captured and plundered the Roman camp, had immediately removed from Apulia into
                    Samnium; invited into the territory of the Hirpini by Statius, who promised that
                    he would surrender Compsa. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Trebius, a native
                    of Compsa, was conspicuous for rank among his countrymen; but a faction of the
                    Mopsii kept him down — a family of great influence through the favour of the
                    Romans. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> After intelligence of the battle of
                    Cannae, and a report of the approach of Hannibal, circulated by the discourse of
                    Trebius, the Mopsian party had retired from the city; which was thus given up to
                    the Carthaginian without opposition, and a garrison received into it. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> Leaving there all his booty and baggage, and dividing
                    his forces, he orders Mago to receive under his protection the cities of that
                    district which might revolt from the Romans, and to force to defection those
                    which might be disinclined. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He himself,
                    passing through the territory of Campania, made for the lower sea, with the
                    intention of assaulting Naples, in order that he might be master of a maritime
                    city. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> As soon as he entered the confines of
                    the Neapoli- <pb n="836" xml:id="p.836"/> tan territory, he placed part of his
                    Numidians in ambush, wherever he could find a convenient spot; for there are
                    very many hollow roads and secret windings: others he ordered to drive before
                    them the booty they had collected from the country, and, exhibiting it to the
                    enemy, to ride up to the gates of the city. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As
                    they appeared to be few in number and in disorder, a troop of horse sallied out
                    against them, which was cut off, being drawn into an ambuscade by the others,
                    who purposely retreated: <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> nor would one of them
                    have escaped, had not the sea been near, and some vessels, principally such as
                    are used in fishing, observed at a short distance from the shore, afforded an
                    escape for those who could swim. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Several noble
                    youths, however, were captured and slain in that affair. Among whom, Hegeas, the
                    commander of the cavalry, fell when pursuing the retreating enemy too eagerly.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The sight of the walls, which were not
                    favourable to a besieging force, deterred the Carthaginian from storming the
                    city. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Thence he turned his course to Capua, which
                    was wantoning under a long course of prosperity, and the indulgence of fortune:
                    amid the general corruption, however, the most conspicuous feature was the
                    extravagance of the commons, who exercised their liberty without limit.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Pacuvius Calavius had rendered the senate
                    subservient to himself and the commons, at once a noble and popular man, but who
                    had acquired his influence by dishonourable intrigues. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Happening to hold the chief magistracy during the year in
                    which the defeat at the Trasimenus occurred, and thinking that the commons, who
                    had long felt the most violent hostility to the senate, would attempt some
                    desperate measure, should an opportunity for effecting a change present itself;
                    and if Hannibal should come into that quarter with his victorious army, would
                    murder the senators and deliver Capua to the Carthaginians; <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> as he desired to rule in a state preserved rather than
                    subverted (for though depraved he was not utterly abandoned); and as he felt
                    convinced that no state could be preserved if bereaved of its public council, he
                    adopted a plan by which he might preserve the senate and render it subject to
                    himself and the commons. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Having assembled the
                    senate, he prefaced his remarks by observing, <quote> that nothing would induce
                        him to acquiesce in a plan of defection from the Romans, were it not
                        absolutely necessary; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> since he had
                        children by the daughter <pb n="837" xml:id="p.837"/> of Appius Claudius,
                        and had a daughter at Rome married to Livius: but that a much more serious
                        and alarming matter threatened them, than any consequences which could
                        result from such a measure. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For that the
                        intention of the commons was not to abolish the senate by revolting to the
                        Carthaginians, but to murder the senators, and deliver the state thus
                        destitute to Hannibal and the Carthaginians. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                        /> That it was in his power to rescue them from this danger, if they would
                        resign themselves to his care, and, forgetting their political dissensions,
                        confide in him. </quote>
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When, overpowered with fear, they all put
                    themselves under his protection, he proceeded: <quote> I will shut you up in the
                        senate-house, and pretending myself to be an accomplice in the meditated
                        crime, I will, by approving measures which I should in vain oppose, find out
                        a way for your safety. For the performance of this take whatever pledge you
                        please. </quote>
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Having given his honour, he went out; and
                    having ordered the house to be closed, placed a guard in the lobby that no one
                    might enter or leave it without his leave. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Then assembling the people, he thus addressed
                    them: <quote> What you have so often wished for, Campanians, the power of
                        punishing an unprincipled and detestable senate, you now have, not at your
                        own imminent peril, by riotously storming the houses of each, which are
                        guarded and garrisoned with slaves and dependants, but free and without
                        danger. Take them all, shut up in the senate-house, alone and unarmed; nor
                        need you do any thing precipitately or blindly. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> I will give you the opportunity of pronouncing upon the
                        life or death of each, that each may suffer the punishment he has deserved.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But, above all, it behoves you so to
                        give way to your resentment, as considering that your own safety and
                        advantage are of greater importance. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> For I
                        apprehend that you hate these particular senators, and not that you are
                        unwilling to have any senate at all; for you must either have a king, which
                        all abominate, or a senate, which is the only course compatible with a free
                        state. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Accordingly you must effect two
                        objects at the same time; you must remove the old senate and elect a new
                        one. I will order the senators to be summoned one by one, and I shall put it
                        to you to decide whether they deserve to live or die: <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> whatever you may determine respecting each shall be
                        done; but before you execute your sentence on the culprit, you shall <pb
                            n="838" xml:id="p.838"/> elect some brave and strenuous man as a fresh
                        senator to supply his place. </quote>
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Upon this he took his seat, and, the names
                    having been thrown together into an urn, he ordered that the name which had the
                    lot to fall out first should be proclaimed, and the person brought forward out
                    of the senate-house. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> When the name was heard,
                    each man strenuously exclaimed that he was a wicked and unprincipled fellow, and
                    deserved to be punished. Pacuvius then said, <quote> I perceive the sentence
                        which has been passed on this man; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> now
                        choose a good and upright senator in the room of this wicked and
                        unprincipled one. </quote>
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> At first all was silence, from the want of a
                    better man whom they might substitute; afterwards, one of them, laying aside his
                    modesty, nominating some one, in an instant a much greater clamour arose;
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> while some denied all knowledge of him,
                    others objected to him at one time on account of flagitious conduct, at another
                    time on account of his humble birth, his sordid circumstances, and the
                    disgraceful nature of his trade and occupation. <milestone n="12" unit="section"
                    /> The same occurred with increased vehemence with respect to the second and
                    third senators, so that it was evident that they were dissatisfied with the
                    senator himself, but had not any one to substitute for him; <milestone n="13"
                        unit="section"/> for it was of no use that the same persons should be
                    nominated again, to no other purpose than to hear of their vices, and the rest
                    were much more mean and obscure than those who first occurred to their
                    recollection. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Thus the assembly separated,
                    affirming that every evil which was most known was easiest to be endured, and
                    ordering the senate to be discharged from custody. </p>
                <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Pacuvius, having thus rendered the senators
                    more subservient to himself than to the commons by the gift of their lives,
                    ruled without the aid of arms, all persons now acquiescing. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> Henceforward the senators, forgetful of their rank and
                    independence, flattered the commons; saluted them courteously; invited them
                    graciously; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> entertained them with sumptuous
                    feasts; undertook those causes, always espoused that party, decided as judges in

                    On receiving this intelligence Marcellus, having bestowed the highest <pb

                    and the other multitude appointed to guard the baggage, joined in the shout, so
                    that they suddenly exhibited the appearance of a vast army to the Carthaginians,
                    who despised chiefly their paucity of numbers. <milestone n="15" unit="section"

                    declared, that two thousand eight hundred of the enemy were slain, and that the
                    Romans lost not more than five hundred. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    Whether the <pb n="855" xml:id="p.855"/> victory was so great or not, it is
                    certain that a very important advantage, and perhaps the greatest during the
                    war, was gained on that day; for not to be vanquished by Hannibal was then a
                    more difficult task to the victorious troops, than to conquer him afterwards. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When Hannibal, all hope of getting possession
                    of Nola being lost, had retired to Acerrae, Marcellus, having closed the gates
                    and posted guards in different quarters to prevent any one from going out,
                    immediately instituted a judicial inquiry in the forum, into the conduct of
                    those who had been secretly in communication with the enemy. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> He beheaded more than seventy who were convicted of
                    treason, and ordered their goods to be confiscated to the Roman state;
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and then committing the government to the
                    senate, set out with all his forces, and, pitching a camp, took up a position
                    above Suessula. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The Carthaginian, having at
                    first endeavoured to win over the people of Acerrae to a voluntary surrender,
                    but finding them resolved, makes preparations for a siege and assault. But the
                    people of Acerrae had more spirit than power. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Despairing, therefore, of the defence of the city, when they saw their walls
                    being circumvallated, before the lines of the enemy were completed, they stole
                    off in the dead of night through the opening in the works, and where the watches
                    had been neglected; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> and pursuing their course
                    through roads and pathless regions, accordingly as design or mistake directed
                    each, made their escape to those towns of Campania which they knew had not
                    renounced their fidelity. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> After Acerrae was
                    plundered and burnt, Hannibal, having received intelligence that the Roman
                    dictator with the new-raised legions was seen at some distance from Casilinum,
                    and fearing lest, the camp of the enemy being so near, something might occur at
                    Capua, marched his army to Casilinum. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> At that
                    time Casilinum was occupied by five hundred Praenestines, with a few Romans and
                    Latins, whom the news of the defeat at Cannae had brought to the same place.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> These men setting out from home too late,
                    in consequence of the levy at Praeneste not being completed at the appointed
                    day, and arriving at Casilinum before the defeat was known there, where they
                    united themselves with other troops, Romans and allies, were proceeding thence
                    in a tolerably large body, but the news of the battle at Cannae turned them back
                    to Casilinum. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Having spent several days <pb
                        n="856" xml:id="p.856"/> there in evading and concerting plots, in fear
                    themselves and suspected by the Campanians, and having now received certain
                    information that the revolt of Capua and the reception of Hannibal were in
                    agitation, they put the townsmen to the sword by night, and seized upon the part
                    of the town on this side the Vulturnus, for it is divided by that river.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Such was the garrison the Romans had at
                    Casilinum; to these was added a cohort of Perusians, in number four hundred and
                    sixty, who had been driven to Casilinum by the same intelligence which had
                    brought the Praenestines a few days before. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    They formed a sufficient number of armed men for the defence of walls of so
                    limited extent, and protected on one side by the river. The scarcity of corn
                    made them even appear too numerous. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Hannibal having now advanced within a short
                    distance of the place, sent forward a body of Getulians under a commander named
                    Isalca, and orders them in the first place, if an opportunity of parley should
                    be given, to win them over by fair words, to open the gates, and admit a
                    garrison; but, if they persisted in obstinate opposition, to proceed to action,
                    and try if in any part he could force an entrance into the city. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> When they had approached the walls, because silence
                    prevailed there appeared a solitude; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and the
                    barbarian, supposing that they had retired through fear, made preparation for
                    forcing the gates and breaking away the bars, when, the gates being suddenly
                    thrown open, two cohorts, drawn up within for that very purpose, rushed forth
                    with great tumult, and made a slaughter of the enemy. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> The first party being thus repulsed, Maharbal was sent with
                    a more powerful body of troops; but neither could even he sustain the sally of
                    the cohorts. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Lastly, Hannibal, fixing his camp
                    directly before the walls, prepared to assault this paltry city and garrison,
                    with every effort and all his forces, and having completely surrounded the city
                    with a line of troops, lost a considerable number of men, including all the most
                    forward, who were shot from the walls and turrets, while he pressed on and
                    provoked the enemy. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Once he was very near
                    cutting them off, by throwing in a line of elephants, when aggressively sallying
                    forth, and drove them in the utmost confusion into the town; a good many, out of
                    so small a number, having been slain. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> More
                    would have fallen had not night interrupted the battle. <pb n="857"
                        xml:id="p.857"/> On the following day, the minds of all were possessed with
                    an ardent desire to commence the assault, especially after a golden mural crown
                    had been promised, and the general himself had reproached the conquerors of
                    Saguntum with the slowness of their siege of a little fort situated on level
                    ground; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> reminding them, each and all, of
                    Cannae, Trasimenus, and Trebia. They then began to apply the vineae and to
                    spring mines: nor was any measure, whether of open force or stratagem,
                    unemployed against the various attempts of the enemy. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> These allies of the Romans erected bulwarks against the
                    vineae, cut off the mines of the enemy by cross-mines, and met their efforts
                    both covertly and openly, till, at last, shame compelled Hannibal to desist from
                    his undertaking; and, fortifying a camp in which he placed a small guard, that
                    the affair might not appear to have been abandoned, he retired into winter
                    quarters to Capua. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> There he kept, under
                    cover, for the greater part of the winter, that army, which, though fortified by
                    frequent and continued hardships against every human ill, had yet never
                    experienced or been habituated to prosperity. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly, excess of good fortune and unrestrained indulgence were the ruin of
                    men whom no severity of distress had subdued; and so much the more completely,
                    in proportion to the avidity with which they plunged into pleasures to which
                    they were unaccustomed. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> For sleep, wine,
                    feasting, women, baths, and ease, which custom rendered more seductive day by
                    day, so completely unnerved both mind and body, that from henceforth their past
                    victories rather than their present strength protected them; and in this the
                    general is considered by those who are skilled in the art of war to have
                    committed a greater error than in not having marched his troops to Rome
                    forthwith from the field of Cannae: <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> for his
                    delay on that occasion might be considered as only to have postponed his
                    victory, but this mistake to have bereaved him of the power of conquering.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Accordingly, by Hercules, as though he
                    marched out of Capua with another army, it retained in no respect any of its
                    former discipline; <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> for most of the troops
                    returned in the embrace of harlots; and as soon as they began to live under
                    tents, and the fatigue of marching and other military labours tried them, like
                    raw troops, they failed both in bodily strength and spirit. <milestone n="16"
                        unit="section"/> From that time, during the whole period of the summer
                    campaign, a great number of them slunk away from <pb n="858" xml:id="p.858"/>
                    the standards without furloughs, while Capua was the only retreat of the

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> However, when the rigour of winter began to
                    abate, marching his troops out of their winter quarters he returned to
                    Casilinum; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> where, although there had been an
                    intermission of the assault, the continuance of the siege had reduced the

                        unit="section"/> Titus Sempronius commanded the Roman camp, the dictator
                    having gone to Rome to renew the auspices. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The
                    swollen state of the Vulturnus and the entreaties of the people of Nola and
                    Acerrae, who feared the Campanians if the Roman troops should leave them, kept
                    Marcellus in his place; although desirous himself also to bring assistance to
                    the besieged. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Gracchus, only maintaining his
                    post near Casilinum, because he had been enjoined by the dictator not to take
                    any active steps during his absence, did not stir; although intelligence was
                    brought from Casilinum which might easily overcome every degree of patience.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For it appeared that some had precipitated
                    themselves from the walls through famine, and that they were standing unarmed
                    upon the walls, exposing their undefended bodies to the blows of the missile
                    weapons. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Gracchus, grieved at the
                    intelligence, but not daring to fight contrary to the injunctions of the
                    dictator, and yet aware that he must fight if he openly attempted to convey in
                    provisions, and having no hope of introducing them clandestinely, collected corn
                    from all parts of the surrounding country, and filling several casks sent a
                    message to the magistrate to Casilinum, directing that they might catch the
                    casks which the river would bring down. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                    following night, while all were intent upon the river, and the hopes excited by
                    the message from the Romans, the casks sent came floating down the centre of the
                    stream, and the corn was equally distributed among them all. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> This was repeated the second and third day; <milestone

                        n="11" unit="section"/> But afterwards, the river, rendered more than
                    ordinarily rapid by continual rains, drove the casks by a cross current to the
                    bank which the enemy were guarding; there they were discovered sticking among
                    the osiers which grew along the banks; and, it being reported to Hannibal, from
                    that time the watches were kept more strictly, that nothing <pb n="859"
                        xml:id="p.859"/> sent to the city by the Vulturnus might escape notice.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> However, nuts poured out at the Roman
                    camp floated down the centre of the river to Casilinum, and were caught with
                    hurdles. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> At length they were reduced to such
                    a degree of want, that they endeavoured to chew the thongs and skins which they
                    tore from their shields, after softening them in warm water; nor did they
                    abstain from mice or any other kind of animals. <milestone n="14" unit="section"
                    /> They even dug up every kind of herb and root from the lowest mounds of their
                    wall; and when the enemy had ploughed over all the ground producing herbage
                    which was without the wall, they threw in turnip seed, so that Hannibal
                    exclaimed, Must I sit here at Casilinum even till these spring up? <milestone
                        n="15" unit="section"/> and he, who up to that time had not lent an ear to
                    any terms, then at length allowed himself to be treated with respecting the
                    ransom of the free persons. Seven ounces of gold for each person were agreed
                    upon as the price; and then, under a promise of protection, they surrendered
                    themselves. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> They were kept in chains till the
                    whole of the gold was paid, after which they were sent back to Cumae, in
                    fulfilment of the promise. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> This account is
                    more credible than that they were slain by a body of cavalry, which was sent to
                    attack them as they were going away. They were for the most part Prae- nestines.
                    Out of the five hundred and seventy who formed the garrison, almost one half
                    were destroyed by sword or famine; the rest returned safe to Praeneste with
                    their praetor Manicius, who had formerly been a scribe. <milestone n="18"

                    of mail, with a gown on, and with the head covered, formed an evidence of this

                    of Hannibal, lest on the departure of the Carthaginian from it, the Romans
                    should assault it. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> To the Praenestine soldiers
                    the Roman senate voted double pay and exemption from military service for five
                    years. On being offered the freedom of the state, in consideration of their

                    but also by the rest of the Bruttian states, on account of their having adopted
                    a separate policy. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Petelini, unable to
                    bear up against these distresses, sent ambassadors to Rome to solicit aid, whose
                    prayers and entreaties (for on being told that they must themselves take
                    measures for their own safety, they gave themselves up to piteous lamentations
                    in the vestibule of the senate-house) excited the deepest commiseration in the

                    they had no longer any protection for their distant allies, and bid them return

                    of fortune. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> On the result of this embassy
                    being reported to the Petelini, their senate was suddenly seized with such
                    violent grief and dismay, that some advised that they should run away wherever
                    each man could find an asylum, and abandon the city. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Some advised, that as they were deserted by their ancient
                    allies, they should unite themselves with the rest of the Bruttian states, and
                    through them surrender themselves to Hannibal. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    The opinion however which prevailed was that of those who thought that nothing
                    should be done in haste and rashly, and that they should take the whole matter
                    into their consideration again. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The next day,
                    when they had cooled upon it, and their trepidation had somewhat subsided, the
                    principal men carried their point that they should collect all their property

                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Nearly the same intelligence respecting corn
                    and pay was conveyed in a letter from Aulus Cornelius Mammula, the propraetor,
                    from Sardinia. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The answer to both was, that
                    there were no resources from whence they could be supplied, and orders were
                    given to them that they should themselves provide for their fleets and armies.
                    Titus Otacilius having sent ambassadors to Hiero, the only source of assistance
                    the Romans had, received as much money as was wanting to pay the troops and a

                    the allied states contributed liberally to Cornelius. The scarcity of money at
                    Rome also was so great, that on the proposal of Marcus Minucius, plebeian
                    tribune, a financial triumvirate was appointed, consisting of Lucius Aemilius

                    if the Roman fathers thought proper, who might be chosen into the senate to

                        in profound and inviolable silence, surely that above all others was one
                        which deserved to be covered and consigned to darkness and oblivion, and

                    his army was destroyed in Gaul. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He was to
                    march his troops through a vast wood, which the Gauls called Litana. On the
                    right and left of his route, the natives had sawed the trees in such a manner
                    that they continued standing upright, but would fall when impelled by a slight
                    force. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Posthumius had with him two Roman
                    legions, and besides had levied so great a number of allies along the Adriatic
                    Sea, that he led into the enemy's country twenty-five thousand men. <milestone
                        n="9" unit="section"/> As soon as this army entered the wood, the Gauls, who
                    were posted around its extreme skirts, pushed down the outermost of the sawn

                    arms, killed the rest, panic-struck by so unexpected a disaster. A very small
                    number, who attempted to escape by a bridge, were taken prisoners, being
                    intercepted by the enemy who had taken possession of it before them. <milestone

                    with chased gold, used it as a cup for libations in their solemn festivals, and
                    a drinking cup for their high priests and other ministers of the temple.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The spoils taken by the Gauls were not
                    less than the victory. For though great numbers of the beasts were crushed by
                    the falling trees, yet as nothing was scattered by flight, every thing else was

                    Then Titus Sempronius, having assembled the senate, consoled and encouraged the

                    consular armies sufficient to support so important a war. For this reason,

                    Italy, the war in Spain was prosecuted with no less vigour; but hitherto more
                    favourably to the Romans. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The two generals had
                    divided their troops, so that Cneius acted by land, and Publius by sea.
                    Hasdrubal, general of the Carthaginians, sufficiently trusting to neither branch
                    of his forces, kept himself at a distance from the enemy, secured by the
                    intervening space and the strength of his fortifications, until, after much
                    solicitation, four thousand foot and five hundred horse were sent him out of
                    Africa as a reinforcement. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At length, inspired
                    with fresh hopes, he moved nearer the enemy; and himself also ordered a fleet to
                    be equipped and prepared for the protection of the islands and sea-coasts.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In the very onset of renewing the war, he
                    was greatly embarrassed by the desertion of the captains of his ships, who had
                    ceased to entertain a sincere attachment towards the general and the
                    Carthaginian cause, ever since they were severely reprimanded for abandoning the
                    fleet in a cowardly manner at the Iberus. These deserters had raised an
                    insurrection among the Tartessians, and at their instigation some cities had
                    revolted; they had even taken one by force. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    The war was now turned from the Romans into that country, which he entered in a
                    hostile. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> manner, and resolved to attack
                    Galbus, a distinguished general of the Tartessians, who with a powerful army
                    kept close within his camp, before the walls of a city which had been captured
                    but a few days before. Accordingly, he sent his light-armed troops in advance to
                    provoke the enemy to battle, and part of his infantry to ravage the country
                    throughout in every direction, and to cut off stragglers. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> There was a skirmish before the camp, at the same time that
                    many were killed and put to flight in the fields. <milestone n="8"

                    courage not only to defend their lines, but challenge the enemy to fight. They
                    sallied out, therefore, in a body from the camp, dancing according to their
                    custom. Their sudden boldness terrified the enemy, who a little before had been
                    the assailants. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Hasdrubal therefore drew off
                    his troops to a tolerably steep eminence, and secured further by having a river
                    between it and the enemy. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Here the parties of
                    light-armed troops which had been sent in advance, and the horse which had been
                    dispersed about, he called in to join him. But not thinking himself sufficiently
                    secured by the eminence or the river, he fortified his camp completely with a
                    rampart. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> While thus fearing and feared
                    alternately, several skirmishes occurred, in which the Numidian cavalry were not
                    so good as the Spanish, nor the Moorish darters so good as the Spanish
                    targetteers, who equalled them in swiftness, but were superior to them in

                    difficulty, stormed Asena, whither Hasdrubal, on entering their territories, had
                    laid up his corn and other stores. By this they became masters of all the
                    surrounding country. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But now they became quite
                    ungovernable, both when on march and within their camp. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Hasdrubal, therefore, perceiving their
                    negligence, which, as usual, was the consequence of success, after having
                    exhorted his troops to attack them while they were straggling and without their
                    standards, came down the hill, and advanced to their camp in order of battle.

                    tumultuous manner, by men who fled from the watch-posts and advanced guards,
                    they shouted to arms; and as each could get his arms, they rushed precipitately
                    to battle, without waiting for the word, without standards, without order, and
                    without ranks. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The foremost of them were
                    already engaged, while some were running up in parties, and others had not got

                    boldness of their attack terrified the enemy. But when they charged their close
                    ranks with their own which were thin, and were not able to defend themselves for
                    want of numbers, each began to look out for others to support him; <milestone

                    themselves in form of <pb n="868" xml:id="p.868"/> a circle, where being so
                    closely crowded together, body to body, armour to armour, that they had not room
                    to wield their arms, they were surrounded by the enemy, who continued to
                    slaughter them till late in the day. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A small
                    number, having forced a passage, made for the woods and hills. With like
                    consternation, their camp was abandoned, and next day the whole nation
                    submitted. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But they did not continue long
                    quiet, for immediately upon this, Hasdrubal received orders from Carthage to
                    march into Italy with all expedition. The report of which, spreading over Spain,
                    made almost all the states declare for the Romans. Accordingly he wrote
                    immediately to Carthage, to inform them how much mischief the report of his
                    march had produced. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>

                        besides that he had neither an army nor a general whom he could leave to
                        supply his place, so great were the abilities of the Roman generals who
                        commanded there, that they could scarcely be opposed with equal forces.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> If, therefore, they had any concern
                        for preserving Spain, they ought to send a general with a powerful army to

                    impression on the senate, yet, as their interest in Italy was first and most
                    important, they did not at all alter their resolution in relation to Hasdrubal
                    and his troops. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> However, they despatched
                    Himilco with a complete army, and an augmented fleet, to preserve and defend
                    Spain both by sea and land. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When he had
                    conveyed over his land and naval forces, he fortified a camp; and having drawn
                    his ships upon dry land, and surrounded them with a rampart, he marched with a
                    chosen body of cavalry, with all possible expedition; using the same caution
                    when passing through people who were wavering, and those who were actually
                    enemies; and came up with Hasdrubal. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As soon
                    as he had informed him of the resolutions and orders of the senate, and in his
                    turn been thoroughly instructed in what manner to prosecute the war in Spain, he
                    returned to his camp; his expedition more than any thing else saving him, for he
                    quitted every place before the people could conspire. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Before Hasdrubal quitted his position he laid all the
                    states in subjection to him under contribution. He knew <pb n="869"
                        xml:id="p.869"/> well, that Hannibal purchased a passage through some
                    nations; that he had no Gallic auxiliaries but such as were hired; <milestone

                    without money, he would scarcely have penetrated so far as the Alps. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> For this reason, having exacted the contributions
                    with great haste, he marched down to the Iberus. As soon as the Roman generals
                    got notice of the Carthaginian senate's resolution, and Hasdrubal's march, they
                    gave up every other concern, and uniting their forces, determined to meet him
                    and oppose his attempt. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They reflected, that
                    when it was already so difficult to make head against Hannibal alone in Italy,
                    there would be an end of the Roman empire in Spain, should Hasdrubal join him
                    with a Spanish army. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Full of anxiety and care
                    on these accounts, they assembled their forces at the Iberus, and crossed the
                    river; and after deliberating for some time whether they should encamp opposite
                    to the enemy, or be satisfied with impeding his intended march by attacking the
                    allies of <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> the Carthaginians, they made
                    preparations for besieging a city called Ibera, from its contiguity to the
                    river, which was at that time the wealthiest in that quarter. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> When Hasdrubal perceived this, instead of carrying
                    assistance to his allies, he proceeded himself to besiege a city which had
                    lately placed itself under the protection of the Romans; <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> and thus the siege which was now commenced was given up by

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> For a few days they remained encamped at a
                    distance of five miles from each other, not without skirmishes, but without
                    going out to a regular engagement. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> At length
                    the signal for battle was given out on both sides on one and the same day, as
                    though by concert, and they marched down into the plain with all their forces.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The Roman army stood in triple line; a
                    part of the light troops were stationed among the first line, the other half
                    were received behind the standards, the cavalry covering the wings. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> Hasdrubal formed his centre strong with Spaniards,
                    and placed the Carthaginians in the right wing, the Africans and hired
                    auxiliaries in the left. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> His cavalry he placed
                    before the wings, attaching the Numidians to the Carthaginian infantry, and the
                    rest to the Africans. Nor were all the Numidians placed in the right wing, but

                    the hottest, from a tired horse upon a fresh one, after the manner of vaulters:
                    such was their own agility, and so docile their breed of horses. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> While they stood thus drawn up, the hopes entertained
                    by the generals on both sides were pretty much upon an equality; for neither
                    possessed any great superiority, either in point of the number or quality of the
                    troops. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The feelings of the soldiers were
                    widely different. Their generals had, without difficulty, induced the Romans to
                    believe, that although they fought at a distance from their country, it was
                    Italy and the city of Rome that they were defending. Accordingly, they had
                    brought their minds to a settled resolution to conquer or die; as if their
                    return to their country had hinged upon the issue of that battle. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> The other army consisted of less determined men; for
                    they were principally Spaniards, who would rather be vanquished in Spain, than
                    be victorious to be dragged into Italy. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> On the
                    first onset, therefore, ere their javelins had scarcely been thrown, their
                    centre gave ground, and the Romans pressing on with great impetuosity, turned
                    their backs. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> In the wings the battle
                    proceeded with no less activity; on one side the Carthaginians, on the other the
                    Africans, charged vigorously, while the Romans, in a manner surrounded, were
                    exposed to a two-fold attack. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> But when the
                    whole of the Roman troops had united in the centre, they possessed sufficient
                    strength to compel the wings of the enemy to retire in different directions;
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> and thus there were two separate battles,
                    in both of which the Romans were decidedly superior, as after the defeat of the
                    enemy's centre they had the advantage both in the number and strength of their
                    troops. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Vast numbers were slain on this
                    occasion; and had not the Spaniards fled precipitately from the field ere the
                    battle had scarce begun, very few out of the whole army would have survived.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> There was very little fighting of the
                    cavalry, for as soon as the Moors and Numidians perceived that the centre gave
                    way, they fled immediately with the utmost precipitation, leaving the wings
                    uncovered, and also driving the elephants before them. <milestone n="15"
                        unit="section"/> Hasdrubal, after waiting the issue of the battle to the
                    very last, fled from the midst of the carnage with a few attendants. The Romans
                    took and plundered the camp. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> This victory
                    united with the Romans whatever states of Spain were wavering, and left
                    Hasdrubal <pb n="871" xml:id="p.871"/> no hope, not only of leading an army over

                    letters from the Scipios, the greatest joy was felt, not so much for the

                    This victory cost the Carthaginians much blood and many wounds, nor did any

                    he would have proceeded to Carale, had not Manlius, meeting him with his army,

                    Carthaginians caused the battle to continue long doubtful, for the Sardinians
                    were accustomed to yield easily; but at last, when the Sardinians fell and fled

                    the Sardinian generals render that battle distinguished by their disasters; for

                    reflecting in reproachful terms on the cowardice of the enemy, returned in

                    equestrian contest, some histories add a circumstance which is certainly
                    astonishing; how true it is, is an open matter of opinion: that Claudius, when
                    in pursuit of Taurea, who fled back to the city, rode in at one of the gates of
                    the enemy which stood open and made his escape unhurt through another, the enemy
                    being thunderstruck at the strangeness of the circumstance. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The camps were then undisturbed; the consul
                    even moved his camp back, that the Campanians might complete their sowing; nor
                    did he do any injury to the lands till the blades in the corn-fields were grown
                    sufficiently high to be useful for forage. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    This he conveyed into the Claudian camp above Suessula, and there erected winter
                    quarters. He ordered Marcus Claudius, the proconsul, to retain at Nola a
                    sufficient force for the protection of the place, and send the rest to Rome,
                    that they might not be a burthen to their allies nor an expense to the republic.

                    legions from Cumae to Luceria in Apulia, sent Marcus Valerius, the praetor,
                    thence to Brundusium with the troops which he had commanded at Luceria, with
                    orders to protect the coast of the Sallentine territory, and make provisions
                    with regard to Philip and the Macedonian war. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    At the close of the summer, the events of which I have described, letters
                    arrived from Publius and Cneius Scipio, stating the magnitude and success of
                    their operations in Spain, but that the army was in want of money, clothing, and
                    corn, and that their crews were in want of every thing. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> With regard to the pay, they said, that if the treasury was
                    low, they would adopt some plan by which they might procure it from the
                    Spaniards; but that the other supplies must certainly be sent from Rome, for
                    otherwise neither the army could be kept together nor the province preserved.
                    When the letters were read, all to a man admitted that the statement was
                    correct, and the request reasonable; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> but it
                    occurred to their minds, what great forces they were maintaining by land and
                    sea, and how large a fleet must soon be equipped if a war with Macedon should
                    break out; that Sicily and Sardinia, which before the war had yielded a revenue,
                    were scarcely able to maintain the troops which protected those provinces;
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> that the expenses were supplied by a tax;
                    that both the number of the persons who contributed this tax was diminished by
                    the great havoc made <pb n="894" xml:id="p.894"/> in their armies at the
                    Trasimenus and Cannae, and the few who survived, if they were oppressed with
                    multiplied impositions, would perish by a calamity of a different kind.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> That, therefore, if the republic could not
                    subsist by credit, it could not stand by its own resources. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> It was resolved, therefore, that Fulvius, the praetor,
                    should present himself to the public assembly of the people, point out
                        <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> the necessities of the state, and
                    exhort those persons who had increased their patrimonies by farming the public
                    revenues, to furnish temporary loans for the service <milestone n="11??"
                        unit="section"/> of that state, from which they had derived their wealth,
                    and contract to supply what was necessary for the army in Spain, on the
                    condition of being paid the first when there was money in the treasury.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> These things the praetor laid before the
                    assembly, and fixed a day on which he would let on contract the furnishing the
                    army in Spain with clothes and corn, and with such other things as were
                    necessary for the crews. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When the day arrived, three companies, of
                    nineteen persons, came forward to enter into the contract; but they made two
                    requests: <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> one was, that they should be exempt
                    from military service while employed in that revenue business; the second was,
                    that the state should bear all losses of the goods they shipped, which might
                    arise either from the attacks of the enemy or from storms. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Having obtained both their requests, they entered into the
                    contract, and the affairs of the state were conducted by private funds. This
                    character and love of country uniformly pervaded all ranks. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> As all the engagements were entered into with magnanimity,
                    so were they fulfilled with the strictest fidelity; and the supplies were
                    furnished in the same manner as formerly, from an abundant treasury. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> At the time when these supplies arrived, the town of
                    Illiturgi was being besieged by Hasdrubal, Mago, and Hamilcar the son of
                    Bomilcar, on account of its having gone over to the Romans. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Between these three camps of the enemy, the Scipios
                    effected an entrance into the town of their allies, after a violent contest and
                    great slaughter of their opponents, and introduced some corn, of which there was
                    a scarcity; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> and after exhorting the townsmen
                    to defend their walls with the same spirit which they had seen displayed by the
                    Roman army fighting in their behalf, led on their troops to attack the largest
                    of the camps, in which Hasdrubal had <pb n="895" xml:id="p.895"/> the command.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> To this camp the two other generals of the
                    Carthaginians with their armies came, seeing that the great business was to be
                    done there. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They therefore sallied from the
                    camp and fought. Of the enemy engaged there were sixty thousand; of the Romans
                    about sixteen; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> the victory, however, was so
                    decisive, that the Romans slew more than their own number of the <milestone
                        n="11??" unit="section"/> enemy, and captured more than three thousand, with
                    nearly a thousand horses and fifty-nine military standards, five elephants
                    having been slain in the battle. They made themselves masters of the three camps
                    on that day. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The siege of Illiturgi having
                    been raised, the Carthaginian armies were led away to the siege of Intibili; the
                    forces having been recruited out of that province, which was, above all others,
                    fond of war, provided there was any plunder or pay to be obtained, and at that
                    time had an abundance of young men. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> A second
                    regular engagement took place, attended with the same fortune to both parties;
                    in which above three thousand of the enemy were slain, more than two thousand
                    captured, together with forty-two standards and nine elephants. <milestone
                        n="14" unit="section"/> Then, indeed, almost all the people of Spain came
                    over to the Romans, and the achievements in Spain during that summer were much
                    more important than those in Italy. </p>
