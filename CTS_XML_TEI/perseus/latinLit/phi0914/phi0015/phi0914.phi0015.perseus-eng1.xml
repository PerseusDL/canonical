                    Veientes were at war, and their rage and animosity were such that the end was
                    clearly at hand for those that should be vanquished. Each people held an
                    election very different from that of the other. <milestone n="2" unit="section"
                    /> The Romans enlarged the number of their military tribunes with consular
                    authority, and elected eight, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Livy
                        seems to have erred through including the names of the censors, Camillus and

                        See chap. x. § 1 and chap. xiv. § 5 and notes there. </note> a greater
                    number than ever before, to wit, Manius Aemilius Mamercus (for the second time),
                    Lucius Valerius Potitus (for the third), Appius Claudius Crassus, Marcus
                    Quinctilius Varus, Lucius Julius lulus, Marcus Postumius, Marcus Furius
                    Camillus, Marcus Postumius Albinus. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But the
                    Veientes, weary of annual canvassing, which was sometimes the cause of brawls,
                    chose a king. This gave offence to the feelings of the Etruscan peoples, who
                    loathed not more the institution of kings than the King himself. <milestone

                    reason of his wealth and arrogance, since he had violently broken up a solemn

                    of a political rebuff; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> and because the
                    suffrages of the Twelve Peoples had returned another man as priest in preference
                    to him, he had suddenly carried off the actors, most of whom were his own
                    slaves, in the middle of the games. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> And so the
                    nation which was devoted beyond all others to religious rites (and all the more
                    because it excelled in the art of observing them) voted to refuse its help to
                    the men of Veil, so long as they should obey a king. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> This vote the Veientes would not suffer to be mentioned, in
                    their fear of the King, who had a way of treating the man by whom any such
                    saying was reported as a leader in sedition, not as the bearer of an idle tale.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Although the Romans got word that things
                    were quiet in Etruria, still, because they <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/>
                    heard that this question came up at all their meetings, they so constructed
                    their works as to have a double fortification, one facing Veii, to oppose the
                    sallies of the townsfolk, the other confronting Etruria, to shut off any
                    assistance that might come from thence. </p>

                    <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> As the Roman generals hoped more from a siege
                    than from an assault, they even began the erection of winter quarters —a new
                    thing to the Roman soldier —and planned to carry the campaign on, straight
                    through the winter. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When news of this came to
                    Rome, to the plebeian tribunes, who had now for a long time been unable to
                        <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> hit upon any pretext for agitation, they
                    hurried before the assembly and set to work upon the passions of the commons: So
                    this was the reason that the soldiers had been granted pay! <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> They had not been mistaken in thinking that this gift of
                    their opponents would be smeared with poison. The liberty of the <pb n="p.7"/>
                    commons had been sold; the young men, having <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="marg">B.C. 403</note> been permanently removed and
                    banished from the City and from the state, were no longer free, even in winter
                    and the stormy season, to see to their homes and their affairs. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> What, they asked, did their hearers suppose to be the
                    reason for making the service continuous? They would assuredly find no other
                    motive than this: <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> lest, through the presence
                    in large numbers of the young men in whom lay all the vigour of the commons,
                    something might be accomplished for the people's good. Moreover, they were far
                    more ruthlessly abused and trodden down than <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/>
                    were the Veientes, who, for their part, spent the winter in their houses,
                    safeguarding their city by means of strong walls and natural defences, whilst
                    the Roman soldiers were enduring toil and danger, overwhelmed with snows and
                    frosts, in tents, not even laying aside their weapons in the winter time, a
                    season of respite from all wars both by land and by sea. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Such slavery as this neither kings, nor the proud consuls
                    who came before the establishment of the tribunician power, nor the stern
                    authority of a dictator, nor harsh decemvirs, had laid upon them, — that they
                    should wage perennial war. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Pray what would
                    those men do if they should become consuls or dictators, who had made the
                    semblance of consular authority so savage and truculent? But the commons were
                    only getting their deserts. There had been no room even amongst eight military
                    tribunes for a single plebeian. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Heretofore
                    the patricians had been wont with the utmost exertion to fill three places in a
                    year: now they were advancing eight abreast to make good their authority, and
                    there was never a commoner hanging on to the crowd, were it <pb n="p.9"/> only
                    to remind his colleagues that their soldiers were <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="marg">B c. 403</note> not slaves but freemen and
                    fellow citizens; <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> whom, at least in winter,
                    they were bound to bring back to the shelter of their houses, and to leave them
                    some portion of the year to <milestone n="12??" unit="section"/> look after
                    their parents, their children, and their wives, and to use their liberty and
                    elect magistrates. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> As they shouted forth these and suchlike
                    arguments, they found an opponent not unequal to them in Appius Claudius, whom
                    his colleagues had left behind to repress sedition on the part of the tribunes.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> He was a man experienced from his youth
                    up in contentions with the plebs, and I have related how, some years before, he
                    had advised that the intervention of their colleagues be used to break the power
                    of the tribunes. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> See Book IV, chap.
                        xlviii. The Appius Claudius here mentioned was a grandson of the decemvir.

                    <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The man not only had a nimble wit but was
                    already a practised orator, and he delivered on this occasion a speech to the
                    following effect: <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> "If it has ever been a
                    question, Quirites, whether it was for your sake or their own that the tribunes
                    of the commons have always encouraged sedition, I am certain that the doubt has
                    this year been resolved; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and not only do I
                    rejoice that you have at length cleared up a long misunderstanding, but I
                    congratulate both you, - and on your account the state as well, that it has:
                    happened at a time, of all others, when your affairs are prospering. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> Or is there anyone who doubts that no wrongs which
                    you have suffered, if haply such there have sometimes been, have ever so
                    offended and stirred up the plebeian tribunes as has the boon which the Fathers
                    bestowed upon the commons, when they granted pay for military service?
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> What else do you believe they <pb n="p.11"
                    /> were afraid of then, or are seeking now to shatter, <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="marg">B. C. 403</note> but the harmony of the
                    orders, which they regard as very apt to overthrow the tribunician authority?
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Indeed they are like quack-salvers seeking
                    employment, since they desire that there should always be some disease in the
                    body politic, that there may be something which you may call them in to cure.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Pray, are you tribunes defending the
                    commons, or attacking them? Are you adversaries of the soldiers, or their
                    advocates? <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Or perhaps this is your plea:
                    'Whatever the Fathers do displeases us, be it in behalf of the commons or
                    against them'; and just as masters forbid outsiders to have aught to do with
                    their slaves, and think it right that they should abstain alike from benefiting
                    and from harming them, so you deny the Fathers intercourse with the commons,
                    lest we by our friendliness and liberality encourage them, or they become
                    dutiful and obedient to us. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> How much more, if
                    you had in you the slightest —I say not patriotism, but —humanity, ought you
                    rather to have favoured, and, so far as in you lay, to have encouraged the
                    kindly spirit of the Fathers and the complaisance of the plebs? <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/> And if this harmony should last, who would not make
                    bold to warrant that our empire would soon be the greatest among the
                    neighbouring peoples? </p>

                    <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> "I shall presently explain, in regard to this
                    plan of my colleagues, who have not been willing to withdraw the army from Veii
                    with its task unaccomplished, —how not merely profitable but even necessary it
                    was. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But first I wish to speak about the
                    actual condition of the soldiers; and I think that if I should express my
                    meaning not in your presence only but also in the camp, the army itself <pb
                        n="p.13"/> would judge it reasonable. Indeed, though I were <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="marg">B.C. 403</note> unable to
                    think of anything to urge myself, I could be quite content with the speeches of
                    my opponents. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They were lately insisting that
                    pay ought not to be given to the men, because it never had been given. How then
                    can they object, if to those who have gained some new advantage be allotted new
                    labour also, in proportion. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Nowhere, as a
                    rule, is service given without recompense, nor recompense except for service;
                    toil and pleasure, most unlike in nature, have been linked together in a sort of
                    natural bond. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Formerly the soldier was vexed
                    that he must serve the state at his own cost; yet he was happy to be able, for a
                    half of the year, to till his own field and gain the means of keeping himself
                    and his family, whether he were at home or with the army. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Now he is happy that the state affords him gain, and is
                    glad to receive his pay. Let him therefore be resigned to remaining away a
                    little longer from his home and his property, which is now under no heavy
                    charges. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Why, if the commonwealth should call
                    him to a reckoning, would it not justly say, 'You have a year's stipend, render
                    a year's service; do you think it right that for a campaign of six months you
                    should receive the pay of twelve?' <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> I dislike
                    to dwell upon this point, Quirites; for it is thus that men who employ
                    mercenaries ought to argue; we would deal as though with fellow citizens, and we
                    think it only right that you deal with us as with your native country.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Either we ought not to have undertaken the
                    war, or we ought to conduct it as befits the Roman People, and end it as quickly

                    sutlers, with trafficking in the country-side and the towns near by. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> Nor were things any better at Veii, which was at that
                    time the nation's chief concern; for the Roman commanders showed more jealousy
                    of one another than spirit in dealing with the enemy, whose forces moreover were
                    enlarged by the unexpected accession of the Capenates and the Faliscans.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> These two Etruscan peoples, being nearest
                    in situation, believed that if the Veientes were conquered it would be their
                    turn next to face a Roman invasion. The Faliscans, besides, had incurred
                    hostility on their own account, because they had been mixed up before in the war
                    with Fidenae. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See IV. xvii. 11.</note>
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> So they exchanged embassies, bound themselves
                    by an oath, and their armies suddenly appeared before Veii. It happened that
                    they attacked the camp at that point where the tribune Manius Sergius was in
                    command, and great was the terror they inspired, since the Romans thought that
                    all Etruria had risen and was come with a mighty array against them. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> The same belief roused up the Veientes in the town.
                    Thus a two-fold attack was directed against the camp. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The soldiers rallied into groups, facing now this way and
                    now that, yet were unable either quite to confine the Veientes within the

                    help should come from the larger camp, so that the legions might face different
                    ways, some of them confronting the Capenates and Faliscans, and others the
                    sortie of the townsfolk. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But that camp was
                    under the command of Verginius, who was privately hated by Sergius and returned
                    his enmity. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This man, though word was brought
                    that many bastions had been stormed and the ramparts scaled, and that the enemy
                    were attacking on both sides, held his troops under arms, saying that if his
                    colleague needed help he would let him know. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    His pride found a match in the other's obstinacy, and Sergius, lest he should
                    seem to have required any aid of his rival, preferred defeat at the hands of the
                    enemy to victory gained through a fellow citizen. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> For a long time the Romans were slaughtered between the two

                    into the larger camp, while Sergius himself, with the chief part of his men,
                    kept on to Rome. It was there decided, on his throwing all the blame upon his
                    colleague, to summon Verginius from camp, and in the meanwhile put lieutenants
                    in command of it. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The affair was then debated
                    in the senate and the colleagues heaped abuse on one another. There were but few

                    both the levy and the payment of the war-tax occasioned difficulties, a quarrel

                    the number of the soldiers, the more money they required for pay. <milestone

                <p> Meantime alarms were multiplied at Veii, where three wars were rolled into one.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> For, precisely as before, the Capenates
                    and the Faliscans came suddenly to raise the siege, and the Romans fought about
                    their works against three armies, which attacked them on both sides. What helped
                    them most, was the recollection how Sergius and Verginius had been condemned.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> And so from the principal camp, where the
                    delay had occurred on the former occasion, troops were dispatched by a short
                    circuit and fell upon the Capenates in the rear, as they faced the rampart of
                    the Romans. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Beginning there, the battle
                    carried terror even among the Faliscans, who were wavering, when a timely sally
                    from the camp put them to flight. Then, as they retreated, the victors pursued
                    them with great slaughter; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> and not long after
                    a party that was raiding the territory of the Capenates happened to fall in with

                    barred out the hindmost of their own people. </p>

                    drew near for choosing military tribunes and the Fathers were almost more
                    concerned about the election than about the war, perceiving that the highest
                    authority had been not merely shared with the plebs, but well-nigh lost to
                    themselves. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They therefore arranged that their
                    most distinguished members should stand, —men whom they believed the electors
                    would be ashamed to pass over, —and at the same time they themselves, as if they
                    had all been candidates, left no stone unturned, and called to their aid not
                    only men, but the gods as well, by raising a religious scruple anent the
                    election held two -years before. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In the year
                    before the last, they said, there had been an intolerable winter, like a warning
                    from Heaven. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Last year had come not prodigies
                    but actual realities: a pestilence had descended upon the fields and the City,
                    clearly proceeding from the anger of the gods, whom they must propitiate in
                    order to avert the plague, as the fateful Books had indicated; it had seemed to
                    the gods an affront that an election held under their auspices should prostitute
                    honours and confound family distinctions. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The
                    people were awed not only by the dignity of the candidates, but by the fear of
                    Heaven, and to be military tribunes with consular powers chose all patricians,
                    and chiefly the most illustrious among them, as follows: <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Lucius Valerius Potitus (for the fifth time), Marcus
                    Valerius Maximus, Marcus Furius Camillus (for the second <pb n="p.53"/> time),
                    Lucius Furius Medullinus (for the third), Q. <note anchored="true"

                    absolutely nothing noteworthy at Veii, but employed all their strength in
                    pillaging. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The two chief commanders, Potitus
                    and Camillus, —one at Falerii, the other at Capena, —carried off huge spoils and
                    left nothing untouched that iron or fire could destroy. </p>

                    <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Meanwhile many portents were reported, most of
                    which, because they had only one witness each to vouch for them, obtained no
                    credence and were slighted; and, besides, when the Etruscans, whose services
                    they employed to avert evil omens, were at war with them, they had no
                    soothsayers. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> One thing occasioned universal
                    anxiety, namely that the lake in the Alban Wood, without any rains or other
                    cause to make it less than a miracle, rose to an unwonted height. <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> To inquire what the gods could possibly foretell by
                    that prodigy, envoys were sent to the Delphic oracle. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> But a nearer interpreter of the fates presented himself, an
                    old man of Veii, who, while the Roman and Etruscan soldiers were scoffing at one
                    another as they stood guard at the outposts, declared in a prophetic strain that
                    until the water should be drawn off from the Alban Lake the Romans never could
                    take Veii. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> At first they made light of this as
                    an idle taunt; then they began to talk it over; presently one of the Roman
                    outpost inquired of the townsman nearest him (for owing to the long continuance
                    of the war they had now got into the way of conversing together) who that man
                    was who threw out mysterious hints regarding the Alban Lake. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> When he heard that he was a soothsayer, being himself not
                    without a touch of <pb n="p.55"/> superstition, he alleged a desire to consult
                    him <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="marg">B.C. 398</note> about
                    the averting of a domestic portent, if he could spare the time, and so enticed
                    the seer to a conference. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> And when they had
                    walked a little way apart from the friends of both, unarmed and fearing nothing,
                    the stalwart young Roman laid hold of the feeble old man in the sight of them
                    all, and despite an unavailing hubbub raised by the Etruscans, bore him off to
                    his own fellows. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> There they had him before the
                    general, who sent him on to Rome, to the senate. <milestone n="9" unit="section"
                    /> When the Fathers questioned him what it was he had meant about the Alban
                    Lake, he answered that the gods must surely have been incensed at the people of
                    Veii on the day when they put it into his: <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    mind to reveal the destruction destined to befall his native city; and so what
                    he had then uttered under divine inspiration, he could not now unsay and recall;
                    and perhaps in concealing what the immortal gods wished to be published guilt
                    was incurred no less than by disclosing what should be hid. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> Thus then it was written in the books of fate, thus handed
                    down in the lore of the Etruscans, that when the Alban water should overflow, if
                    then the Romans should duly draw it off, they would be given the victory over
                    the Veientes; until that should come, to pass, the gods would not abandon the
                    walls of Veii. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He then went on to explain the
                    appointed method of draining it. But the senators, making slight account of his
                    authority, as not sufficiently trustworthy in so grave a matter, determined to
                    wait for their deputies with the response of the Pythian oracle. <note

                    believed that in these circumstances they had an opportunity to do the Romans a

                    had subsequently come into the possession of the Roman People, a tithe thereof
                    was sacred to Apollo. Thus the city and the land came into the estimate.

                    their camp about a mile from the town, trusting that it was quite safe, without
                    other reason than the difficulty of approaching it; for the ground about it was

                    earliest dawn in a considerably superior position. The Romans, divided into
                    three shifts, began to build a rampart, the soldiers who were not working

                    their camp, which was the nearer refuge, and made for the town; and many were
                    slain or wounded, before, in their terror, they could rush in through the gates.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The camp was taken, and the booty was paid

                    of the military tribunes, Gaius Aemilius and Spurius Postumius. At first they
                    exercised the command conjointly; afterwards, when they had routed the enemy in
                    battle, they arranged that Aemilius should hold Verrugo with a garrison, while
                    Postumius should lay waste the country. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As he
                    was leading his troops in irregular formation, somewhat carelessly in

                    deserved his reproaches, and confessed the enormity of their misconduct, but

                    disappointment which the Fathers avenged by passing a resolution in the senate
                    providing for the election of consuls —a magistracy odious to the plebs. There
                    had been no consuls for fifteen years, when they elected Lucius Lucretius
                    Flavus, and Servius Sulpicius Camerinus. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In
                    the beginning of this year, the tribunes united in a spirited attempt —for none
                    of the college was disposed to object —to carry the bill; and the consuls, for
                    that very reason, were quite as active in opposing them. While the whole body
                    politic was absorbed in this one concern, Vitellia, a Roman colony, was captured
                    by the Aequi, in whose territory it was situated. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> The greatest part of the settlers escaped, for the place
                    was taken by treachery at night and their flight through the opposite quarter of
                    the town was unopposed, and made their way to Rome in safety. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> To Lucius Lucretius the consul fell the command in this
                    affair. Marching out with his army, he defeated the enemy in a battle and
                    returned victorious to the City, where he found a far more serious struggle
                    impending. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> A day of trial had been appointed
                    for the plebeian tribunes of two years before, namely Aulus Verginius and
                    Quintus Pomponius, to defend whom the senate, as the patricians all agreed, was
                    in honour bound; for no man brought any charge against their lives or the
                    conduct of their office, except their having, out of complaisance to the
                    Fathers, opposed the tribunician law. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But the
                        <pb n="p.105"/> influence of the senators was out-weighed by the <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="marg">B.C. 393</note> resentment
                    of the plebs, and a shameful precedent was set, when the innocent men were
                    condemned each to pay a fine of 10,000 asses. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    This roused the indignation of the senate. Camillus frankly denounced the
                    depravity of the commons, who having turned against their own representatives,
                    failed to perceive that they had by their wicked judgment of the tribunes done
                    away with the veto, and that in doing away with the veto they had overthrown the
                    tribunician power. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> For if they supposed that
                    the unbridled licence of that office would be tolerated by the Fathers, they
                    were mistaken; if tribunician violence could not be resisted by the help of
                    tribunes, the senators must find some other weapon. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> He rebuked the consuls also, because they had, without
                    protesting, allowed those tribunes who had followed the guidance of the senate
                    to suffer for their reliance on the guarantee of state protection. By such
                    sentiments, publicly expressed in speeches, he angered the people more and more
                    from day to day. </p>

                    arrive for voting on it, in no other spirit than that of men who realized that
                    they had to fight for hearth and home, for the temples of their gods, and for
                    the soil of their birth. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> So far, indeed, as
                    the question touched his private interest, it would actually be an honour to

                    stirred the senators, old men as well as young, that on the day the law was
                    proposed they formed in a body and came into the Forum, where they dispersed
                    among the tribes, and canvassing every man <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/>
                    his own tribesmen, began with tears to beseech them, that they would not forsake
                    that City for which both they and their fathers had fought with the greatest
                    courage and good fortune. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They pointed to the
                    Capitol, to the shrine of Vesta, and to the other temples standing all about
                    them; they begged them not to drive the Roman People, an exile, and a wanderer
                    from its native land and its household gods, to the city of its enemies, nor to
                    carry things so far that it would be better that Veii had not been taken, so
                    that Rome might not be deserted. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Since the
                    patricians used not force but entreaties, and in their entreaties made many a

                    by the Etruscans; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and that wine had been
                    imported into Gaul expressly to entice them, by Arruns of Clusium, in his anger
                    at the seduction of his wife by Lucumo. This youth, whose guardian he had been,
                    was so powerful that he could not have chastised him without calling in a

                    Now I would not deny that Arruns or some other citizen brought the Gauls to
                    Clusium, but that those who besieged Clusium were not the first who had passed

                    of the Bituriges, and this tribe supplied the Celtic nation with a king.

                    that it seemed hardly possible to govern so great a multitude. <milestone n="3"

                    Thence, after leaving a moderate guard to prevent any attack upon their

                    gods whose service not even the fear of death could cause him to neglect, and
                    rejoined his friends on the Capitol, leaving the Gauls dumbfounded by his
                    astonishing audacity, or perhaps even moved by religious awe, a sentiment to

                    from day to day, not courage merely, but strength as well. Not only were Romans
                    coming in from the country-side, —men who had been wanderers since the defeat,
                    or the capture of the City, —but volunteers were also pouring in from Latium,
                    that they might share in the spoils. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It seemed
                    therefore that the time was now ripe to return to their native City and wrest it
                    from the hands of the enemy; but their strong body lacked a head. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> The place itself reminded men of Camillus, and there
                    were many of the soldiers who had fought successfully under his leadership and
                    auspices. Moreover, Caedicius declared that he would suffer neither god nor man
                    to put an end to his authority, but, remembering his station, would himself
                    demand the appointment of a general. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> With the
                    consent of all they resolved <pb n="p.157"/> to send for Camillus from Ardea,
                    but not till the <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="marg">B.C.
                        390</note> senate at Rome had been consulted; so modest were they in their
                    conduct of everything, preserving the proper distinctions even in their
                    well-nigh desperate case. It was necessary at enormous risk to pass the enemy's
                    outposts. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This an active youth named Pontius
                    Cominus undertook to do, and supporting himself on a strip of cork, floated down
                    the Tiber to the City. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Once there, he passed
                    by the shortest way from the bank up a cliff so steep that the enemy had
                    neglected to guard it, to the Capitol, and being brought before the magistrates
                    delivered to them the message from the army. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Then, on the senate's resolving that the <hi rend="italics">curiate</hi>

                    even as the people commanded he should straightway be appointed dictator, and
                    the soldiers have the general they desired, the messenger returned by the same
                    route and came in haste to Veii; <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> whence
                    envoys were despatched to Ardea for Camillus, and fetched him to Veii; or rather
                    —as I prefer to believe that he did not quit Ardea until he had learnt that the
                    law was passed, since he could not change his residence without the People's
                    command, nor take the auspices in the army till he had been appointed
                    dictator-the curiate law was passed and Camillus declared dictator, in his
                    absence. </p>

                    they could not elude the vigilance of the geese, which, being sacred to Juno,
                    had, notwithstanding the dearth of provisions, not been killed. This was the
                    salvation of them all; for the geese with their gabbling and clapping of their
                    wings woke Marcus Manlius, —consul of three years before and a distinguished
                    soldier, —who, catching up his weapons and at the same time calling the rest to
                    arms, strode past his bewildered comrades to a Gaul who had already got a
                    foothold on the crest and dislodged him with a blow from the boss of his shield.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> As he slipped and fell, he overturned
                    those who were next to him, and the others in alarm let go their weapons and
                    grasping the rocks to which they had been clinging, were slain by Manlius.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> And by now the rest had come together and
                    were assailing the invaders with javelins and stones, and presently the whole
                    company lost their footing and were flung down headlong to destruction.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Then after the din was hushed, the rest of
                    the night —so far as their excitement would permit, when even a past peril made
                    them nervous —was given up to sleep. At dawn the trumpet summoned the soldiers
                    to assemble before the tribunes. Good conduct and bad had both to be requited.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> First Manlius was praised for his courage
                    and presented with gifts, not only by <pb n="p.161"/> the tribunes of the

                        >B. C. 390</note> amongst the troops, who brought each half a pound of spelt
                    and a gill of wine to his house, which stood in the Citadel. It is a little
                    thing to tell, but the scarcity made it a great token of affection, since
                    everyone robbed himself of his own sustenance and bestowed what he had
                    subtracted from his physical necessities to do honour to one man. <milestone

                    scaled without being discovered were called up. <milestone n="10" unit="section"
                    /> Quintus Sulpicius, the tribune, announced his intention to punish them all in
                    the military fashion; but deterred by the cries of the soldiers, who united in
                    throwing the blame upon a single sentinel, he spared the others. This man was
                    guilty beyond a doubt, and was flung from the rock with the approval of all.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> From that time the guards on both sides
                    were more alert: the Gauls, because it had been put about that messengers were

                        n="2" unit="section"/> The Gauls suffered also from a pestilence, being
                    encamped between hills on low ground, parched and heated by the conflagration,
                    where the air was filled with ashes, as well as dust, whenever a breeze sprang
                    up. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> These annoyances were intolerable to a

                    they began to sicken of diseases that spread as though the victims had been
                    cattle, they were soon too slothful to bury their dead singly, and piling the

                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A truce was afterwards made with the Romans,
                    and the commanders allowed their soldiers to talk together. Since in these
                    conversations the Gauls used frequently to taunt their enemies with their
                    famished state, and call on them to yield to that necessity and surrender, the
                    Romans are said, in order to do away with this opinion, to have cast bread down
                    from the Capitol in many places, into the outposts of the enemy. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> Yet at last they could neither dissemble their hunger
                    nor endure it any longer. The dictator was now holding a levy of his own at
                    Ardea, and having ordered the master of the horse, Lucius Valerius, to bring up
                    his army from Veii, was mustering and drilling a force with which he might cope
                    with the Gauls on equal terms. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But the army on
                    the Capitol was worn out with picket duty and mounting guard; and though they
                    had got the better of all human ills, yet was there one, and that was famine,
                    which nature would not suffer to be overcome. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Day after day they looked out to see if any relief from the dictator was at
                    hand; but at last even hope, as well as food, beginning to fail them, and their
                    bodies growing almost too weak to sustain their armour when they went out on
                    picket duty, they declared that they must either surrender or ransom themselves,
                    on whatever conditions they could make; for the Gauls were hinting very plainly
                    that no great price would be required to induce them to raise the siege.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Thereupon the senate met, and instructed
                    the tribunes of the soldiers to arrange the terms. Then, at a conference between
                    Quintus Sulpicius the tribune and the Gallic chieftain Brennus, the affair <pb

                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The transaction was a foul disgrace in
                    itself, but an insult was added thereto: the weights brought by the Gauls were
                    dishonest, and on the tribune's objecting, the insolent Gaul added his sword to
                    the weight, and a saying intolerable to Roman ears was heard, —Woe to the
                    conquered! </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="49" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> But neither gods nor men would suffer the
                    Romans to live ransomed. For, by some chance, before the infamous payment had
                    been consummated, and when the gold had not yet, owing to the dispute, been all
                    weighed out, the dictator appeared and commanded the gold to be cleared away and
                    the Gauls to leave. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They objected vehemently,
                    and insisted on the compact; but Camillus denied the validity of that compact
                    which, subsequently to his own appointment as dictator, an inferior magistrate
                    had made without his authorization, and warned them to prepare for battle.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> His own men he ordered to throw their
                    packs in a heap, make ready their weapons, and win their country back with iron
                    instead of gold; having before their eyes the temples of the gods, their wives
                    and their children, the soil of their native land, with the hideous marks of war
                    upon it, and all that religion called upon them to defend, recover, or avenge.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He then drew up his line, as well as the
                    ground permitted, on the naturally uneven surface of the half-ruined City, and
                    saw to it that his soldiers had every advantage in choice of position and in
                    preparation which the art of war suggested. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    The Gauls were taken aback; they armed, and, with more rage than judgment, <pb

                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="marg">B.C. 390</note> now the
                    might of Heaven and human wisdom were engaged in the cause of Rome. Accordingly,
                    at the first shock the Gauls were routed with as little effort as they had
                    themselves put forth to conquer on the Allia. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    They afterwards fought a second, more regular engagement, eight miles out on the
                    Gabinian Way, where they had rallied from their flight, and again the
                    generalship and auspices of Camillus overcame them. Here the carnage was
                    universal; their camp was taken; and not a man survived to tell of the disaster.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The dictator, having recovered his country
                    from her enemies, returned in triumph to the city; and between the rough jests
                    uttered by the soldiers, was hailed in no unmeaning terms of praise as a Romulus
                    and Father of his Country and a second Founder of the City. </p>

                        —with its healthful <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="marg"
                            >B.C. 390</note> hills; its convenient river, by which crops may be
                        floated down from the midland regions and foreign commodities brought up;
                        its sea, near enough for use, yet not exposing us, by too great propinquity,
                        to peril from foreign fleets; a situation in the heart of Italy —a spot, in
                        short, of a nature uniquely adapted for the expansion of a city. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> This is proved by the very greatness of so new a
                        place. It is now, Quirites, in its three hundred and sixty-fifth year.
                        Amongst all these ancient nations you have for so long a time been waging
                        wars; and all this while — to say nothing of single cities —neither the
                        Volsci joined with the Aequi, and all their powerful towns, nor all Etruria,
                        with its enormous strength on land and water, and its occupancy of the
                        entire breadth of Italy from sea to sea, has been a match for you in war.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Since this is so, what a plague is the
                        reason why you that have experienced these things should experiment with
                        others? Granting that your valour may go elsewhere, yet surely the fortune
                        of this place could not be taken along! <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        Here is the Capitol, where men were told, when of old they discovered there
                        a human head, that in that place should be the head of the world and the
                        seat of empire; here, when the Capitol was being cleared with augural rites,
                        Juvent as and Terminus, to the vast joy of your fathers, refused to be
                        removed; here are Vesta's fires, here the shields that were sent down from
                        heaven, here are all the gods propitious, if you remain. </quote>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The speech of Camillus is said to have moved
                    them, particularly where he touched upon religion; but the doubtful issue was
                    resolved by a word <pb n="p.187"/> that was let fall in the nick of time. It was
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="marg">B.C. 390</note> while
                    the senate, a little later, was deliberating about these matters in the Curia
                    Hostilia; some cohorts returning from guard-duty were marching through the
                    Forum, and as they came to the Comitium a centurion cried out,
                        <quote>Standard-bearer, fix your ensign; here will be our best place to
                        remain.</quote>
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Hearing this sentence the senators came out
                    from the Curia and shouted their acceptance of the omen, and the commons
                    gathering round them signified approval. The bill was then rejected, and people
                    began in a random fashion to rebuild the City. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    The state supplied tiles, and granted everybody the right to quarry stone and to
                    hew timber where he liked, after giving security for the completion of the
                    structures within that year. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In their haste
                    men were careless about making straight the streets, and paying no attention to
                    their own and others' rights, built on the vacant spaces. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> This is the reason that the ancient sewers, which were at
                    first conducted through the public ways, at present frequently run under private
                    dwellings, and the appearance of the City is like one where the ground has been
                    appropriated rather than divided. </p>
