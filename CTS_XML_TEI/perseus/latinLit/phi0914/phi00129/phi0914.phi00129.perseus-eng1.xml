                    Three hundred of them, young men in the bloom of their youth and conspicuous for their physical strength, he kept about him unarmed and ignorant of the purpose for which they were being reserved without being organized in centuries or furnished with arms.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Then he chose out of the number of the younger men of all Sicily three hundred horsemen, men of high rank and of wealth, to cross over with him into Africa.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    He appointed a day also on which they were to present themselves equipped and furnished with horses and arms. Such service far from home seemed to them formidable and likely to bring many hardships and great dangers on land and sea. And concern on this account troubled not merely the men themselves but also their parents and relations.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    When the day which had been appointed came the men displayed their arms and horses. Then Scipio said reports were coming to him that some of the Sicilian horsemen shrank from that service as formidable and difficult.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    If any were of that mind he preferred that they should confess it to him at once, rather than complain later and prove spiritless soldiers and useless for the state. Let them declare what was their mind; he would give them a kindly hearing.

                        Accordingly, since you have not concealed what your mind is, young man, I will furnish a substitute for you, and to him you shall hand over your arms and horse and the other equipment for the service, and forthwith shall take him away with you to your home, train him and see that he is taught horsemanship and the use of arms.

                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    As the man gladly accepted the terms Scipio turned over to him one of the three hundred unarmed men that-he had. When the others saw the horseman thus discharged with the consent of the commander, every man excused himself and took a substitute.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Thus three hundred Sicilians were replaced by Roman horsemen without expense to the state.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    Of their training and drilling the Sicilians were in charge, because the general's order was that any man who failed to do so should himself serve.

                    Every preparation for the war having been made, he came to Syracuse, which was not yet quite peaceful after the great unsettlement due to the war.

                    Thinking it of the utmost importance to keep a promise given by the state, Scipio restored their property to the Syracusans, partly by

                    The Carthaginians had been driven out by the Romans; the Spaniards, if they should agree, were able to drive out the Romans, so that, free from all foreign authority, Spain might return permanently to its ancestral customs and usages.

                    enemies had concentrated and pitched camp three miles away from their camp. At first a vain effort was made through envoys to make them abandon fighting.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Then when an attack was suddenly made upon Roman foragers by Spanish horse and from a Roman outpost horsemen were sent to the rescue, there was a cavalry battle with no success for either side worth mentioning.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    At sunrise on the following day, under arms and drawn up, all of them displayed their battle-line at a distance of about a mile from the Roman camp.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    The Ausetani were in the centre; of the wings the Ilergetes occupied the right, unimportant Spanish tribes the left. Between the wings and the centre they had made spaces broad enough to send the cavalry through when the time came.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    And the Romans, having drawn up their army in the customary fashion, imitated this feature only of the enemy's line, that they likewise left broad spaces between the legions for the passage of cavalry.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    But Lentulus thought that whichever side should first send its cavalry out into the enemy's line with its gaping intervals would use its cavalry to advantage.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    He therefore ordered Servius Cornelius, a tribune of the soldiers, to command his cavalry to give their horses free rein through the broad openings in the battle-line of the enemy.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Lentulus himself, after the infantry battle had begun without success, delayed only long enough to bring up the thirteenth legion from the reserves into the front line to support the twelfth legion, which had been placed on the left wing facing the Ilergetes and was giving way.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Now that the battle was evenly balanced there, he came up to Lucius Manlius, who
                    <pb n="p.217"/>
                    was in the foremost ranks, encouraging the men

                    and bringing up reserves to such positions as the case required.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    He informed him that all was secured on the left wing; that he had already sent Servius Cornelius to surround the enemy with a whirlwind attack of cavalry.

                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Scarcely had Lentulus said this when the Roman horse, charging into the midst of the enemy, threw the infantry lines into confusion and at the same time closed for the Spanish cavalry the route by which they might launch their attack.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly the Spaniards gave up the cavalry battle and dismounted. The Roman generals, on seeing the broken ranks of the enemy, and their fright and alarm and the wavering standards, exhorted and implored their soldiers to attack the discouraged enemy and not allow the line to re-form.

Consequently while the Numidian, fired by his newfound love, was in his power, with the help also of the young woman's allurements, Hasdrubal prevailed upon him to send ambassadors to Scipio in Sicily, and through these men he was to warn Scipio not to cross over to Africa in reliance upon his previous promises.

                    The report of this modest success at the beginning of the campaign brought the Numidians over to Masinissa, and from farms and villages on all sides old soldiers of Gala flocked to him; and they spurred the young man on to recover the kingdom of his father.

                    In the number of his soldiers Mazaetullus was considerably superior; for not only did he himself have the army with which he had defeated Capussa, and a number of men whom he had taken over after the slaying of the king, but also the young Lacumazes had brought up very large auxiliary forces from Syphax.

The prince with his guardian and a very small band of Masaesulians sought refuge in the territory of Carthage. So, having recovered his father's kingdom, Masinissa, seeing that his remaining conflict against Syphax would be considerably more serious, thought it best to be reconciled with his cousin.

                    He added that unless Syphax and the Carthaginians should put out that incipient flame, they would be consumed later by a mighty conflagration when they could no longer cope with it; that Masinissa's strength was still slight and frail, while he was nursing a kingdom whose wounds had barely begun to heal.
