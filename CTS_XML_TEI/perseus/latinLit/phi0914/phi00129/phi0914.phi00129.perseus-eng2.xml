                    <p> In Spain, Mandonius and Indibilis, reviving hostilities, are finally
                        subdued. Scipio goes over from Syracuse to Locri; dislodges the Carthaginian
                        general; repulses Hannibal, and recovers that city. Peace made with Philip.
                        The Idaean Mother brought to Rome from Phrygia; received by Publius Scipio
                        Nasica, judged by the senate the best man in the state. Scipio passes over
                        into Africa. Syphax, having married a daughter of Hasdrubal, renounces his
                        alliance with Scipio. Masinissa, who had been expelled his kingdom by
                        Syphax, joins Scipio with two hundred horsemen; they defeat a large army
                        commanded by Hanno. Hasdrubal and Syphax approach with a most numerous
                        force. Scipio raises the siege of Utica, and fortifies a post for the
                        winter. The consul Sempronius gets the better of Hannibal in a battle near
                        Croton. dispute between Marcus Livius and Claudius Nero, censors. </p>
                </argument>
                <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> SCIPIO, after his arrival in Sicily, formed
                    his volunteers into cohorts and centuries. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Of
                    these he kept about his person three hundred young men, in the bloom of their
                    age and the prime of their strength, unarmed, and not knowing for what purpose
                    they were reserved, as they were not included in the centuries, nor furnished
                    with arms. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He then selected out of the number
                    of the youth of all Sicily three hundred horsemen, of the highest birth and
                    fortune, who were to cross over with him into Africa, appointing a day on which
                    they were to present themselves equipped and furnished with horses and arms.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This severe service, far from their native
                    land, appeared to them likely to be attended with many hardships, and great
                    dangers, both by sea and land; nor did that anxiety affect themselves alone, but
                    also their parents and relations. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When the
                    appointed day arrived, they exhibited their arms and horses. Then Scipio
                    observed, <quote> that an intimation had been conveyed to him that certain of
                        the Sicilian horsemen felt a strong aversion to that service, as being
                        severe and arduous. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> If there were any who
                        entertained such a feeling, that he would rather they should then confess it
                        to him, than, complaining afterwards, prove themselves slothful and <pb
                            n="1232" xml:id="p.1232"/> useless soldiers to the state. He desired
                        that they would openly avow their sentiments, for that he would hear them
                        with kindly feeling. </quote>
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When one of the number took courage to
                    declare, that if he were allowed the uncontrolled exercise of his will he
                    certainly would not serve, Scipio replied to him thus: <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/>
                    <quote> Since then, young man, you have not dissembled your sentiments, I will
                        furnish a substitute for you, to whom I request that you transfer your arms,
                        your horse, and other appliances of war; and, taking him hence immediately
                        to your house, train him, and take care that he is instructed in the
                        management of his horse and arms. </quote>
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The youth accepted the terms joyfully, when
                    Scipio delivered to him one of the three hundred whom he kept unarmed. The rest,
                    seeing the horseman thus discharged without giving any offence to the general,
                    began severally to excuse themselves and receive substitutes. Thus Roman
                    horsemen were substituted for the three hundred Sicilian, without any expense to
                    the state. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The Sicilians had the care of
                    instructing and training them, because the general had ordered that the man who
                    should not do so, should serve himself. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> It is
                    said that this turned out to be an admirable body of cavalry, and rendered
                    effectual service to the state in many engagements. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> Afterwards, inspecting the legions, he chose out of them
                    such soldiers as had served the greatest number of campaigns, particularly those
                    who had acted under Marcellus; for he considered that they were formed under the
                    best discipline, and also, from the long time in which they were engaged in the
                    siege of Syracuse, were most skilled in the assault of towns: for his thoughts
                    were now occupied with no small object, but the destruction of Carthage.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> He then distributed his army through the
                    towns; ordered the Sicilian states to furnish corn, sparing that which had been
                    brought from Italy; repaired his old ships, and sent Caius Laelius with them
                    into Africa to plunder. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> His new ships he
                    hauled on shore at Panormus, that they might be kept on land during the winter,
                    as they had been hastily built of unseasoned timber. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> When every thing was got in readiness for the
                    war he came to Syracuse, which had hardly yet returned to a state of
                    tranquillity, after the violent commotions of the war. <milestone n="16"
                        unit="section"/> The Greeks, demanding restitution of their property, which
                    had been granted to them by the senate, from certain persons of <pb n="1233"
                        xml:id="p.1233"/> the Italian nation, who retained possession of it in the
                    same forcible manner in which they had seized it in the war, Scipio, who deemed
                    it <milestone n="17??" unit="section"/> of the first importance to preserve the
                    public faith, restored their property to the Syracusans, partly by proclamation,
                    and partly even by judgments pronounced against those who pertinaciously
                    retained their unjust acquisitions. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> This
                    measure was acceptable not only to the persons immediately concerned, but to all
                    the states of Sicily, and so much the more energetically did they give aid in
                    the war. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> During the same summer a very
                    formidable war sprang up in Spain, at the instance of Indibilis the Ilergetian,
                    from no other cause than the contempt he conceived for the other generals, in
                    consequence of his admiration of Scipio. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> He
                    considered <quote> that he was the only commander the Romans had left, the rest
                        having been slain by Hannibal. That they had, therefore, no other general
                        whom they could send into Spain after the Scipios were cut off there, and
                        that afterwards, when the war in Italy pressed upon them with increased
                        severity, he was recalled to oppose Hannibal. That, in addition to the fact
                        that the Romans had the names only of generals in Spain, their old army had
                        also been withdrawn thence. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> That all the
                        troops they had there were irresolute, as consisting of an undisciplined
                        multitude of recruits. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> That there would
                        never again occur such an opportunity for the liberation of Spain.
                            <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> That up to that time they had been
                        the slaves either of Carthaginians or Romans, and that not to one or the
                        other in turns, but sometimes to both together. <milestone n="24"
                            unit="section"/> That the Carthaginians had been driven out by the
                        Romans, and that the Romans might be driven out by the Spaniards, if they
                        would unite: so that Spain, for ever freed from a foreign yoke, might return
                        to her native customs and rites. </quote>
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/> By these and other observations he stirred up
                    not only his countrymen, but the Ausetanians also, a neighbouring nation, as
                    well as other states bordering on his own and their country. <milestone n="26"
                        unit="section"/> Accordingly, within a few days, thirty thousand foot and
                    about four thousand horse assembled in the Sedetanian territory, according to
                    the orders which had been given. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> On the other side, the Roman generals also,
                    Lucius Lentulus and Lucius Manlius Acidinus, lest <milestone n="2??"
                        unit="section"/> by neglecting the first beginnings of the war it should
                    increase in violence, having united their armies, and led their troops through
                    the <pb n="1234" xml:id="p.1234"/> Ausetanian territory in a peaceable manner,
                    as though it had been the territory of friends instead of enemies, came to the
                    position of the enemy, and pitched their camp at a distance of three miles from
                    theirs. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At first an unsuccessful attempt was
                    made, through ambassadors, to induce them to lay down their arms; then the
                    Spanish cavalry making a sudden attack on the Roman foragers, a body of cavalry
                    was sent to support them from the Roman outposts, when a battle between the
                    cavalry took place with no memorable issue to either side. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> The next day, at sun-rise, the whole force displayed their
                    line, armed and drawn out for battle, at the distance of about a mile from the
                    Roman camp. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Ausetanians were in the
                    centre, the right wing was occupied by the Ilergetians, the left by some
                    inconsiderable states of Spain. Between the wings and the centre they had left
                    intervals of considerable extent, through which they might send out their
                    cavalry when occasion required. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Romans
                    also, drawing up their army in their usual manner, imitated the enemy in respect
                    only of leaving themselves also intervals between the legions to afford passages
                    for their cavalry. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Lentulus, however,
                    concluding that the cavalry could be employed with advantage by those only who
                    should be the first to send them against the enemy's line, thus broken by
                    intervals, ordered Servius Cornelius, a military tribune, to direct the cavalry
                    to ride at full speed into the spaces left in the enemy's line. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Lentulus himself, as the battle between the infantry was
                    somewhat unfavourable in its commencement, waited <milestone n="9??"
                        unit="section"/> only until he had brought up from the reserve into the
                    front line the thirteenth legion to support the twelfth legion, which had been
                    posted in the left wing, against the Ilergetians, and which was giving ground.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> And when the battle was thus placed on an
                    equal footing in that quarter, he came to Lucius Manlius, who was exhorting the
                    troops in the foremost line, and bringing up the reserves in such places as
                    circumstances required, and told him that all was safe in the left wing, and
                    that Cornelius Servius, who had <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> been sent
                    by him for that purpose, would soon pour round the enemy a storm of cavalry.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He had scarcely uttered these words, when
                    the Roman horse, riding into the midst of the enemy, at once threw their line of
                    infantry into disorder, and closed up the passage by which the Spanish cavalry
                    were to advance. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The Spaniards, therefore,
                    giving up all thoughts of fighting on <pb n="1235" xml:id="p.1235"/> horseback,
                    dismounted and fought on foot. When the Roman generals saw that the ranks of the

                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> So desperate was their charge that the
                    barbarians could not have withstood the shock, had not the prince Indibilis in
                    person, together with the dismounted cavalry, opposed himself to the enemy
                    before the front rank of the infantry. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> There
                    an obstinate contest continued for a considerable time; but those who fought
                    round the king, who continued his resistance though almost expiring, and who was
                    afterwards pinned to the earth by a javelin, having at length fallen,
                    overwhelmed with darts, a general flight took place; <milestone n="16"

                    were prevented from remounting, and because the Romans pressed impetuously upon
                    the discomfited troops; nor did they give over until they had deprived the enemy
                    of their camp. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> On that day thirteen thousand
                    Spaniards were slain, and about eight hundred captured. Of the Romans and allies
                    there fell a little more than two hundred, and those principally in the left

                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The tumult occasioned by the rebellion in

                    without any great disturbance, the whole terror of the war was directed against

                    Regius by night, at break of day led his soldiers and mariners in regular array

                    done; and messengers, flying in terror, filled Carthage with alarm, by reporting
                    that the Roman fleet and the general, Scipio, had arrived; for there was a

                    fear, which represented them as greater than they really were, exaggerated every

                    dismay took possession of their minds, but afterwards grief, when they reflected
                    that their circumstances had undergone so great a change; that they, who lately
                    as conquerors had an army before the walls of Rome, and, after having laid
                    prostrate so many armies of the enemy, had received the surrender of all the

                    like the resources to enable them to bear up against those calamities which the
                    Romans possessed. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> To the latter the Roman
                    commons and Latium afforded a supply of young men, which continually grew up
                    more vigorous and more numerous, in the room of so many armies destroyed, while
                    their own people, both those in the city and those in the country, were unfit

                    too, with regard to the kings, Syphax was alienated from them since his

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Their minds, which had fallen into these
                    melancholy reflections in consequence of the intelligence they had just
                    received, were brought back by their immediate fears to deliberate how to oppose
                    the instant danger. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They resolved, that troops
                    should be hastily levied both in the city and in the country; that persons
                    should be sent to hire auxiliaries from the Africans; that the city should be
                    fortified, corn collected, weapons and arms prepared, and ships equipped and

                    now, while engaged in these matters, news at length arrived that it was Laelius,
                    and not Scipio; that the forces which he had brought over were only what were
                    sufficient for making predatory incursions into the country, and that the
                    principal stress of the war still lay in Sicily. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                    /> Thus they were enabled to take breath, and they began to send embassies to
                    Syphax and the other petty princes, for the purpose of strengthening their
                    alliances. To Philip also ambassadors were sent, to promise him two hundred
                    talents of silver, if he would cross over into Sicily or Italy. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Ambassadors were also sent into Italy to the two generals,
                    to desire them to keep Scipio at home by terrifying the enemy in every way they
                    could. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> To Mago, not only ambassadors were
                    sent, but twenty-five men of war, six thousand infantry, eight hundred horse,
                    and seven elephants, besides a large sum of money to be employed in hiring
                    auxiliaries, in order that, encouraged by these aids, he might advance his army
                    nearer to the city of Rome, and form a junction with Hannibal. Such were the
                    preparations and plans at Carthage. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> While
                    Laelius was employed in carrying off an immense quantity of booty from the
                    country, the inhabitants of which had no arms, and which was destitute of
                    forces, Masinissa, moved by the report of the arrival of the Roman fleet, came
                    to him attended by a small body of horse. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He
                    complained that <quote> Scipio had not acted with promptness in this business,
                        in that he had not already passed his army over into Africa, while the

                        with the neighbouring states, and in doubt and uncertainty as to the course
                        he should take; that if time was allowed to Syphax to adjust his own <pb

                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He requested that he would exhort and
                    stimulate Scipio not to delay. Though driven from his kingdom, he said he would
                    join him with no despicable force of foot and horse. Nor was it right, said he,
                    that Laelius should continue in Africa, for he believed that a fleet had set
                    sail from Carthage, with which, in the absence of Scipio, it would not be
                    altogether safe to engage. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> After this discourse Masinissa departed.
                    Laelius, the next day, sailed from Hippo with his ships loaded with booty, and
                    returning to Sicily, delivered to Scipio the injunctions of Masinissa.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> About the same time the ships which were
                    sent from Carthage to Mago touched at the country between the Albingaunian
                    Ligurians and Genoa. Mago happened to be lying here with his fleet at this time.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> After hearing the message of the

                    both those nations were there. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He said that he
                    was sent to restore them to liberty, and, as they themselves might see, succours
                    were sent him from home; but that it depended upon them with how great forces
                    and how large an army the war for that purpose was to be carried on. <milestone

                    Gaul and another in Etruria. That he was well informed that Spurius Lucretius
                    would form a junction with Marcus Livius, and that they on their part must arm
                    many thousands, in order to cope with two Roman generals and two armies.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Gauls replied, that they had the
                    strongest possible inclination to this, but as the Romans had one army within
                    their borders, and another in the neighbouring country of Etruria, almost within
                    sight, if it should be known that they had supported the Carthaginians with
                    auxiliaries, those would immediately invade their territories on both sides with
                    determined hostility. They requested that he would ask of the Gauls such aids as
                    they could afford in a covert manner. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                    purposes of the Ligurians, they said, were unrestrained, because the Roman
                    troops were at a distance from their lands and cities; that it was fair that
                    they should arm their youth and take upon themselves a portion of the war.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The Ligurians did not dissent; they only
                    requested the space of two months to make their levies. Having <pb n="1239"
                        xml:id="p.1239"/> dismissed the Gauls, Mago in the mean time secretly hired
                    soldiers through their country. Provisions also of every description were sent

                    nearer to the city; but intending, if the Carthaginian should keep himself quiet
                    under the angle formed by the Alps, to remain himself also in the same quarter,

                    on seeing the booty which was taken from the enemy's country landed from the

                    possible; this important object was interrupted by one of minor consideration,
                    namely, that of regaining the town of Locri, which at the time of the general
                    defection of Italy had itself also gone over to the Carthaginians. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> The hope of accomplishing this object beamed forth
                    from a very trifling circumstance. The war was carried on in Bruttium rather in
                    a predatory than a regular manner, the Numidians having set the example, and the
                    Bruttians falling in with that practice, not more in consequence of their
                    connexion with the Carthaginians, than from their natural inclination.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At last the Romans also, who now took
                    delight in plunder by a sort of infection, made excursions into the lands of

                        unit="section"/> Some Locrians who had gone out of the town were surrounded
                    by them and carried off to Rhegium. Among the number of the prisoners were
                    certain artisans, who, as it happened, had been accustomed to work for the

                    They were recognised by some of the Locrian nobles, who having been driven out
                    by the opposite faction, which had delivered up Locri to Hannibal, had retired
                    to Rhegium; and having answered their other questions relative to what was going
                    on at home, questions which are usually put by such as have been long absent,
                    they gave them hopes that, if ransomed and sent back, they might be able to
                    deliver up the citadel to them; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> for there they
                    resided, and among the Carthaginians they enjoyed unlimited confidence.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Accordingly, as these nobles <pb n="1240"

                    and inflamed with a desire to be revenged on their enemies, they immediately
                    ransomed the prisoners and sent them back, after having settled the plan of
                    operation, and agreed upon the signals which were to be given at a distance and

                    Marcus Sergius and Publius Matienus, military tribunes, were sent with them, and
                    ordered to lead three thousand soldiers from Rhegium to Locri. A letter was also
                    written to Quintus Pleminius, the proprietor, with directions that he should

                    an attack was made upon the Carthaginian sentinels, who were fast asleep, as

                    uncertain whence the noise proceeded, while the terror of an alarm by night
                    magnified all fears, however groundless. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The
                    Carthaginians, therefore, terrified and supposing that the citadel was already
                    filled with the enemy, gave up all thoughts of opposition and fled to the other

                    Slight engagements took place daily from the two citadels. Quintus Pleminius
                    commanded the Roman, Hamilcar the Carthaginian garrison. They augmented their

                    came; nor would the Romans have held out, had not the general body of the
                    Locrians, exasperated by the pride and rapacity of the Carthaginians, leaned
                    towards the Romans. </p>

                    was approaching, lest even the garrison might be exposed to danger; <milestone

                    thence; as soon as the direction of the tide in the strait had changed, he let
                    the ships drive with the tide from Messana, having left his brother, Lucius
                    Scipio, in command there. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Hannibal also sent a

                    Locri, to desire his party to attack the Romans and Locrians at break of day in
                    the most vigorous manner, while he on the opposite side assaulted the town,
                    which would be unprepared for such a measure, as every one would have his

                    battle had commenced, he was unwilling to shut himself up in the citadel, where,
                    by his numbers, he would crowd that confined place; nor had he brought with him
                    scaling-ladders to enable him to mount the walls. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Having, however, had the baggage thrown together in a heap,

                    while the scaling-ladders and other requisites for an assault were preparing, he
                    rode round the city with some Numidian horsemen, in order to observe in what
                    quarter the attack might be best made. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Having
                    advanced towards the rampart, the person who happened to stand next him was
                    struck by a weapon from a scorpion; and, terrified at an accident in which he
                    had been exposed to so much danger, he retired, gave directions for sounding a
                    retreat, and fortified a camp out of the reach of weapons. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> The Roman fleet from Messana came to Locri several hours
                    before night. The troops were all landed and had entered the city before
                    sun-set. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The following day the fight began
                    from the citadel on the part of the Carthaginians, and Hannibal, having now
                    prepared ladders and all the other requisites for an assault, was coming up to
                    the walls; when, throwing open the gate, the Romans suddenly sallied out <pb

                    those who were in the citadel, to desire them to take measures for their own
                    safety, he decamped by night. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Those who were
                    in the citadel also, after throwing fire upon the buildings they occupied, in
                    order that the alarm thus occasioned might detain their enemy, went away with a

                    by the enemy, and their camp deserted, called the Locrians to an assembly and
                    rebuked them severely for their defection. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He
                    inflicted punishment on the persons principally concerned, and gave their
                    effects to the leaders of the other party, in consideration of their
                    extraordinary fidelity to the Romans. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> As to
                    the Locrians in general, he said that he would neither grant them any thing, nor
                    take any thing from them. They might send ambassadors to Rome, and they should

                    which was, that although they had deserved ill at the hands of the Romans, they
                    would be better off when subject to them, though incensed against them, than
                    they had been when in the power of their friends the Carthaginians. <milestone

                    cruelty by the Carthaginians since their revolt from the Romans, that they were
                    able to endure severities of an ordinary kind not only with patience but almost
                    willingness. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But indeed, so greatly did
                    Pleminius surpass Hamilcar, who had commanded the garrison, so greatly did the
                    Roman soldiers in the garrison surpass the Carthaginians in villany and
                    rapacity, that it would appear that they endeavoured to outdo each other, not in
                    arms, but in vices. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> None of all those things
                    which render the power of a superior hateful to the powerless was omitted
                    towards the inhabitants, either by the general or his soldiers. The most
                    shocking insults were committed <pb n="1243" xml:id="p.1243"/> against their own
                    persons, their children, and their wives. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> For
                    their rapacity did not abstain from the spoliation even of sacred things; and
                    not only were other temples violated, but even the treasures of Proserpine,
                    which had never been touched through all ages, excepting that they were said to
                    have been carried away by Pyrrhus, who restored the spoils, together with a

                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> they then cruelly lacerated the

                    acquitted Pleminius and left him in command of the same place, and pronounced
                    the tribunes guilty and thrown them into chains, that they might be sent to Rome
                    to the senate, he returned to Messana, and thence to Syracuse. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> Pleminius, unable to restrain his resentment, for he
                    thought that the injury he had sustained had been treated negligently and too
                    lightly by Scipio, and that no one could form an estimate of the punishment

                        Therefore, as he could not come himself to the election, he would, with the

                    their efforts to that quarter instead of assisting the Aetolians, for which

                    making peace with the king without their sanction, contrary to the league.

                    these events, lest any greater commotion should arise in the neighbouring
                    nations and states, he proceeded by forced marches to Apollonia, to which place
                    Sempronius had retired, having sent Laetorius, his lieutenant-general, with a

                        defend her own temple. As they were deterred, by religious awe, from
                        removing the treasures thence, they were desirous of surrounding the temple

                    of certain persons whom he had corrupted by bribes, to set fire to the city in
                    several places, that he might have an opportunity of breaking out of prison, and
                    making his escape; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> and that afterwards, the
                    wicked plot having been discovered, he was consigned to the Tullian dungeon,

                    of Scipio was considered no where but in the senate; where all the deputies and
                    tribunes, bestowing the highest commendations on the fleet, the army, and the
                    general, induced the senate to vote that he should cross over into Africa as

                        unit="section"/> Scipio was very far from feeling contempt for that

                    was not attributable to their cowardice, and that there were no soldiers in the
                    Roman army who had served so long, or were so experienced not only in the

                    In some I find ten thousand infantry and two hundred horse; in others, sixteen

                    took upon himself the care of seeing that the soldiers embarked orderly and
                    without confusion. The seamen, who were made to embark first, Caius Laelius, the

                    of ships of war in the left wing, would protect the transports. That the ships

                    surprising, (for most of the fleets went out for the purpose of getting
                    plunder,) but even in any former war, never did a fleet on setting out exhibit

                    is to be formed with reference to the magnitude of the fleet, it must be owned
                    that two consuls with their armies had passed from thence before, and there were
                    almost as many ships of war in those fleets as the transports with which Scipio

                    passed over with the object of drawing Hannibal out of Italy, of removing the

                    Manlius, which was almost fifty years ago, the Carthaginians had seen no Roman
                    armament, with the exception of fleets sent for plundering, from which troops
                    had made descents upon the lands bordering on the sea, <milestone n="6??"

                    their way, had always returned to their ships before their noise had collected
                    the peasantry. For this reason the hurry and consternation in the city was, on
                    the present occasion, the greater. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> And, by
                    Hercules, they had neither an efficient army at home, nor a general, whom they
                    could oppose to their enemy. Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo, was by far the first man
                    in their state in respect of birth, fame, opulence, and, at that time, also by
                    reason of an affinity with the king. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But they
                    recollected that he had been routed in several battles and driven out of Spain
                    by this very Scipio; and that therefore, as a general, he was no more a match
                    for the general of the enemy than their tumultuary army was for that of the

                    Scipio were coming immediately to attack the city; the gates were hastily
                    closed, armed men placed upon the walls, guards and outposts stationed in
                    different places, and the following night was spent in watching. <milestone

                    time Scipio, having sent his fleet to Utica, had proceeded a short distance from

                    the Romans was, the arrival of Masinissa just at the commencement of their
                    operations. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Some say that he came with not

                    greatest king of his age, and rendered most essential service to the Romans, it
                    seems worth while to digress a little, to give a full account of the great
                    vicissitudes of fortune he experienced in the loss and recovery of his father's
                    kingdom. While he was serving in Spain in the cause of the Carthaginians, his
                    father, named Gala, died. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The kingdom,
                    according to the custom of the Numidians, came to Œsalces, the brother of the

                    Œsalces also dying, the elder of his two sons, named Capusa, the other being
                    quite a boy, succeeded to his father's kingdom. But, as he occupied the throne
                    more by right of descent than from the <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/>
                    esteem in which he was held among his countrymen, or the power he possessed,
                    there stood forth a person named Mezetulus, not unrelated by blood to the kings,
                    of a family which had always been hostile to them, and had continually contested
                    the right to the throne with those who then occupied it, with various success.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This man, having roused his countrymen to
                    arms, over whom he possessed a great influence, from the hatred felt towards the
                    kings, openly pitched his camp, and compelled the king to come into the field
                    and fight for the throne. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Capusa, with many
                    of his nobles, falling in the action, the whole nation of the Massylians came
                    under the dominion and rule of Mezetulus. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> He
                    abstained, however, from assuming the title of king; and, contenting himself
                    with the modest appellation of protector, gave the name of king to the boy

                    concluding that by action, and by making some effort, he should collect
                    sufficient strength to enable him to effect something, he threw himself in the
                    way of the young king Lacumaces, at Thapsus, as he was going to Syphax. The
                    troops which attended him having fled back to the town in consternation,
                    Masinissa took it at the first assault. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Of the
                    royal party, some who surrendered themselves he received, others he slew while
                    attempting resistance. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The greater part, with
                    the young king himself, escaped during the confusion and came to Syphax, to whom
                    they intended to go at first. The fame of this success, in the commencement of
                    his operations, though of no great magnitude, brought the Numidians over to the
                    cause of Masinissa; and the veteran soldiers of Gala flocked to his standard
                    from all quarters, from the country and the towns, inviting the youth to come
                    and recover his paternal dominions. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Mezetulus
                    had somewhat the advantage in the number of his soldiers, for he had himself
                    both the army with which he had conquered Capusa, and also some troops who had
                    submitted to him after the king was slain; and the young king Lacumaces had
                    brought him very large succours from Syphax. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Mezetulus had fifteen thousand infantry, and ten thousand cavalry. With these
                    Masinissa engaged in battle, though he had by no means so many horse or foot.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The valour, however, of the veteran
                    troops, and the skill of the general, who had been exercised in the war between
                    the Romans and Carthaginians, <pb n="1272" xml:id="p.1272"/> prevailed. The
                    young king, with the protector and a small body of Massylians, escaped into the
                    territories of the Carthaginians. Masinissa thus recovered his paternal
                    dominions; but, as he saw that there still remained a struggle considerably more
                    arduous with Syphax, he thought it advisable to come to a reconciliation with
                    his cousin-german. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Having, therefore, sent
                    persons to give the young king hopes, that if he put himself under the
                    protection of Masinissa, he would be held in the same honour by him as Œsalces
                    had formerly been by Gala; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> and to promise
                    Mezetulus, in addition to impunity, a faithful restitution of all his property;

                    brought <milestone n="13??" unit="section"/> them over to his side,

                    put him to flight. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Masinissa, with a few
                    horsemen, effected his escape from the field to a mountain called by the natives
                    Balbus. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Several families, with their tents and
                    cattle, which form their wealth, followed the king; the rest of the Massylian

                    which the exiles had seized, had plenty of grass and water; and, as it was well
                    adapted for feeding cattle, afforded an abundant supply of food for men who live
                    upon flesh and milk. From this place they infested all the surrounding country;
                    at first with nightly and clandestine incursions, but afterwards with open
                    depredations. The lands of the Carthaginians suffered the severest devastation,
                    because there was not only a greater quantity of booty there than among the
                    Numidians, but their plunder would be safer. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    And now they did it with so much boldness and defiance, that, carrying their
                    booty down to the sea, they sold it to merchants, who brought their ships to
                    land for that very purpose; <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> while a greater
                    number of Carthaginians were slain and made prisoners, than frequently happens
                    in a regular war. The Carthaginians complained bitterly of these occurrences to
                    Syphax, and urged him strongly to follow up this remnant of the war, though he
                    was himself highly incensed at them. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> But he
                    considered it hardly suitable to the dignity of a king to pursue a vagabond

                    had emerged among the bushes on the farther bank. Here Bocchar stopped his
                    pursuit, as he neither had courage to enter the river, nor believed that he now
                    had any one to pursue. Upon this he returned to the king, with the false account
                    of the death of Masinissa. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Messengers were

                    whom they supposed to have perished, that within a few days six thousand armed

                    alliance with the Carthaginians, and the frontiers of the Massylians, the
                    dominions of Syphax. Then, having provoked Syphax to war, he took up a position
                    between Cirta and Hippo, on the tops of mountains which were conveniently

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Syphax, considering this an affair of too
                    great importance to be managed by one of his generals, sent a part of his army
                    with his son Vermina, a youth, with orders to march his troops round and attack
                    the enemy in the rear, while he engaged their attention in front. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> Vermina set out by night, as he was to fall upon the
                    enemy unawares; but Syphax decamped in the day-time and marched openly,
                    intending to fight a pitched battle. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When it
                    was thought that sufficient time had elapsed for those who were sent round to
                    have reached their destination, Syphax himself, relying upon his numbers and on
                    the ambuscade prepared on the enemy's rear, led his troops up the mountain which
                    lay before him, by a gentle acclivity which led towards the enemy. Masinissa,
                    relying chiefly on the great superiority he would have over his opponents in
                    respect of the ground, on his part also formed his troops. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> The battle was furious, and for a long time doubtful;
                    Masinissa having the advantage in point of situation and the courage of his
                    troops, and Syphax in respect of his numbers, which were much the greater of the
                    two. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> His numerous troops, which were divided,
                    some of them pressing upon the enemy in front, while others surrounded them on
                    the rear, gave Syphax a decisive victory; and, enclosed as they were in front
                    and rear, the enemy had not even a way to escape. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Accordingly, all their troops, both horse and foot, were
                    slain and made prisoners, except about two hundred horsemen, which Masinissa
                    having collected round him in a compact body, and divided into three squadrons,
                    ordered to force their way through, first naming a place where they were to meet
                    after being separated in their flight. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Masinissa himself escaped through the midst of the enemy's weapons in the
                    quarter to which he had directed his course; two of the squadrons were unable to
                    extricate themselves; one of them surrendered to the enemy through fear, the
                    other, making a more obstinate resistance, was overwhelmed with weapons and
                    annihilated. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Vermina followed Masinissa, <pb
                        n="1276" xml:id="p.1276"/> treading almost in his steps; but he eluded him
                    by continually turning out of one road into another, till at length he obliged
                    him, wearied with the hopeless task, to desist from the pursuit, and arrived at
                    the Lesser Syrtis with sixty horsemen. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Here,
                    in the country lying between the Carthaginian Emporia and the nation of the

                    Roman fleet into Africa, with the proud consciousness of having made every
                    exertion to recover his paternal dominions. These are the circumstances which
                    incline me to the opinion, that afterwards also, when Masinissa came to Scipio,
                    he brought with him a smallish rather than a large body of cavalry to succour
                    him; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> for the large number would seem to suit
                    only with the condition of a reigning king, while the small number corresponds

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The Carthaginians having lost a detachment of
                    cavalry, together with the commander, got together another body by means of a
                    new levy, and gave the command of it to Hanno, son of Hamilcar. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> They frequently sent for Hasdrubal and Syphax by letters
                    and messengers, and lastly even by ambassadors, ordering Hasdrubal to bring
                    assistance to his almost besieged country, and imploring Syphax to bring relief
                    to Carthage, nay to all Africa. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At that time
                    Scipio had his camp about five miles from the city of Utica, having removed it
                    from the sea, where he had continued encamped for a few days near the fleet.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Hanno, having received the body of horse,
                    which was far from being strong enough, not only to attack the enemy, but even
                    to protect the country from devastation, made it his first business to augment
                    the number of his cavalry by pressing; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> and
                    though he did not despise the men of other nations, he enlisted principally from
                    the Numidians, who are by far the first horsemen in Africa. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> He had now as many as four thousand horsemen, when he took
                    possession of a town named Salera, about fifteen miles from the Roman camp. When
                    Scipio was told of this, he said, <quote> What! cavalry lodging in houses during

                    dilatory they were in their operations, the more active he ought to be, he sent
                    Masinissa forward with the cavalry, directing him to ride up to the gates of the
                    enemy and draw them out to battle; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> and when
                    their whole force had poured out and pressed upon him with such <pb n="1277"
                        xml:id="p.1277"/> impetuosity in the contest that they could not easily be
                    withstood, then to retire by degrees, and he would himself come up and join in
                    the battle in time. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Waiting only till he
                    thought he had allowed sufficient time for the advanced party to draw out the
                    enemy, he followed with the Roman cavalry, proceeding without being seen, as he
                    was covered by some rising grounds, which lay very conveniently between him and
                    the enemy, round the windings of the road. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Masinissa, according to the plan laid down, at one time as if menacing the
                    enemy, at another as if he had been afraid, either rode up to the gates, or else
                    by retiring when his counterfeited fears had inspired them with courage, tempted
                    them to pursue him with inconsiderate ardour. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    They had not as yet all gone out, and the general was wearying himself with
                    various occupations, compelling some who were oppressed with sleep and wine to
                    take arms and bridle their horses, and preventing others from running out at all
                    the gates in scattered parties and in disorder, without keeping their ranks or
                    following their standards. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> At first, those
                    who incautiously rushed out were overpowered by Masinissa; but then a greater
                    number pouring out of the gate at once in a dense body, placed the contest on an
                    equal footing; <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> and at last the whole of their
                    cavalry coming up and joining in the battle, they could now no longer be
                    withstood. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Masinissa, however, did not
                    receive their charge in hasty flight, but retired slowly, until he drew them to
                    the rising grounds which covered the Roman cavalry. The Roman cavalry then
                    rising up, their own strength unimpaired and their horses fresh, spread
                    themselves round Hanno and the Africans, fatigued 'with the fight and the

                    a strong garrison at Saleca, he set out with the rest of his army; and having
                    not only devastated the country wherever he marched, but taken some cities and
                    towns, thus spreading the terrors of war far and wide, he returned to his camp
                    on the seventh day after he set out, bringing with him an immense quantity of
                    men and cattle, and booty of every description, and sent away his ships again
                    loaded with the spoils of the enemy. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Then
                    giving up all expeditions of a minor kind, and predatory excursions, he directed

                    employed a number of artificers skilled in such works. The people of Utica, thus
                    beset on all sides with so formidable a force, placed all their hopes in the
                    Carthaginians, and the Carthaginians in the chance there was that Hasdrubal
                    could induce Syphax to take arms. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But all
                    their movements were made too slowly for the anxiety felt by those who were in

                    by levies, conducted with the utmost diligence, made up as many as thirty
                    thousand infantry and three thousand horse, yet dared not move nearer to the
                    enemy before the arrival of Syphax. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Syphax
                    came with fifty thousand foot and ten thousand horse, and, immediately <pb

                    far from Utica and the Roman works. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Their
                    arrival produced, however, this effect, that Scipio, who had been besieging
                    Utica for forty days, during which he had tried every expedient without effect,
                    left the place without accomplishing his object; <milestone n="13"

                    camp for the winter upon a promontory, which being attached to the continent by

                    the surrounding country by plunder, and the provisions imported from Italy and
                    Sicily, Cneius Octavius, propraetor, brought a vast quantity out of Sardinia
                    from Tiberius Claudius the praetor, whose province Sardinia was; and not only
                    were the granaries already built filled, but new ones were erected. <milestone

                    to consult with the praetor in order to ascertain if any could be procured and
                    sent out of that province. This business was also diligently attended to. One

                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> During the summer in which these
                    operations were carried on in Africa, Publius Sempronius, the consul, who had
                    the province of Bruttium, fought an irregular kind of battle with Hannibal in
                    the Crotonian territory while actually on march; <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                    /> they fought with their troops drawn more in order of march than of battle.
                    The Romans were driven back, and as many as twelve hundred of the army of the
                    consul were slain in this affair, which was more a tumult than a battle.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They returned in confusion to their camp.
                    The enemy, however, dared not assault it. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But,
                    during the silence of the following night, the consul marched away, and having
                    sent a messenger before him to Publius Licinius, the proconsul, to bring up his
                    legions, united his forces with his. Thus two generals and two armies returned
                    to Hannibal. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Nor did either party delay to
                    fight, as the forces of the consul were <pb n="1280" xml:id="p.1280"/> doubled,
                    and the Carthaginian was inspirited by recent victory. Sempronius led his
                    legions into the front line; those of Licinius were placed in reserve.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The consul, in the beginning of the
                    battle, vowed a temple to Fortuna Primigenia if he routed the enemy that day,
                    and he obtained the object of that vow. The Carthaginians were routed and put to
                    flight; above four thousand armed men were slain, a little under three hundred
                    taken alive, with forty horses and eleven military standards. <milestone n="9"

                    away to Croton. At the same time, in another part of Italy, Etruria, almost the
                    whole of which had espoused the interest of Mago, and had <milestone n="10??"

                    means, was kept in subjection by the consul Marcus Cornelius, not so much by the
                    force of his arms as the terror of his judicial proceedings. <milestone n="11"

                    the decree of the senate, he had shown the utmost impartiality; and many of the
                    Tuscan nobles, who had either themselves gone, or had sent others to Mago
                    respecting the revolt of their states, at first standing their trials, were
                    condemned; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> but afterwards others, who, from a
                    consciousness of guilt, had gone into voluntary exile, were condemned in their
                    absence, and by thus withdrawing left their effects only, which were liable to
                    confiscation, as a pledge for their punishment. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> While the consuls were thus engaged in
                    different quarters, in the mean time, at Rome, the censors, Marcus Livius and
                    Caius Claudius, called over the senate roll. Quintus Fabius was again chosen
                    chief of the senate; seven were stigmatized, of whom there was not one who had
                    sat in the curule chair. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They inquired into
                    the business relating to the repair of public edifices with diligence and the
                    most scrupulous exactness. They set by contract the making of a road out of the
                    ox market to the temple of Venus, with public seats on each side of it, and a
                    temple to be built in the palatium for the great mother. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> They established also a new tax out of the price of salt.
                    Salt, both at Rome, and throughout all Italy, was sold at the sixth part of an
                        <hi rend="italics">as.</hi> They contracted for the supply of it at Rome at
                    the same price, at a higher price in the country towns and markets, and at
                    different prices in different places. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They
                    felt well convinced that this tax was invented by one of the censors, out of
                    resentment to the people, <pb n="1281" xml:id="p.1281"/> because he had formerly
                    been condemned by an unjust sentence, and that in fixing the price of salt,
                    those tribes had been most burdened by whose means he had been condemned.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Hence Livius derived the surname of
                    Salinator. The closing of the lustrum was later than usual, because the censors
                    sent persons through the provinces, that <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> a
                    report might be made of the number of Roman citizens in each of the armies.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Including these, the number of persons
                    returned in the census was two hundred and fourteen thousand. Caius Claudius
                    Nero closed the lustrum. They then received a census of the twelve colonies,
                    which had never been done before, the censors of the colonies themselves
                    presenting it, in order that there might appear registers among the public
                    records, stating the extent of their resources, both in respect of furnishing
                    soldiers and money. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The review of the knights
                    then began to be made, and it happened that both the censors had a horse at the
                    public expense. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When they came to the Pollian
                    tribe, in which was the name of Marcus Livius, and the herald hesitated to cite
                    the censor himself, Nero said, <quote>Cite Marcus Livius;</quote> and whether it
                    was that he was actuated by the remains of an old enmity, or that he felt a
                    ridiculous pride in this ill-timed display of severity, he ordered Marcus Livius
                    to sell his horse, because he had been condemned by the sentence of the people.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> In like manner, when they came to the
                    Narnian tribe, and the name of his colleague, Marcus Livius ordered Caius
                    Claudius to sell his horse, for two reasons; one, because he had given false
                    evidence against him; the other, because he had not been sincere in his
                    reconciliation with him. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Thus a disgraceful
                    contest arose, in which each endeavoured to asperse the character of the other,
                    though not without detriment to his own. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> On
                    the expiration of the office, when Caius Claudius had taken the oath respecting
                    the observance of the laws, and had gone up into the treasury, he gave the name
                    of his colleague among the names of those whom he left disfranchised. <milestone
                        n="13" unit="section"/> Afterwards, Marcus Livius came into the treasury,
                    and excepting only the Maecian tribe, which had neither condemned him nor made
                    him consul or censor when condemned, left all the Roman people, four and thirty
                    tribes, disfranchised, because they had both condemned him when innocent, and
                    when condemned had made him consul and censor; <milestone n="14" unit="section"
                    /> and therefore could not deny <pb n="1282" xml:id="p.1282"/> that they had
                    been guilty of a crime, either once in his condemnation, or twice at the
                    elections. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> He said that the disfranchisement
                    of Caius Claudius would be included in that of the thirty-four tribes, but that
                    if he were in possession of a precedent for leaving the same person
                    disfranchised twice, he would have left his name particularly among the
                    disfranchised. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> This contest between censors,
                    endeavouring to brand each other, was highly improper, while the correction
                    applied to the inconstancy of the people was suitable to the office of a censor,
                    and worthy of the strict discipline of the times. <milestone n="17"
                        unit="section"/> As the censors were labouring under odium, Cneius Babius,
                    tribune of the people, thinking this a favourable opportunity of advancing
                    himself at their expense, summoned them both to trial before the people. This
                    proceeding was quashed by the unanimous voice of the senate, lest in future the
                    office of censor should become subject to the caprice of the people. </p>

                    As the time for the elections was now drawing near, it was thought best that
                    Cornelius should be summoned to Rome from Etruria, as there was no war there.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He elected, as consuls, Cneius Servilius
                    Caepio and Caius Servilius Geminus. The election of praetors was then held.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The persons elected were, Publius
                    Cornelius Lentulus, Publius Quinctilius Varus, Publius Aelius Paetus, and
                    Publius Villius Tappulus. The last two were plebeian aediles when elected
                    praetors. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The elections finished, the consul
                    returned into Etruria to his army. The priests who died this year, and those who
                    were put in their places, were Tiberius Veturius Philo, flamen of Mars, elected
                    and <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> inaugurated in the room of Marcus
                    Aemilius Regillus, who died the year before: <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    in the room of Marcus Pomponius Matho, augur and decemvir, were elected Marcus
                    Aurelius Cotta, decemvir, and Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, augur, being then a
                    very young man; an instance of very rare occurrence in the disposal of the
                    priests' offices in those times. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Golden
                    four-horsed chariots were placed this year in the Capitol by the curule aediles,
                    Caius Livius and Marcus Servilius Geminus. The Roman games were repeated during
                    two days. During two days also the plebeian games were repeated by the aediles,
                    Publius Aelius and Publius Villius. There was likewise a feast of Jupiter on
