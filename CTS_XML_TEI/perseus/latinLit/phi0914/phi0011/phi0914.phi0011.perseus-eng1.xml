                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Whether I am likely to accomplish anything
                    worthy of the labour, if I record the achievements of the Roman people from the
                    foundation of the city, I do not really know, nor if I knew would I dare to
                    avouch it; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> perceiving as I do that the theme
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Some scholars take <hi

                        <hi rend="italics">sc.</hi> of expressing confidence in one's ability.
                    </note> is not only old but hackneyed, through the constant succession of new
                    historians, who believe either that in their facts they can produce more
                    authentic information, or that in their style they will prove better than the
                    rude attempts of the ancients. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Yet, however
                    this shall be, it will be a satisfaction to have done myself as much as lies in
                    me to commemorate the deeds of the foremost people of the world; and if in so
                    vast a company of writers my own reputation should be obscure, my consolation
                    would be the fame and greatness of those whose renown will throw mine into the
                    shade. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Moreover, my subject involves infinite
                    labour, seeing that it must be traced back <pb n="p.5"/> above seven hundred
                    years, and that proceeding from slender beginnings it has so increased as now to
                    be burdened by its own magnitude; and at the same time I doubt not that to most
                    readers the earliest origins and the period immediately succeeding them will
                    give little pleasure, for they will be in haste to reach these modern times, in
                    which the might of a people which has long been very powerful is working its own
                    undoing. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> I myself, on the contrary, shall seek
                    in this an additional reward for my toil, that I may avert my gaze from the
                    troubles which our age has been witnessing for so many years, so long at least
                    as I am absorbed in the recollection of the brave <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> days of old, free from every care which, even if it could
                    not divert the historian's mind from the truth, might nevertheless cause it
                    anxiety. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Livy refers to the
                        animosities inevitably aroused by writers who dealt with such thorny
                        subjects as the civil wars, during the lifetime of many who had taken part
                        in them. </note>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Such traditions as belong to the time before
                    the city was founded, or rather was presently to be founded, and are rather
                    adorned with poetic legends than based upon trustworthy historical proofs, I
                    purpose neither to affirm nor to refute. It is the privilege of antiquity to
                    mingle divine things with human, and so to add dignity to the beginnings of
                    cities; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> and if any people ought to be allowed
                    to consecrate their origins and refer them to a divine source, so great is the
                    military glory of the Roman People that when they profess that their Father and
                    the Father of their Founder was none other than Mars, the nations of the earth
                    may well submit to this also with as good a grace as they submit to Rome's
                    dominion. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But to such legends as these,
                    however they shall be regarded and judged, I shall, for my own part, attach no
                    great importance. Here are the questions to which I would have every reader <pb
                        n="p.7"/> give his close attention —what life and morals were like; through
                    what men and by what policies, in peace and in war, empire was established and
                    enlarged; then let him note how, with the gradual relaxation of discipline,
                    morals first gave way, as it were, then sank lower and lower, and finally began
                    the downward plunge <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">The metaphor is
                        from a decaying building.</note> which has brought us to the present time,
                    when we can endure neither our vices nor their cure. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> What chiefly makes the study of history
                    wholesome and profitable is this, that you behold the lessons of every kind of
                    experience set forth as on a conspicuous monument; <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified"> The monument Livy means is the body of a nation's
                        achievements ( <hi rend="italics">cf. res</hi> in § 1), the
                            <quote>history</quote> of a nation, in that objective sense of the word.
                        This he likens to a monument of stone on which men's deeds are recorded.
                    </note> from these you may choose for yourself and for your own state what to
                    imitate, from these mark for avoidance what is shameful in the conception and
                    shameful in the result. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> For the rest, either
                    love of the task I have set myself deceives me, or no state was ever greater,
                    none more righteous or richer in good examples, none ever was where avarice and
                    luxury came into the social order so late, or where humble means and thrift were
                    so highly esteemed and so long held in honour. <milestone n="12" unit="section"
                    /> For true it is that the less men's wealth was, the less was their greed. Of
                    late, riches have brought in avarice, and excessive pleasures the longing to
                    carry wantonness and licence to the point of ruin for oneself and of universal
                    destruction. </p>
                <p> But complaints are sure to be disagreeable, even when they shall perhaps be
                    necessary; let the beginning, at all events, of so great an enterprise have
                    none. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> With good omens rather would we begin,
                    and, if historians had the same custom which poets have, <pb n="p.9"/> with
                    prayers and entreaties to the gods and goddesses, that they might grant us to
                    bring to a successful issue the great task we have undertaken. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> First of all, then, it is generally agreed
                    that when Troy was taken vengeance was wreaked upon the other Trojans, but that
                    two, Aeneas and Antenor, were spared all the penalties of war by the Achivi,
                    owing to long-standing claims of hospitality, and because they had always
                    advocated peace and the giving back of Helen. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    They then experienced various vicissitudes. Antenor, with a company of Eneti who
                    had been expelled from Paphlagonia in a revolution and were looking for a home
                    and a leader —for they had lost their king, Pylaemenes, at Troy <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified"> See the <hi rend="italics">Iliad,</hi>
                        v. 576. </note> —came to the inmost bay of the Adriatic. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> There, driving out the Euganei, who dwelt between the sea
                    and the Alps, the Eneti and Trojans took possession of those lands. And in fact
                    the place where they first landed is called Troy, and the district is therefore
                    known as Trojan, while the people as a whole are called the Veneti. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> Aeneas, driven from home by a similar misfortune, but
                    guided by fate to undertakings of greater consequence, came first to Macedonia;
                    thence was carried, in his quest of a place of settlement, to Sicily; and from
                    Sicily laid his course towards the land of Laurentum. This place too is called
                    Troy. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Landing there, the Trojans, as men who,
                    after their all but immeasurable wanderings, had nothing left but their swords
                    and ships, were driving booty from the fields, when King Latinus and the
                    Aborigines, who then occupied that country, rushed down from their city and
                    their fields to repel with arms the violence of the invaders. From this point
                    the tradition follows two <pb n="p.11"/> lines. Some say that Latinus, having
                    been defeated in the battle, made a peace with Aeneas, and later an alliance of
                    marriage. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> This, in a nutshell, is the
                        form of the legend on which Virgil based Books vii.-xii. of the <hi
                            rend="italics">Aeneid.</hi>
                    </note>
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Others maintain that when the opposing lines
                    had been drawn up, Latinus did not wait for the charge to sound, but advanced
                    amidst his chieftains and summoned the captain of the strangers to a parley.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He then inquired what men they were,
                    whence they had come, what mishap had caused them to leave their home, and what
                    they sought in landing on the coast of Laurentum. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> He was told that the people were Trojans and their leader
                    Aeneas, son of Anchises and Venus; that their city had been burnt, and that,
                    driven from home, they were looking for a dwelling-place and a site where they
                    might build a city. Filled with wonder at the renown of the race and the hero,
                    and at his spirit, prepared alike for war or peace, he gave him his right hand
                    in solemn pledge of lasting friendship. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                    commanders then made a treaty, and the armies saluted each other. Aeneas became
                    a guest in the house of Latinus; there the latter, in the presence of his
                    household gods, added a domestic treaty to the public one, by giving his
                    daughter in marriage to Aeneas. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This event
                    removed any doubt in the minds of the Trojans that they had brought their
                    wanderings to an end at last in a permanent and settled habitation. <milestone
                        n="11" unit="section"/> They founded a town, which Aeneas named Lavinium,
                    after his wife. In a short time, moreover, there was a male scion of the new
                    marriage, to whom his parents gave the name of Ascanius. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> War was then made upon Trojans and Aborigines
                    alike. Turnus was king of the Rutulians, and to him Lavinia had been betrothed
                    before the coming <pb n="p.13"/> of Aeneas. Indignant that a stranger should be
                    preferred before him, he attacked, at the same time, both Aeneas and Latinus.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Neither army came off rejoicing from that
                    battle. The Rutulians were beaten: the victorious Aborigines and Trojans lost
                    their leader Latinus. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Then Turnus and the
                    Rutulians, discouraged at their situation, fled for succour to the opulent and
                    powerful Etruscans and their king Mezentius, who held sway in Caere, at that
                    time an important town. Mezentius had been, from the very beginning, far from
                    pleased at the birth of the new city; he now felt that the Trojan state was
                    growing much more rapidly than was altogether safe for its neighbours, and
                    readily united his forces with those of the Rutulians. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Aeneas, that he might win the goodwill of the Aborigines to
                    confront so formidable an array, and that all might possess not only the same
                    rights but also the same name, called both nations Latins; <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified"> Virgil makes Jupiter grant, as a favour to Juno, that
                        the Trojan name shall be sunk in the Latin ( <hi rend="italics">Aen.</hi>
                        xii. 835). </note> and from that time on the Aborigines were no less ready
                    and faithful than the Trojans in the service of King Aeneas. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Accordingly, trusting to this friendly spirit of the two
                    peoples, which were growing each day more united, and, despite the power of
                    Etruria, which had filled with the glory of her name not only the lands but the
                    sea as well, along the whole extent of Italy from the Alps to the Sicilian
                    Strait, Aeneas declined to defend himself behind his walls, as he might have
                    done, but led out his troops to battle. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The
                    fight which ensued was a victory for the Latins: for Aeneas it was, besides, the
                    last of his mortal labours. He lies buried, whether it is fitting and right <pb
                        n="p.15"/> to term him god or man, on the banks of the river Numicus; men,
                    however, call him Jupiter Indiges. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">Indiges</hi> means <quote>of or belonging to a certain

                    authority; yet the authority was kept for him, unimpaired, until he arrived at
                    manhood. Meanwhile, under a woman's regency, the Latin State and the kingdom of
                    his father and his grandfather stood unshaken —so strong was Lavinia's character
                    —until the boy could claim it. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> I shall not
                    discuss the question —for who could affirm for certain so ancient a matter?
                    —whether this boy was Ascanius, or an elder brother, born by Creusa while Ilium
                    yet stood, who accompanied his father when he fled from the city, being the same
                    whom the Julian family call lulus and claim as the author of their name.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This Ascanius, no matter where born, or of
                    what mother —it is agreed in any case that he was Aeneas' son —left Lavinium,
                    when its population came to be too large, for it was already a flourishing and
                    wealthy city for those days, to his mother, or stepmother, and founded a new
                    city himself below the Alban Mount. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This was
                    known from its position, as it lay stretched out along the ridge, by the name of
                    Alba Longa. From the settlement of Lavinium to the planting of the colony at
                    Alba Longa was an interval of some thirty years. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
                    /> Yet the nation had grown so powerful, in consequence especially of the defeat
                    of the Etruscans, that even when Aeneas died, and even when a woman became its
                    regent and a boy began his apprenticeship as king, neither Mezentius and his
                    Etruscans nor any other neighbours dared to attack them. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Peace had been agreed to on these terms, that the River
                    Albula, which men now call the Tiber, should be the boundary <pb n="p.17"/>
                    between the Etruscans and the Latins. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Next
                    Silvius reigned, son of Ascanius, born, as it chanced, in the forest. He begat
                    Aeneas Silvius, and he Latinus Silvius. By him several colonies were planted,
                    and called the Ancient Latins. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Thereafter the
                    cognomen Silvius was retained by all who ruled at Alba. From Latinus came Alba,
                    from Alba Atys, from Atys Capys, from Capys Capetus, from Capetus Tiberinus.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This last king was drowned in crossing the
                    River Albula, and gave the stream the name which has been current with later
                    generations. Then Agrippa, son of Tiberinus, reigned, and after Agrippa Romulus
                    Silvius was king, having received the power from his father. Upon the death of
                    Romulus by lightning, the kingship passed from him to Aventinus. This king was
                    buried on that hill, which is now a part of the City of Rome, and gave his name
                    to the hill. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Proca ruled next. He begat
                    Numitor and Amulius; to Numitor, the elder, he bequeathed the ancient realm of
                    the Silvian family. Yet violence proved more potent than a father's wishes or
                    respect for seniority. Amulius drove out his brother and ruled in his stead.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Adding crime to crime, he destroyed
                    Numitor's male issue; and Rhea Silvia, his brother's daughter, he appointed a
                    Vestal under pretence of honouring, her, and by consigning her to perpetual
                    virginity, deprived her of the hope of children. </p>

                    upon the founding of this great City, and the beginning of the mightiest of
                    empires, next after that of Heaven. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The Vestal
                    was ravished, and having given birth to twin sons, named Mars as the father of
                    her doubtful offspring, whether actually so believing, or because it seemed less

                        unit="section"/> But neither gods nor men protected the mother herself or
                    her babes from the king's cruelty; the priestess he ordered to be manacled and
                    cast into prison, the children to be committed to the river. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> It happened by singular good fortune that the Tiber having
                    spread beyond its banks into stagnant pools afforded nowhere any access to the
                    regular channel of the river, and the men who brought the twins were led to hope
                    that being infants they might be drowned, no matter how sluggish the stream.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> So they made shift to discharge the king's
                    command, by exposing the babes at the nearest point of the overflow, where the

                    The story persists that when the floating basket in which the children had been
                    exposed was left high and dry by the receding water, a she-wolf, coming down out
                    of the surrounding hills to slake her thirst, turned her steps towards the cry
                    of the infants, and with her teats gave them suck so gently, that the keeper of
                    the royal flock found her licking them with her tongue. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> Tradition assigns to this man the name of Faustulus, and
                    adds that he carried the twins to his hut and gave them to his wife Larentia to
                    rear. Some think that Larentia, having been free with her favours, had got the
                    name of <quote>she-wolf</quote> among the shepherds, and that this gave rise to
                    this marvellous story. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The word <hi

                    hill was named Pallantium, from Pallanteum, an Arcadian city, and then Palatium.

                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> There Evander, an Arcadian of that stock, who
                    had held the place many ages before the time of which I am writing, is said to
                    have established the yearly rite, derived from Arcadia, that youths should run
                    naked about in playful sport, doing honour to Lycaean Pan, whom the Romans
                    afterwards called Inuus. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When the young men
                    were occupied in this celebration, the rite being generally known, some robbers
                    who had been angered by the loss of their plunder laid an ambush for them, and
                    although Romulus successfully defended himself, captured Remus and delivered up
                    their prisoner to King Amulius, even lodging a complaint against him. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> The main charge was that the brothers made raids on
                    the lands of Numitor, and pillaged them, with a band of young fellows which they
                    had got together, like an invading enemy. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> So
                    Remus was given up to Numitor to be punished. From the very beginning Faustulus
                    had entertained the suspicion that they were children of the royal blood that he
                    was bringing up in his house; for he was aware both that infants had been
                    exposed by order of the king, and that the time when he had himself taken up the
                    children exactly coincided with that event. But he had been unwilling that the
                        <pb n="p.23"/> matter should be disclosed prematurely, until opportunity
                    offered or necessity compelled. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Necessity came
                    first; accordingly, driven by fear, he revealed the facts to Romulus. It chanced
                    that Numitor too, having Remus in custody, and hearing that the brothers were
                    twins, had been reminded, upon considering their age and their far from servile
                    nature, of his grandsons. The inquiries he made led him to the same conclusion,
                    so that he was almost ready to acknowledge Remus. Thus on every hand the toils
                    were woven about the king. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Romulus did not
                    assemble his company of youths —for he was not equal to open violence —but
                    commanded his shepherds to come to the palace at an appointed time, some by one
                    way, some by another, and so made his attack upon the king; while from the house
                    of Numitor came Remus, with another party which he had got together, to help his
                    brother. So Romulus slew the king. <milestone n="6" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> At the beginning of the fray Numitor exclaimed
                    that an enemy had invaded the city and attacked the palace, and drew off the
                    active men of the place to serve as an armed garrison for the defence of the
                    citadel; and when he saw the young men approaching, after they had dispatched
                    the king, to congratulate him, he at once summoned a council, and laid before it
                    his brother's crimes against himself, the parentage of his grandsons, and how
                    they had been born, reared, and recognised. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He
                    then announced the tyrant's death, and declared himself to be responsible for
                    it. The brothers advanced with their band through the midst of the crowd, and
                    hailed their grandfather king, whereupon such a shout of assent arose from the
                    entire throng as confirmed the new monarch's title and authority. </p>

                <p> The Alban state being thus made over to Numitor, Romulus and Remus were seized
                    with the desire to found a city in the region where they had been exposed and
                    brought up. And in fact the population of Albans and Latins was too large;
                    besides, there were the shepherds. All together, their numbers might easily lead
                    men to hope that Alba would be small, and Lavinium small, compared with the city
                    which they should build. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> These considerations
                    were interrupted by the curse of their grandsires, the greed of kingly power,
                    and by a shameful quarrel which grew out of it, upon an occasion innocent
                    enough. Since the brothers were twins, and respect for their age could not
                    determine between them, it was agreed that the gods who had those places in
                    their protection should choose by augury who should give the new city its name,
                    who should govern it when built. Romulus took the Palatine for his augural
                    quarter, Remus the Aventine. <milestone n="7" unit="chapter"/>

                    already reported when twice that number appeared to Romulus. Thereupon each was
                    saluted king by his own followers, the one party laying claim to the honour from
                    priority, the other from the number of the birds. <milestone n="2"

                    leading to bloodshed, Remus was struck down in the affray. The commoner story is
                    that Remus leaped over the new walls in mockery of his brother, whereupon
                    Romulus in great anger slew him, and in menacing wise added these words withal, <quote>

                    was driving off his wondrously beautiful cattle, when, close to the river Tiber,
                    where he had swum across it with the herd before him, he found a green spot,
                    where he could let the cattle rest and refresh themselves with the abundant
                    grass; and being tired from his journey he lay down himself. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> When he had there fallen into a deep sleep, for he was
                    heavy with food and wine, a shepherd by the name of Cacus, who dwelt hard by and
                    was insolent by reason of his strength, was struck with the beauty of the
                    animals, and wished to drive them off as plunder. But if he had driven the herd
                    into his cave, their tracks would have been enough to guide their owner to the
                    place in his search; he therefore chose out those of the cattle that were most
                    remarkable for their beauty, and turning them the other way, dragged them into
                    the cave by their tails. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> At daybreak Hercules
                    awoke. Glancing over the herd, and perceiving that a part of their number was
                    lacking, he proceeded to the nearest cave, in case there might be foot-prints
                    leading into it. When he saw that they were all turned outward and yet did not
                    lead to any other place, he was confused and bewildered, and made ready to drive
                    his herd away from that uncanny spot. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As the
                    cattle were being driven off, some of them lowed, as usually happens, missing
                    those which had been left behind. They were answered with a low by the cattle
                    shut up in the cave, and this made Hercules turn back. When he came towards the
                        <pb n="p.29"/> cave, Cacus would have prevented his approach with <note

                    their stock and their blood with the Romans, who were as truly men as they were.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Nowhere did the embassy obtain a friendly
                    hearing. In fact men spurned, at the same time that they feared, both for
                    themselves and their descendants, that great power which was then growing up in
                    their midst; and the envoys were frequently asked, on being dismissed, if they
                    had opened a sanctuary for women as well as for men, for in that way only would
                    they obtain suitable wives. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This was a bitter
                    insult to the young Romans, and the matter seemed certain to end in violence.
                    Expressly to afford a fitting time and place for this, Romulus, concealing his
                    resentment, made ready solemn games in honour of the equestrian Neptune, which

                    In most cases these were taken by the men in whose path they chanced to be.
                    Some, of exceptional beauty, had been marked out for the chief senators, and
                    were carried off to their houses by plebeians to whom the office had been

                    shouting that no one should touch her, for they were taking her to Thalassius,
                    and this was the origin of the wedding-cry. <note anchored="true"

                    They were therefore routed at the first charge and shout, and their town was
                    taken. As Romulus was exulting in his double victory, his wife Hersilia, beset
                    with entreaties by the captive women, begged him to forgive their parents and
                    receive them into the state; which would, in that case, gain in strength by
                    harmony. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He readily granted her request. He
                    then set out to meet the Crustuminians, who were marching to attack him. They
                    offered even less resistance than their allies had done, for their ardour had
                    been quenched by the defeats of the others. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Colonies were sent out to both places, though most of the colonists preferred to

                <p> The last to attack Rome were the Sabines, and this war was by far the gravest of

                    even added deception. Spurius Tarpeius commanded the Roman citadel. This man's
                    maiden daughter was bribed with gold by Tatius to admit armed men into the
                    fortress: she happened at that time to have gone outside the walls to fetch
                    water for a sacrifice. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> As a vestal,

                    traitor. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> There is also a legend that because
                    most of the Sabines wore heavy golden <pb n="p.45"/> bracelets on their left

                    had on their left arms, and that they had therefore heaped their shields upon

                    in virtue of the compact that they should give her what they wore on their arms,
                    she flatly demanded their shields and, her treachery being perceived, forfeited

                    attends a divided rule, or because he thought Tatius had been not unjustly
                    slain. He therefore declined to go to war; but yet, in order that he might atone
                    for the insults to the envoys and the murder of the king, he caused the covenant

                    into the farmers, whose sudden stampede from the fields into the City brought
                    the first tidings of war. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Romulus led forth
                    his army on the instant, for delay was impossible with the enemy so near, and
                    pitched his camp a mile from Fidenae. Leaving there a small guard, he marched

                    galloped almost up to the gates, he accomplished his purpose of drawing out the
                    enemy. For the flight, too, which had next to be feigned, the cavalry engagement
                    afforded a favourable pretext. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And when not
                    only the cavalry began to waver, as if undecided whether to fight or run, but
                    the infantry also fell back, the city gates were quickly thronged by the enemy,
                    who poured out and hurled themselves against the Roman line, and in the ardour

                    by so many dangers the men of Fidenae scarcely afforded time for Romulus and

                    to Veii. The Romans, on the contrary, not finding their enemy in the fields,

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The senators meanwhile were engaged in a
                    struggle for the coveted kingship. So far it had not come to a question of any
                    one person, for nobody stood out with special prominence in the new nation;
                    instead, a strife of factions was waging between the two stocks. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> Those of Sabine origin, having had no king on their
                    side since the death of Tatius, feared that despite their equal rights they
                    might lose their hold upon the sovereign power, and hence desired that the king
                    should be chosen from their own body. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The
                    original Romans spurned the idea of an alien king. Various, however, as were
                    men's inclinations, to be ruled by a king was their universal wish, for they had
                    not yet tasted the sweetness of liberty. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Then
                    the senators became alarmed, lest the state wanting a ruler and the army a
                    leader, and many neighbouring states being disaffected, some violence might be
                    offered from without. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> All therefore were
                    agreed that there should be some head, but nobody could make up his mind to
                    yield to his fellow. And so the hundred senators shared the power among
                    themselves, establishing ten decuries and appointing one man for each decury to
                    preside over the administration. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Ten men
                    exercised authority; only one had its insignia and lictors. Five days was the
                    period of his power, which passed in rotation to all; and for a year the
                    monarchy lapsed. This interval was called, as it was, an interregnum, a name
                    which even yet obtains. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Murmurs then arose
                    among the plebs that their servitude had been multiplied; that a hundred masters
                    had been given them instead of <pb n="p.63"/> one. No longer, it seemed, would
                    they endure <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        716</note> anything short of a king, and a king, too, of their own choosing.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Perceiving that such ideas were in the
                    wind, the senators thought it would be well to proffer spontaneously a thing
                    which they were on the verge of losing, and obtained the favour of the people by
                    granting them supreme power on such terms as to part with no greater prerogative
                    than they retained. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> For they decreed that when
                    the people should have named a king, their act should only be valid in case the
                    senators ratified it. Even now, in voting for laws and magistrates, the same
                    right is exercised, but is robbed of its significance; before the people can
                    begin to vote, and when the result of the election is undetermined, the Fathers
                    ratify it. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> On the present occasion the
                    interrex summoned the assembly and spoke as follows: <quote> May prosperity,

                    enjoyed in those days by Numa Pompilius. Cures, a town of the Sabines, was his

                    law, divine and human. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The teacher to whom he
                    owed his learning was not, as men say, in default of another name, the Samian
                    Pythagoras; for it is well established that Servius Tullius was king at Rome,
                    more than a hundred years after this <pb n="p.65"/> time, when Pythagoras

                    contemporary, how could his fame have reached the Sabines? Again, in what common
                    language could he have induced anyone to seek instruction of him? Or under whose
                    protection could a solitary man have made his way through so many nations
                    differing in speech and customs? <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> It was Numa's
                    native disposition, then, as I incline to believe, that tempered his soul with
                    noble qualities, and his training was not in foreign studies, but in the stern
                    and austere discipline of the ancient Sabines, a race incorruptible as any race
                    of the olden time. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When Numa's name had been
                    proposed, the Roman senators perceived that the Sabines would gain the
                    ascendancy if a king were to be chosen from that nation; yet nobody ventured to
                    urge his own claims in preference to those of such a man, nor the claim of any
                    other of his faction, nor those, in short, of any of the senators or citizens.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> And so they unanimously voted to offer the
                    sovereignty to Numa Pompilius. Being summoned to Rome he commanded that, just as
                    Romulus had obeyed the augural omens in building his city and assuming regal
                    power, so too in his own case the gods should be consulted. Accordingly an augur
                    (who thereafter, as a mark of honour, was made a priest of the state in
                    permanent charge of that function) conducted him to the citadel and caused him
                    to sit down on a stone, facing the south. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                    augur seated himself on Numa's left, having his head covered, and holding his in

                    the country beyond, he prayed to the gods, and marked off the heavens by a line
                    from east to west, designating as ' right' the regions to the south, as 'left'
                    those to the north, and fixing in his mind a landmark opposite to him and as far

                    warlike people should be softened by the disuse of arms, and built the temple of
                    Janus at the bottom of the Argiletum, as an index of peace and war, that when
                    open it might signify that the nation was in arms, when closed that all the

                    distinguished himself in the battle with the Sabines at the foot of the citadel,
                    was declared king by the people, and the senate confirmed their choice.

                    but was actually more warlike than Romulus had been. Besides his youth and
                    strength, the glory of his grandfather was also an incentive to him. So,
                    thinking that the nation was growing decrepit from inaction, he everywhere

                    demand restitution. Tullus had commanded his envoys to do nothing else till they
                    had carried out his orders; he felt convinced that the Albans would refuse his
                    demands, in which case he could declare war with a good conscience. The Alban
                    representatives proceeded rather laxly. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Received by Tullus with gracious and kindly hospitality, they attended in a

                    had been beforehand with them in seeking redress, and, being denied it by the
                    Alban leader, had made a declaration of war, to take effect in thirty days.

                    their mission. They, knowing nothing of what had happened, at first spent some
                    time in apologies. They said they should be sorry to utter anything which might
                    give offence to Tullus, but that they were compelled to do so by their orders;
                    they had come to seek restitution; if it should be denied them they were
                    commanded to declare war. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> To this Tullus
                    replied: <quote> Tell your king the Roman king calls the gods to witness which

                    made the struggle less deplorable, for no battle was fought, and when only the
                    buildings of one of the cities had been destroyed, the two peoples were fused
                    into one. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The Albans were first in the field,
                    and with a great army invaded the Roman territory. Their camp they pitched not
                    more than five miles from the City, and surrounded it with a trench. (This was
                    known for some centuries as the Cluilian Trench, from the name of the general,
                    until in the course of time both trench and name disappeared.) <milestone n="4"

                    chose as dictator Mettius Fufetius. Meantime Tullus, emboldened principally by
                    the death of the king, and asserting that Heaven's great powers would take
                    vengeance upon all of the Alban name, beginning with their king himself, for
                    their unscrupulous war, made a night march past the enemy's camp and led his
                    army into the country of the Albans. This move drew Mettius out from his
                    fortifications. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Leading his troops the
                    shortest way towards the enemy, he sent an envoy on ahead to say to Tullus that
                    before they fought it was well that they should confer together; if Tullus would
                    meet him he was confident he had that to say which would be of no less moment to
                    the Roman state than to the Alban. Without rejecting this suggestion, Tullus
                    nevertheless drew up his men in line of battle, in case the proposals should
                    prove impracticable. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> On the other side the

                        to prosecute that war. But this is the point, Tullus, which I wish to

                        doubtful hazard of dominion or enslavement, let us adopt some plan by which
                        we may decide the question which nation shall rule the other, without a

                    battle. The two armies were drawn up, each in front of its own camp, no longer
                    in any immediate danger, but their concern as great as ever; and no wonder,

                    charge, breathing the courage of great armies. Neither side thought of its own

                    forward their country must experience the fortune they should themselves create.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The instant they encountered, there was a

                    already slain him, and was hastening, flushed with victory, to meet his second
                    antagonist. Then with a cheer, such as is often drawn from partisans by a sudden
                    turn in a contest, the Romans encouraged their champion, and he pressed on to
                    end the battle. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> And so, before the third

                    surviving on each side, but in hope and vigour they were far from equal. The
                    one, unscathed and elated by his double victory, was eager for a third
                    encounter. The other dragged himself along, faint from his wound and exhausted
                    with running; he thought how his brothers had been slaughtered before him, and
                    was a beaten man when he faced his triumphant foe. What followed was no combat.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The Roman cried exultantly, <quote> Two

                    thanksgivings, and their joy was all the greater that they had come near

                    their designs, were induced to commence hostilities by a promise that the Albans
                    would go over to their side. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Fidenae having
                    openly revolted, Tullus summoned Mettius and his army from Alba, and led his
                    forces against the enemy. Crossing the Anio, he pitched his camp at the
                    confluence of the rivers. The Veientine army had crossed the Tiber between that
                    place and Fidenae. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> These troops, drawn up next
                    the river, formed the right wing; on the left the Fidenates were posted, nearer
                    the mountains. Tullus marshalled his own men against the Veientine enemy; the
                    Albans he posted opposite the army of Fidenae. The Alban commander was as
                    wanting in courage as in loyalty. Not daring, therefore, either to hold his
                    ground or openly to desert, he drew off by imperceptible degrees in the
                    direction of the mountains. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Then, when he
                    thought he had got near enough to them, he brought up his whole battle-line to
                    an elevated position, and still irresolute, deployed his ranks with the object
                    of consuming time. His purpose was to swing his forces to the side which fortune
                    favoured. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> At first the Romans posted next to
                    the Albans were amazed when they perceived that their flank was being uncovered
                    by the withdrawal of their allies; then a <pb n="p.99"/> horseman galloped up to
                    the king, and told him that <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 672-640</note> the Albans were marching off. In this
                    crisis Tullus vowed to establish twelve Salian priests, <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified"> These were the so-called <hi rend="italics"

                        with Quirinus, as the <hi rend="italics">Palatini</hi> (chap. xx.) were with
                        Mars Gradivus. See also v. lii. 7. </note> and to build shrines to Pallor
                    and Panic. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The horseman he reprimanded in a
                    loud voice, that the enemy might overhear him, and ordered him to go back and
                    fight; there was no occasion for alarm; it was by his own command that the Alban
                    army was marching round, that they might attack the unprotected rear of the
                    Fidenates. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He also ordered the cavalry to
                    raise their spears. This manœuvre hid the retreat of the Alban army from a large
                    part of the Roman foot-soldiers; those who had seen it, believing what the king
                    had been heard to say, fought all the more impetuously. The enemy in their turn
                    now became alarmed; they had heard Tullus's loud assertion, and many of the
                    Fidenates, having had Romans among them as colonists, knew Latin. <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/> And so, lest the Albans should suddenly charge down
                    from the hills and cut them off from their town, they beat a retreat. Tullus
                    pressed them hard, and having routed the wing composed of the Fidenates,
                    returned, bolder than ever, to the Veientes, who were demoralized by the panic
                    of their neighbours. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> They, too, failed to
                    withstand his attack, but their rout was stopped by the river in their rear When
                    they had fled thus far, some basely threw away their arms and rushed blindly
                    into the water, others hesitated on the bank and were overtaken before they had
                    made up their minds whether to flee or resist. Never before had the Romans
                    fought a bloodier battle. </p>

                    Tullus on the conquest of his enemies; Tullus replied kindly to Mettius, and
                    commanded the Albans in a good hour to join their camp to that of the Romans.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He then made preparations to perform, on
                    the morrow, a sacrifice of purification. At dawn, when all things were in
                    readiness, he issued to both armies the customary order, convoking them to an
                    assembly. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The heralds, beginning at the
                    outskirts of the camp, called out the Albans first, who being moved by the very
                    novelty of the occasion, took their stand close to the Roman king, that they
                    might hear him harangue his army. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The Roman
                    troops, by previous arrangement, were armed and disposed around them, and the
                    centurions were bidden to execute orders promptly. Then Tullus began as follows: </p>
                <p>
                    <quote> Romans, if ever anywhere in any war you have had reason to give thanks,
                        first to the immortal gods and then to your own valour, it was in the battle
                        of yesterday. For you fought not only against your enemies, but a harder and
                        more dangerous fight —against the treachery and the perfidy of your allies.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> For, to undeceive you, I gave no
                        orders that the Albans should draw off towards the mountains. What you heard
                        was not my command, but a trick and a pretended command, devised in order
                        that you might not know you were being deserted, and so be distracted from
                        the fight; and that the enemy, thinking that they were being hemmed in on
                        the rear, might be panic-stricken and flee. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                        /> And yet this guilt which I am charging does not attach to all the Albans;
                        they but followed <pb n="p.103"/> their general, as you, too, would have
                        done, had I <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.

                        who led this march; Mettius, too, who contrived this war; Mettius who broke
                        the treaty between Roman and Alban. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Let

                </p>
                <p> Thereupon the centurions, sword in hand, surrounded Mettius, while the king
                    proceeded: <quote> May prosperity, favour, and fortune be with the Roman people
                        and myself, and with you, men of Alba! I purpose to bring all the Alban
                        people over to Rome, to grant citizenship to their commons, to enroll the
                        nobles in the senate, to make one city and one state. As formerly from one
                        people the Alban nation was divided into two, so now let it be reunited into
                        one. </quote>
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Hearing these words the Alban soldiers,
                    themselves unarmed and fenced in by armed men, were constrained, however their
                    wishes might differ, by a common fear, and held their peace. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> Then Tullus said: <quote> Mettius Fufetius, if you were
                        capable of learning, yourself, to keep faith and abide by treaties, you
                        should have lived that I might teach you this; as it is, since your
                        disposition is incurable, you shall yet by your punishment teach the human
                        race to hold sacred the obligations you have violated. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Accordingly, just as a little while ago your heart was

                    chariots, and caused Mettius to be stretched out and made fast to them, after
                    which the horses were whipped up in opposite directions, and bore off in <pb

                    were turned away from so dreadful a sight. Such was the first and last
                    punishment among the Romans of a kind that disregards the laws of humanity. In
                    other cases we may boast that with no nation have milder punishments found

                    been sent on to Alba to fetch the inhabitants to Rome, and afterwards the

                    /> When they entered the gates there was not, indeed, the tumult and panic which
                    usually follow the capture of a city, when its gates have been forced or its
                    walls breached with a ram or its stronghold stormed, when the shouts of the
                    enemy and the rush of armed men through the streets throw the whole town into a
                    wild confusion of blood and fire. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But at Alba
                    oppressive silence and grief that found no words quite overwhelmed the spirits
                    of all the people; too dismayed to think what they should take with them and
                    what leave behind, they would ask each other's advice again and again, now
                    standing on their thresholds, and now roaming aimlessly through the houses they

                    at length the horsemen began to be urgent, and clamorously commanded them to

                    pulled down in the outskirts of the city; when the dust rising in different
                    quarters had overcast the sky like a gathering cloud; then everybody made haste
                    to carry out what he could, and forth they went, abandoning their lares and

                    the women, when they passed the venerable temples beset by armed men, and left
                    in captivity, as it seemed to them, their gods. <milestone n="6" unit="section"

                    destruction and desolation the work of the four hundred years during which Alba

                    of the king's house and from that time onwards resided there. <milestone n="2"

                    consecrated place for the order he had enlarged, a senate-house, which continued
                    to be called the Curia Hostilia as late as the time of our own fathers. <note

                    traders had been seized; the Sabines alleged that, before this, refugees from
                    their country had fled to the grove of sanctuary, and had been detained in Rome.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> These were put forward as the causes of
                    war. The Sabines, not forgetting that a portion of their own forces had been

                    the nearest of the Etruscans were the Veientes. There the resentment left over

                    fathers, the sacrifices, which as though they had forsaken their gods along with
                    their city, they had given over to oblivion, either adopting Roman rites, or in
                    anger at their fortune, such as men sometimes feel, abandoning the worship of
                    the gods. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The Romans also, in consequence of

                    The king himself, so tradition tells, in turning over the commentaries of Numa

                    Elicius, and devoted himself in secret to those rites; but the ceremony was
                    improperly undertaken or performed, and not only was no divine manifestation
                    vouchsafed him, but in consequence of the wrath of Jupiter, who was provoked by
                    his faulty observance, he was struck by a thunderbolt and consumed in the flames
                    of his house. Tullus was greatly renowned in war and reigned thirty-two years. </p>

                    the people elected Ancus Marcius king, a choice which the Fathers ratified.
                    Ancus Marcius was a grandson, on the mother's side, of King Numa Pompilius.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When he began to rule he was mindful of
                    his grandfather's glory, and considered that the last reign, excellent in all
                    else, had failed to prosper in one respect, owing to neglect or misconduct of
                    religious observances. Deeming it therefore a matter of the utmost consequence
                    to perform the state sacrifices as Numa had established them, he bade the
                    pontifex copy out all these from the commentaries of the king and display them
                    in public on a whitened table. This act led the citizens, who were eager for
                    peace, <pb n="p.115"/> and also the neighbouring nations, to hope that he <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 640-616</note> would
                    adopt the character and institutions of his grandfather. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Hence the Latins, with whom a treaty had been made in the
                    time of Tullus, plucked up courage, and raided Roman territory, and when called
                    on by the Romans to make restitution, returned an arrogant answer, persuaded
                    that the Roman king would spend his reign in inactivity amid shrines and altars.
                    But the character of Ancus was well balanced, and he honoured the memory of
                    Romulus, as well as Numa. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> And besides having a
                    conviction that peace had been more necessary to his grandfather's reign, when
                    the nation had been both young and mettlesome, he also believed that the
                    tranquillity, so free of attack, which had fallen to the lot of Numa would be no
                    easy thing for himself to compass; his patience was being tried, and when proved
                    would be regarded with contempt, and in short the times were better suited to
                    the rule of a Tullus than a Numa. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> In order
                    however that, as Numa had instituted religious practices in time of peace, he
                    might himself give out a ceremonial of war, and that wars might not only be
                    waged but also declared with some sort of formality, he copied from the ancient
                    tribe of the Aequicoli the law, which the fetials now have, <note

                    place for her purpose; amongst a new people, where all rank was of sudden growth
                    and founded on worth, there would be room for a brave and strenuous man; the
                    City had been ruled by Tatius the Sabine, it had summoned Numa to the
                    sovereignty from Cures, even Ancus was the son of a Sabine mother, and could
                    point to no noble ancestor but Numa. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> She had
                    no trouble in persuading a man who was eager for distinction, to whom Tarquinii
                    was only his mother's birthplace. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They
                    therefore gathered their possessions together and removed to Rome. They had
                    come, as it happened, as far as Janiculum, when, as they were sitting in their
                    covered waggon, an eagle poised on its wings gently descended upon them and
                    plucked off Lucumo's cap, after which, rising noisily above the car and again
                    stooping, as if sent from heaven for that service, it deftly replaced the cap
                    upon his head, and departed on high. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This
                    augury was joyfully accepted, it is said, by Tanaquil, who was a woman skilled
                    in celestial prodigies, as was the case with most Etruscans. Embracing her
                    husband, she bade him expect transcendent greatness: such was the meaning of
                    that bird, appearing from that quarter of the sky, and bringing tidings from
                    that god; the highest part of the man had been concerned in the omen; the eagle
                    had removed the adornment placed upon a mortal's head that it might <pb

                    Tarquinius Priscus. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The Romans regarded him
                    with special interest, as a stranger and a man of wealth, and he steadily pushed
                    his fortune by his own exertions, making friends wherever possible, by kind
                    words, courteous hospitality, and benefactions, until his reputation extended
                    even to the palace. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He had not long been
                    known in this way to the king before the liberality and adroitness of his
                    services procured him the footing of an intimate friend. He was now consulted in
                    matters both of public and private importance, in time of war and in time of
                    peace, and having been tested in every way was eventually even named in the
                    king's will as guardian of his children. </p>

                    inferior to none of his predecessors in the arts of peace and war and in the
                    reputation they conferred. By this time his sons were nearly grown. Tarquinius
                    was therefore all the more insistent in urging that the comitia should be held
                    without delay to choose a king. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When the
                    meeting had been proclaimed, and the day drew near, he sent the boys away on a

                    kingship and to deliver a speech designed to win the favour of the commons.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He pointed out that it; was no new thing
                    he sought; he was not the first outsider to aim at the sovereignty in Rome —a
                    thing which might have occasioned indignation and astonishment, —but the third.
                    Tatius indeed, had been not merely an alien but an enemy when he was made king;
                    while Numa was a stranger <pb n="p.129"/> to the City, and, far from seeking the

                    he had removed to Rome with his wife and all his property. For the greater part
                    of that period of life during which men serve the state he had lived in Rome,
                    and not in the city of his birth. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Both in
                    civil life and in war he had had no mean instructor —King Ancus himself had
                    taught him Roman laws and Roman rites. In subordination and deference to the
                    king he had vied, he said, with all his hearers; in generosity to his
                    fellow-subjects he had emulated the king himself. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Hearing him advance these not unwarranted claims, the
                    people, with striking unanimity, named him king. The result was that the man, so
                    admirable in all other respects, continued even after he had obtained the
                    sovereignty to manifest the same spirit of intrigue which had governed him in
                    seeking it; and being no less concerned to strengthen his own power than to
                    enlarge the state, he added a hundred members to the senate, who were known
                    thenceforward as Fathers of the <quote>lesser families,</quote> and formed a
                    party of unwavering loyalty to the king, to whom they owed their admission to

                        shown its disapproval of the accession of Tarquinius, who now sought to

                    around the City, when a Sabine war interrupted his plans. And so sudden was the
                    invasion, that they had crossed the Anio before the Roman army was able to march
                    out and stop them, so that the City was thrown into a panic. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> The first battle was indecisive, with heavy losses on both
                    sides. The enemy then withdrew into their camp, affording the Romans an
                    opportunity to renew their preparations for the war. Tarquinius believed that
                    cavalry was what he chiefly lacked. To the Ramnes, Titienses, and Luceres, the
                    centuries which Romulus had enrolled, he therefore determined to add others, and
                    to give them his own name as a permanent distinction. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> But since this was a matter in which Romulus had obtained
                    the sanction of augury before acting, it was asserted by Attus Navius, a famous
                    augur of those days, that no change or innovation could be introduced unless the
                    birds had signified their approval. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The king's
                    ire was aroused by this, and he is reported to have said, in derision of the
                    science, <quote> Come now, divine seer! Inquire of your augury if that of which
                        I am now thinking can come to pass. </quote> When Attus, having taken the
                    auspices, replied that it would surely come to pass, the king said, <quote> Nay,
                        but this is <pb n="p.133"/> what I was thinking of, that you should cleave a

                    without a sign of hesitation, cut the whetstone in two. <milestone n="5"

                    covered, on the spot where the thing was done, in the comitium, even at the
                    steps on the left of the senate-house; tradition adds that the whetstone also
                    was deposited in the same place, to be a memorial of that miracle to posterity.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> However this may be, auguries and the
                    augural priesthood so increased in honour that nothing was afterwards done, in

                    assemblies, musterings of the army, acts of supreme importance —all were put off

                    for men were secretly dispatched to light a great quantity of firewood lying on
                    the bank of the Anio, and throw it into the river. A favouring wind set the wood

                    the cavalry particularly distinguished themselves. They were posted on either

                    retreat, they are said to have charged from both sides, with such effect that
                    they not only checked the Sabine forces, which were pressing hotly forward as

                    Tarquinius thought it proper to follow up his victory while the other side was

                    the will of Heaven. The youth turned out to be of a truly royal nature, and when
                    Tarquinius sought a son-in-law there was no other young Roman who could be at
                    all compared to Servius; and the king accordingly betrothed his daughter to him.

                    great with child, had been recognized amongst the other captive women, and on
                    the score of her unique nobility had been rescued from slavery by the Roman
                    queen, and had brought forth her child at Rome in the house of Priscus
                    Tarquinius; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> in the sequel this act of
                    generosity led to a growing intimacy between the women, and the boy, as one

                    his mother's misfortune, who by the capture of her native town came into the
                    power of its enemies, which gave rise to the belief that Servius was born of a
                    slave woman. </p>

                    Tarquinius had begun to reign, and not only the king, but the Fathers and the

                        unit="section"/> Now the two sons of Ancus had always considered it a great
                    outrage that they had been ousted from their father's kingship by the crime of
                    their guardian, and that Rome should be ruled by a stranger whose descent was
                    derived from a race not only remote but actually not even Italian. <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> But their indignation was vastly increased by the
                    prospect that even after Tarquinius' death the sovereignty would not revert to
                    them, but, plunging down to yet baser depths, would fall into the hands of
                    slaves; so that where, a hundred years before, Romulus, a god's son and himself
                    a god, had borne sway, so long as he remained on earth, in that self-same state
                    a slave and <pb n="p.143"/> the son of a slave woman would be king. It would

                    be not only a general disgrace to the Roman name, but particularly to their own
                    house, if during the lifetime of Ancus' sons it should be open not only to
                    strangers, but even to slaves to rule over the Romans. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> They therefore determined to repel that insult with the
                    sword. But resentment at their wrong urged them rather against Tarquinius
                    himself than against Servius, not only because the king, if he survived, would
                    be more formidable to avenge the murder than a subject would be, but because if
                    Servius should be dispatched it seemed probable that the kingdom would be
                    inherited by whomsoever else Tarquinius might choose to be his son-in-law. For
                    these reasons they laid their plot against the king himself. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Two very desperate shepherds were selected to do the deed.
                    Armed with the rustic implements to which they were both accustomed, they
                    feigned a brawl in the entrance-court of the palace and, making as much noise as
                    possible, attracted the attention of all the royal attendants; then they
                    appealed to the king, until their shouts were heard inside the palace and they
                    were sent for and came before him. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> At first
                    each raised his voice and tried to shout the other down. Being repressed by the
                    lictor and bidden to speak in turn, they finally ceased to interrupt each other,
                    and one of them began to state his case, as they had planned beforehand.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> While the king, intent upon the speaker,
                    turned quite away from the other shepherd, the latter lifted his axe and brought
                    it down upon his head. Then, leaving the weapon in the wound, they both ran out

                    asking one another in amazement what the matter was. In the midst of the tumult
                    Tanaquil gave orders to close the palace, and ejected all witnesses. She busily
                    got together the remedies needful for healing a wound, as if there were still
                    hope, taking at the same time other measures to protect herself in case her hope

                    and through a window looking out upon the Nova Via —for the king lived near the

                    Servius Tullius, who would dispense justice and perform the other duties of the
                    king. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Servius went forth in the royal robe,
                    accompanied by lictors, and sitting in the king's seat rendered judgment in some
                    cases, while in regard to others he gave out that he would consult the king. In
                    this way for several days after Tarquinius had breathed his last he concealed
                    his death, pretending that he was merely doing another's work, while he was
                    really strengthening his own position; then at last the truth was allowed to be
                    known, from the lamentations which arose within the palace. Servius surrounded
                    himself with a strong guard, and ruled at first without the authorization of the
                    people, but with the consent of the Fathers. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    The sons of Ancus, upon the arrest of the agents of their crime and the report
                    that the king was alive and that Servius was so strong, had already gone into

                    Tarquinius might not show the same animosity towards himself which the sons of
                    Ancus had felt towards Tarquinius, he married his two daughters to the young

                    could not break the force of destiny by human wisdom; and jealousy of his power,
                    even among the members of his household, created an atmosphere of treachery and
                    hostility. Most opportune for the tranquil preservation <pb n="p.149"/> of the
                    existing state of things was a war which was <note anchored="true"

                    of Tullius were conspicuous; and when he had utterly defeated the vast army of
                    his enemies, he found on returning to Rome that his title to the kingship was no
                    longer questioned, whether he tested the feeling of the Fathers or that of the
                    commons. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He then addressed himself to what is
                    by far the most important work of peace: as Numa had established religious law,
                    so Servius intended that posterity should celebrate himself as the originator of
                    all distinctions among the citizens, and of the orders which clearly
                    differentiate the various grades of rank and fortune. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> For he instituted the census, <note anchored="true"

                        given a place in the army, which was to be reclassified according to every

                    to men's wealth. He then distributed the people into classes and centuries
                    according to the following scale, which was based upon the census and was

                    were all known as the first class; the seniors were to be ready to guard the

                    armour which these men were required to provide consisted of helmet, round
                    shield, greaves, and breast-plate, all of bronze, for the protection of their
                    bodies; their offensive weapons were a spear and a sword. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> There were added to this class two centuries of mechanics,
                    who were to serve without arms; to them was entrusted the duty of fashioning
                    siege-engines in war. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The second class was
                    drawn up out of those whose rating was between a hundred thousand and

                    at fifty thousand; a like number of centuries was formed in this class as in the

                    the same number of centuries was formed, but their equipment was changed,
                    nothing being given them but a spear and a javelin. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> The fifth class was made larger, and thirty centuries were
                    formed. These men carried slings, with stones for missiles. Rated with them were
                    the horn-blowers and trumpeters, divided into two centuries. Eleven thousand was

                    —three had been instituted by Romulus —employing the same names which had been
                    hallowed to their use by augury. For the purchase of horses they were allowed
                    ten thousand asses each from the state treasury, and for the maintenance of
                    these horses unmarried women were designated, who had to pay two thousand asses
                    each, every year. All these burdens were shifted from the shoulders of the poor
                    to those of the rich. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The latter were then

                    handed down by Romulus and observed by all the other kings; but gradations were
                    introduced, so that ostensibly no one should be excluded from the suffrage, and

                    demands of peace as well as those of war, he was unwilling that arms should
                    always be the means employed for strengthening Rome's power, and sought to
                    increase her sway by diplomacy, and at the same time to add something to the
                    splendour of the City. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Even at that early date
                    the temple of Diana at Ephesus enjoyed great renown. It was reputed to have been
                    built through the cooperation of the cities of Asia, and this harmony and
                    community of worship Servius praised in superlative terms to the Latin nobles,

                    Diana was built in Rome by the nations of Latium conjointly with the Roman
                    People. This was an admission that Rome was the capital —a point which had so
                    often been disputed <pb n="p.159"/> with force of arms. But though it seemed

                    repeated failure of their appeals to war, there was one man amongst the Sabines
                    who thought that he saw an opportunity to recover the empire by a shrewd plan of
                    his own. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In the Sabine country, on the farm of
                    a certain head of a family, there was born a heifer of extraordinary size and
                    beauty; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> a marvel to which the horns afterwards
                    bore testimony, for they were fastened up for many generations in the vestibule
                    of Diana's temple. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This heifer was regarded as
                    a prodigy, as indeed it was; soothsayers prophesied that the state whose
                    citizens should sacrifice the animal to Diana would be the seat of empire, and
                    this prediction had reached the ears of the priest of Diana's shrine. On the
                    earliest day which seemed suitable for the sacrifice, the Sabine drove the
                    heifer to Rome, and bringing her to the shrine of Diana, led her up to the
                    altar. There the Roman priest, moved by the great size of the victim, which had
                    been much talked of, and recalling the prophecy, asked the Sabine, <quote> What
                        is this that you are doing, stranger? Would you sacrifice, unpurified, to
                        Diana? Not so! First bathe in a running stream; the Tiber flows by in the

                    the commons by dividing among all the citizens the land obtained by conquest
                    from the enemy; after which he made bold to call upon the people to vote whether
                    he should be their ruler, and was declared king with such unanimity as none of

                    opposition to the wishes of the senate, he felt that he had got the better
                    opportunity of vilifying Servius to the Fathers and of increasing his own
                    influence in the senate-house. He was a hot-headed youth himself, and he had at

                    —whether he was the son or the grandson of King Tarquinius Priscus is uncertain;

                    admired, him she called a man and a prince: she despised her sister because,

                    took the lead in all the mischief. Having become addicted to clandestine
                    meetings with another's husband, she spared no terms of insult when speaking of
                    her own husband to his brother, or of her sister to that sister's husband. She
                    urged that it would have been juster for her to be unmarried and for him to lack
                    a wife than for them to be united to their inferiors and be compelled to

                    by deaths which followed closely upon one another, they were joined together in
                    nuptials which Servius rather tolerated than approved. </p>

                    seated himself on the throne in front of the Curia, and commanded, by the mouth
                    of a herald, that the senators should come to King Tarquinius at the

                    had been aroused by the alarming news, came up and immediately called out in a

                    Tarquinius answered truculently that it was his own father's seat he occupied;
                    that the king's son was a fitter successor to his kingdom than a slave was; that
                    Tullius had long enough been suffered to mock his masters and insult them.
                    Shouts arose from the partisans of each, and the people began to rush into the
                    senate-house; it was clear that he would be king who won the day. <milestone

                    on boldly to the end. Being much superior to Servius in youth and strength, he
                    seized him by the middle, and bearing him out of the senate-house, flung him
                    down the steps. He then went back into the Curia to hold the senate together.

                    was driven in her carriage into the Forum, and nothing abashed at the crowd of

                    gain but plunder. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It was chiefly the senators
                    whose numbers were reduced by this procedure, and Tarquinius determined to make
                    no new appointments to the order, that it might be the more despised for its
                    very paucity, and might chafe less at being ignored in all business of state.

                    household. War, peace, treaties, and alliances were entered upon or broken off

                    much talk in the council all day about various subjects. Turnus Herdonius of

                    secretly and in whispers, but still quite generally; —could anything be more
                    overbearing than to flout the whole Latin race as he was doing then? <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> Their leaders had been summoned from distant homes,
                    and the very man who had called the council was not there. He was evidently
                    trying their patience, intending, if they submitted to the yoke, to use them as
                    his vassals. For who could fail to see that he was aiming at sovereignty over
                    the Latins? <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> If his own people had done well to
                    intrust this to him, if indeed it had been intrusted to him at all, and had not
                    been ravished by foul murder, then it was right that the Latins also should
                    intrust it to him —nay, <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> not even then, for he
                    was of foreign birth; but if his own subjects were weary of him, as men who, one
                    after another, were being made to suffer death, exile, confiscation, what better
                    prospect was held out to the Latins? If they were guided by the speaker they
                    would depart every man to his own home, nor observe the day of meeting more than
                    he who had proclaimed it was observing it. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As

                    uttered by the factious and turbulent Latin, who owed to these qualities his

                        unit="section"/> This was the end of the speech; all turned to salute
                    Tarquinius. Silence was commanded, and the king, being advised by those nearest
                    him to excuse himself for having come so late, declared that he had been chosen
                    arbiter between a father and his son, and had been delayed by his anxiety to
                    reconcile them. He added that since this business had used up that day, he would
                    take up on the morrow the matters which he had meant to bring before them.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They say that Turnus would not suffer even
                    this to go unchallenged, asserting that there was no question more quickly
                    settled than one betwixt father and son, for these few words were enough to end

                    Arician quitted the council. Tarquinius was considerably more vexed than he
                    appeared to be, and at once looked about him for the means of destroying Turnus,
                    that he might inspire in the Latins the same terror with which he had broken the
                    spirit of the Romans. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> And since he could not
                    openly put his man to death by virtue of sovereign right, he charged him with a
                    crime of which he was innocent, and so destroyed him. Through the agency of
                    certain men of the opposite party in Aricia, he bribed a slave of Turnus with
                    gold to allow a large quantity of swords to be brought secretly into his
                    master's lodging. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Having accomplished this in
                    a single night, Tarquinius, shortly before dawn, summoned the chief men of the
                    Latins to his quarters, pretending to <pb n="p.179"/> have received alarming
                    news, and informed them <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin"
                        >B.C. 534-510</note> that his tardiness on the preceding day, as though
                    somehow providentially occasioned, had been the means of saving himself and
                    them. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> For he was told that Turnus was plotting
                    his murder and that of the chief men of the different cities, that he might be
                    sole ruler over the Latins. He would have attacked them the day before in the
                    council, but had postponed the attempt because the summoner of the council, whom
                    he chiefly aimed at, was not there. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> That was
                    the reason Turnus had railed at him in his absence, for his delay had balked the
                    Arician's expectation. Tarquinius said that he had no doubt, if his information
                    was true, that Turnus would come at dawn, when they had assembled in the
                    council, and would be armed and attended by a band of conspirators. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> It was said that a great quantity of swords had been
                    carried to his lodging; the falsity or truth of this could be ascertained
                    immediately, and he asked them to go with him to Turnus's quarters. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> The charge was made plausible both by the aggressive
                    spirit of Turnus and his speech of the day before, and by Tarquinius's delay,
                    since it seemed that the massacre might have been postponed on that account. The
                    nobles went therefore with a disposition to believe the story, but still, if the
                    swords should not be found, they were prepared to conclude the other charges
                    false. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As soon as they reached the place they
                    wakened Turnus from his sleep and surrounded him with guards; and having
                    overpowered the slaves, who out of affection for their master would have
                    resorted to force, they proceeded to pull out the hidden swords from every
                    corner of the inn. There was now no doubt that Turnus was <pb n="p.181"/> caught
                    in the act, and he was cast into chains, while <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> the summons was

                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> There such bitter resentment was aroused
                    by the public display of the swords, that the accused was not permitted to plead
                    his cause, but suffered a new kind of death, being plunged into the source of
                    the Ferentine Water and sunk beneath a wicker crate heaped up with stones. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Tarquinius then called the Latins again to the
                    place of council, and praised them for the punishment which they had justly
                    meted out to the rebellious attempt of Turnus, in view of the treason in which
                    he had just been taken. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The king then went on
                    to say that it was in his power to proceed according to an ancient right, since
                    all the Latins, having sprung from Alba, were included in that treaty by which,
                    from the time of Tullus, the whole Alban state, with its colonies, had come
                    under Rome's dominion. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> In the account
                        of this treaty at xxiv. 3 no Alban colonies are mentioned, nor do we know of

                    served, he thought, if that treaty were renewed and the good fortune of the
                    Roman people were thrown open to the participation of the Latins, than if they
                    were always to be dreading or enduring the razing of their cities and the
                    devastation of their lands which they had suffered first in Ancus's reign and
                    afterward in that of the speaker's father. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> It
                    was not difficult to persuade the Latins, although the Roman interest
                    preponderated in this treaty. For the rest, they saw that the chiefs of the
                    Latin name stood with the king and took his view of the matter, and they had
                    just been given a demonstration of the danger they would each incur if they
                    opposed the project. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> So the treaty was
                    renewed, and the Latin <pb n="p.183"/> juniors were commanded to present
                    themselves at <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.

                    assembled, agreeably to the king's edict, from the different districts,
                    Tarquinius was unwilling that they should have their own leaders, or a separate
                    command, or their own standards; he therefore mingled Latins and Romans in the
                    maniples, making one maniple of two and two of one, and over the maniples thus
                    doubled he put centurions. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> A Roman

                        not, strictly speaking, doubled. </note>

                    was not a bad general in war. Indeed, he would have equalled in this art the

                    dimmed his glory here. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It was he who began the

                    driven off from the walls; and he finally resorted to the policy, so unlike a

                    For he pretended to have given up <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"

                    strangers upon his own family. Even his children were too many to please him,
                    and the solitude which he had caused in the senate-house he wished to bring to
                    pass in his own home also, that he might leave no descendant, no heir to his
                    kingdom. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The young man said that he had
                    himself escaped from amidst the swords and javelins of his father, and had made
                    up his mind that there was no safety for him anywhere save with the enemies of
                    Lucius Tarquinius. Let them not delude themselves, he said; the war which the
                    king pretended to have abandoned was still awaiting them, and when the chance
                    offered he would attack them unawares. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But if
                    they had no room for suppliants, he was prepared to wander all over Latium, and
                    thence seek out the Volsci and the Aequi and the Hernici, till at last he should
                    come to people who knew how to protect a son from the cruel and wicked tortures
                    inflicted on him by a father. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Possibly he
                    might even discover some enthusiasm for war and arms against the haughtiest of

                    it appeared that if they were indifferent he would leave them in anger and
                    continue his flight, the Gabini bade him welcome. They told him not to be
                    surprised if the king had been the same to his children that he had been to his
                    subjects, to his allies; he would end by venting his cruelty upon <pb n="p.187"

                    believed that in a short time, with his help, the seat of war would be shifted

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Sextus next obtained admission to the Gabian
                    councils of state, where, on all subjects but one, he professed a deference for
                    the opinion of those who had long been citizens of Gabii and were better
                    acquainted with the facts. War, however, he did take it upon himself to urge,
                    again and again; and in so doing he assumed a special competence, as one who was
                    acquainted with the strength of both nations, and knew that the king's pride
                    must necessarily be hateful to all the citizens, since even his children had not
                    been able to put up with it. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In this way,
                    little by little, he stirred up the leaders of the Gabini to reopen the war. He
                    would himself take the boldest of the young men and go upon raids and forays.
                    All his words and acts were calculated to deceive, and their ill-grounded
                    confidence so increased that in the end he was chosen commander-in-chief.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The war began, and the people had no
                    suspicion of what was going forward. Skirmishes took place between Rome and
                    Gabii, in which, as a rule, the Gabini had the best of it. Thereupon their
                    citizens, both high and low, contended who should be loudest in expressing the
                    belief that in Sextus Tarquinius they had a heaven-sent leader. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> And the soldiers, seeing him ever ready to share in their
                    dangers and hardships, and ever lavish in distributing the plunder, came to love
                    him so devotedly that the elder Tarquinius was not more truly master <pb

                        unit="section"/> And so, when <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> Sextus saw that he had acquired strength
                    enough for any enterprise, he despatched one of his own followers to his father
                    in Rome, to ask what the king might please to have him do, since the gods had
                    granted that at Gabii all power in the state should rest with him alone.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> To this messenger, I suppose because he
                    seemed not quite to be trusted, no verbal reply was given. The king, as if
                    absorbed in meditation, passed into the garden of his house, followed by his
                    son's envoy. There, walking up and down without a word, he is said to have
                    struck off the heads of the tallest poppies with his stick. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> Tired of asking questions and waiting for an answer, the
                    messenger returned to Gabii, his mission, as he thought, unaccomplished. He
                    reported what he had said himself and what he had seen. Whether from anger, or
                    hatred, or native pride, the king, he said, had not pronounced a single word.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As soon as it was clear to Sextus what his
                    father meant and what was the purport of his silent hints, he rid himself of the
                    chief men of the state. Some he accused before the people; against others he
                    took advantage of the odium they had themselves incurred. Many were openly
                    executed; some, whom it would not have looked well to accuse, were put to death
                    in secret. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Some were permitted, if they chose,
                    to leave the country; or they were driven into banishment, and once out of the
                    way, their property was forfeited, just as in the case of those who had been put
                    to death. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Thence came largesses and spoils,
                    and in the sweetness of private gain men lost their feeling for the wrongs of
                    the nation, until, deprived of counsel and aid, the state of Gabii was handed
                    over unresisting to the Roman king. </p>

                    made peace with the Aequian nation and renewed the treaty with the Etruscans. He
                    next turned his attention to affairs in the city. Here his first concern was to
                    build a temple of Jupiter on the Tarpeian Mount <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified">

                    stand as a memorial of his reign and of his name, testifying that of the two
                    Tarquinii, both kings, the father had made the vow and the son had fulfilled it.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> And that the site might be free from all
                    other religious claims and belong wholly to Jupiter and his temple, which was
                    building there, he determined to annul the consecration of several fanes and
                    shrines which had been first vowed by King Tatius at the crisis of the battle
                    against Romulus, and had afterwards been consecrated and inaugurated. <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> At the very time when he began this task the gods are
                    said to have exerted their power to show the magnitude of this mighty empire.
                    For whereas the birds permitted that the consecrations of all the other shrines
                    should be rescinded, they refused their consent for the shrine of Terminus.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This omen and augury was thus construed:
                    the fact that the seat of Terminus was not moved, and that of all the gods he
                    alone was not called away from the place consecrated to him, meant that the
                    whole kingdom would be firm and steadfast. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    When this auspice of permanence had been received, there followed another
                    prodigy foretelling the grandeur of their empire. A human head, its features
                    intact, was found, so it is said, by the men who were digging for the
                    foundations of the temple. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This appearance
                    plainly foreshowed that here was to be the citadel of the empire and the head of
                    the world, and such was the interpretation of the soothsayers, both those who
                    were in <pb n="p.193"/> the City and those who were called in from Etruria <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 534-510</note> to
                    consider the matter. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This made the king all
                    the more ready to spend money on the work. Hence the Pometian spoils, which had
                    been destined to carry the building up to the roof, barely sufficed for the
                    foundations. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This disposes me to believe the
                    statement of Fabius (who is, besides, the earlier writer) that the spoils were
                    only forty talents, rather than Piso's, who writes that forty thousand pounds of
                    silver were put aside for this work. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> So great
                    a sum of money could not be expected from the booty of a single city of that
                    time, and there is no building, even among those of our own day, for the
                    foundations of which it would not be more than enough. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Being intent upon completing the temple, the
                    king called in workmen from every quarter of Etruria, and used for this purpose
                    not only the state funds but labourers drawn from the commons. This work was far
                    from light in itself, and was added to their military service. Yet the plebeians
                    felt less abused at having to build with their own hands the temples of the
                    gods, than they did when they came to be transferred to other tasks also, which,
                    while less in show, were yet rather more laborious. <milestone n="2"

                    After making the plebeians toil at these hard tasks, the king felt that a
                    populace which had now no work to do was only a burden to the City; he wished,
                    moreover, by sending out settlers, to extend the frontiers of his dominions.

                <p> While he was thus occupied, a terrible portent appeared. A snake glided out of a
                    wooden pillar, causing fright and commotion in the palace. As for the king
                    himself, his heart was not so much struck with sudden terror as filled with
                    anxious forebodings. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Now for public prodigies
                    none but Etruscan soothsayers were wont to be employed, but this domestic
                    apparition, as he regarded it, so thoroughly alarmed him that he determined to

                        unit="section"/> and, not daring to trust the oracle's reply to anybody
                    else, he sent two of his sons, through strange lands, as they were then, and
                    over stranger seas, to Greece. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Titus and
                    Arruns were the ones who went; and, to bear them company, Lucius Junius Brutus
                    was sent too, the son of Tarquinia, sister of the king, a young man of a very
                    different mind from that which he pretended to bear. Having heard that the
                    leading men of the state, and among them his own brother, had been put to death
                    by his uncle, he determined to leave nothing in his disposition which the king
                    might justly fear, nor anything in his fortune to covet, resolving to find
                    safety in contempt, where justice afforded no protection. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> He therefore deliberately assumed the appearance of
                    stupidity, and permitted himself and his property to become the spoil of the
                    king; he even accepted the surname Brutus, <note anchored="true"

                    City, in accordance with the commentaries of Servius Tullius. <note

                        Lucretius presided over the election in the capacity of interrex (to which
                        office Dion. iv. 84 says Lucretius was appointed by Brutus) than in that of
                        prefect. </note> These were Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius
