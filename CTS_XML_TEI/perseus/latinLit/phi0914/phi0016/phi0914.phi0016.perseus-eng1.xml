                    the City of Rome to the capture of the same —at first under kings and afterwards
                    under consuls and dictators, decemvirs and consular tribunes —their <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> foreign wars and their domestic dissensions, I have
                    set forth in five books, dealing with matters which are obscure not only by
                    reason of their great antiquity —like far-off objects which can hardly be
                    descried —but also because in those days there was but slightly and scanty use
                    of writing, the sole trustworthy guardian of the memory of past events, and
                    because even such records as existed in the commentaries of the pontiffs and in
                    other public and private documents, nearly all perished in the conflagration of
                    the City. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> From this point onwards a clearer
                    and more definite account shall be given of the City's civil and military
                    history, when, beginning for a second time, it sprang up, as it were from the
                    old roots, with a more luxuriant and fruitful growth. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Now it stood at first by leaning on the same
                    support by which it had raised itself up, that is on Marcus Furius, its foremost
                    citizen; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> neither would men suffer him to
                    resign the dictatorship till the completion of the year. <note anchored="true"

                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> That elections for the ensuing year should be
                    held by the tribunes, in whose magistracy the City had been captured, was
                    considered inadvisable, and the state reverted to an <pb n="p.197"/>
                    interregnum. While the citizens were engrossed in <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="marg">B.C. 389</note> unremitting toil and labour
                    to restore the City, Quintus Fabius had no sooner quitted his magistracy than he
                    was indicted by Gnaeus Marcius, a tribune of the plebs, on the ground of his
                    having fought in violation of the <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> law of
                    nations against the Gauls, to whom he had been sent as an envoy —a trial which
                    he escaped by a death so opportune that the majority believed it voluntary.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The interregnum began: Publius Cornelius
                    Scipio was interrex; and after him Marcus Furius Camillus, who effected the
                    election, as tribunes of the soldiers with consular authority, of Lucius
                    Valerius Publicola (for the second time) Lucius Verginius, Publius Cornelius,
                    Aulus Manlius, Lucius Aemilius, and Lucius Postumius. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Having, immediately <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified">On July 6th at the earliest.</note> after the
                    interregnum, entered upon their term, they consulted the senate before
                    everything else on questions of religious observance. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> Among the first decrees they passed was one for searching
                    out the treaties and laws — to wit, the twelve tables and certain laws of the
                    kings, —so far as they could be discovered. Some of these were made accessible
                    even to the common people, but such as dealt with sacred rites were kept private
                    by the pontiffs, chiefly that they might hold the minds of the populace in
                    subjection through religious fear. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Then they
                    proceeded to deliberate about days of evil omen. The 18th of July was notorious
                    for a double misfortune, since it was on that day that the Fabii were massacred
                    at the Cremera and that subsequently the rout at the Allia occurred, which
                    resulted in the destruction of the City. From the latter disaster they named it
                    the Day of the Allia, and forbade any public or <pb n="p.199"/> private business
                    to be done that day. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Some think, <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="marg">B. C. 389</note> because
                    Sulpicius had, on the day after the Ides of July, made an unacceptable
                    sacrifice, and, without having gained the divine approval, had two days later
                    exposed the Roman army to the enemy, that therefore religious rites were omitted
                    also on the days after the several Ides; and that afterwards it became
                    traditional that the morrow after Kalends and Nones should likewise be avoided,
                    from the same scruple. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> But the Romans were not left long to the
                    peaceful consideration of plans for raising their state after its grievous fall.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> On the one hand the Volsci, their ancient
                    foes, had armed for the purpose of extinguishing the Roman name: on the other,
                    merchants brought word from Etruria that the leading men of all her nations had
                    met at the shrine of Voltumna and conspired to make war. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> A fresh alarm, too, was occasioned by the revolt of the
                    Latins and the Hernici, who since the battle fought at Lake Regillus had
                    continued for close upon a hundred years, with unquestioned loyalty, in the
                    friendship of the Roman People. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> And so, when
                    such dangers threatened them on every side, and it was clear to all that the
                    name of Rome was not only held in hatred by her enemies, but even in contempt by
                    her allies, it was <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> resolved that the
                    republic should be defended under the same auspices under which it had been
                    redeemed and that Marcus Furius Camillus should be named dictator. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> Being appointed dictator he designated Gaius
                    Servilius Ahala master of the horse, and after proclaiming a cessation of legal
                    business, held a levy of the juniors, yet without excluding such of the older
                    men as still <pb n="p.201"/> possessed any vigour, to whom also he administered
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="marg">B.C. 389</note> the
                    oath and mustered them into centuries. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Having enrolled the army and equipped it, he
                    divided it into three parts. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> One division he
                    stationed in the Veientine district to confront Etruria; a second he ordered to
                    encamp before the City. These divisions were put under the command of military
                    tribunes, Aulus Manlius for the home troops, Lucius Aemilius for those which
                    were being dispatched against the Etruscans. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    The third division he led himself against the Volsci, and not far from Lanuvium
                    — <hi rend="italics">ad Mecium</hi> the place is called —advanced to attack
                    their camp. The enemy had gone to war from a feeling of contempt for the Romans,
                    believing that their fighting strength had been nearly wiped out by the Gauls,
                    but merely on hearing that Camillus was their general, they were so terrified
                    that they protected themselves with a rampart and <milestone n="10??"
                        unit="section"/> the rampart with a barricade of logs, that the Romans might
                    nowhere be able to penetrate to their defences. On perceiving this, Camillus
                    ordered his men to throw fire on the barrier. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    It so happened that there was a high wind blowing towards the enemy, which not
                    only caused the blaze to open a path, but what with the flames making towards
                    the camp, and the heat and smoke and the crackling of the green wood, so alarmed
                    the enemy, that the Roman soldiers experienced less difficulty in scaling the
                    fortifications of the Volscian camp than they had met with in crossing the burnt
                    barricade. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Having routed and slain his
                    enemies and taken their camp by assault, the dictator gave the booty to his
                    soldiers, an act which, coming unexpectedly from a commander who <pb n="p.203"/>
                    was by no means open-handed, was all the more <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="marg">B.C. 389</note> acceptable to the men.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Then after pursuing the fugitives and
                    laying waste all the Volscian countryside, he forced the Volsci to surrender at
                    last, after seventy years of war. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        Writing of Tarquinius Superbus, Livy says (I. liii. 2) that he began a war
                        with the Volsci which was to last more than two hundred years after his
                        time. It is not known where he could have found the seventy years tradition. </note>
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The victor, leaving the Volsci, crossed over
                    to the Aequi, who were themselves making preparations for war; their army he
                    surprised at Bolae, and carried not only their camp but their city, too, at the
                    first assault. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> While affairs were thus prosperous in that
                    region where Camillus commanded for Rome, in another direction a great danger
                    threatened. Well-nigh the whole of Etruria was in arms and was laying siege to
                    Sutrium, an ally of the Roman People. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Envoys
                    of the Sutrines had appeared before the senate to beg for assistance in their
                    distress, and had obtained a decree that the dictator should march to the aid of
                    their people at the earliest opportunity. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But
                    the plight of the besieged would not admit of their waiting till this hope was
                    realized; and the population of the little town, exhausted with the labour,
                    guard-mounting, and wounds, which fell always to the lot of the same men, had
                    come to terms, and having surrendered their city to the enemy, were leaving
                    their homes in a sad procession, unarmed and with but a single garment each,
                    when, as it chanced, Camillus appeared on the scene with a Roman army.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The disconsolate rabble cast themselves at
                    his feet, while their leading men addressed him with words drawn from them by
                    the direst necessity and accompanied by the wailing of the women and children,
                    who were being dragged along as the companions of their exile. He bade the
                    Sutrines spare their lamentations; the Etruscans <pb n="p.205"/> were those to
                    whom he was bringing grief and tears. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="marg">B.C. 389</note>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He then gave orders that the packs should be
                    set down; that the Sutrines should stop there, with a small guard which he left
                    them; and that his soldiers should take their weapons and follow him. So, with
                    his army in light marching order, he set out for Sutrium, where he was not
                    surprised to find everything at loose ends, as a consequence —common enough —of
                    their success; there was no outpost before the walls; the gates were open; and
                    the victors had dispersed and were fetching the booty out of the houses of their
                    enemies. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For the second time, therefore, on
                    the same day, Sutrium was captured. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                    victorious Etruscans were everywhere slaughtered by the new enemy, and had no
                    time given them to assemble and unite their forces or to arm. As they tried,
                    every man for himself, to reach the gates, if by chance they might somehow
                    escape out into the fields, they found them shut, for so the general had ordered
                    in the beginning. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> After that some caught up
                    their swords; others, whom the sudden attack had found already armed, tried to
                    call their fellows together for a battle, and this would have been hotly fought,
                    because of the enemy's despair, had not heralds been dispatched through the town
                    who made proclamation that arms should be laid down and the unarmed receive
                    quarter, and that none should suffer any violence except those that carried
                    weapons. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Then even such as had in their
                    extremity resolved to fight to the death, now that hope of life was held out to
                    them, began everywhere to throw down their swords, and to go unarmed —for

                    possession of empty houses in Veii and had gone there to live. They had indeed
                    murmured at first, and had flouted the order; but the designation of a day and
                    the threat of a capital penalty for failure to return to Rome reduced them from
                    a defiant group to obedient individuals, as each became alarmed for himself.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Rome was now growing in numbers, and in
                    every part at once new buildings were springing up; the state contributed
                    towards the costs, and the aediles forwarded the work as though it had been
                    public business, while the citizens themselves, incited by their desire to be

                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> At the close of the year an election of
                    military tribunes with consular powers was held. Those chosen were Titus
                    Quinctius Cincinnatus, Quintus Servilius Fidenas (for the fifth time), Lucius
                    Julius Iulus, Lucius Aquilius Corvus, Lucius Lucretius Tricipitinus, and Servius
                    Sulpicius Rufus. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> These men led one army
                    against the Aequi, not to war —for they confessed themselves vanquished —but
                    from hatred, in order to waste, their territories and leave them with no
                    strength to make new trouble; with another they invaded the district of
                    Tarquinii, where they captured by assault the Etruscan towns Cortuosa and
                    Contenebra. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> At Cortuosa there was no struggle:
                    in a surprise attack they carried the place at the first shout and onset, and
                    then sacked and burned it. Contenebra held out for a few days, but the
                    continuous fighting, without respite either day or night, overcame them.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The Roman army had been divided into six
                    corps, of which each in its turn went into battle for six hours; while the
                    townsmen were so few that the same men were exposed to an attack that was
                    constantly renewed, until at last they gave way and afforded the Romans an
                    opening to enter the City. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The tribunes
                    decided that the booty should go to the state, but were less prompt in issuing
                    orders than in planning; and, while they procrastinated, it was already in the
                    hands of the soldiers and could not be taken away without offending them. </p>

                    in private buildings only, the Capitol was provided with a substructure of hewn

                    building, the tribunes of the plebs were trying to attract crowds to their

                    held out hopes of the Pomptine district, of which the Romans had then for the

                    undisputed control. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The tribunes brought the
                    charge that this district was worse plagued by the nobility than it had been by
                    the Volsci; for the latter, as long as they were strong enough and had arms, had
                    done no more than make incursions into it; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> but
                    the nobles were taking violent possession of the public domain, and unless it
                    should be parcelled out before they seized it all, there would be no room there
                    for the commons. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They made no great impression
                    on the plebs, who were seldom in the Forum, because they were so intent on
                    building, and, exhausted with the expense thereby incurred, had no thought of
                    land, which they lacked the means of stocking. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The citizens were much given to religious
                    fears, and at that time, owing to the recent calamity, even the leaders were a
                    prey to superstition; so, in order that new auspices might be had, the state
                    went into an interregnum. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The office of
                    interrex was successively held by Marcus Manlius Capitolinus, Servius Sulpicius
                    Camerinus, and Lucius Valerius Potitus. Finally, the last-named held an election
                    of military tribunes and announced that the choice had fallen on Lucius
                    Papirius, Gaius Cornelius, Gaius Sergius, Lucius Aemilius (for the second time),
                    Lucius <pb n="p.213"/> Menenius and Lucius Valerius Publicola (for the <note

                    These men took office at the conclusion of the interregnum. </p>

                    brought up by Lucius Sicinius, a tribune of the plebs, in popular meetings which
                    were now more numerously attended, and by men more easily induced to covet land,
                    than had been the case before. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The senate
                    talked also of war with the Latins and the Hernici, but dread of a greater war

                    Cornelius Maluginensis, Quintus Servilius Fidenas (for a sixth term), Lucius
                    Quinctius Cincinnatus, Lucius Horatius Pulvillus, and Publius Valerius.

                    diverted from the Etruscan war, when a band of fugitives from the Pomptine

                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Latin communities, so they reported,
                    had sent their soldiers to help in the war, but asserted that their government
                    was not involved, since they had merely, as they said, not forbidden their young
                    men to serve, as volunteers, where they liked. </p>

                    senate gave thanks to the gods that Camillus was in office, for in sooth they
                    would have been obliged to make him dictator, if he had been a private citizen;
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> and his colleagues declared that the
                    general control, when any warlike danger threatened, belonged to one man alone,
                    and that they were resolved to subordinate their own authority to Camillus; nor
                    did they believe that there was any derogation of their own dignity in such
                    concessions as they might make to his. The senate commended the tribunes, and
                    Camillus himself, deeply moved, expressed his thanks. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> A heavy responsibility he said, was placed upon him by the
                    Roman People, who had now elected him for the fourth time; no small one by the
                    senate, in so judging of him; but the greatest of all proceeded from the

                    there was more bluster in that quarter than real danger; nevertheless, as he

                    in your captured City, you celebrated, only the other day, a three-fold triumph
                    for a triple victory over these very Volsci and Aequi and over Etruria.

                    his horse, caught hold of the nearest standard bearer and hurried him towards
                    the enemy, calling out: <quote>Forward soldiers!</quote>
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But when they saw Camillus, who for bodily
                    feats was now grown old and infirm, advancing in person against the foe, they
                    all gave a cheer and rushed forward together, and every man took up the cry of

                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> It is even said that Camillus bade the
                    standard-bearer hurl his ensign into the press of enemies, and urging the front
                    ranks to recover it, then for the first time discomfited the Antiates.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The panic did not stop with the first

                    /> It was not only the dash of the Roman soldiers, inspired by their leader's
                    presence, which overcame them; for nothing so daunted the spirits of the Volsci
                    as the sight of Camillus himself, when they happened to encounter him —so
                    surely, wherever he went, did he carry victory with him. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> This was especially apparent on the left. That wing had
                    already nearly given way, when Camillus suddenly threw himself upon a horse,
                    and, armed with an infantry-shield, rode up and by his presence retrieved the
                    battle, calling out that the rest of the army was conquering. <milestone n="7"

                    multitude remained for the weary soldiers to dispatch with long-drawn massacre,
                    when suddenly great gusts of wind brought on a downpour of rain, which broke off
                    what was rather a certain victory than a battle. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                    /> Thereupon the recall was sounded, and the night that followed finished the
                    campaign for the Romans, while they slept. For the Latins and Hernici abandoned
                    the Volsci and marched off to their homes, their evil counsels rewarded with as
                    evil an outcome; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> and the Volsci, perceiving
                    themselves to be deserted by those on whom they had relied in their rebellion,
                    forsook their camp and shut themselves up within the walls of Satricum.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Camillus at first set about confining
                    them with a palisade and mound, intending to lay siege to them; but finding the
                    enemy made no sorties to interrupt the work, he concluded they had not
                    sufficient resolution to make him wait so long for victory. He therefore
                    encouraged his troops not to wear themselves out with protracted toil, as though
                    they were besieging Veii, when victory was within their grasp; and with great
                    alacrity on the part of the soldiers, he approached the walls from every side
                    and captured the town with scaling ladders. The Volsci threw away their weapons
                    and surrendered. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> But the general's thoughts were turning to a
                    matter of greater moment, namely Antium, which, as being the Volscian capital,
                    he held responsible for the last war. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But
                    because, without extensive equipment of artillery and engines, it was impossible
                    to take so strong a town, he left his colleague in command of the army and
                    proceeded to Rome, that he might <pb n="p.225"/> urge the senate to undertake
                    the destruction of <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="marg">B. C.

                    —I suppose it was Heaven's will that the Antian state should continue somewhat
                    longer <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">With this remark compare I. iv.

                    against the Etruscans, saying that the opportunity of lending aid would soon be
                    past. To this quarter Fortune diverted the energies of Camillus, away from
                    Antium. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> For since these places were on the
                    frontier of Etruria, and were the barriers, so to speak, and gateways of that
                    region, the Etruscans were concerned to seize them, as often as they had any new
                    design in hand, and the Romans to recover or defend them. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> The senate therefore resolved to request of Camillus that
                    he should relinquish Antium and undertake the Etruscan war, and voted him the
                    city levies which had been under the command of Quinctius. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Although Camillus would have preferred the army,
                    disciplined and used to his authority, which lay in the Volscian country, he
                    made no objection, only stipulating that Valerius should be associated with him
                    in the command. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Quinctius and Horatius were
                    dispatched to succeed Valerius against the Volsci. </p>
                <p> Leaving the City and marching to Sutrium, Furius and Valerius found that a part
                    of the town was already captured by the Etruscans, and that in the other part
                    the townspeople had barricaded the streets and were defending themselves with
                    great difficulty from the onslaughts of their enemies. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The arrival of succour from Rome, and particularly the
                    great reputation which Camillus enjoyed with both friends and foes, checked for
                    the moment the disastrous course of events and afforded time to render
                    assistance. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Accordingly, Camillus divided the
                    army, <pb n="p.227"/> and directed his colleague to make a circuit with his
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="marg">B. C. 386</note>
                    forces and to attack the walls on the side which was held by the enemy. His hope
                    was not so much that the city would be taken by escalade, as that the enemy
                    might be diverted to that quarter —easing thereby the strain upon the townsmen,
                    who were already worn out with fighting —and that he might himself have an
                    opportunity of entering the place without encountering resistance. <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/> But on this plan being put into effect
                    simultaneously at both points, the Etruscans, finding themselves threatened on
                    either side and seeing that the walls were being violently assailed and that the
                    enemy was inside the city, threw themselves out by the only gate which chanced
                    to be unguarded, in one panic-stricken throng. <milestone n="11" unit="section"
                    /> Great was the carnage they suffered as they fled, both in the city and in the
                    fields. Furius's men slew more within the walls; the soldiers of Valerius were
                    more lightly equipped for pursuit, and kept up the massacre until night made it
                    impossible to see. </p>

                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Having retaken Sutrium and restored it to our
                    allies, the army marched to Nepete, which had surrendered to the Etruscans, who

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> It appeared likely that this town would be
                    more troublesome to recover, not only because it was wholly in the hands of the
                    enemy, but also because a faction of the Nepesini had betrayed their state and
                    arranged the capitulation. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It was nevertheless
                    decided to send word to their leaders, that they should sever themselves from
                    the Etruscans and extend to the Romans the same trusty aid which they had
                    requested at their hands. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When the reply came
                        <pb n="p.229"/> back that they were powerless, that the Etruscans <note

                    walls and guarded the gates, the Romans first laid waste their fields, in an
                    effort to frighten the townsfolk; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> then, when
                    the sanctity of their surrender proved to be more binding on them than that of
                    their alliance, they gathered osiers from the fields and made fascines, and the
                    army being led against the walls filled up the moat, erected scaling ladders,
                    and carried the town at the first shout and charge. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> The Nepesini were then commanded to lay down their weapons
                    and the order was given to spare such as were unarmed. The Etruscans were put to
                    death, whether armed or not. Of the Nepesini, too, those who were responsible
                    for the surrender were executed; the innocent populace were given back their
                    possessions, and the town was left with a garrison. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> After thus regaining from the enemy two cities of the
                    allies, the victorious army under its tribunes marched gloriously back to Rome. </p>
                <p> The same year demands for reparation were made upon the Latins and the Hernici,
                    and they were asked why, during recent years, they had furnished no soldiers, as
                    they had agreed to do. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Both nations replied in
                    plenary assemblies that no blame or evil purpose attached to the state because a
                    few of their young men had served with the Volsci. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> These men had, for that matter, paid the penalty for their
                    distorted judgment, and not one of them had come back; as to their having
                    furnished no soldiers, this had been due to their constant fear of the Volsci —a
                    pest that clung so fast to them that with all that long succession of wars they
                    had been unable to shake it off. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> On learning
                    of this answer, the <pb n="p.231"/> senators were of opinion that they lacked

                    Lucius Papirius Cursor (for the second time) and Gaius Sergius (for the second
                    time), a serious foreign war broke out, and an even more serious domestic
                    schism. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The war was set on foot by the Volsci,
                    in conjunction with a revolt on the part of the Latins and Hernici; the schism
                    originated where such a thing was least to be apprehended, with a man of
                    patrician family and high renown, Marcus Manlius Capitolinus. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> This man, scorning, in his overweening pride, the other
                    nobles, but envying the one who excelled them all in honours and good qualities,
                    namely Marcus Furius, could ill endure that Camillus should at last have
                    attained to such solitary eminence, both amongst the magistrates and in the
                    armies, as to have those who had been chosen under the same auspices not for

                    considered the situation fairly —it would have been impossible for Marcus Furius
                    to redeem his native City from the leaguer of her enemies, unless Manlius
                    himself had before that saved the Capitol and Citadel. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Camillus had assailed the Gauls while they were receiving
                    the gold and while their resolution was relaxed by thoughts of peace; but he
                    himself had driven them back, as they came on, sword in hand, in the act of
                    taking the Citadel. Of the glory of Camillus a goodly portion belonged to all
                    the soldiers who had conquered with him: in his own victory it was acknowledged
                    that no mortal soever had a share. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Puffed up

                    nature, impetuous and passionate, when he perceived that his abilities did not

                    which he thought they merited, he was the first of all the patricians to turn
                    demagogue and to cast in his lot with the plebeian magistrates. He abused the
                    nobles, he courted the favour of the plebs; and swept along by the breath of
                    popularity and not by good counsel chose rather to be reputed great than
                    virtuous. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Moreover, not content with agrarian
                    proposals, which had ever served the tribunes to stir up sedition, he began an
                    attack on credit; for he held that debt was a sharper goad, since it not only
                    threatened poverty and shame, but terrified the freeman with the thought of
                    shackles and imprisonment. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> And in fact there
                    had been a vast piling up of debts, by reason of a thing that is ruinous even to
                    the rich, to wit, building. And so the Volscian war, grave in itself and made
                    still graver by the defection of the Latins and Hernici, was alleged as a reason
                    for seeking a greater authority; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> but the
                    revolutionary schemes of Manlius were the more compelling cause of the senate's
                    naming a dictator. They appointed Aulus Cornelius Cossus, who appointed as his
                    master of the horse Titus Quinctius Capitolinus. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The dictator perceived that a greater struggle
                    was impending at home than abroad. But either the war demanded haste, or he
                    believed that by a victory and triumph he could add power to the dictatorship
                    itself. So he mustered his forces and proceeded to the Pomptine territory, which

                    up —as happens nowadays in the levies of the Romans —which they used for their
                    frequent renewals of war; or that it was not always the same tribes from which
                    they enrolled their armies —though it was always the same nation which made war;

                    of Roman slaves. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> In any case, all the

                    although their state had recently suffered a heavy blow from the generalship and
                    auspices of Camillus. There were, besides, additional forces of Latins and
                    Hernici, as well as a certain number from Circeii, and even Roman colonists from

                    pressed on after them, and as long as they retained their arms and withdrew in

                    Flight and pursuit continued until nightfall. The Volscian camp was also

                    plans for accomplishing the revolution, for he was much bolder and more

                    stationed a strong out-guard before the camp; he then took up his post on an

                    this irresolution the tribunes characterized as an intolerable mockery of the

                    were threatened with attack, more out of hatred of Rome's citizens than of her
                    enemies. The object was to wear the plebeians out with service and give them no
                    time to take breath in the City, or leisure to bethink them of liberty or to
                    stand in the assembly, where they might sometimes hear the voice of a tribune

                    influence to oblige the plebs to elect all patricians to the millitary
                    tribunate; these were Lucius Aemilius, Publius Valerius (for the fourth time),
                    Gaius Veturius Servius Sulpicius, Lucius and Gaius Quinctius Cincinnatus.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The same influence enabled them to carry
                    through their plans against the Latins and the Volsci, who had united their

                    objected when the men of military age were all compelled to take the oath, and
                    three armies were enrolled: one was intended to defend the City; another was for
                    use in sudden expeditions, if a revolt should break out anywhere; a third —much
                    the strongest —marched to Satricum, under Publius Valerius and Lucius Aemilius.

                    the combat was renewed, and for some little time the enemy —particularly the
                    Latin legions, schooled in Roman discipline by their long alliance —resisted
                    with equal courage and success. But the cavalry were sent against them and threw
                    their ranks into confusion, and before they could recover, the infantry were
                    upon them; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> in proportion as the Roman line
                    advanced, was the enemy forced out of his position; and when once the tide of
                    battle turned, there was no stopping the onrush of the Romans. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> The routed enemy made for Satricum, two miles away, instead
                    of their camp, and suffered great slaughter, especially at the hands of the
                    cavalry. Their camp was taken and sacked. The night after the battle they fled
                    rather than marched towards Antium; and though the Roman army followed hard
                    after, fear proved swifter than wrath. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> So the
                    enemy got within the walls before the Romans could harass or delay their rear. A
                    few days were then consumed in ravaging the land, since the Romans had not

                    departed, and freed themselves from all share in what they considered a

                    arms —in burning Satricum, the town which had been their first place of refuge
                    after their defeat. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They applied the torch
                    without discrimination both to sacred and to secular buildings, and not one

                    was unexpected, and the first shout had not died away when the town was taken,

                    and children, and sent off messengers to Rome to let the senate know of their
                    predicament. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> With a promptness worthy of the

                    defending the walls of the town, on the other assailing the fortress, and they
                    experienced themselves the same terror they inspired. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> The arrival of the Romans produced a change in the spirits
                    of both sides: the Tusculans were roused from the depths of despair to the
                    greatest cheerfulness; the Latins, who had felt almost certain that since the
                    town was theirs they would soon possess the citadel, were reduced almost to
                    despair of their own lives. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The Tusculans in
                    the citadel gave a cheer and were answered by one much louder from the Roman
                    army. On both sides the Latins were hard pressed: they could neither resist the
                    charges of the townsmen, as they rushed down from above, nor drive back the

                    fight and no room to escape, and were slain where they stood, to the very last

                    magistracies. The patricians seemed therefore to have regained possession in

                    a mighty change. Marcus Fabius Ambustus <note anchored="true"

                    was far from looking down upon it. This man had married his two daughters, the
                    elder to Servius Sulpicius, the younger to Gaius Licinius Stolo, a man of mark,
                    albeit a plebeian; and the very fact that he had not rejected such an alliance
                    had won regard for Fabius with the common people. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> It fell out that the sisters Fabia were together in the
                    house of Servius Sulpicius, then a consular tribune, and were whiling away the
                    time in talk, as women will, when a lictor of Sulpicius, who was returning from
                    the Forum, rapped on the door, in the usual manner, with his rod. At this the
                    younger Fabia, being unused to the custom, went white, which made the elder
                    laugh with surprise at her sister's ignorance. But that laugh rankled in the

                    reason of her grief, which was too little consistent with sisterly affection and
                    did no great honour to her husband; but he brought her by tender inquiries to
                    confess that she was unhappy in being mated to one beneath her, having married
                    into a house where neither dignities nor influence could enter. <milestone

                <p> At home the situation was more dangerous. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For

                    Stolo's father-in-law, was openly advocating the adoption of the measures he had

                    at first eight members of the college of plebeian tribunes who opposed the

                    be the case with men who forsake their party, were no more than mouthpieces,
                    repeating in justification of their vetoes only what they had been privately
                    schooled to say, to wit, that a majority of the plebeians were absent at

                    that the plebeian should have a farm scarce large enough to contain a shelter
                    for his necessities or a place of burial? <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Or
                    was it their wish that the plebs, undone with usury, should give up their bodies
                    to imprisonment and torture, instead of paying the principal sums they owed? Did
                    they mean every day to drag off gangs of condemned debtors from the Forum? to
                    fill with prisoners the houses of the nobles? to make of every patrician's

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The shame and pity of these conditions awoke
                    more indignation in their hearers, who feared for their own safety, than the
                    speakers had themselves felt in denouncing them. <milestone n="2" unit="section"
                    /> And yet the patricians —as they proceeded to assert —would never check their
                    greed for land, nor cease murdering the plebs with usury, until the commons
                    should elect one of the two consuls from their own number, to guard their

                    become the portion of the plebeian tribunes, for they used the veto to break
                    down their own power. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> There could be no
                    question of equal rights, where the other side commanded and they themselves

                    And let no one think that it would be sufficient if plebeians were accepted as
                    candidates at the consular elections: unless it were required that at least one
                    consul must be chosen from the commons, none ever would be. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Had they already forgotten, that although the election of
                    tribunes of the soldiers rather than <pb n="p.325"/> consuls had been resolved

                    places only now available, the patricians would of their own volition bestow the
                    office on the plebs, when they had habitually claimed eight places in electing
                    military tribunes? Would those men allow the consulship to be approached, who
                    had blocked so long the road to the tribuneship? <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                    /> The law must make good for them what they could not gain by favour at the
                    elections; one of the two consulships must be set apart for the undisputed use
                    of the plebs, for if left in dispute it would always fall a prize to the more
                    powerful. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Neither could it any longer be

                    were none who were suitable for curule magistracies. Had the public
                    administration been a jot more indifferent or slipshod since the tribuneship of
                    Publius Licinius Calvus, who was the first man elected from the plebs, <note

                    patricians had been military tribunes? <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Nay, on
                    the contrary, several patricians had been impeached after holding the
                    tribuneship, but not one plebeian. Quaestors, too, like military tribunes, had
                    begun a few years before to be elected from the commons, nor had the Roman

                        practically identical. The new nobility comprised plebeians as well as
                        patricians, and owing to the tendency of the electorate to continue the same
                        families in office, it became almost as exclusive a body as the old

                    as to the tribunes of the plebs, the commons chose the same men over again —the

                    over the laws; and when the tribes were summoned to vote, and the proposers of

                    patricians were put to their two last shifts —the greatest office, and the

                    adversaries, the proposers <pb n="p.329"/> of the laws on their side armed the

                    with the usual skirmish between the tribunes of the plebs, some of whom urged
                    the passing of the law while others interposed their vetoes. But powerful as the
                    veto was on the legal side, it was being overcome by the popularity of the bills
                    themselves and their proposers, and the tribes which had been summoned first

                    before the matter had been decided either way, Camillus resigned his office,
                    whether because there had been a flaw in his election —as certain writers have
                    held —or because the tribunes proposed to the plebs and the plebs decreed, that

                    that the auspices, and not a law without a precedent, were responsible for his

                    that Publius Manlius was at once made dictator in his place —for what good would
                    his appointment do, in a struggle in which Marcus Furius had been beaten?
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Besides, Marcus Furius himself was
                    dictator again in the following year, and he would surely have been ashamed to

                    occurred between tribunes and consuls, down to the times we can ourselves

                    to be relieved themselves of usury and settled on lands which the nobles had
                    unjustly held, while leaving the men to whom they owed these advantages to grow

                    that in the year of which I am now writing, the dictator, Marcus Furius, fought
                    a battle against the Gauls on Alban soil. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Notwithstanding the great terror occasioned by the invasion of the Gauls and the
                    recollection of their old defeat, the Romans gained a victory that was neither
                    difficult nor uncertain. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Many thousands of
                    barbarians fell in battle, and many after the camp was taken. The others roamed
                    about, making mostly towards Apulia, and owed their escape from the Romans to
                    their distant flight and the dispersion which resulted from their panic and
                    their straggling. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The dictator was awarded a
                    triumph with the consent of both senate and plebs. </p>
                <p> Hardly had Camillus brought the war to an end, when he was confronted with a
                    fiercer opposition in the City. After desperate struggles the senate and the
                    dictator were beaten, and the measures advocated by the tribunes were adopted.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> An election of consuls was held, against
                    the wishes of the nobles, and resulted in the choice of Lucius Sextius, the
                    first of the plebeians to attain that honour. Even this did not end their
                    disputes. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The patricians declared that they
                    would not ratify the election, and the affair had almost led to a <pb n="p.351"
                    /> secession of the plebs and threatened other terrible <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="marg">B.C. 367</note> embroilments, when the
                    dictator finally proposed a compromise which allayed the discord; the nobles
                    gave way to the plebs in regard to the plebeian consul, and the plebs conceded
                    to the nobles that they might elect from the patricians one praetor to
                    administer justice in the City. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> This
                        step was made necessary by the growth of the City and the increasing burden

                        compensation to the patricians for the privileges they were now forced to
                        share with the plebs-until, in <date when="-0337">337 B.C.</date> ( <hi

                    reconciled at last. The senate decided that this was a fitting occasion to

                    celebrating the Great Games, and voted that one day should be added to the

                        unit="section"/> The entire people united in thanks to them, and the senate
