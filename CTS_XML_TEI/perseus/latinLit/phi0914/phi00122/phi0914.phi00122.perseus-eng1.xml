                    Hannibal moved out of his winter encampment. He had tried before this to cross
                    the Apennines, but had failed because of the intolerable cold. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> And the delay had been attended with the greatest danger
                    and anxiety; for when the Gauls, whom the hope of spoil and pillage had excited
                    to revolt, perceived that instead of harrying and plundering the fields of
                    others, their own lands were the seat of war and were burdened with the winter
                    quarters of both armies, they turned their hatred back again from the Romans
                    upon Hannibal. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But though their leaders laid
                    many a plot against him, their treachery to one another saved him, for they gave
                    him information of these conspiracies with the same inconstancy with which they
                    had conspired. Moreover, changing now his dress and now his headgear, <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Polybius says that <quote> he had a
                            number of wigs made, dyed to suit the appearance of persons differing
                            widely in age, and kept constantly changing them, and at the same time
                            also dressing in a style suited to the wig, so that not only those who
                            had seen him but for a moment, but even his familiars, found difficulty
                            in recognizing him </quote> (iii. xxxviii, Paton's Trans.). Livy prefers
                        ambiguity to the use of a technical or undignified word. </note> he
                    protected himself against their plots by the uncertainty which this gave rise
                    to. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Still, the fear of such plots was another
                    reason for quitting his winter quarters early. </p>
                <p> About the same time, on the Ides of March, Gnaeus Servilius entered on his
                    consulship at Rome. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> On his then referring the
                    state of the nation to the senate for discussion, their anger at Gaius Flaminius
                        <pb n="p.201"/> was renewed. They had chosen two consuls, they said, <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 217</note> but had
                    only one; for what proper authority or right of auspices did Flaminius possess?
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Magistrates, they urged, carried with them
                    this prerogative when they set out from home —from their own and the nation's
                    hearth —after celebrating the Latin Festival, sacrificing on the Alban Mount and
                    duly offering up their vows on the Capitol; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    but a private citizen could neither take the auspices with him, nor, if he had
                    left Rome without them, receive them new from the beginning on foreign soil.
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The enemies of Flaminius argued
                        that he was not, in fact, a consul, for, though elected to that office, he
                        had not been duly inaugurated in Rome, but had left the City before taking
                        the auspices. It would not be possible for him to repair the omission in
                        camp, since even a consul who had set out after receiving the auspices was
                        required, in case it was afterwards discovered that there had been some flaw
                        in them, to return to Rome and renew them there, and it followed, a <hi

                    reported simultaneously from many places: that in Sicily the javelins of several
                    soldiers had taken fire, and that in Sardinia, as a horseman was making the
                    round of the night-watch, the same thing had happened to the truncheon which he
                    held in his hand; that many fires had blazed up on the shore; that two shields
                    had sweated blood; that certain soldiers had been struck with lightning; that
                    the sun's disk had seemed to be contracted; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    that glowing stones had fallen from the sky at Praeneste; that at Arpi bucklers
                    had appeared in the sky and the sun had seemed to be fighting with the moon;
                    that at Capena two moons had risen in the daytime; <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> that the waters of Caere had flowed mixed with blood, and
                    that bloodstains had appeared in the water that trickled from the spring of
                    Hercules itself; that at Antium, when some men were reaping, bloody ears of corn
                    had fallen into their basket; that at Falerii the sky had seemed to be rent as
                    it were with a great fissure; and through the opening a bright light had shone;

                    the midst of a shower of rain. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Afterwards
                    less memorable prodigies were also given credence: that certain folk had found
                    their goats to have got woolly fleeces; that a hen had changed into a cock and a
                    cock into a hen. </p>

                    men who vouched for their truth, he consulted the Fathers regarding their
                    religious import. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> It was voted that these
                    prodigies should be expiated, in part with greater, in part with lesser victims,
                    and that a supplication should be held for three days at all the couches of the
                    gods; <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> as for the rest, when the decemvirs
                    should have inspected the Books, such rites were to be observed as they should

                    pounds; and that Juno and Minerva should be given offerings of silver;

                    appeasing the gods and levying troops, Hannibal, who had left his winter
                    quarters, heard that Flaminius, the other consul, had already arrived at
                    Arretium; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> and so, though another route,
                    longer, to be sure, but less difficult, was pointed out to him, he took the
                    shorter, though the marshes, which the river Arno had lately flooded to an
                    unusual extent. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He ordered the Spaniards and
                    the Africans and all the flower of his veteran army, taking their own baggage
                    with them so as not to want the necessities of life wherever they might be
                    forced to halt, to march in the van; the Gauls to follow them and form the
                    centre of the column; and the cavalry to fall in behind. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Mago and the Numidian light horse were to bring up the
                    rear, their principal duty being to keep the Gauls in order, in case they should
                    weary of the long and <pb n="p.207"/> painful march —for the race is ill adapted

                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Those in front only asked that their guides
                    lead on before. Through deep and well-nigh bottomless quagmires left by the
                    flood, almost engulfed in the mud into which they plunged, they nevertheless
                    followed on after their standards. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But the
                    Gauls could neither keep from falling when they slipped, nor regain their
                    footing, once they had plunged into a hole; the flesh was neither sustained by
                    the spirit nor the spirit by hope. Some could hardly drag their tired limbs
                    along; others, their courage yielding once for all to their weariness, dropped
                    down and died amongst the baggage-animals, for these too were lying all about.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> What distressed them most of all was the
                    want of sleep, which they had now endured for four days and three nights.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And since everything was under water and
                    they could find no dry spot on which to stretch their weary bodies, they would
                    pile their packs in the flood and lie down on these; <milestone n="9"

                    about along the line of march would afford a makeshift bed —for all they asked
                    was a place that stood out above the water, where they could snatch a little
                    sleep. </p>

                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Hannibal himself, whose eyes were suffering
                    in the first place from the trying spring weather, alternating betwixt hot and
                    cold, rode upon the sole surviving elephant, that he might be higher above the

                    when, lo! another disaster was reported, for which they were quite unprepared.
                    Four thousand horse under the propraetor Gaius Centenius had been sent by the
                    Consul Servilius to join his colleague; but on hearing of the battle at
                    Trasumennus they had turned aside into Umbria, and had there fallen into the

                    affected people variously: some, whose thoughts were taken up with a greater
                    sorrow, regarded this fresh loss of the cavalry as trivial in comparison with
                    their former losses; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> others refused to judge
                    of the misfortune as an isolated fact, but held that, just as when a man was
                    sick, any disorder, however slight, was felt more than a worse one would be

                    was sick and suffering, any untoward occurrence should be gauged not by its
                    intrinsic importance but by the enfeebled condition of the commonwealth, which
                    could endure no aggravation. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> And so the
                    citizens had recourse to a remedy that had now for a long time neither been
                    employed nor needed —the creation of a dictator. And because the consul, who
                    alone was supposed to possess the power to nominate one, was absent, and because
                    it was no easy matter, when Italy was beset with Punic arms, to get a courier or
                    a letter through to him, they did what had never been done until that day, and
                    created a dictator by popular election. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Their

                    entrusted the task of strengthening the walls and towers of the City, of

                    began to provoke and try his temper by frequent shifting of his camp and by

                    undertaken from a safe position and with a place of refuge close at hand, he at

                    Fabius was informed of this by his scouts. Feeling certain that Hannibal would
                    leave the Falernian district, by the same passes through which he had entered

                    had bade him proceed as far as was compatible with safety, and retire before the

                    soon as Mancinus perceived that the enemy would not give over the pursuit, and
                    that he could not hope <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> to get away, he
                    rallied his men and led them back into the fight, though overmatched in every

                    on heights, which they use both as watch-towers and also for protection against

                    together to their ships, as though their object were rather to flee the shore

                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The other was something that he did himself,

                    was close at hand, he himself did something that would almost seem incredible,

                    to fight a battle, for his forces were so small that he was hardly able to

                    objected now that the victory was won, and persisted in drawing out the war and

                    Cales and Falerii had been utterly laid waste; while the dictator sat still at

                    dictator with his master of the horse; and this action, to which history could
                    afford no parallel, had been taken in that very state in which masters <pb

                    Accordingly, on the day of his first meeting with Quintus Fabius, he said that
                    the very first thing to be settled was the manner in which they should exercise
                    the joint command: <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> he himself thought that the

                        says that it was Fabius who proposed the alternation, and that Minucius
                        preferred that the army be divided. </note> or, if longer periods seemed

                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This proposal by no means suited Quintus
                    Fabius, for he saw that everything which his rash colleague should have got
                    control of would be controlled by Fortune: he had been made, he said, to share
                    the supreme command with another, not deprived of it; <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> he would therefore never voluntarily relinquish that share
                    which he possessed of the power to guide the campaign prudently; he would not
                    divide with Minucius the times or days of commanding, but would divide the army,
                    and in accordance with his own plans would save what he could, since he was not
                    permitted to save everything. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> In this way he
                    brought about a division of the legions, such as was customary between consuls.
                    The first and fourth fell to Minucius, the second and third to Fabius.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> In like manner they divided equally the

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> All this caused Hannibal a twofold joy, for,
                    fully acquainted as he was with whatever went on amongst his enemies both from
                    much information brought in by deserters and from the discoveries of his own
                    spies, he reckoned on entrapping <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> the
                    uncontrolled rashness of Minucius after his own fashion, while he saw that the

                <p>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> There was a hill between the camp of Minucius
                    and that of the Phoenicians, and it was certain that he who occupied it would
                    place his enemy in a rather bad position. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This
                    Hannibal was desirous not so much of capturing without a struggle —though this
                    would have been worth while —as of using to bring on a battle with Minucius, who
                    would sally forth, as he well knew, to oppose him. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> It appeared at first sight that none of the ground between
                    could be used for an ambush, since it not only had nothing on it in the shape of
                    trees, but was nowhere so much as screened with brambles. But in fact it was
                    formed by nature for covering an ambuscade —all the more because in a bare
                    valley no such trap could be suspected —for in its windings there were hollow
                    cliffs, so large that some of them would hold two hundred soldiers. <milestone

                    thousand foot and horse —as many in each as could readily lie in wait there.

                    general himself, as fatuous and rash as anyone, called the men to arms and
                    railed at the enemy with idle threats. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> First
                    he ordered out the light infantry; then he sent the cavalry off in a solid
                    column; finally, when he saw that the enemy too were bringing up supports, he
                    set forth with his legions in battle array. Hannibal likewise, as the struggle
                    waxed hotter and his men were sore bested, sent in reinforcement after
                        <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> reinforcement, horse and foot, till he
                    now had a regular army in the field, and both sides were engaged with all their

                    were advancing from the lower ground on to the height which the enemy had
                    already occupied, was the first to suffer a repulse, and as they were driven
                    downhill, caused a panic among the cavalry, which was coming up behind them, and
                    fled to the standards of the legions. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> These
                    alone maintained their line undaunted, when all the rest were in full flight,
                    and it looked as if, had the battle been a regular front-to-front engagement,
                    they would have proved fully equal to their enemy —so encouraged had they been
                    by the successful action a few days before. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    But the men in ambush, suddenly springing out and charging them on both flanks
                    and in the rear, worked such havoc and alarm that not one of them had any

                    slaves appeared on the scene, one belonging to a Formian, the other to a

                        According to Polybius (III. cvii. ff.), Servilius, consul in 217, was still

                        seized the citadel of Cannae, which the Romans had been using as a granary.
                        On receiving the disquieting news of this serious loss, Servilius sent to
                        Rome and asked for instructions. The senate decided to give battle, and sent
                        the new consuls to the front to take command. The engagement at Cannae was

                    making up some fires, as before, and leaving a few tents standing where they

                    fear of an ambush, as before. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        Weissenborn suggests the possibility that the repetition of this stratagem
                        in Livy's narrative may be due to a combination of different versions
                        occurring respectively in Coelius Antipater and in Valerius Antias. The
                        whole passage (chap. xl. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> —chap. xliii.) is
                        discussed by De Sanctis, III. 2, p. 59.90, who regards the story of the two
                        camps at Gereonium as a repetition of the situation on the Aufidus (chap.
                        xliv. § 1). The scarcity of provisions attributed to Hannibal was invented,
                        he thinks, in order to make it appear the less excusable in the Romans to
                        have accepted battle. The new skirmish at Gereonium is a repetition of the
                        one to which Polybius refers as taking place fifty stades from Cannae.
                        Finally, the stratagem of the abandoned camp is ridiculous and absurd, for
                        the Romans had only to occupy it with a couple of legions and Hannibal would
                        have found it very difficult to recover, and even if Aemilius had chosen to
                        allow Hannibal to return to his camp, he would have deserved a court-martial
                        if he had not first destroyed the tents and levelled the camp and filled the
                        trenches. De Sanctis thinks that the whole episode is characteristic of
                        Valerius Antias. </note>

                    Cannae, had been more concerned with the projects of a conqueror than with those
                    of one who was still waging war. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Mustering the
                    prisoners and dividing them into two groups, he addressed a few kindly words to
                    the allies and dismissed them without ransom, as he had done previously at the
                    Trebia and Lake Trasumennus. He then called up the Romans also and spoke to them
                    with a mildness he had never shown before. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He
                    was waging, he said, no war of extermination with them, but was contending for
                    honour and dominion. His forerunners had yielded to the valour of the Romans,
                    and he was striving to compel them in their turn to yield to his own good
                    fortune and valour. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He would therefore give
                    them an opportunity to redeem the prisoners, and would fix their ransom at five
                    hundred chariot-pieces for each horseman, three hundred for each foot-soldier,
                    and a hundred for each slave. </p>

                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Although this was a rather large addition to
                    the ransom which the horsemen had agreed to on surrendering, they joyfully
                    accepted any terms of treaty. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It was resolved
                    that the prisoners should themselves elect ten representatives to go to the
                    senate in Rome; nor did Hannibal take any other pledge of their good faith than
                    their oath that they would return. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Carthalo, a
                    Carthaginian noble, was sent with them, so that, if he should see that the <pb

                    caught up with his companions. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When the news
                    reached Rome that they were coming, a lictor was sent to meet Carthalo on the

                        of your neglect. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> For we did not yield up
                        our swords through fear on the field of battle, but standing on the heaped

                        retired to our camp. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The rest of the day
                        and the succeeding night, though exhausted with fighting and with wounds, we
                        defended the stockade. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> On the following

                        no disgrace that when fifty thousand of our troops had been cut down, some
                        few Roman soldiers should survive the battle of Cannae, we finally
                        stipulated <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> for a price at which we might
                        be ransomed, and delivered to the enemy the arms in which there was no

                        Tarentum to ransom prisoners. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And yet
                        neither the battle with the Gauls at the Allia nor that with Pyrrhus at
                        Heraclea owed its unhappy fame so much to carnage as to craven flight. At
                        Cannae the plains are covered with heaps of Roman corpses, and if we
                        survive, it is only because our enemies' swords were dulled and their
                        strength spent with slaughtering. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> There
                        are some of us, too, who were never even in the battle, but were left to

                        haply you should incline to deal harshly by us —which we do not in the least
                        deserve —to what enemy would you be leaving us? To a Pyrrhus, pray, who
                        treated his prisoners like <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> guests? or to
                        a barbarian and Phoenician, of whom it can hardly be determined whether his
                        avarice or cruelty be <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> greater? If you
                        could behold the fetters, the squalor, the degradation of your
                        fellow-citizens, assuredly the sight would move you no less profoundly than
                        if, on the other hand, you saw your legions lying slaughtered on the fields
                        of Cannae. One thing you can see —the distress and tears of our kinsmen who
                        are standing at the entrance of the Curia awaiting your <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> decision. When these people are in such suspense and
                        agony for us and for those who are absent, what think you the men themselves
                        must feel whose life and liberty are hanging in the balance? If Hannibal

                        pleased, against his nature, to show us mercy, we should nevertheless deem
                        life a worthless boon, if we had seemed to you unworthy of being ransomed.
                        There once came back to Rome some prisoners whom Pyrrhus had allowed to go
                        scot-free; but they came back in company with envoys, the first men of the

                        Am I to come back to my country as a citizen not reckoned to be worth three

                        citizens before he could break through their enemies: Can their country wish
                        to recover such citizens as these? <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> If the

                            place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 216</note> courageous to force
                        their way through and return to their country, free and armed. <milestone
                            n="19" unit="section"/> Nor did these six hundred encounter any
                        opposition from the enemy; how safe then, think you, would have been their
                        march, if they had amounted almost to two legions? <milestone n="20"
                            unit="section"/> You would have to-day under arms at Canusium, Conscript
                        Fathers, twenty thousand brave and loyal men. But how can these men now be
                        good and loyal citizens —for they themselves would hardly claim to be brave?
                            <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> Unless we are to believe that they
                        helped their comrades to sally out, when in fact they tried to prevent the
                        sally; or that they grudge not those men both the safety and the renown
                        their courage has earned them, knowing, as they do, that fear and cowardice
                        are the cause of their own disgraceful servitude. They had a good chance of
                        escaping in the silence of the night, but preferred to hide in their tents
                        and await both the day and the enemy. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> But
                        perhaps, though they lacked the courage to sally forth, they had courage
                        enough for a valiant defence of the camp? Perhaps they were besieged for
                        several days and nights, and protected the rampart with their swords, and
                        themselves with the rampart? <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> and finally,
                        after suffering the last extremities, when every support of life gave out
                        and their strength was so impaired with hunger that they could now no longer
                        hold up their shields, they were overcome by the necessities of human nature
                        and not by arms? <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> Nay, the sun was up when
                        the enemy approached the rampart, and the day was not two hours old when,
                        without once putting their fortune to the test of battle, they surrendered
                        both their arms and their persons. Such, mark you, were <pb n="p.405"/> the
                        exploits these men performed during two days. <note anchored="true"

                        for their stockade, they surrendered the camp, worthless alike in the field
                        and behind entrenchments. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/> And you would
                        have us ransom you? When it is time to sally from your camp, you hesitate
                        and stop there; when it is needful that you stop and defend it with your
                        swords, you hand over camp and swords and your own bodies to the enemy!
                            <milestone n="27" unit="section"/> No, Conscript Fathers, I would no
                        more vote for ransoming these men than I would for giving those others up to
                        Hannibal, who forced their way from the camp through the midst of enemies,
                        and, by exerting the utmost valour, gave themselves back to their country.
