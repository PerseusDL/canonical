                        Hannibal, after an uninterrupted march of four days and three nights, ar-
					rives in Etruria, through the marshes, in which he lost an eye. Caius
					Flaminius, the consul, an inconsiderate man, having gone forth in opposi-
					tion to the omens, dug up the standards which could not otherwise be
					raised, and been thrown from his horse immediately after he had
					mounted, is insnared by Hannibal, and cut off by his army near the
					Thrasimene lake. Three thousand who had escaped are placed in chains
					by Hannibal, in violation of pledges given. Distress occasioned in Rome
					by the intelligence. The Sibylline books consulted, and a sacred spring
					decreed. Fabius Maximus sent as dictator against Hannibal, whom he
					frustrates by caution and delay. Marcus Minucius, the master of the
					horse, a rash and impetuous man, inveighs against the caution of Fabius,
					and obtains an equality of command with him. The army is divided be-
					tween them, and Minucius engaging Hannibal in an unfavourable position,
					is reduced to the extremity of danger, and is rescued by the dictator, and
					places himself under his authority. Hannibal, after ravaging Campania,
					is shut up by Fabius in a valley near the town of Casilinum, but escapes
					by night, putting to flight the Romans on guard by oxen with lighted
					faggots attached to their horns. Hannibal attempts to excite a suspicion
					of the fidelity of Fabius by sparing his farm while ravaging with fire
					the whole country around it. Aemilius Paulus and Terentius
					Varro are routed at Cann≈ì, and forty thousand men slain, among whom
					were Paulus the consul, eighty senators, and thirty who had served the
					office of consul, praetor, or aedile. A design projected by some noble youths
					of quitting Italy in despair after this calamity, is intrepidly quashed by
					Publius Cornelius Scipio, a military tribune, afterwards surnamed Afri-
					canus. Successes in Spain, eight thousand slaves are enlisted by the Ro-
					mans, they refuse to ransom the captives, they go out in a body to meet
					Varro, and thank him for not having despaired of the commonwealth.

                    SPRING was now at hand, when Hannibal quitted his winter quarters, having both attempted in vain to cross the Apennines, from the intolerable cold, and having remained with great danger and alarm.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    The Gauls, whom the hope of plunder and spoil had collected, when, instead of being themselves engaged in carrying and driving away booty from the fields of others, they saw their own lands made the seat of war, and burdened by the wintering of the armies of both parties, turned their hatred back again from the Romans upon Hannibal;
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    and though plots were frequently concerted

                    against him by their chieftains, he was preserved by the treachery they manifested towards each other; disclosing their conspiracy with the same inconstancy with which they had conspired; and by changing sometimes his dress, at other times the fashion of his hair, he protected himself from treachery by deception.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    However, this fear was the cause of his more speedily quitting his winter quarters. Meanwhile Cneius Servilius, the consul, entered upon his office at Rome, on the ides of March.

                    There, when he had consulted the senate on the state of the republic in general, the indignation against Flaminius was rekindled. They said

                        That their magistrates took these with them from home, from the tutelar deities of themselves and the state, after the celebration of the Latin holidays; the sacrifice upon the mountain being completed, and the vows duly offered up in the Capitol:
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        that neither could an unofficial individual take the auspices, nor could one who had gone from home without them, take them new, and for the first time, in a foreign soil.

                    Prodigies announced from many places at the same time, augmented the terror: in Sicily, that several darts belonging to the soldiers had taken fire; and in Sardinia, that the staff of a horseman, who was going His rounds upon a wall, took fire as he held it in his hand; that the shores had blazed with frequent fires; that two shields had sweated blood at Praeneste;
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    that redhot stones had fallen from the heavens at Arpi; that shields were seen in the heavens, and the sun fighting with the moon, at Capena; that two moons rose in the daytime; that the waters of Caere had flowed mixed with blood; and that even the fountain of Hercules had flowed sprinkled with spots of blood.

                    In the territory of Antium, that bloody ears of corn had fallen into the basket as they were reaping.

                    At Capua, that there had been the appearance of the heavens being on fire, and of the moon as falling amidst rain.

                    was given to prodigies of less magnitude: that the goats of certain persons had borne wool; that a hen had changed herself into a cock; and a cock into a hen:
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    these things having been laid before the senate as reported, the authors being conducted into the senate-house, the consul took the sense of the fathers on religious affairs.
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    It was decreed that those prodigies should be expiated, partly with full-grown, partly with sucking victims; and that a supplication should be made at every shrine for the space of three days;
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    that the other things should be done accordingly as the gods should declare in their oracles to be agreeable to their will when the decemviri had examined the books.
                    <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    By the advice of the decemviri it was decreed, first, that a golden thunderbolt of fifty pounds' weight should be made as an offering to Jupiter; that offerings of silver should be presented to Juno and Minerva; that sacrifices of full-grown victims should be offered to Juno Regina on the Aventine; and to Juno Sospita at Lanuvium; that the matrons, contributing as much money as might be convenient to each, should carry it to the Aventine, as a present to Juno Regina; and that a lectisternium should be celebrated.
                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    Moreover, that the very freed-women should, according to their means, contribute money from which a present might be made to Feronia. When these things were done, the decemviri sacrificed with the larger victims in the forum at Ardea.
                    <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    Lastly, it being now the month of December, a sacrifice was made at the temple of Saturn at Rome, and a lectisternium ordered, in which senators prepared the couch and a public banquet.
                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    Proclamation was made through the city, that the Saturnalia should be kept for a day and a night; and the people were commanded to account that day as a holiday, and observe it for ever.

                    While the consul employs himself at Rome in appeasing the gods and holding the levy, Hannibal, setting out from his winter quarters, because it was reported that the consul Flaminius had now arrived at Arretium, although a

                    He ordered the Spaniards and Africans (in these lay the strength of his veteran army) to lead, their own baggage being intermixed with them, lest, being compelled to halt any where, they should want what

                    might be necessary for their use: the Gauls he ordered to go next, that they might form the middle of the marching body;
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    the cavalry to march in the rear: next, Mago with the light-armed Numidians to keep the army together, particularly coercing the Gauls, if, fatigued with exertion and the length of the march, as that nation is wanting in vigour for such exertions, they should fall away or halt.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    The van still followed the standards wherever the guides did but lead them, through the exceeding deep and almost fathomless eddies of the river, nearly swallowed up in mud, and plunging themselves in.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    The Gauls could neither support themselves when fallen, nor raise themselves from the eddies. Nor did they sustain their bodies with spirit, nor their minds with hope; some scarce dragging on their wearied limbs;
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    others dying where they had once fallen, their spirits being subdued with fatigue, among the beasts which themselves also lay prostrate in every place. But chiefly watching wore them out, endured now for four days and three nights.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    When, the water covering every place, not a dry spot could be found where they might stretch their weary bodies, they laid themselves down upon their baggage, thrown in heaps into the waters.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Piles of beasts, which lay every where through the whole route, afforded a necessary bed for temporary repose to those seeking any place which was not under water.

                    Hannibal himself, riding on the only remaining elephant, to be the higher from the water, contracted a disorder in his eyes, at first from the unwholesomeness of the vernal air, which is attended with transitions from heat to cold;
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>

                    Many men and cattle having been lost thus wretchedly, when at length he had emerged from the marshes, he pitches his camp as soon as he could on dry ground. And here he received information, through the scouts sent in advance, that the Roman army was round the walls of Arretium.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Next the plans and temper of the consul, the situation of the country, the roads, the sources from which provisions might be obtained, and whatever else it was useful to know; all these things he ascertained by the most diligent inquiry.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    The country was among the most fertile of Italy, the plains

                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    The consul was haughty from his former consulship, and felt no proper degree of reverence not only for the laws and the majesty of the fathers, but even for the gods. This temerity, inherent in his nature, fortune had fostered by a career of prosperity and success in civil and military affairs.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Thus it was sufficiently evident that, heedless of gods and men, he would act in all cases with presumption and precipitation; and, that he might fall the more readily into the errors natural to him, the Carthaginian begins to fret and irritate him;

                    and leaving the enemy on his left, he takes the road to Faesulae, and marching through the centre of Etruria, with intent to plunder, he exhibits to the consul, in the distance, the greatest devastation he could with fires and slaughters.

                    Flaminius, who would not have rested even if the enemy had remained quiet; then, indeed, when he saw the property of the allies driven and carried away almost before his eyes, considering that it reflected disgrace upon him that the Carthaginian now roaming at large through the heart of Italy, and marching without resistance to storm the very walls of Rome, though every other person in the council advised safe rather than showy measures, urging that he should wait for his colleague, in order

                    It now began to appear that Hannibal was hemmed in, the road to Casilinum being blockaded; and that while Capua, and Samnium, and so many wealthy allies in the rear of the Romans might supply them with provisions, the Carthaginian, on the other hand, must winter amid the rocks of Formiae and the sands and hideous swamps of Liternum.

                    Nor did it escape Hannibal that he was assailed by his own arts; wherefore, since he could not escape by way of Casilinum, and since it was necessary to make for the mountains, and pass the summit of Callicula, lest in any place the Romans should attack his troops while enclosed in valleys;
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    having hit upon a stratagem calculated to deceive the sight, and excite terror from its appearance, by means of which he might baffle the enemy, he resolved to come up by stealth to the mountains at the commencement of night.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    The preparation of his wily stratagem was of this description. Torches, collected from every part of the country, and bundles of rods and dry cuttings, are fastened before the horns of oxen, of which, wild and tame, he had driven away a great number among other plunder of the country: the number of oxen was made up to nearly two thousand.

                    To Hasdrubal was assigned the task of driving to the mountains that herd, after having set fire to their horns, as soon as ever it was dark; particularly, if he could, over the passes beset by the enemy.

                    When they arrived at the foot of the mountains and the narrow passes, the signal is immediately given for setting fire to their horns and driving them violently up the mountains before them.

But the night, when the fear was equally shared, kept them from commencing the battle till morning.

                    From the Peligni the Carthaginian turned his course, and going back again to Apulia, reached Geronium, a city deserted by its inhabitants from fear, as a part of its walls had fallen down together in ruins.

                    Cneius Scipio, when he heard that the enemy had quitted his winter quarters, at first formed the same plan; but afterwards, not daring to engage him by land, from a great rumour of fresh auxiliaries, he advances to meet him with a fleet of thirty-five ships, having put some chosen soldiers on board.

                    Setting out from Tarraco, on the second day, he reached a convenient station, ten miles from the mouth of the Iberus. Two ships of the Massilians, sent forward from that place reconnoitring, brought word back that the Carthaginian fleet was stationed in the mouth of the river, and that the camp was pitched upon the bank.

                    From them first, a view of the ships of the enemy having been obtained, the signal was given to Hasdrubal; and a tumult arose in the camp, and on land sooner than on the ships and at sea; the dashing of the oars and other nautical noises not being yet distinctly heard, nor the promontories disclosing the fleet. Upon this, suddenly one horseman after another, sent out by Hasdrubal, orders those who were strolling upon the shore or resting quietly in their tents, expecting any thing rather than the enemy and a battle on that day, immediately to embark and take up arms: that the Roman fleet was now a short distance from the harbour.

                    Scarcely had all embarked, when some, unfastening the hawsers, are carried out against the anchors; others cut their cables, that nothing might impede them; and by doing every thing with hurry and precipitation, the duties of mariners were impeded by the preparations of the soldiers, and the soldiers were prevented from taking and preparing for action their arms, by the bustle of the mariners.

                    And now the Roman was not only approaching, but had drawn up his ships for the battle. The Carthaginians, therefore, thrown into disorder, not more by the enemy and the battle than by their own tumult, having rather made an attempt at fighting than commenced a battle, turned their fleet for flight; and as the mouth of the river which was before them could not be entered in so broad a line, and by so many pressing in at the same time, they ran their ships on shore in every part.
