                <argument>
                    <p> Cneius Fulvius, pro-consul, defeated by Hannibal and slain; the consul,
                        Claudius Marcellus, engages him with better success. Hannibal, raising his
                        camp, retires; Marcellus pursues, and forces him to an engagement. They
                        fight twice; in the first battle, Hannibal gains the advantage; in the
                        second, Marcellus. Tarentum betrayed to Fabius Maximus, the consul. Scipio
                        engages with Hasdrubal, the son of Hamilcar, at Baetula, in Spain, and
                        defeats him. Among other prisoners, a youth of royal race and exquisite
                        beauty is taken; Scipio sets him free, and sends him, enriched with
                        magnificent presents, to his uncle Masinissa. Marcellus and Quintus
                        Crispinus, consuls, drawn into an ambuscade by Hannibal; Marcellus is slain,
                        Crispinus escapes. Operations by Publius Sulpicius, praetor, against Philip
                        and the Achaeans. A census held; the number of citizens found to amount to
                        one hundred and thirty-seven thousand one hundred and eight: from which it
                        appears how great a loss they had sustained by the number of unsuccessful
                        battles they had of late been engaged in. Hasdrubal, who had crossed the
                        Alps with a reinforcement for Hannibal, defeated by the consuls, Marcus
                        Livius and Claudius Nero, and slain; with him fell fifty-six thousand men.
                    </p>
                </argument>
                <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> SUCH was the state of affairs in Spain. In
                    Italy, the consul Marcellus, after regaining Salapia, which was betrayed into
                    his hands, took Maronea and Meles from the Samnites by force. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> As many as three thousand of the soldiers of Hannibal,
                    which were left as a garrison, were here surprised and overpowered. The booty,
                    and there was a considerable quantity of it, was given up to the troops. Also,
                    two hundred and forty thousand pecks of wheat, with a hundred and ten thousand
                    peeks of barley, were found here. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The joy,
                    however, thus occasioned, was by no means so great as a disaster sustained a few
                    days afterwards, not far from the town Herdonea. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                    /> Cneius Fulvius, the consul, was lying encamped there, in the hope of
                    regaining <pb n="1090" xml:id="p.1090"/> Herdonea, which had revolted from the
                    Romans after the defeat at Cannae, his position being neither sufficiently
                    secure, from the nature of the place, nor strengthened by guards. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> The natural negligence of the general was now
                    increased by the hope that their attachment to the Carthaginians was shaken,
                    when they had heard that Hannibal, after the loss of Salapia, had retired from
                    that neighbourhood into Bruttium. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Intelligence
                    of all these circumstances being conveyed to Hannibal by secret messengers from
                    Herdonea, at once excited an anxious desire to retain possession of a city in
                    alliance with him, and inspired a hope of attacking the enemy when unprepared.
                    With a lightly equipped force he hastened to Herdonea by forced marches, so as
                    almost to anticipate the report of his approach; and in order to strike greater
                    terror into the enemy, came up with his troops in battle-array. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> The Roman, equal to him in courage, but inferior in
                    strength, hastily drawing out his troops, engaged him. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The fifth legion and the left wing of the allied infantry
                    commenced the battle with spirit. But Hannibal ordered his cavalry, on a signal
                    given, to ride round, as soon as the foot forces had their eyes and thoughts
                    occupied with the contest before <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> them, and
                    one half of them to attack the camp of the enemy, the other half to fall upon
                    their rear, while busily engaged in fighting. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    He himself, sarcastically alluding to the similarity of the name Fulvius, as he
                    had defeated Cneius Fulvius, the praetor, two years ago, in the same country,
                    expressed his confidence that the issue of the battle would be similar.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Nor was this expectation vain; for after
                    many of the Romans had fallen in the close contest, and in the engagement with
                    the infantry, notwithstanding which they still preserved their ranks and stood
                    their ground; the alarm occasioned by the cavalry on their rear, and the enemy's
                    shout, which was heard at the same time from their camp, first put to flight the
                    sixth legion, which being posted in the second line, was first thrown into
                    confusion by the Numidians; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> and then the
                    fifth legion, and those who were posted in the van. <milestone n="13"
                        unit="section"/> Some fled precipitately, others were slain in the middle
                    space, where also Cneius Fulvius himself, with eleven military tribunes, fell.
                    Who can state with certainty how many thousands of the Romans and their allies
                    were slain in this battle, when I find in some accounts that thirteen, in others
                    that not more than seven, thousand were slain? <milestone n="14" unit="section"
                    /> The <pb n="1091" xml:id="p.1091"/> conquerors got possession of the camp and
                    the spoil. Finding that Herdonea would have revolted to the Romans, and was not
                    likely to continue faithful to him if he departed thence, he removed all its
                    inhabitants to Metapontum and Thurium, and burnt it. <milestone n="15"
                        unit="section"/> He put to death the chief men who were found to have held
                    secret conferences with Fulvius. Such of the Romans as escaped this dreadful
                    carnage, fled half-armed, by different roads, into Samnium, to the consul
                    Marcellus. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Marcellus, who was not much discouraged at
                    this so great a disaster, sent a letter to the senate at Rome, with an account
                    of the loss of the general and army at Herdonea; <milestone n="2" unit="section"
                    /> observing, however, <quote> that he who, after the battle of Cannae, had
                        humbled Hannibal when elated with victory, was now marching against him, and
                        that he would cause that his present joy and exultation should not continue
                        long. </quote>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At Rome, indeed, the grief occasioned by what
                    had occurred, and the fears entertained for the future, were excessive.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The consul passing out of Samnium into
                    Lucania, pitched his camp at Numistro, on a plain within view of Hannibal, who
                    occupied a hill. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He added also another
                    demonstration of his confidence; for he was the first to lead out his troops to
                    battle, nor did Hannibal decline fighting when he saw the standards carried out
                    from the gates. However, they drew up their forces so that the right wing of the
                    Carthaginians was extended up the hill, while the left wing of the Romans was
                    contiguous to the town. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For a long time
                    neither side had any advantage; but the battle having continued from the third
                    hour till night, and the first lines, which consisted, on the part of the
                    Romans, of the first legion and the right wing of the allied infantry, on the
                    part <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> of Hannibal, of the Spanish soldiers,
                    the balearic slingers, and the elephants, which were driven into the field after
                    the commencement of the battle, being fatigued with fighting, the first legion
                    was relieved by the third, and the right wing of allied infantry by the left;
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> while on the part of the enemy fresh
                    troops took up the battle in place of those who were tired. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> A new and desperate conflict suddenly arose, instead of
                    that which was so feebly maintained, their minds and bodies being unimpaired by
                    fatigue; but night separated the combatants while the victory was undecided. The
                    following day the Romans stood drawn up for battle from sunrise till <pb
                        n="1092" xml:id="p.1092"/> late in the day; but none of the enemy coming out
                    against them, they gathered the spoils at their leisure, and collecting the
                    bodies of their own troops into a heap, burnt them. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> The following night Hannibal decamped in silence, and moved
                    off into Apulia. As soon as daylight discovered the flight of the enemy,
                    Marcellus, leaving his wounded under the protection of a small garrison at
                    Numistro, in command of which he placed Lucius Furius Purpureo, a military
                    tribune, commenced a close pursuit of Hannibal, and overtook him at Venusia.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Here, during several days, parties of
                    troops sallying from the outposts, battles took place between foot and horse
                    promiscuously, rather irregular than important, but which for the most part were
                    favourable to the Romans. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The armies were
                    marched thence through Apulia without any engagement worth recording; for
                    Hannibal marched by night, seeking an opportunity for ambuscade, but Marcellus
                    never followed him except in broad daylight, and after having explored the
                    country. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> In the mean time, while Flaccus was detained
                    at Capua in selling the property of the nobles, and letting out the lands which
                    had been forfeited, all of which he let for a rent to be paid in corn, lest
                    occasions for exercising severity towards the Campanians should be wanting, a
                    new piece of iniquity, which had been ripening in secret, was brought out in
                    evidence. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He had compelled his soldiers,
                    withdrawn from the houses, to build for themselves huts after the military
                    manner, near the gates and walls; at once, that the houses of the city might be
                    let and occupied together with the land, and also through fear, lest the
                    excessive luxury of the city should enervate his troops as it had those of
                    Hannibal. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Now most of these were formed of
                    hurdles or boards, others of reeds interwoven, all being covered with straw, as
                    if combustible materials had been employed on purpose. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> A hundred and seventy Campanians, headed by the Blosii who
                    were brothers, had formed a conspiracy to set fire to all these at one hour of
                    the night; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> but information of the conspiracy
                    having been given by one of the slaves of the Blosii, the gates were suddenly
                    closed by the command of the proconsul, and after the soldiers had been
                    assembled under arms, on a signal given, all who were implicated in the guilt
                    were seized, and, after a rigorous examination, were condemned and executed.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The <pb n="1093" xml:id="p.1093"/>
                    informers were rewarded with liberty and ten thousand <hi rend="italics"
                        >asses</hi> each. The people of Nuceria and Acerra, who complained that they
                    had no where to dwell, Acerra being partly burnt, and Nuceria demolished,
                    Fulvius sent to Rome to the senate. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Permission
                    was given to the people of Acerra to rebuild what had been destroyed by fire.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The people of Nuceria were removed to
                    Atella, as they preferred; the people of Atella being ordered to migrate to

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> At the close of this year, Caius Laelius, the
                    lieutenant-general of Scipio, came to Rome on the thirty-fourth day after he set
                    out from Tarraco, and entering the city accompanied by a train of captives, drew
                    together a great concourse of people. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The next
                    day, on being brought into the senate, he stated that Carthage, the capital of
                    Spain, had been captured in one day, that several cities which had revolted were
                    regained, and that fresh ones had been received into alliance. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> From the prisoners, information was gained, corresponding
                    for the most part with what was contained in the letter of Marcus Valerius
                    Messala. What produced the greatest effect upon the fathers, was the march of
                    Hasdrubal into Italy, which was with difficulty resisting Hannibal and his
                    forces. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Laelius also, who was brought before
                    the general assembly, gave a particular statement of the same things. The senate
                    decreed a supplication for one day, on account of the successes of Publius
                    Scipio, and ordered Caius Laelius to return as soon as possible to Spain, with
                    the ships he had brought with him. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> I have laid
                    the taking of Carthage in this year, on the authority of many writers, although
                    aware that some have stated that it was <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/>
                    taken the following year, because it appeared to me hardly probable that Scipio
                    should have spent an entire year in Spain in doing nothing. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> Quintus Fabius Maximus for the fifth time, and Quintus
                    Fulvius Flaccus for the fourth, <pb n="1099" xml:id="p.1099"/> having entered on
                    their offices of consuls on the ides of March, on the same day, Italy was
                    decreed as the province of both, their command, however, was distributed to
                    separate districts. Fabius was appointed to carry on the war at Tarentum;
                    Fulvius in Lucania and Bruttium. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Marcus
                    Claudius was continued in command for the year. The praetors thin cast lots for
                    their provinces. Caius Hostilius Tubulus obtained the city jurisdiction; Lucius
                    Veturius Philo the foreign, with Gaul; Titus Quinctius Crispinus, Capua; Caius
                    Aurunculeius, Sardinia. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The troops were thus
                    distributed through the provinces: Fulvius received the two legions which Marcus
                    Valerius Laevinus had in Sicily; Quintus Fabius, those which Caius Calpurnius
                    had commanded in Etruria. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The city troops
                    were to succeed those in Etruria; Caius Calpurnius commanding the same province
                    and the army. Titus Quinctius was to take the command of Capua, and the army
                    which had served under Quintus Fulvius there. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    Lucius Veturius was to succeed Caius Laetorius, propraetor, in his province and
                    the command of the army, which was then at Ariminum. Marcus Marcellus had the
                    legions with which he had been successful when consul. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> To Marcus Valerius together with Lucius Cincius, for these
                    also were continued in command in Sicily, the troops which had fought at Cannae
                    were given, with orders to recruit them out of the surviving soldiers of the
                    legions of Cneius Fulvius. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> These were
                    collected and sent by the consuls into Sicily, and the same ignominious
                    condition of service was added, under which the troops which had fought at
                    Cannae served, and to those troops belonging to the army of Cneius Fulvius, the
                    praetor, which had been sent thither by the senate through displeasure
                    occasioned by a similar flight. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Caius
                    Aurunculeius was appointed to command, in Sardinia, the same legions with which
                    Publius Manlius Vulso had occupied that province. <milestone n="15"
                        unit="section"/> Publius Sulpicius was continued in command for the year,
                    with orders to hold Macedonia with the same legion and fleet. Orders were given
                    to send thirty quinqueremes from Sicily to Tarentum, to the consul Fabius.
                        <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> With the rest of the ships, orders were
                    given that Marcus Valerius Laevinus should either pass over himself into Africa
                    to ravage the country, or send either Lucius Cincius or Marcus Valerius Messala.
                        <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> With regard to Spain, no alteration was
                    made, except that Scipio and Silanus were continued in command, not for the
                    year, but until they <pb n="1100" xml:id="p.1100"/> should be recalled by the
                    senate. In such manner were the provinces and the commands of the armies
                    distributed for this year. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Amid concerns of greater importance, an old
                    dispute was revived at the election of a chief curio, when a priest was
                    appointed to succeed Marcus Aemilius; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> the
                    patricians denying that Caius Mamilius Vitulus, who was a plebeian candidate,
                    ought to be allowed to stand, because no one before his time had held that
                    priesthood who was not a patrician. The tribunes, on being appealed to, referred
                    the matter to the senate. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The senate left it
                    to the decision of the people. Thus Caius Mamilius Vitulus was the first
                    plebeian created chief curio. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Publius
                    Licinius, chief pontiff, compelled Caius Valerius Flaccus to be inaugurated
                    flamen of Jupiter, against his will. Caius Valerius Laetorius was created
                    decemvir for the performance of sacred rites, in the room of Quintus Mucius
                    Scaevola, deceased. I should willingly have passed over in silence the reason of
                    a flamen's being compelled to be inaugurated, had he not become a good, from
                    having been a bad character. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> In consequence of
                    having spent his youth in idleness and debauchery, vices for which he had
                    incurred the displeasure of his own brother, Lucius Flaccus, and the rest of his
                    kinsmen, Caius Flaccus was chosen flamen by Publius Licinius, chief pontiff.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> As soon as his mind became occupied with
                    the care of the sacred rites and ceremonies, he soon so completely divested
                    himself of his former habits, that no one among all the youth was more esteemed,
                    or enjoyed in a greater degree the approbation of the chief of the patricians,
                    whether relations or aliens. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Being raised by
                    this general good character to a proper confidence in himself, he claimed to be
                    admitted into the senate; a thing intermitted for many years, on account of the
                    worthlessness of former flamens. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> On entering
                    the senate, Lucius Licinius, the praetor, led him out; on which the flamen
                    appealed to the tribunes of the people. He demanded back the ancient privilege
                    of his priesthood, which was given, together with the purple-bordered robe, and
                    the curule chair, to the office of flamen. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                    praetor wished the question to rest not on the precedents contained in the
                    annals, which were obsolete from their antiquity, but on the usual practice in
                    all the cases of most recent date; urging, that no flamen of Jupiter, in the
                    memory of their fathers or their grandfathers, had taken up that privilege.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The tribunes <pb n="1101" xml:id="p.1101"
                    /> giving it as their opinion, that justice required, that as the obliteration
                    of the privilege was occasioned by the negligence of the flamens, the
                    consequences ought to fall upon the flamens themselves, and not upon the office,
                    led the flamen into the senate, with the general approbation of the fathers, and
                    without any opposition, even from the praetor himself; <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> while all were of opinion that the flamen had obtained his
                    object more from the purity of his life, than any right appertaining to the
                    priesthood. The consuls, before they departed to their provinces, raised two
                    legions for the city, and as many soldiers as were necessary to make up the
                    numbers of the other armies. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The consul
                    Fulvius appointed his brother, Caius Fulvius Flaccus, lieutenant-general, to
                    march the old city army into Etruria, and to bring to Rome the legions which
                    were in Etruria. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> And the consul Fabius
                    ordered his son, Quintus Fabius Maximus, to lead the remains of the army of
                    Fulvius, which had been collected, amounting to three thousand three hundred and
                    thirty-six, into Sicily to Marcus Valerius, the proconsul, and to receive from
                    him two legions and thirty quinqueremes. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The
                    withdrawing of these legions from the island did not at all diminish the force
                    employed for the protection of that province, either in effect or appearance;
                        <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> for though, in addition to two veteran
                    legions which were most effectively reinforced, he had a great number of
                    Numidian deserters, both horse and foot, he raised also a body of Sicilian
                    troops, consisting of men who had served in the armies of Epicydes and the
                    Carthaginians, and were experienced in war. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    Having added these foreign auxiliaries to each of the Roman legions, he
                    preserved the appearance of two armies. With one he ordered Lucius Cinctius to
                    protect that portion of the island which had formed the kingdom of Hiero, with
                    the other he himself guarded the rest of the island, which was formerly divided
                    by the boundary of the Roman and Carthaginian dominions. <milestone n="17"
                        unit="section"/> He divided also the fleet of seventy ships, in order that
                    it might protect the sea-coast, through the entire extent of its shores.
                        <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> He himself went through the island with
                    the cavalry of Mutines to inspect the lands, observe those which were cultivated
                    and those which were not, and, accordingly, either praise or reprove the owners.
                        <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> By this diligence so large a quantity of
                    corn was produced, that he both sent some to Rome, and collected at Catana corn
                    which might serve as a <pb n="1102" xml:id="p.1102"/> supply for the army, which
                    was about to pass the summer at Tarentum. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> But the transportation of the soldiers into
                    Sicily, and they consisted chiefly of Latins and allies, had very nearly caused
                    a serious commotion; from such trifling circumstances do events of great
                    importance frequently arise. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> A murmuring arose
                    among the Latins and allies at their meetings. They said, that <quote> they had
                        been drained by levies and contributions for ten years. That almost every
                        year they fought with the most disastrous consequences. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> That some of them were slain in the field, others were
                        carried off by disease. That a countryman of theirs who was enlisted by the
                        Romans, was more lost to them than one who was taken prisoner by the
                        Carthaginians; for the latter was sent back to his country by the enemy
                        without ransom, while the former was sent beyond the limits of Italy, into
                        exile rather than military service. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> That
                        the troops which fought at Cannae were growing old there, for eight years,
                        and would die there before the enemy, who was now more than ever flourishing
                        and vigorous, would depart from Italy. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> If
                        the old soldiers did not return to their country, and fresh ones were
                        enlisted, that in a short time there would be no one left. That, therefore,
                        they must refuse to the Roman people, before they came to utter desolation
                        and want, what shortly their very condition would refuse. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> If the Romans saw their allies unanimous on this point,
                        that they would then certainly think of making peace with the Carthaginians;
                        otherwise, Italy would never be without war while Hannibal was alive.
                    </quote> Thus they discoursed in their meetings. The Roman people had at that

                        the purpose of increasing the population. That they owed to the Romans what

                    the abandonment of Italy, after the defeat at Cannae. In censuring those of the
                    equestrian order, the same ground was acted upon, but there were very few to
                    whom that disgrace belonged. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> All of the

                    They also searched for, and discovered, a great number of those who ought to

                    Fulvius first went in advance to Capua; in a few days Fabius followed. He had

                    Tarentum. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> That when that city was taken from

                    messenger to Rhegium, to the prefect of the garrison, which had been placed
                    there by the consul Laevinus, against the Bruttians, and consisted of eight
                    thousand men, the greater part of whom had been brought from Agathyrna in
                    Sicily, as has been before mentioned, and were men who had been accustomed to
                    live by rapine. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> To these were added fugitives
                    of the Bruttians, natives of that country, equal to them in daring, and under an
                    equal necessity of braving every thing. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This
                    band he ordered to be marched, first, to lay waste the Bruttian territory, and
                    then to attack the city Caulonia. After having executed the order, not only with
                    alacrity, but avidity, and having pillaged and put to flight the cultivators of
                    the land, they attacked the city with the utmost vigour. <milestone n="7"

                    was so good a match for Hannibal as himself, set out from his winter quartets as
                    soon as there was plenty of forage in the fields, and met Hannibal at Canusium.
                    The Carthaginian was then endeavouring to induce the Canusians to revolt, but as
                    soon as he heard that Marcellus was approaching, he decamped thence. <milestone

                    an ambuscade; he therefore began to retire thence into woody districts.
                    Marcellus closely pursued him, pitched his camp close to his, and when he had
                    completed his works, led out his troops into the field. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> Hannibal engaged in slight skirmishes, and sent out single
                    troops of horse and the spearmen from his infantry, not considering it necessary
                    to hazard a general battle. He was, however, drawn on to a contest of that kind
                    which he was avoiding. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Hannibal had decamped
                    by night, but was overtaken by Marcellus in a plain and open country. Then,
                    while encamping, Marcellus, by attacking the workmen on all hands, prevented the
                    completion of his works. Thus a pitched battle ensued, and all their forces were
                    brought into action; but night coming on, they retired from an equal contest.
                    They then hastily fortified their camps, which were a small space apart, before

                    Marcellus led out his troops into the field; nor did Hannibal decline the
                    challenge, but exhorted his soldiers at great length, desiring them <quote>to
                        remember Trasimenus and Cannae, and thus quell the proud spirit of their

                    surrender which had been given to the Lucanians. Quintus Fabius, the consul,

                    ships were fitted up and prepared to attack the town from the open sea; and the

                    account of Philip's preparing to attack the Aetolians. Meanwhile, those who were
                    attacking Caulon, in the territory of Bruttium, fearful lest they should be
                    overpowered, had retired on the approach of Hannibal to an eminence, secure from

                    mention, is unimportant. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Tarentum was occupied
                    by a garrison of Bruttians, given them by Hannibal; the commander of that
                    garrison was desperately in love with a girl, whose brother was in the army of

                    the lover, by means of his sister, might be induced to any thing she pleased, he
                    acquainted the consul with the hopes he had formed. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> His reasoning appeared not altogether unfounded, and he was
                    desired to go to Tarentum as a deserter; and having gained the confidence of the
                    prefect by means of his sister, he began by sounding his disposition in a covert
                    manner, and then, having sufficiently ascertained his weakness, induced him, by
                    the aid of female fascinations, to the betrayal of that custody of the place to
                    which he was appointed. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> After the method to

                    soldier, who was sent out of the city by night clandestinely, through the
                    intervals between the guards, related to the consul what had been done, and what
                    had been agreed upon to be done. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> At the first

                    from the citadel, the harbour, and the ships which had been brought to the shore
                    from the open sea, and a shout was purposely raised, accompanied with the

                    parts of the city resounded with such a din that sometimes a shout like that of
                    a captured city was raised, and fearing lest, while he hesitated, the consul
                    should make some attack and <milestone n="16??" unit="section"/> advance his
                    standards, led his party over to the citadel, from which the most alarming noise
                    proceeded. Fabius, concluding that the guard was withdrawn, both from the time

                    that part of the wall where the person who had contrived the plot or betraying

                    they proceeded to the forum, where they arrived much about daybreak, without

                    their javelins, they turned their backs almost before they had joined battle,
                    and escaped in different directions through the streets of the city, with which
                    they were acquainted, to their own houses and those of their friends. Two of

                    betraying the city to Hannibal, rode away from the battle at full speed. Shortly
                    after, his horse, which was loose and straying through the city, was recognised,
                    but his body could not be found any where. It was generally believed that he had

                    Carthaginians and Tarentines without distinction. Many of the Bruttians also
                    were slain either by mistake or on account of an old grudge entertained against
                    them, or else with a view to the report that the city was betrayed; in order
                    that Tarentum might rather appear to have been captured by force of arms.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The troops then ran off in all directions
                    from the slaughter, to <pb n="1114" xml:id="p.1114"/> plunder the city. Thirty
                    thousand slaves are said to have been captured; an immense quantity of silver,
                    wrought and coined; eighty-three thousand pounds of gold; of statues and
                    pictures so many that they almost equalled the decorations of Syracuse.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But Fabius, with more magnanimity than
                    Marcellus, abstained from booty of that kind. When his secretary asked him what
                    he wished to be done with the statues of their gods, which are of immense size
                    and represented as fighting, each having his peculiar habit, he gave orders that

                    gods after sacrificing a victim, the aruspex forewarned him to be on his guard

                    these events occurred, after Publius Scipio had employed the whole of the winter
                    in Spain in regaining the affections of the barbarians, partly by presents, and
                    partly by sending home their hostages and prisoners, Edesco, a man distinguished
                    among the Spanish commanders, came to him. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> His
                    wife land children were in the hands of the Romans; but besides this motive, he
                    was influenced by that apparently fortuitous turn in the state of feeling which
                    had converted the whole of Spain from the Carthaginian to the Roman cause.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The same motive induced Indibilis and
                    Mandonius, who were undoubtedly the principal men in all Spain, to desert
                    Hasdrubal and withdraw with the whole body of their countrymen to the eminences
                    which overhung his camp, from which they had a safe retreat along a chain of
                    hills to the Romans. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Hasdrubal, perceiving
                    that the strength of the enemy was increasing by such large accessions, while
                    his own was diminishing, and that events would continue to flow in the same
                    course they had taken, unless by a bold effort he effected some alteration,
                    resolved to come to an engagement as soon as possible. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Scipio was still more eager for a battle, as well from hope
                    which the success attending his operations had increased, as because he
                    preferred, before the junction of the enemy's forces, to fight with one general
                    and one army, rather than with their united troops. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> However, in case he should be obliged to fight with more
                    armies than one at the same time, he had with some ingenuity augmented his
                    forces; for seeing that there was no necessity for ships, as the whole coast of
                    Spain was clear of Carthaginian fleets, he hauled his ships on shore at Tarraco
                    and added his mariners to his land forces. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He
                    had plenty of arms for them, both those which had been captured at Carthage, and
                    those which he had caused to be made after its capture, so large a number of
                    workmen having been employed. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> With these
                    forces, setting out from Tarraco at the commencement of the spring, for Laelius
                    had now returned from Rome, without whom he wished nothing of very great
                    importance to be attempted, Scipio marched against the enemy. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> Indibilis and Mandonius, with their forces, met him while
                    on his march; passing through every place without molestation, his allies
                    receiving him courteously, and <pb n="1116" xml:id="p.1116"/> escorting him as

                    Indibilis, who spoke for both, addressed him by no means stupidly and
                    imprudently like a barbarian, but with a modest gravity, rather excusing the
                    change as necessary, than glorying that the present opportunity had been eagerly
                    seized as the first which had occurred. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>

                    and their countrymen. <quote>On this account,</quote> he said, <quote> his

                        of Scipio was, that their passing over to him might neither be the occasion
                        of a charge of fraud nor a ground for respect, but that he would estimate
                        their services according to what sort of men he should find them to be from

                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The Roman replied, that <quote> he would do
                        so in every particular; nor would he consider those men as deserters who did

                    their camp in disorderly flight, and the Roman standards were advanced almost
                    within their very gates. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Their minds on that
                    day having only been excited to a contest, the Romans pitched their camp.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> At night Hasdrubal withdrew his forces to
                    an eminence, on the summit of which extended a level plain. There was a river on
                    the rear, in front and on either side a kind of steep bank completely surrounded
                    its extremity. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Beneath this and lower down was
                    another plain of gentle declivity, which was also surrounded by a similar ridge
                    equally difficult of ascent. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Into this lower
                    plain Hasdrubal, the next day, when he saw the troops of the enemy drawn up
                    before their camp, sent his Numidian cavalry and light-armed Baleares. Scipio
                    riding out to the companies and battalions, pointed out to them, that "the enemy
                    having abandoned, beforehand, all hope of being able to withstand them on level
                    ground, had resorted to hills; where they stood in view, relying on the strength
                    of their position, and not on their valour and arms. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> But the walls of Carthage, which the Roman soldiers had
                    scaled, were still higher. That neither hills, nor a citadel, nor even the sea
                    itself, had formed an impediment to their arms. <milestone n="9" unit="section"
                    /> That the heights which the enemy had occupied would only have the effect of
                    making it necessary for them to leap down crags and precipices in their flight,
                    but he would even cut off that kind of retreat. <milestone n="10" unit="section"
                    /> He accordingly gave orders to two cohorts, that one of them should occupy the
                    entrance of the valley down which the river ran, and that the other should block
                    up the road which led from the city into the country, over the side of the hill.
                    He himself led the light troops, which the day before had driven in the advanced
                    guard of the enemy, against the light-armed troops which were stationed on the
                    lower ridge. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> At first they marched through
                    rugged ground, impeded by nothing except the road; afterwards, when they came
                    within reach of the darts, an immense quantity of weapon of every description
                    was showered upon them; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> while on their part,
                    not only the soldiers, but a multitude of servants mingled with the troops,
                    threw stones furnished by the place, which were spread about in every part, and
                    for the most part convenient as missiles. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> But
                    though the ascent was difficult, and they were almost overwhelmed with stones
                    and darts, yet from their practice in approaching walls and their inflexibility
                    of <pb n="1118" xml:id="p.1118"/> mind, the foremost succeeded in getting up.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> These, as soon as they got upon some
                    level ground and could stand with firm footing, compelled the enemy, who were
                    light-armed troops adapted for skirmishing, and could defend themselves at a
                    distance, where an elusive kind of fight is carried on by the discharge of
                    missiles, but yet wanted steadiness for a close action, to fly from their
                    position; and, killing a great many, drove them to the troops which stood above
                    them on the higher eminence. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Upon this
                    Scipio, having ordered the victorious troops to mount up and attack the centre
                    of the enemy, divided the rest of his forces with Laelius; whom he directed to
                    go round the hill to the right till he could find a way of easier ascent, while
                    he himself, making a small circuit to the left, charged the enemy in flank.
                        <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> In consequence of this their line was
                    first thrown into confusion, while they endeavoured to wheel round and face
                    about their ranks towards the shouts which resounded from every quarter around
                    them. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> During this confusion Laelius also came
                    up, and while the enemy were retreating, that they might not be exposed to
                    wounds from behind, their front line became disjoined, and a space was left for
                    the Roman centre to mount up; <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> who, from the
                    disadvantage of the ground, never could have done so had their ranks stood

                    his left wing had charged the right of the enemy, was chiefly employed in
                    attacking their naked flank. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> And now there
                    was not even room to fly; for parties of the Roman troops had blocked up the
                    roads on both sides, right and left, and the gate of the camp was closed by the
                    flight of the general and principal officers; added to which was the fright of
                    the elephants, who, when in consternation, were as much feared by them as the

                    Mago came from the farther Spain and joined Hasdrubal; a late assistance after

                    of Spain which borders on the ocean and Gades, was, as yet, unacquainted with
                    the Romans, and might therefore be somewhat friendly to the Carthaginians.

                    entertained an angry feeling towards them; the greater part comparing them with

                    against the prefect on the ground that Tarentum was betrayed to the enemy
                    through his negligence, others proposing rewards for having defended the citadel
                    for five years, and because Tarentum had been recovered chiefly by his single

                    however, <quote> that he admitted that the recovery of Tarentum was owing to the
                        efforts of Livius, as his friends openly boasted in the senate, but
                            <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> that there would have been no
                        necessity for its recovery, had it not been lost. </quote> One of the
                    consuls, Titus Quinctius Crispinus, set out for Lucania, with soma troops to
                    make up the numbers, to take the command of the army which had served under
                    Quintus Fulvius Flaccus. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Marcellus was
                    detained by a succession of religious scruples, which presented themselves to
                    his mind. One of which was, that when in the Gallic war at Clastidium he had
                    vowed a temple to Honour and Valour, its dedication was impeded by the pontiffs.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> who said, that one shrine could not with
                    propriety be dedicated to two deities; because if it should be struck with
                    lightning or any kind of portent should happen in it, the expiation would be
                    attended with difficulty, as it could not be ascertained to which deity
                    sacrifice ought to be made; nor could one victim be lawfully offered to two
                    deities, unless in particular cases. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly another temple to Virtue was erected with all speed. Nevertheless,
                    these temples were not dedicated by Marcellus himself. <milestone n="10"

                    up the numbers, to the army he had left the preceding year at Venusia.
                    Crispinus, who endeavoured to reduce Locri in Bruttium by a siege, because he

                    forces to Lacinium, and in consequence of a report, that his colleague, with
                    whom he wished to effect a junction, had now led his army from Venusia.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> He therefore returned from Bruttium into
                    Apulia, and the consuls took up a position in two separate camps, distant from

                    into the same quarter. Here the consuls, who were both of sanguine temperament,
                    almost daily went out and drew up their troops for action, confidently hoping,
                    that if the enemy would hazard an engagement with two consular armies united,
                    they might put an end to the war. </p>

                    equal grounds for hope and fear, should he encounter the same general again; so
                    was he far from thinking himself a match for the two consuls together.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Directing his attention, therefore, wholly
                    to his own peculiar arts, he looked out for an opportunity for planting an

                    fought between the two camps with varying success. But the consuls, thinking it
                    probable that the summer would be spun out in engagements of this kind, and
                    being of opinion that the siege of Locri might be going on notwithstanding,
                    wrote to Lucius Cincius to pass over to Locri with his fleet from Sicily.

                    having found from certain Thurians that these things would be done, sent a body
                    of troops to lie in ambush on the road leading from Tarentum. There, under the
                    hill of Petelia, three thousand cavalry and two thousand foot were placed in
                    concealment. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Romans, who proceeded without
                    exploring their way, having fallen into the ambuscade, as many as two thousand
                    soldiers were slain, and about twelve hundred made prisoners. The others, who
                    were scattered in flight through the fields and forests, returned to Tarentum.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> There was a rising ground covered with

                    which was occupied at first by neither party, because the Romans were
                    unacquainted with its nature on that side which faced the enemy's camp, while
                    Hannibal had supposed it better adapted for an ambuscade than a camp. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> Accordingly, he had sent thither, by night, several
                    troops of Numidians, concealing them in the midst of the wood. Not one of them
                    stirred from his position by day, lest their arms or themselves should be
                    observed from a distance. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> There was a general
                    murmur in the Roman camp, that this eminence ought to be occupied and secured by
                    a fort, lest if it should be seized by Hannibal they should have the enemy, as
                    it were, immediately over their heads. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Marcellus was moved by this consideration, and observed to his colleague,

                    without its head; in the second, that all the usual parts were present, and that

                    ardent a desire of engaging with Hannibal, that he never thought their camps
                    close enough. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> At that time also, as he quitted
                    the rampart, he gave orders that the troops should be ready when occasion
                    required, in order that if the hill, which they were going to examine, were

                    they might be able to intercept any stragglers who had gone too far from the
                    camp in search of wood or forage, gave a signal to the Numidians to rise

                    those whose business it was to intercept their passage in the rear, had gone
                    round. Then they all sprang up from every side, and, raising a shout, commenced
                    an attack. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Although the consuls were in such a

                    with a loud noise. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Some of the Salapians fell
                    upon the deserters, who were carrying their arms carelessly suspended upon their
                    shoulders, as is customary after a march, as if among friends; others frightened
                    away the enemy by discharging stones, pikes, and javelins from the tower
                    adjoining the gate and from the walls. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Thus
                    Hannibal withdrew, having been caught by his own stratagem, and proceeded to
                    raise the siege of Locri, which Cincius was carrying on with the greatest
                    vigour, with works and engines of every kind, which were brought from Sicily.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Mago, who by that time almost despaired
                    of retaining and defending the town, derived his first gleam of hope on the
                    death of Marcellus being reported. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> This was
                    followed by a message, that Hannibal had despatched his Numidian cavalry in
                    advance, and was himself following them with all possible speed with a body of
                    infantry. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> As soon, therefore, as he was
                    informed, by a signal displayed from the watch-towers, that the Numidians were
                    drawing near, suddenly throwing open the gate he sallied out boldly upon the
                    enemy, and at first, more because he had done it unexpectedly than from the
                    equality of his strength, the contest was doubtful; <milestone n="17"
                        unit="section"/> but afterwards, when the Numidians came up, the Romans were
                    so dismayed that they fled on all hands to the sea and their ships, leaving
                    their works and the engines with which they battered the walls. Thus the siege
                    of Locri was raised by the approach of Hannibal. </p>

                    the election, both because he did not think he could bear the fatigue of the
                    journey, and because he was anxious about Tarentum, lest Hannibal should direct
                    his course thither from Bruttium. That it was expedient that commissioners
                    should be sent to him, men of sound judgment, with whom he might communicate,

                    The reading of this letter excited great grief for the death of one of the

                    Quintus Fabius the younger to Venusia to the army; and to the consul three
                    commissioners, Sextus Julius Caesar, Lucius Licinius Pollio, and Lucius Cincius

                    fleet of a hundred ships, and making a descent near the city Clupea, devastated
                    the country to a wide extent, scarcely meeting with a single person in arms.
                    Afterwards the troops employed in making these depredations were hastily led
                    back to their ships, and a report had suddenly reached them that a Carthaginian

                    these reasons, was met at the city Lamia by the Aetolians, under the command of
                    Pyrrhias, who had been created praetor that year jointly with Attalus, who was

                    from Attalus, and about a thousand men sent from the Roman fleet by Publius
                    Sulpicius. Against this general and these forces, Philip fought twice
                    successfully, and slew full a thousand of his enemies in each battle. Whence, as
                    the Aetolians were compelled by fear to keep themselves under the walls of
                    Lamia, Philip led back his army to Phalara. This place is situated in the Malian
                    bay, and was formerly thickly inhabited on account of its excellent harbour, the
                    safe anchorage in its neighbourhood, and other conveniences of sea and land.

                    concerned for the Aetolians, whose arrogance of disposition exceeded that of any
                    other nation of Greece, than lest Philip and his empire, which was likely to
                    prove injurious to the cause of liberty, should be intermixed with the affairs
                    of Greece. The deliberations concerning a peace were put off, to a council of
                    the Achaeans, for which a place and certain day were fixed upon; for the mean

                    which had negotiated for peace at Phalara, they at first complained of some

                    the convention; <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> but at last they asserted,
                    that it was impossible the war could be terminated unless the Achaeans gave back

                    Philip, conceiving it an indignity that the vanquished should presumptuously

                    people with one or two companions, and in proportion as he was less conspicuous

                    who were slain without having fought any memorable battle, a coincidence which

                    who, many years ago, was, on the expiration of his consulship, condemned in a

                    retired into the country, and for many years absented himself from the city, and
                    avoided all public assemblies. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Much about the

                    appeared in a squalid dress, his hair and beard allowed to grow, and exhibiting
                    in his countenance and attire the deep impression of the disgrace he had
                    sustained. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Lucius Veturius and Publius
                    Licinius, the censors, compelled him to have his beard and hair trimmed, to lay

                    assent by a single word, or signified his vote by walking to one side of the

                    character was at stake, obliged him to deliver his sentiments in the senate upon

                    occasion, after so long an interval, he drew the eyes of all upon him, and gave
                    occasion to conversations to the following effect: <quote> That the people had
                        injuriously disgraced a man who was undeserving of it, and that it had been
                        greatly detrimental to the state that, in so important a war, it had not had
                        the benefit of the services and counsels of such a man. <milestone n="9"

                        That the same cause precluded Titus Manlius, besides that he had refused a

                    lightning. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The people of Minturnae added what
                    was more alarming, that a stream of blood had flowed at their gate. At Capua, a

                    larger kind, and a supplication for one day was made, according to a decree of
                    the pontiffs. The nine days' sacred rite was then performed again, because a

                    fears, they were again disturbed by intelligence that an infant had been born at
                    Frusino as large as a child of four years old, and not so much an object of
                    wonder from its size, as that it was born without any certain mark of
                    distinction whether it was male or female, which was the case two years before
                    at Sinuessa. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Aruspices, called in from
                    Etruria, declared this to be indeed a foul and ill-omened prodigy, which ought

                    contact with the earth, to be plunged into the deep. <milestone n="7"

                    While in the temple of Jupiter Stator they were learning this hymn, which was

                    within the city and within the tenth milestone from it, were summoned to the

                    virgins, arrayed in white vestments, and singing in honour of Juno Regina a
                    hymn, which to the uncultivated minds of that time might appear to have merit,
                    but if repeated now would seem inelegant and uncouth. <milestone n="13"

                    unrestricted liberty of filling up their numbers from what source they pleased,
                    of selecting out of all the armies such as they liked, and of exchanging and

                    levy, and go earlier than they had determined into their provinces, with the
                    intention that each should keep his enemy in his own province, and not allow

                        unit="section"/> This object was much aided by an opinion possessed by
                    Hannibal; for although he felt assured that his brother <pb n="1145"

                    recollected what difficulties he had himself experienced through a period of
                    five months, first in crossing the Rhone, then the Alps, contending against men,
                    and the nature of the ground, he was far from expecting that his transit would
                    be so easy and expeditious, <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> and this was the
                    cause of his moving more slowly from his winter quarters. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> But all things were done by Hasdrubal with less delay and
                    trouble than he himself or any others expected. For the Arverni, and after them
                    the other Gallic and Alpine nations in succession, not only gave him a friendly
                    reception, but followed him to the war; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> and
                    not only had roads been formed during the passage of his brother in most of the
                    countries through which he marched, and which were before impassable, but also
                    as the Alps had been passable for a period of twelve years, he marched through
                    tribes of less ferocious dispositions. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> For
                    before that time, being never visited by foreigners, nor accustomed, themselves,
                    to see a stranger in their country, they were unsociable to the whole human
                    race. And at first, not knowing whither the Carthaginian was going, they had
                    imagined that their own rocks and forts, and the plunder of their cattle and
                    people, were his objects; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> but afterwards, the
                    report of the Punic war with which Italy was being desolated for now ten years,
                    had convinced them that the Alps were only a passage, and that two very powerful
                    nations, separated from each other by a vast tract of sea and land, were
                    contending for empire and power. These were the causes which opened the Alps to
                    Hasdrubal. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But the advantage which he gained
                    by the celerity of his <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> march he lost by his
                    delay at Placentia, while he carried on a fruitless siege, rather than an
                    assault. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He had supposed that it would be
                    easy to take by storm a town situated on a plain; and the celebrity of the
                    colony induced him to believe that by destroying it he should strike great
                    terror into the rest. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> This siege not only
                    impeded his own progress, but had the effect of restraining Hannibal, who was
                    just on the point of quitting his winter quarters, after hearing of his passage,
                    which was so much quicker than he expected; <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    for he not only revolved in his mind how tedious was the siege of towns, but
                    also how ineffectual was his attempt upon that same colony, when returning

                    escaping thence, came down with all his forces, and formed in order of battle.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Upon this the consul, imitating the crafty
                    character of his enemy, ordered five cohorts, with the addition of five
                    maniples, to pass the summit by night and sit down in the valleys on the
                    opposite side; a measure to which he was prompted the more strongly in
                    proportion as he felt that there could exist no suspicion of an ambuscade in
                    hills so uncovered. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Of the time for rising up
                    from their retreat and of falling upon the enemy he informed Tiberius Claudius

                        unit="section"/> The general himself, at break of day, drew out all his
                    forces, both foot and horse, for battle. Shortly after, the signal for battle
                    was given out by Hannibal, and a noise was raised in the camp, from the troops
                    running hastily to arms; then both horse and foot eagerly rushed through the
                    gates, and spreading themselves over the plain, hastened to the enemy.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The consul perceiving them thus
                    disordered, gave orders to Caius Aurunculeius, a military tribune of the third
                    legion, to send out the cavalry of the legion to charge the enemy with all
                    possible vehemence, for that the enemy had spread themselves <milestone n="10??"
                        unit="section"/> like cattle in such disorder throughout the whole plain,
                    that they might be knocked down and trampled under foot before they could be

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Hannibal had not yet gone out of the camp,
                    when he heard the shout of his troops engaged; and thus roused by the alarm, he
                    hastily led his forces against the enemy. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Already had the Roman horse spread terror through the Carthaginian van; the
                    first legion also of the infantry and the right wing were commencing the action,
                    while the troops of the Carthaginians, in disorder, engaged just as chance threw

                    became more general by reinforcements, and the number of those who ran out to

                    confusion, would have drawn up his troops while fighting, (which would not have
                    been an easy task unless to a veteran general with veteran soldiers,) had not
                    the shouts of the cohorts and maniples, running down from the hills, which was
                    heard in their rear, created an alarm lest they should be cut off from their
                    camp. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> After this they were seized with a
                    panic, and a flight commenced in every part; but the number slain was less,
                    because the nearness of the camp offered to the terrified troops a shorter
                    distance to fly. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For the cavalry hung upon
                    their rear, and the cohorts, running down the declivities of the hills by an
                    unobstructed and easy path, charged them transversely in flank. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> However, above eight thousand men were slain, above seven
                    hundred made prisoners, and eight military standards taken. Of the elephants
                    also, which had been of no use in such a sudden and irregular action, four were
                    killed and two captured. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The conquerors lost
                    about five hundred Romans and allies. The following day the Car- <pb n="1149"
                        xml:id="p.1149"/> thaginian remained quiet. The Roman having led out his
                    troops into the field, when he saw that no one came out to meet him, gave orders
                    that the spoils of those of the enemy who were slain should be collected, and
                    that the bodies of his own men should be gathered into one place and buried.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> After this, for several days following in
                    succession, he came up so near the enemy's gates that he almost seemed to be
                    carrying in his standards. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But at length
                    Hannibal at the third watch, leaving a number of fires and tents in that part of
                    the camp which faced the enemy, and also a few Numidians who might show
                    themselves in the rampart and the gates, decamped and proceeded towards Apulia.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> As soon as it dawned, the Roman army came
                    up to the trenches, and the Numidians, according to the plan concerted, took
                    care to show themselves for a little time on the rampart and in the gates; and
                    having deceived the enemy for some time, rode off at full speed, and overtook
                    their friends on their march. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The consul,
                    when all was silence in the camp, and he could now no where see even the few who
                    at break of day had walked up and down, sent two horsemen in advance to
                    reconnoitre; <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> and after he had ascertained
                    that all was safe enough, ordered his troops to march in; <milestone n="14"
                        unit="section"/> and after staying there only while his men distributed
                    themselves for plunder, sounded a retreat and led back his forces long before
                    night. The next day he set out as soon as it was light, and following the rumour
                    and the track of the enemy by forced marches, came up with them not far from
                    Venusia. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Here also an irregular battle took
                    place, in which two thousand of the Carthaginians were slain. <milestone n="16"
                        unit="section"/> The Carthaginian quitting this place made for Metapontum,
                    marching by night and over mountainous districts in order to avoid a battle.
                    Thence Hanno, who commanded the garrison of that place, was sent into Bruttium
                    with a small party to raise a fresh army. Hannibal, after adding his forces to
                    his own, went back to Venusia by the same route by which he came, and proceeded
                    thence to Canusium. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Nero had never quitted
                    the enemy's steps, and when he himself went to Metapontum, had sent for Quintus
                    Fulvius into Lucania, lest that region should be left without protection. </p>

                    some Roman foragers, who were straggling through the fields, and brought before
                    the propraetor, Caius Claudius. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At first they
                    endeavoured to baffle him by evasive answers, but threats of applying torture
                    being held out to them, they were compelled to confess the truth; when they
                    fully admitted that they were the bearers of a letter from Hasdrubal to
                    Hannibal. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They were delivered into the custody
                    of Lucius Virginius, a military tribune, together with the letter sealed as it
                    was, to be conveyed to the consul Claudius. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> At
                    the same time two troops of Samnites were sent with them as an escort. Having
                    made their way to the consul, the letter was read by means of an interpreter,
                    and the captives were interrogated; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> when
                    Claudius, coming to the conclusion that the predicament of the state was not
                    such as that her generals should carry on the war, each within the limits of his

                    great fear into great joy, sent the letter of Hasdrubal to Rome to the senate;
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> and at the same time informed the
                    conscript fathers what his intentions were; and recommended that, as Hasdrubal
                    had written to his brother that he should meet him in Umbria, they should send
                    for the legion from Capua to Rome, enlist troops at Rome, and oppose the city
                    forces to the enemy at Narnia. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Such was his
                    letter to the senate. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Messengers were sent in
                    advance through the territory of Larinum, Marrucia, Frentana, and Praetutia,
                    where he was about to march his army, with orders that they should all bring
                    down from their farms and towns to the road-side provisions ready dressed for
                    the soldiers to eat; and that they should bring out horses and other beasts of

                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> He then selected the choicest troops out

                    towards Picenum, and making his marches as long as possible, led his troops to

                    less than they had been two years before, when the Carthaginian camp was pitched
                    over against the Roman walls and gates; nor could people make up their minds

                        with his whole army, who had gone off with only six thousand armed men, or
                        to assault the camp, which was left as a prey for him, without strength,

                        war during so many years in Spain, and rendered famous by a double victory,

                    tents in a confined place, would be attended with less inconvenience, because
                    the army of Claudius had brought with them on their expedition scarcely any

                    who had completed their period of service, but young men also offered themselves
                    without solicitation; and, as they vied with each other in giving in their
                    names, he had enlisted those whose personal appearance and bodily strength
                    seemed fit for military service. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The camp of
                    the other consul was near Sena, and Hasdrubal's position was about five hundred
                    paces from it. Nero, therefore, when he was now drawing near, halted under cover
                    of the mountains, in order that he might not enter the camp before night.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Having entered when all was still, they

                    troops while marching by attacking their flank or rear, he had baffled the enemy
                    by all the arts of war. This man was, on the present occasion, one of the

                    engagement should be deferred till Nero had recruited his soldiers, who were
                    weary with marching and watching, and had employed a few days in acquiring a

                    by persuasion, but with the most earnest entreaties, <quote> that they would not

                    their camp in battle-array. This circumstance delayed the battle: Hasdrubal, who
                    had advanced before the line with a few horsemen, remarked some old shields
                    among the enemy, which he had not seen before, and some horses leaner than the
                    rest; their numbers also appeared greater than usual. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> Suspecting, therefore, what was really the case, he hastily
                    sounded a retreat, and sent a party to the river from which they got their
                    water, where some of them might be intercepted, and notice taken whether there
                    were perchance any there whose com- <pb n="1155" xml:id="p.1155"/> plexions were
                    more than ordinarily sun-burnt, as from a recent march. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> At the same time he ordered a party to ride round the camp
                    at a distance, and note whether the rampart was extended in any part, and also
                    observe whether the signal sounded once or twice. Having received a report of
                    all these particulars, the fact of the camp's not being enlarged led him into
                    error. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> There were now two camps, as there were
                    before the other consul arrived, one belonging to Marcus Livius, the other to
                    Lucius Porcius, and to neither of them had any addition been made to give more
                    room for the tents. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But the veteran general,
                    who was accustomed to a Roman enemy, was much struck by their reporting that the
                    signal sounded once in the praetor's camp, and twice in the consul's; there must
                    therefore be two consuls, and felt the most painful anxiety as to the manner in
                    which the other had got away from Hannibal. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Least of all could he suspect, what was really the case, that he had got away
                    from Hannibal by deceiving him to such an extent, as that he knew not where the
                    general was, and where the army whose camp stood opposite to his own. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> Surely, he concluded, deterred by a defeat of no
                    ordinary kind, he has not dared to pursue him; and he began to entertain the
                    most serious fears that he had himself come too late with assistance, now that
                    affairs were desperate, and lest the same good fortune attended the Roman arms
                    in Italy which they had experienced in Spain. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    Sometimes he imagined that his letter could not have reached him, and that, it
                    having been intercepted, the consul had hastened to overpower him. Thus anxious
                    and perplexed, having put out the fires, he issued a signal at the first watch
                    to collect the baggage in silence, and gave orders to march. In the hurry and
                    confusion occasioned by a march by night, their guides were not watched with
                    sufficient care and attention. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> One of them
                    stopped in a lace of concealment which he had beforehand fixed upon in hi mind,
                    the other swam across the river Metaurus, at a ford with which he was
                    acquainted. The troops, thus deserted by their guides, at first wandered up and
                    down through the fields; and some of them, overpowered with sleep, and fatigued
                    with watching, stretched themselves on the ground here and there, leaving their
                    standards thinly attended. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Hasdrubal gave
                    orders to march along the bank of the river until the light should discover the

                    course along the turnings and windings of that tortuous river, with the

                    convenient for the purpose, he made but little progress; <milestone n="11"

                    and rushed upon a Roman cohort, where he fell fighting, as was worthy of the son

                    battle, and marching at a more rapid rate than when he came, arrived at his camp
                    before the enemy on the sixth day. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> As he was
                    not preceded by a messenger, fewer people attended him on his march; but the joy
                    felt was so great, that they were almost insane with delight. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Neither state of feeling at Rome can be well described or
                    told, whether that in which the citizens were when in doubtful expectation of
                    the issue, or when they received the intelligence of victory. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Every day, from the time that news arrived that the consul
                    Claudius had set out, from sunrise to sunset, none of the senators ever quitted
                    the senate-house, or did the people depart from the forum. The <pb n="1159"
                        xml:id="p.1159"/> matrons, as they had themselves no means of affording
                    assistance, had recourse to prayers and entreaties, and going about to all the
                    temples, wearied the gods with vows and supplications. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> While the city was in this state of solicitude and
                    suspense, a vague report first arrived that two Narnian horsemen had come from
                    the field of battle into the camp which stood as a defence in the entrance to
                    Umbria, with intelligence that the enemy were cut to pieces. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> At first they rather heard than credited this news, as
                    being too great and too joyful for the mind to take in, or obtain a firm belief.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Even the very rapidity with which it had
                    arrived formed an obstacle to its reception; for it was stated that the battle
                    took place two days before. After this a letter was brought which had been sent
                    by Lucius Manlius Acidinus, from his camp, on the subject of the arrival of the
                    Narnian horsemen. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This letter being conveyed
                    through the forum to the tribunal of the praetor, drew the senators out of the
                    senate-house; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> and with such eagerness and
                    hurry did the people crowd to the doors of the senate-house, that the messenger
                    could not approach, but was dragged off by persons who asked him questions, and
                    demanded vociferously that the letter should be read on the rostrum before it
                    was read in the senate. At length they were put back and restrained by the
                    magistrates; and thus the joy was gradually dispensed to their overpowered
                    spirits. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The letter was read first in the
                    senate, and then in the assembly of the people. <milestone n="11" unit="section"
                    /> The effect was various, according to the difference in the cast of men's
                    minds, some thinking that there were already sure grounds for rejoicing, while
                    others would place no confidence in the news, till they listened to ambassadors,
                    or a letter from the consuls. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> After this, news came that the ambassadors
                    themselves were on the point of arriving. Then, indeed, people of all ages ran
                    to meet them, each man being eager to be the first to <milestone n="2??"
                        unit="section"/> receive an assurance of such joyful tidings, by the
                    evidence of his eyes and ears. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> One continued
                    train extended as far as the Mulvian bridge. The ambassadors, Lucius Veturius
                    Philo, Publius Licinius Varus, and Quintus Caecilius Metellus, made their way
                    into the forum, surrounded by a crowd of persons of every description; when some
                    asked the ambassadors them-selves, others their attendants, what had been done;
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> and, as <pb n="1160" xml:id="p.1160"/>
                    soon as each had heard that the army and general of the enemy had been cut off,
                    that the Roman legions were safe, and the consuls unhurt, he immediately
                    imparted the joyful intelligence to others, imparting to them the joy he felt
                    himself. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Having with difficulty made their way
                    into the senate-house, and the crowd with still more difficulty being removed,
                    that they might not mix with the fathers, the letter was read in the senate;
                    after which the ambassadors were brought into the general assembly. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> Lucius Veturius Philo, after reading the letter
                    himself, gave a more explicit account of all that had occurred, amidst great
                    approbation, and at last of general shouting from the assembly, while their
                    minds could scarcely contain their joy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They
                    then ran off in various directions, some to the different temples of the gods,
                    to return thanks, others to their homes, to impart the joyful intelligence to
                    their wives and children. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The senate decreed a
                    supplication for three days, because Marcus Livius and Caius Claudius, the
                    consuls, had cut off the general and legions of the enemy, their own army being
                    safe. This supplication Caius Hostilius, the praetor, proclaimed in the
                    assembly, and was celebrated both by men and women. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> During the whole three days all the temples were uniformly
                    crowded, whilst the matrons, dressed in their richest robes, and accompanied by
                    their children, just as though the war had been brought to a conclusion, and
                    free from every apprehension, offered thanksgivings to the immortal gods.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This victory produced an alteration also
                    in the condition of the state, so that immediately from this event, just as
                    though it had been a time of peace, men were not afraid to do business with each
                    other, buying, selling, lending, and paying borrowed money. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> Caius Claudius, the consul, on his return to his camp,
                    ordered the head of Hasdrubal, which he had carefully kept and brought with him,
                    to be thrown before the advanced guards of the enemy, and the African prisoners
                    to be shown to them bound just as they were. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Two of these also he unbound, and bid them go to Hannibal and tell him what had
                    occurred. Hannibal, smitten by such severe distress, at once public and
                    domestic, is said to have declared that he recognised the destiny of Carthage;
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> and decamping thence with the intention
                    of drawing together into Bruttium, the remotest corner of Italy, all his <pb
                        n="1161" xml:id="p.1161"/> auxiliaries which he could not protect when
                    widely scattered, removed into Bruttium the whole state of the Metapontines,
                    summoned away from their former habitations, and also such of the Lucanians as
                    were under his authority. </p>
