                    IN the beginning of the same year, Sextus Digitius, praetor in the Hither Spain, fought with those states which, after the departure of Marcus Cato, had, in great numbers, recommenced hostilities, numerous battles, but none deserving of particular mention; and all so unfavourable to him, that he scarcely delivered to his successor half the number of men that he had received.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    In consequence of this, every state in Spain would certainly have resumed new courage, had not the other praetor, Publius Cornelius Scipio, son of Cneius, been successful in several engagements on the other side of the Iberus;
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    and, by these means, diffused such a general terror, that no less than fifty towns came over to his side. These exploits Scipio performed in his praetorship.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Afterwards, when propraetor, as the Lusitanians, after ravaging the farther province, were returning home, with an immense booty, he
                    <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/>
                    attacked them on their march, and continued the engagement from the third hour of the day to the eighth, before any advantage was gained on either side. He was inferior to the

                    enemy in number of men, but he had the advantage of them in other respects:
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    with his troops formed in a compact body, he attacked a long train, encumbered with multitudes of cattle; and with his soldiers fresh, engaged men, fatigued by a long march; for the enemy had set out at the third watch, and besides travelling the remainder of the night, had continued their route to the third hour of the day;
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    nor had they been allowed any rest, as the battle immediately succeeded the toil of the march.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    Wherefore, though at the beginning they retained some vigour of body and spirits, and, at first, threw the Romans into disorder, yet, after some time, the fight became equal. In this critical situation the proprietor made a vow to celebrate games in honour of Jupiter, in case he should defeat and cut off the enemy.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    The Romans then made a more vigorous push, and the Lusitanians gave way, and, in a little time, turned their backs. As the victors pursued them briskly, no less than twelve thousand of them were slain, and five hundred and forty taken prisoners, most of whom were horsemen.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    There were taken, besides, a hundred and thirty-four military standards. Of the Roman army, but seventy-three men were lost. The battle was fought at a small distance from the city of Ilipa.

                    The remainder was put into the hands of the quaestor to be sold, and the money produced by the sale was distributed among the soldiers.

                    At the time when these occurrences happened in Spain, Caius Flaminius, the praetor, had not yet set out from Rome:
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    therefore these events, as well prosperous as adverse, were reported by himself and his friends in the strongest representations;
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    and he laboured to persuade the senate, that, as a very formidable war had blazed out in his province, and he was likely to receive from Sextus Digitius a very small remnant of an army, and that, too, terrified and disheartened, they ought to decree one of the city legions to him, in order that, when lie should have united to it

                        decrees of the senate were not to be passed in consequence of rumours fabricated by private persons for the gratification of magistrates; and that no intelligence should be deemed authentic except it were either written by the praetors, from their provinces, or brought by their deputies.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        If there was a tumultuous commotion in Spain, they advised a vote, that tumultuary soldiers should be levied by the praetor in some other country than Italy.

                    The senate's intention was that such description of men should be raised in Spain.

                    Valerius Antias says, that Caius Flaminius sailed to Sicily for the purpose of levying troops, and that, on his voyage thence to Spain, being driven by a storm to Africa, he enlisted there many stragglers who had belonged to the army of Publius Africanus;
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    and that, to the levies made in those two provinces, he added a third in Spain.

                    In Italy the war, commenced by the Ligurians, grew daily more formidable. They now invested Pisae, with an army of forty thousand men; for multitudes flocked to them continually, led by the reports of the war and the expectation of booty. The consul, Minucius, came to Arretium, on the day which he had fixed for the assembling of the troops.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Thence he led them, in order of battle, towards Pisae; and though the enemy had removed their camp to the other side of the river at a distance of no more than three miles from the place, the consul marched into the city, which evidently owed its preservation to his coming.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Next day he also encamped on the other side of the river, about a mile from the enemy; and by slight skirmishes protected the lands of the allies from their depredations.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    He did not think it prudent to hazard a general engagement, because his troops were raw, composed of many different kinds of men, and not yet so well known among themselves that they could rely on one another.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    The Ligurians depended so much on their numbers, that they not only came out and offered battle, willing to risk every thing on the issue of it; but, from their superfluity of men, they sent out many parties along the frontiers to plunder;
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    and whenever a large quantity of cattle, and other prey, was collected, there was an escort always in readiness to convey it into their forts and towns.

                    While the operations remained at a stand at Pisae, the other consul, Lucius Cornelius Merula, led his army through the extreme borders of the Ligurians, into the territory of the Boians, where the mode of proceeding was quite the reverse of that which took place in the war of Liguria.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    The consul took the field; the enemy refused to fight; and the Romans, when no one would come out against them, went out in parties to plunder, while the Boians chose to let their country be laid waste with impunity rather than venture an engagement in defence of it.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    When all places were completely ravaged with fire and sword, the consul quitted the enemy's lands, and marched towards Mutina, in a careless manner, as through a pacific population.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    The Boians, when they learned that the enemy had withdrawn beyond their frontiers, followed him as secretly as possible, watching an opportunity for an ambuscade; and, having gone by his camp in the night, took possession of a defile through which the Romans were to pass.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    But as they were not able to effect this with sufficient secrecy, the consul, who usually began his march late in the night, now waited until day, lest, in the disorderly fight likely to ensue, darkness might increase the confusion; and though he did not stir before it was light, yet he sent forward a troop of horse to explore the country.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    When intelligence was brought by them of the number and situation of the enemy, he ordered the baggage to be heaped together in the centre, and the veterans to throw up a rampart round it; and then, with the rest of the army in order of battle, he advanced towards the enemy.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    The Gauls did the same, when they found that their stratagem was detected, and that they were to engage in a fair and regular battle, where success must depend on valour alone.

                    The battle began about the second hour. The left brigade of the allies, and the Extraordinaries, fought in the first line, and were commanded by two lieutenant-generals of consular dignity, Marcus Marcellus and Tiberius Sempronius, who had been consul the year before.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    The present consul was sometimes employed in the front of the line, sometimes in keeping back the legions in reserve, that they might not, through eagerness for fighting, come up to the attack until the signal was given.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    He ordered the two Minucii, Quintus and Publius, military tribunes, to lead off the cavalry of
                    <pb n="1557" xml:id="p.1557"/>
                    the legions into open ground, at some distance from the line; and "when he should give them the signal, to charge the enemy through the clear space.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    While he was thus employed, a message came from Tiberius Sempronius Longus, that the Extraordinaries could not support the onset of the Gauls; that great numbers had already fallen; and that partly through weariness, partly through fear, the ardour of the survivors was much abated.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    He recommended it therefore to the consul, if he thought proper, to send up one or other of the two legions, before the army suffered disgrace.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    The second legion was accordingly sent, and the Extraordinaries were ordered to retire. By the legion coming up, with its men fresh, and the ranks complete in their numbers, the fight was renewed with vigour.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    The left wing was withdrawn out of the action, and the right took its place in the van. The intense heat of the sun discomposed the Gauls, whose bodies were very ill qualified to endure it: nevertheless, keeping their ranks close, and leaning sometimes on each other, sometimes on their bucklers, they withstood the attack of the Romans;
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    which, when the consul observed, in order to break their ranks, he ordered Caius Livius Salinator, commander of the allied cavalry, to charge them at full speed, and the legionary cavalry to remain in reserve.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    This tempest of cavalry first confused and disordered, and at length entirely broke the line of the Gauls; yet it did not make them fly.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    That was prevented by their officers, who, when they quitted their posts, struck them on the back with their spears, and compelled them to return to their ranks: but the allied cavalry, riding in among them, did not suffer them to recover their order.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    The consul exhorted his soldiers to

                        continue their efforts a little longer, for victory was within their reach; to press the enemy, while they saw them disordered and dismayed; for, if they were suffered to recover their ranks, they would enter on a fresh battle with doubtful success.

                    He ordered the standard-bearers to advance with the standards, and then, all exerting themselves at once, they at length forced the enemy to give way. As soon as they turned their backs, and fled precipitately on every side, the legionary cavalry was sent in pursuit of them.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    On that day, fourteen thousand of the Boians were slain; one thousand and ninety-two taken ‚Äîas were seven hundred and twenty-one horsemen, and three of their commanders, with

                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    Nor did the Romans gain the victory without loss of blood: of themselves, or their allies, were lost above five thousand men, twenty-three centurions, four praefects of the allies, and two military tribunes of the second legion, Marcus Genucius and Marcus Marcius.
