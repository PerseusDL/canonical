                        Hannibal by a second invasion of Italy had ended in disaster at the

                    Carthaginians as follows: <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Hasdrubal son of
                    Gisgo had retired all the way to the Ocean and Gades; the coast of Our Sea and
                    nearly all of Spain facing eastward were under Scipio and Roman rule; <milestone

                        years earlier, Hasdrubal had urged the authorities at Carthage to send out
                        another army with a general to take his place in Spain; XXIII. xxvii. 12. A
                        new commander has now arrived, but this Hanno is soon captured and sent to
                        Rome; ii. 11; iv. 4. </note> as successor to Hasdrubal Barca had crossed
                    over from Africa with a new army, and uniting with Mago, had promptly armed men
                    in large numbers in Celtiberia, which lies directly between the two seas.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Whereupon Scipio sent Marcus Silanus <note

                        7.</note> with not more than ten thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry
                    against Hanno. Silanus made his marches as long <pb n="p.5"/> as possible, being
                    hampered, however, both by rough <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 207</note> roads and narrow passes frequently hemmed in
                    by wooded mountains, as is usual in Spain. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Nevertheless he outstripped not only messengers reporting his approach but even
                    rumours of it, and guided by deserters from the same Celtiberia he made his way
                    to the enemy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> From the same informants it was
                    learned, when they were about ten miles from the enemy, that there were two
                    camps, one on each side of the road along which they were moving; that, on the
                    left lay the Celtiberians, a new army, over nine thousand men, on the right the
                    Carthaginian camp; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> that this was strongly
                    defended by outposts, sentries and all the protection usual in the field, while
                    the other camp was lax and carelessly guarded, as belonging to barbarians who
                    were raw recruits and less afraid because they were in their own country. </p>
                <p> Silanus, thinking this camp must be attacked first, ordered the standards to
                    move as far to the left as possible, for fear he might be seen from somewhere by
                    the Carthaginian outposts. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He sent scouts in
                    advance and himself proceeded towards the enemy with a swiftly moving column.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> He was some three miles away when not one of
                    the enemy had yet noticed them; a rugged terrain and brush-covered hills kept
                    them concealed. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> There in a deep valley that
                    was consequently unseen he bade his soldiers sit down and take food. Meantime
                    came the scouts confirming the deserters' reports. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Then the Romans piled their light baggage in the centre,
                    took up their arms and advanced to fight in regular line of battle. They were a
                    mile away when they were seen by the enemy, who suddenly began to show alarm.
                    Mago too, leaving his <pb n="p.7"/> camp at the first shouting and uproar, rode
                    up at a <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 207</note>
                    gallop. In the army of the Celtiberians there were four thousand men with long
                    shields and two hundred horsemen. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This
                    complete legion —and they were the best of his troops —was placed in the front
                    line. The rest, the light-armed, he posted as reserves. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> While he was leading the men in that order out of their
                    camp and they had scarcely got beyond the rampart, the Romans hurled their
                    javelins at them. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Spaniards squatted down
                    to meet the enemy's volley; then they in turn rose to hurl their weapons. After
                    the Romans in dense array, as usual, had received these on their shields held
                    close together, men fought at close quarters and began to use swords. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> But the roughness of the ground made nimbleness of no
                    use to the Celtiberians, whose custom it is to be skirmishers in battle, and at
                    the same time it was not unfavourable for the Romans, accustomed to a static
                    order of battle, except that restricted spaces and intervening thickets broke up
                    their ranks, and they <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/> were forced to engage
                    now singly, now in couples, as though with men paired against them. Whatever
                    hampered the flight of the enemy exposed them to slaughter, as if they were
                    fettered. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> And now that nearly all the
                    Celtiberian heavy infantry had been slain, the <milestone n="10??"
                        unit="section"/> light-armed and the Carthaginians who had come to their aid
                    from the other camp were being routed and cut down. Not more than two thousand
                    infantry and all the cavalry escaped with Mago almost at the beginning of the
                    battle. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Hanno, the second in command, was
                    captured alive with those who had been the last to arrive when the battle was
                    nearly over. Almost all the cavalry and such old soldiers as there were in the
                    infantry <pb n="p.9"/> followed Mago in flight and on the tenth day reached
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 207</note>
                    Hasdrubal <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The son of Gisgo, mentioned
                        just above, i. 2; cf. iii. 3. </note> in the region of Gades. <milestone
                        n="12" unit="section"/> The newly recruited Celtiberians slipped away into
                    the neighbouring forests and thence scattered to their homes. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> This very timely victory had made a sudden
                    end, not so much indeed of the war already in progress, as of the resources for
                    some subsequent war, had it been possible for the Carthaginians, after calling
                    out the Celtiberian nation, to entice other tribes also to take up arms.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Accordingly Scipio praised Silanus in
                    generous terms and cherished the hope of ending the war if only he should not
                    retard the fulfilment by his own delaying. Aiming to finish what remained of the
                    war he proceeded into the farthest part of Spain against Hasdrubal. The
                    Carthaginian, in order to ensure the loyalty of his allies, had his camp at that
                    time, as it happened, in Baetica. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        Here not the later (Augustan) province of that name, but a vague term for

                        the Baetis (Guadalquivir). </note>
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Nevertheless he suddenly took up his
                    standards and with the appearance of a flight rather than of a march led his men
                    all the way to the Ocean and Gades. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> But
                    before taking ship along the strait to Gades, thinking he would be the object of
                    attack so long as he kept his army together, he scattered his entire force among
                    the cities in every direction, that they might defend themselves by walls and at
                    the same time defend walled cities by their arms. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Scipio, observing that the field of operations
                    was widely extended, and that to attack the cities one after another would be a
                    protracted task, if not a great one, turned back. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> Not to leave the region, however, to the enemy, he sent his
                    brother Lucius <pb n="p.11"/> Scipio with ten thousand infantry and a thousand

                    a Bastetanian tribe. Its land is fruitful; the inhabitants mine silver also.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> That city had been a stronghold for
                    Hasdrubal in making-raids among the tribes of the interior. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Scipio pitched his camp near the city and before investing
                    it sent men up to the gates to sound the inhabitants by speaking to them from a
                    short distance, urging them to test the friendship of the Romans rather than
                    their power. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> When no peaceable replies were
                    forthcoming, he surrounded the city with a trench and a double earthwork and
                    divided his army into three parts, so that one third should always be attacking
                    while two thirds in the meantime were resting. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    When the first third essayed an attack there was, to be sure, a fierce battle
                    and indecisive. It was not easy to come near the walls for the shower of
                    missiles, nor to bring up ladders. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Some who
                    had succeeded in raising their ladders against the walls were pushed down by
                    forks made for that very purpose, others had iron grappling-hooks lowered upon
                    them from above, so that they were in danger of being caught up and dragged to
                    the top of the wall. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> When Scipio noted that
                    owing to the greatly inferior number of his men the struggle was evenly
                    balanced, and that the enemy had an advantage already in fighting from the wall,
                    he attacked the city with two thirds of his men at the same time, having
                    recalled the first third. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This <pb n="p.13"/>
                    inspired so much alarm among men already spent in <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 207</note> fighting with the first to
                    attack them that the townsmen in sudden flight abandoned the walls and for fear
                    the city had been betrayed the Carthaginian garrison also left their posts and
                    gathered in one place. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Then the men of the town were possessed by
                    the fear that, if the enemy should enter the city, those whom they happened to
                    meet anywhere would be slain with no distinction between Carthaginian and
                    Spaniard. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Accordingly they suddenly opened a
                    gate and dashed out of the town in large numbers, holding their shields in front
                    of them for fear weapons might be hurled at long range, but displaying their
                    right hands empty, so that it should be clear that they had thrown away their
                    swords. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Whether this was not seen owing to
                    distance, or whether some ruse was suspected, has not been ascertained. The
                    Romans, making an attack upon the deserters, cut them down like an opposing
                    battle-line; and by the same gate hostile units entered the city. <milestone
                        n="13" unit="section"/> Elsewhere also gates were being hewed to pieces and
                    broken open with hatchets and pickaxes, while a cavalryman on entering would
                    ride ahead at full speed to seize the forum; for such were their orders. A

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> With Hannibal there was no campaigning that
                    year. For neither did he invite attack, owing to his very recent wound, a blow
                    national as well as personal, nor did the Romans provoke him so long as he
                    remained inactive; such power they believed to be present in that one commander,
                    even though everything else round him crashed. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    And I am inclined to think he was more marvellous in adversity than in success.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> For here he was, carrying on war in the
                    enemy's land for thirteen years, so far from home with varying fortune, having
                    an army not made up of his own citizens but a mixture of the offscourings of all
                    nations, men who had in common no law, no custom, no language, differing from
                    each other in bearing, in garb, in their arms, differing as to religious rites,
                    sacred observances, one might almost say as to their gods. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Yet he somehow bound them together by a single bond, so
                    that no outbreak ensued among the men themselves nor any mutiny against their
                    general. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> This passage is obviously
                        reminiscent of Polybius' tribute to Hannibal in a fragment of Book XI (xix.
                        esp. 3-5). Cf. XXIII. v. 11; XXX. xxxiii. 8; XXIV. iii. 12. </note>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Yet in the enemy's country both money to pay
                    them and supplies were often wanting —deficiencies which in the previous Punic
                    war had given rise to many unspeakable acts on the part of commanders and
                    soldiers. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Certainly after the destruction of
                    Hasdrubal's army with its commander-and on them he had rested all his hope of
                    victory —, when by retiring into the remote land of the Bruttii he had given up
                    the rest of Italy, who would not find it a marvel that there was no outbreak in
                    his camp? <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For added to everything else was
                    this also, that he had no hope even of feeding his army except from the Bruttian
                    region; and even supposing all of it to be under cultivation, it <pb n="p.53"/>
                    was nevertheless too small to feed so large an army. <note anchored="true"

                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Moreover a great part of the young men, drawn
                    off from the farming of the land, had been claimed instead by the war and by
                    their custom of training soldiers through brigandage, a practice viciously
                    inbred in their nation. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Furthermore, nothing
                    was being sent from home, since they were concerned about their hold upon Spain,
                    as though everything was succeeding in Italy. </p>
                <p> In Spain the campaign was having an issue in part the same, in part very
                    different: the same in that the Carthaginians, vanquished in battle with the
                    loss of a general, had been forced to the farthest coast of Spain, even to the
                    Ocean; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> on the other hand different in that
                    Spain, owing to the nature of the <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> country
                    and its people, was better adapted not merely than Italy but than any other part
                    of the world to preparing for another war. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> In
                    consequence, though the first of the provinces, at least of those on the
                    mainland, to be entered by the Romans, it has been the last of all to be
                    completely conquered, and not until our own times under the command and auspices
                    of Augustus Caesar. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Since Agrippa's
                        completion of the conquest of northwestern Spain is evidently meant here, we

                    at that time returned from Gades in the hope of renewing the war. After
                    conducting levies in Farther Spain with the help of Mago the son of Hamilcar, he
                    armed about fifty thousand infantry and four thousand five hundred cavalry.

                    had got together so large an army, thought that with Roman legions alone he
                    would be no match for such a multitude unless barbarian auxiliaries should

                        unit="section"/> Then Scipio himself set out from Tarraco, and gathering up
                    as he went a moderate number of auxiliaries from the allies dwelling near the

                    a long column of men under arms was dashing out from camp into battle,

                    nearing sunset, the troops were led back into camp, first by the Carthaginian

                    When Scipio observed that this was a persistent belief, he deliberately changed

                    at such a pace that, if they had directly followed the enemy's track, they would

                    standards came to a halt and the men were engaged now with cavalry, now with

                    of cattle, until the general, himself now approving their flight, escaped to the
                    nearest hills with some six thousand half-armed men. The rest were slain or
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> captured. The Carthaginians hastily
                    fortified an improvised camp on a very high hill and from it they defended
                    themselves without difficulty, since the enemy had tried in vain to come up the
                    steep <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> slope. But in an exposed situation which
                    furnished nothing a siege was scarcely endurable even for a few days.
                    Accordingly there were repeated desertions to the enemy. Finally the general

                    Hasdrubal, who had been forced out of Spain and had sailed into the harbour with
                    seven triremes and cast anchor, was bringing his ships to the shore when the two
                    quinqueremes were sighted. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> No one had any
                    doubt that they belonged to the enemy, and that they could be surprised by
                    superior numbers before they entered the harbour. But they caused nothing more
                    than uproar and excitement both among soldiers and sailors, as they made ready
                    their arms and ships all to no purpose. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> For
                    the sails, catching a slightly stronger wind from the open sea, brought the

                    disturbance in the king's harbour. So first Hasdrubal and then Scipio and
                    Laelius disembarked and went to the king. <milestone n="18" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> To Syphax it seemed a splendid thing —as
                    indeed it was —that the generals of the two richest peoples of that time had

                <p>
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He invited both of them to be his guests, and
                    inasmuch as chance had ordained that they should be under one roof and in the
                    same dwelling, he tried to draw them into a conference to put an end to their
                    quarrels. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Scipio indeed stated that neither as
                    a private citizen had he any hatred toward <pb n="p.77"/> the Carthaginian which
                    might be ended by a conference, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 206</note> nor as regarded the state could he treat with
                    an enemy without an order from the senate. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    When the king kept insisting that he consent to come to the same feast for fear
                    one of his guests should seem to have been excluded from his table, Scipio did
                    not decline, and they dined together in the king's house. <milestone n="5"

                    Scipio and Hasdrubal reclined. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Moreover, such
                    was the genial manner of Scipio, such his inborn cleverness in meeting every
                    situation, that by his eloquent mode of address he won not Syphax only, the
                    barbarian unacquainted with Roman ways, but his own bitterest enemy as well.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Hasdrubal plainly showed that when he met
                    him face to face, Scipio seemed even more marvellous than in his achievements in
                    war, and that he did not doubt Syphax and his kingdom would soon be in the power
                    of the Romans; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> such skill did the man possess

                    the Carthaginians to inquire how their Spanish provinces had been lost as to

                    It was not as a traveller, nor as one who idles along beautiful shores, that so

                    and with only two ships had crossed over to Africa and entrusted himself to an
                    enemy's land, to a king's power, to a man's untested honour; on the contrary he
                    was cherishing a hope of conquering Africa. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    It had long <pb n="p.79"/> been Scipio's constant reflection, his open

                    respite from a Carthaginian war, still it was evident that on account of a
                    guilty conscience certain states were quiet out of fear rather than because of
                    loyalty. Most conspicuous both for size and guilt among these were Iliturgi

                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Although in favourable times its citizens had
                    been allies, Castulo, after the Scipios had been slain with their armies, had
                    revolted to the Carthaginians. The men of Iliturgi, by betraying and slaying
                    those who from that disaster had fled to them for refuge, had added a crime also
                    to their revolt. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> On Scipio's first coming,
                    when the Spanish provinces were wavering, vengeance upon those states would have
                    been deserved but not politic. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Now, however,
                    since in a time of peace the moment for exacting the penalty seemed to have
                    arrived, he summoned Lucius Marcius from Tarraco and sent him with a third of
                    his forces to lay siege to Castulo. He himself with the rest of the army reached
                    Iliturgi in about five stages. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The gates had
                    been closed and <pb n="p.81"/> everything disposed and prepared to resist an
                    attack. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 206</note>
                    So true was it that consciousness of what they knew they had deserved had meant
                    as much for them as a declaration of war. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> With
                    this point also Scipio opened his speech of encouragement to his soldiers,
                    saying that the Spaniards by closing their gates had themselves shown what they
                    had deserved to fear. Consequently, he said, they must wage war against them
                    with much more animosity than against the Carthaginians. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> With these it was a contest almost devoid of anger in
                    pursuit of power and glory; from the Iliturgians they must exact the penalty for
                    treachery and cruelty and crime. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The time had
                    come for them to avenge the atrocious slaughter of their comrades and the
                    perfidy which would have been brought to bear against themselves if in flight
                    they had reached the same city. It was time also for them by a severe example to
                    ordain that no one should ever account a Roman citizen or soldier in any
                    misfortune as fair game for ill treatment. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Immediately after this exhortation from their
                    general the officers, thoroughly aroused, issued ladders to men picked out of
                    one maniple after another, and dividing the army so that Laelius as lieutenant
                    should command one half, they attacked the city in two places at the same time,
                    causing a double alarm. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> It was not a single
                    commander or a number of leading men that urged the citizens gallantly to defend
                    the city, but their own fear due to consciousness of guilt. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> They remembered and reminded one another also that the aim
                    was their punishment, not victory; that when every man perished what mattered
                    most was whether he did so in battle and in the line, where the fortune of the
                    fray, <pb n="p.83"/> making no distinctions, often lifted up the defeated <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 206</note> and dashed
                    down the victor, or whether later, when their city was in <milestone n="12??"
                        unit="section"/> ashes and ruins, there before the faces of their captured
                    wives and children, after enduring every outrage and indignity, they breathed
                    their last under the scourge and in chains. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly not merely those of military age or men alone, but women and
                    children also helped beyond their powers of mind and body, bringing up weapons
                    for the fighting men and carrying stones for the builders up to the wall.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The stake was not freedom only, which
                    whets the courage of brave men alone, but all had before their eyes extreme
                    penalties and a hideous death. Bravery was kindled by emulation in toil and
                    danger and by the mere sight of one another. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    And so the battle was begun with such heat that that famous army, the conqueror
                    of all Spain, was repeatedly beaten back from the walls by the young men of a
                    single town and thrown into disorder in an inglorious battle. When Scipio saw
                    this, he was afraid that, owing to so many vain attempts made by his men, the
                    enemy's spirits might be cheered and his own soldiers lose heart. <milestone
                        n="16" unit="section"/> Thinking that he must himself make the attempt and
                    claim a share in the danger, he berated the soldiers for their cowardice,
                    ordered ladders to be brought up, and threatened that if the rest hesitated he
                    would climb up himself. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Already at no small

                    close to the walls when from all sides an outcry was made by the soldiers, who
                    were concerned for their commander and began to set up ladders in many places at

                    caught sight of a very lofty part of the city lacking any kind of
                    fortifications, lacking defenders as well, because it was protected by a very
                    high cliff. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Men of light build and nimble,
                    thanks to much training, they carried iron spikes with them and climbed up
                    wherever they could over the irregular projections of the cliff. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> Wherever they encountered rock too steep and smooth,
                    by driving in spikes at suitable intervals they made something like steps.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Then while the first men with their hands
                    drew up those who followed and the last pushed up those ahead of them, they made
                    their way up to the summit. Thence they dashed down with a shout into the city
                    already captured by the Romans. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It was then in
                    truth evident that the city had been attacked out of anger and hatred. No one
                    thought of taking men alive, no one thought of booty, although every place was
                    open for plunder. They slaughtered the unarmed and the armed alike, women as
                    well as men; cruel anger went even so far as to slay infants. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> Then they threw firebrands into houses and demolished what
                    could not be consumed by the flames. So delighted were they to destroy even the

                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Scipio then led his army to Castulo, a city
                    defended not only by Spaniards from other places but also by remnants of the

                        unit="section"/> But Scipio's coming had been preceded by a report of the
                    disaster at Iliturgi, and in consequence alarm and despair had taken possession.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Also as their interests were different,
                    since everyone wished to be safeguarded himself without regard to any one else,
                    at first unexpressed suspicion, then open discord produced a separation between
                    Carthaginians and Spaniards. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The latter were

                        unit="section"/> Moreover, though they had robbed their command of power,

                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Then the mutiny broke out after they observed
                    that the tribunes censured and disapproved of what was being done and were
                    endeavouring actively to oppose it, also openly declaring that they would not be
                    partners in their madness. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Accordingly,
                    chasing the tribunes out of the space before headquarters and soon after out of
                    the camp, they by common consent bestowed the command upon the leaders of the
                    mutiny, the privates Gaius Albius of Gales and Gaius Atrius, an Umbrian.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> These men, not at all satisfied with the
                    distinguishing marks of tribunes, ventured to pollute the insignia of the very
                    highest command, the fasces and axes. Nor did it occur to them that those rods
                    and axes, which they caused to be carried before them to frighten others, were
                    hanging over their own backs and their own necks. <milestone n="15"
                        unit="section"/> The unfounded belief in Scipio's death was the cause of
                    their blindness and, once rumour of it should presently be spread abroad, they
                    had no doubt that all Spain would be ablaze with war. <milestone n="16"
                        unit="section"/> In that uprising, they thought, money could be exacted from
                    allies, and also neighbouring cities plundered; and in the confusion, when any
                    man would dare anything, what they had themselves done would be less
                    conspicuous. <milestone n="25" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> While they waited from moment to moment for
                    fresh news, expecting to hear not only of his death but even of his funeral, and
                    yet none came and the groundless <pb n="p.103"/> report was losing hold, then
                    its first sponsors began <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin"
                        >B.C. 206</note> to be sought out. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> And as
                    one after another drew back, that he might be thought to have rashly believed
                    such a thing rather than to have invented it, the deserted leaders were now
                    alarmed at their own insignia and, in place of the empty semblance of command
                    which was theirs, at the real, duly bestowed authority that would presently turn
                    against them. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Thus when the mutiny was at a
                    standstill and credible informants brought the news, first that Scipio was
                    alive, and then that he was even well, seven tribunes of the soldiers arrived,
                    being sent by Scipio himself. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Upon their
                    arrival there was at first irritation; soon after, as the tribunes themselves by
                    mild words calmed acquaintances whom they had met, the men were less resentful.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> For going round at first among the tents,
                    then in the headquarters square and before the general's tent, where they saw
                    groups talking together, they would speak to the men, asking them what was the
                    reason for their anger and their sudden mania, instead of finding fault with
                    them for what they had done. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> A common
                    complaint was that their pay had not been given them on the proper date; also
                    that, whereas at the time when the men of Iliturgi <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified">Cf. xix. i. and n.</note> had committed their crime,
                    after the slaughter of the two commanders-in-chief and the two armies, the Roman
                    name had been defended and the province retained by their own courage, yet,
                    while the Iliturgians now had a due punishment for their crime, there was no one
                    to reward their own good deeds. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In reply the
                    tribunes said that those who complained of such matters only were making just
                    pleas, and they would report them to the commander-in-chief. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> They were glad that there was nothing more serious <pb

                <p>
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Scipio, who was familiar with wars but
                    unacquainted with the gusts of mutinies, was kept in a state of concern lest
                    either the army should go to excess in wrong-doing or he himself in punishing
                    them. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> For the present he decided to use
                    gentle measures, as he had begun to do, and to bring the hope of pay nearer by
                    sending collectors round the tributary states. <milestone n="11" unit="section"
                    /> Next an edict was posted up that they should assemble at (New) Carthage to
                    get their pay, whether they preferred to do so as separate units or all
                    together. The mutiny, already of itself on the wane, was quelled by sudden peace
                    on the part of the rebellious Spaniards. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> For
                    Mandonius and Indibilis had abandoned their project and retired to their borders
                    when they had news that Scipio was alive. Nor was there either a fellow-citizen
                    or foreigner any longer with whom the soldiers might share their madness.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> On surveying all possible plans they had
                    nothing left except a not altogether safe retreat from criminal designs, namely,
                    to give themselves up either to the commander's well-grounded anger or to his
                    mercy, as not beyond their hopes. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> He had
                    pardoned even enemies, they said, with whom he had fought with the sword; their
                    mutiny had been free from wounds, free from bloodshed, and neither in itself
                    savage nor meriting a savage punishment. So unduly eloquent is human nature in
                    minimizing one's own guilt. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    <pb n="p.107"/> The only question was whether to go in separate <note

                    get their pay, or all together. Their decision was that all should go together,
                    which they thought safer. </p>

                    deliberating there was a war-council in regard to them at (New) Carthage, and a
                    conflict of opinions as to whether the leaders only of the mutiny —and
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> they were not more than thirty-five in
                    number — should be punished, or whether punishment of a larger number was
                    required in penalizing, not a mutiny but rather a rebellion which set so
                    terrible an example. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The milder opinion
                    prevailed, that punishment should be limited to those with whom the breach of
                    discipline had begun, whereas for the mass a reprimand was enough. <milestone

                    and Indibilis was announced to the army which was at (New) Carthage, and they
                    were ordered to make ready their rations for several days. <milestone n="5"

                    out under Marcus Silanus against the Lacetani, not only relieved them of all
                    fear which remained unexpressed in their minds, but caused great rejoicing that

                    and rest. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The tribunes, without causing any
                    commotion, had the promoters of the mutiny brought by suitable persons to their
                    hospitable quarters, then seized and bound. At the fourth watch the baggage of
                    the army which, it was pretended, was to march away began to take the road.

                    Then the men who had arrived the day before, on being summoned to an assembly,

                    now with joy and exaltation of spirit he was advancing to the slaughter of the

                    once existed, that of loyalty and friendship, they had themselves broken by

                    citizens or allies and Latins, and also because there was hardly a soldier who
                    had not been brought from Italy either by his uncle Gnaeus Scipio, who was the
                    first of the Romans to come into that province, or by his father as consul, or

                    achievements. Mago surely, who fled with a few ships beyond the known world to
                    an island surrounded by the Ocean, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Cf.

                    them to make ready for the march on the morrow; and setting out he came in ten
                    stages to the river Hiberus. Then crossing the river, he pitched camp on the
                    fourth day in sight of the enemy. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In front was
                    level ground hemmed in on this side and that by mountains. Into that valley
                    Scipio first ordered men to drive cattle —mostly booty from the enemy's own
                    farms-to tempt the barbarians' love of pillage, and then sent light —armed
                    troops to their assistance. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When these had
                    begun the battle with a charge, he ordered Laelius to make an attack with
                    cavalry from an ambush. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A hill conveniently
                    projecting concealed the ambsucade of cavalry, and the battle began without
                    delay. The Spaniards, catching sight of cattle in the distance, dashed upon
                    them, the light-armed upon the Spaniards busy with their plunder. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> At first they inspired alarm by their missiles; then
                    abandoning their light weapons, which <pb n="p.135"/> could provoke rather than
                    decide the battle, they <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin"
                        >B.C. 206</note> drew their swords and began fighting at close quarters. And
                    the infantry battle would have remained doubtful if the cavalry had not arrived.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Not only did they trample down those they
                    met by a frontal attack, but some also rode round along the lowest part of the
                    slope and made an attack in the rear, so that they cut off a good many; and the
                    slaughter was greater than unimportant skirmishes usually cause. </p>
                <p> This defeat kindled the anger of the barbarians, instead of diminishing their
                    courage. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Consequently, not to appear daunted,
                    they went out into battle-line at daybreak the next day. The valley being
                    narrow, as stated above, had no room for all the forces. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> About two-thirds of the infantry and all the cavalry came
                    down into line. The remainder of their infantry they stationed on the slope of
                    the hill. Scipio, who thought the limited space was to his advantage, both
                    because a battle at close range seemed likely to be better <milestone n="9??"
                        unit="section"/> suited to the Roman than to the Spanish soldier, also
                    because the enemy's line had been enticed down into a position which did not
                    have room for all of their multitude, turned his attention to a further new
                    plan. He could not place his cavalry on the wings, he thought, in so limited a
                    space, and the enemy would have no use of the cavalry they had brought down with
                    their infantry. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Therefore he ordered Laelius
                    to lead his cavalry about over the hills, taking the road that was best hidden,
                    and <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> to separate the cavalry battle, so far
                    as he could, from that of the infantry. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> As
                    for himself, he made all his infantry units face the enemy; four cohorts he
                    placed in the front line, since he was unable to extend his line to a greater
                    length. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> He did not delay <pb n="p.137"/>
                    beginning the engagement, in order to divert <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 206</note> attention by the battle
                    itself from the sight of the cavalry crossing over the hills; and they were not
                    aware that the horsemen had outflanked them until they heard the din of a
                    cavalry battle in their rear. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Thus there were
                    two distinct battles; two infantry lines, two cavalry forces, were fighting down
                    the length of the level ground, since the narrow space did not permit a battle
                    that combined both arms. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> On the Spanish side
                    neither did infantry aid cavalry nor cavalry infantry; the foot-soldiers, who in
                    reliance upon the cavalry had been rashly posted on the level ground, were cut
                    to pieces; the cavalry, being outflanked, were neither withstanding Roman
                    infantry in front —for their own infantry were already overwhelmed —nor Roman
                    cavalry in the rear. Consequently the horsemen also, after they had formed a
                    circle and with their horses at a standstill had defended themselves for a long
                    time, were all slain to a man; and not one of their foot or horse that fought in
                    the valley survived. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Only a third of them,
                    having stood on the hill, to look on in safety rather than to take part in the
                    battle, had both a suitable position and time for flight. <milestone n="17"
                        unit="section"/> Among them the princes also fled, having slipped away in

                    Mandonius, clasping Scipio's knees, laid the blame upon the fateful madness of a

                    should perpetually devote to him the lives they owed to him alone. Formerly,
                    when they had as yet no experience of his mercy, they had confidence in their

                    had been received, arms taken away and garrisons posted in its cities.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Scipio, however, after inveighing at
                    length against Mandonius, who was present, and the absent Indibilis, said that
                    in consequence of their own misdeeds they had surely deserved to die; that they

                    innocent hostages, but against themselves, and he would exact punishment, not

                    march so long and so circuitous. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Masinissa,

                        of a long narrow island tapering away to the south-south-east. In later
                        times the harbour was closed in that direction by the slow action of
                        Atlantic tides, so that the long island became a peninsula. The city, now
                        Cadiz, is separated from the mainland to the east (at the Trocadero) by a
                        channel three-fourths of a mile wide. Cf. Strabo III. v. 3; Mela III. 46;

                    permit him to cross over to the mainland in order to lay waste the nearest lands
                    in Spain. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> After crossing over he sent three

                        unit="section"/> The Numidian had already been filled with admiration for
                    the man in consequence of his reported achievements, and had conjured up in mind
                    an ideal figure, tall and stately. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But greater
                    still was the reverence that possessed him for the man in his presence; and
                    while Scipio had great natural dignity, long hair added charm, as did a general
                    appearance not due to studied elegance, but truly masculine and soldierly;

                    although he had long wished to give it, he had been unable to furnish in Spain,
                    a foreign and unknown land. But in the land in which he had been born and
                    brought up in the hope of inheriting his father's kingdom, he would easily
                    furnish it. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> If indeed the Romans should send

                    Masinissa by permission of the Romans, that he might not appear to have crossed

                    reached him from Carthage that the senate commanded him to take the fleet which

                    For that purpose money was brought to Mago from Carthage, and in addition he
                    himself exacted all that he could from the citizens of Gades by plundering not
