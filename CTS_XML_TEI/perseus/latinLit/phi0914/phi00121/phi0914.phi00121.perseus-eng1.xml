                    properly assert what many an historian has declared at the outset of his entire
                    work, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Thucydides began his history as
                        follows: <quote> Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote the history of the war which
                            the Peloponnesians and Athenians waged against one another, beginning at
                            its very outset, in the expectation that it would be a great war and
                            more worthy of relation than any that had preceded it. </quote>
                    </note> to wit, that the war which I am going to describe was the most memorable
                    of all wars ever waged —the war, that is, which, under the leadership of
                    Hannibal, the Carthaginians waged with the Roman People. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> For neither have states or nations met in arms possessed of
                    ampler resources, nor was their own might and power ever so great. Nor yet were
                    they strangers to one another's modes of fighting, which the First Punic War had
                    made them understand. And so variable were the fortunes of the war and so
                    uncertain was its outcome that those who ultimately conquered had been nearer
                    ruin. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The animosity, too, with which they
                    fought was almost greater than their strength: the Romans were enraged that the
                    conquered should be actually drawing sword upon their conquerors; the
                    Phoenicians, because they believed that the conquered had been treated with
                    domineering arrogance and greed. </p>

                <p> It is said moreover that when Hannibal, then <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 218-201</note> about nine years old,
                    was childishly teasing his father Hamilcar to take him with him into Spain, his
                    father, who had finished the African war and was sacrificing, before crossing
                    over with his army, led the boy up to the altar and made him touch the offerings
                    and bind himself with an oath that so soon as he should be able he would be the
                    declared enemy of the Roman People. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The loss
                    of Sicily and <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        241</note> Sardinia was a continual torture to the proud spirit of Hamilcar.
                    For he maintained that they had surrendered Sicily <note anchored="true"

                    appropriated Sardinia — and even imposed an indemnity on them besides —in the

                    for five years, and likewise afterwards, during the nine years he spent in Spain
                    in extending the Punic empire, that it was plain to see that he meditated a more
                    important war than the one he was engaged in, and that if his life had been
                    prolonged, <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> the Phoenicians would have
                    invaded Italy under the leadership of Hamilcar, as they did in fact under that

                    of Hannibal delayed the war. In the interval betwixt father and son, the supreme
                    command devolved, for about eight years, on Hasdrubal. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> It was his youthful beauty, they say, that won for him in
                    the first instance the favour of Hamilcar, who subsequently selected him, no
                    doubt for other, that is mental, qualifications, to be his son-in-law. As such
                    —through the influence of the Barcine <pb n="p.7"/> faction <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified"> This was the war-party in Carthage,
                        named for its leader Hamilcar Barca, which opposed the peace-at-any-price
                        policy of the merchant-aristocracy. </note> which was very strong with the
                    soldiers <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        229-222</note> and the common people —he was given the command, though the
                    leading citizens had no liking for this step. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Relying more often on policy than force, Hasdrubal enlarged the sway of Carthage
                    rather by setting up friendly relations with the petty kings and winning over
                    new tribes through the goodwill of their leaders than by war and arms.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But he was not a whit more safe for being
                    at peace. A certain barbarian slew him openly, to avenge his master, whom
                    Hasdrubal had put to death. On being seized by the bystanders he expressed in
                    his countenance the cheerfulness of one who had escaped, and even as he was
                    being tortured, joy so got the upper hand of agony that he seemed actually to
                    smile. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> With this Hasdrubal, because of the
                    marvellous skill which he had shown in tempting the native tribes to join his
                    empire, the Roman People had renewed their covenant, <note anchored="true"

                    question but that the choice originating with the soldiers —who immediately bore
                    young Hannibal into the praetorium and with loud and universal acclamation
                    hailed him general —would obtain the ratification of the senate. The approval of
                    the <pb n="p.9"/> commons followed. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The new
                    commander had been <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        221</note> summoned to Spain by Hasdrubal when a mere lad, and the matter
                    had even been debated in the senate. The Barcine party were urging that Hannibal
                    should become inured to warfare and succeed to the resources of his father, when
                    Hanno, the leader of the other faction, addressed the House. <milestone n="3"

                    <quote>There is reason,</quote> said he, <quote>in Hasdrubal's request,
                        nevertheless I am opposed to granting it.</quote>
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When astonishment at a speech so inconsistent
                    had attracted everybody's attention, he continued: <quote> The youthful charms
                        which Hasdrubal himself permitted Hannibal's father to enjoy he considers
                        that he has the right to require again at the hands of the son. But that we
                        should accustom our young men, by way of military training, to gratify the
                        concupiscence of our generals is most unseemly. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Or do we fear lest Hamilcar's son may too late behold
                        the inordinate powers and the regal pomp which his father has set up? that
                        the son of the king who left our armies as a legacy to his son-in-law may
                        find us too slow in accepting him for our master? <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> For my part, I think that the young man should be kept
                        at home and taught to live in submission to the laws and the magistrates,
                        upon an equal footing with the others, lest one day this small fire kindle a
                        great conflagration. </quote>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> A few, and these included nearly all the best
                    men, supported Hanno, but, as often happens, the larger party prevailed over the
                    better. Hannibal was sent to Spain, where he was no sooner come than he won the
                    favour of the entire army. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The old soldiers
                    thought that Hamilcar was restored to them as he had been in his youth; they
                    beheld <pb n="p.11"/> the same lively expression and piercing eye, tile <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 221</note> same cast
                    of countenance and features. But he soon brought it to pass that his likeness to
                    his father was the least consideration in gaining him support. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Never was the same nature more adaptable to things the most
                    diverse —obedience and command. And so one could not readily have told whether
                    he were dearer to the general or the army. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    When any bold or difficult deed was to be done, there was no one whom Hasdrubal
                    liked better to entrust with it, nor did any other leader inspire his men with
                    greater confidence or daring. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> To reckless
                    courage in incurring dangers he united the greatest judgment when in the midst
                    of them. No toil could exhaust his body or overcome his spirit. Of heat and cold
                    he was equally tolerant. His consumption of meat and drink was determined by
                    natural desire, not by pleasure. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> His times of
                    waking and sleeping were not marked off by day or night: <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> what time remained when his work was done he gave to sleep,
                    which he did not court with a soft bed or stillness, but was seen repeatedly by
                    many lying on the ground wrapped in a common soldier's cloak amongst the
                    sentinels and outguards. His dress was in no way superior to that of his
                    fellows, but his arms and horses were conspicuous. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Both of horsemen and of foot-soldiers he was undoubtedly
                    the first —foremost to enter battle, and last to leave it when the fighting had
                    begun. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> These admirable qualities of the man
                    were equalled by his monstrous vices: his cruelty was inhuman, his perfidy worse
                    than Punic; he had no regard for truth, and none for sanctity, no fear of the
                    gods, no reverence for an oath, no religious scruple. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> With this endowment of <pb n="p.13"/> good and evil traits
                    he served for the space of three <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 221</note> years under Hasdrubal, omitting nothing that
                    should be done or seen by one who was to become a great commander. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> For the rest, from the day on which he was
                    proclaimed commander-in-chief, as though Italy had been assigned to him for his
                    field of operations and he <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> had been

                    lest he too, like his father Hamilcar, and afterwards Hasdrubal, should be

                        somewhat awkwardly effects the transition by means of the sentence
                        following, in which he tries to smooth over the contradiction between <hi

                    provoke the Romans to hostile action, he marched first into the territory of the

                    Carthaginians but not under their dominion —that he might appear not to have
                    aimed at the Saguntines but to have been drawn into that war by a chain of
                    events, as he conquered the neighbouring nations and annexed their territories.

                    There, by a generous partition of the booty and the faithful discharge of all

                    encamped on the bank of the river. As soon as the enemy were settled for the

                    to allow them room for crossing, resolving to attack them as they were

                    been going to fight in a <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> fair field. And so,
                    inspired by a native intrepidity, confiding in their multitude, and believing
                    —since they supposed that their enemies had retreated out of fear —that victory
                    was delayed but till they should have passed the river, they broke into a cheer,
                    and, staying for no man's orders, rushed into the stream wherever it happened to
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> be nearest. From the other side a great
                    body of cavalry was sent in <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> against them. The
                    meeting in mid-channel was no equal conflict, for there the footmen were
                    unsteady, and, scarce trusting to the ford, might even have been overthrown by
                    unarmed riders, urging their horses forward at haphazard; while the horsemen,

                    received the surrender of the <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Carpetani also.

                    indubitably imminent. The Roman consuls at that time were Publius Cornelius

                        telescoped events as to make the attack on Saguntum follow immediately on

                    Some were for sending the consuls into Spain and Africa respectively and waging
                    war by land and sea; others wanted to direct their <milestone n="7"

                    This last opinion, which seemed the safest, carried the day, and the envoys,

                    borders with a hostile army Hannibal laid waste their country far and wide and
                    advanced in three divisions against their city. There was an angle of the wall
                    that gave on a valley more open and more level than the other ground about the

                    pent-houses, that under their cover the battering-rams might be brought into

                    at some distance from the wall was smooth enough for moving the pent-houses, the
                    attempt succeeded very ill when it came to the final execution of it. There was
                    a great overhanging tower, and the wall —as was natural in a suspected place
                    —had been carried up to a greater height than elsewhere, and the pick of the
                    fighting men having been stationed there, where the greatest danger threatened,
                    offered a more strenuous resistance. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> At first
                    they drove the assailants off with missiles and left no spot safe for their

                    against the pickets and earthworks of their enemies, and in these
                    rough-and-tumble fights hardly more Saguntines fell than Phoenicians. <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/> But when Hannibal himself, who had somewhat
                    incautiously ventured up under the wall, was severely wounded in the front of
                    his thigh with a heavy javelin and sank to the ground, those about him fell into
                    such confusion and dismay as almost to abandon their works and pent-houses. </p>

                    section, giving way continuously for some distance, had exposed the town: three
                    towers in a row, together with the wall connecting them, had come down with a
                    loud crash. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Phoenicians believed that the
                    town was taken with that breach, through which from either side men rushed to
                    attack, as though the wall had protected both parties alike. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> It was not at all like the mellays that commonly occur in
                    sieges, where one side gets an opportunity, but regular battle lines had formed,
                    as in an open field, between the ruins of the wall and the buildings of the

                    this side hope, on that despair inspired courage. The Phoenicians believed the
                    city to be theirs, if they put forth a little effort. The Saguntines opposed
                    their bodies to defend their city, denuded of its walls, nor would one of them
                    draw back his foot lest he admit an enemy to the spot which he had vacated.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> And the harder both sides fought and <pb

                    of those wounded, for no missile fell without taking effect on shield or body.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The Saguntines had a javelin, called a

                    terrible, even if it stuck fast in the shield and did not penetrate the body,
                    was this, that when it <milestone n="12??" unit="section"/> had been lighted at
                    the middle and so hurled, the flames were fanned to a fiercer heat by its very

                    set up a shout and thrust forth their enemies amongst the ruins of the wall, and

                    found it necessary to oppose his arguments, so nearly unanimous was the senate
                    in supporting Hannibal. They declared that Hanno had spoken more bitterly than
                    Valerius Flaccus, the Roman envoy. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They then
                    gave their answer to the envoys, to the effect that the war had been begun by
                    the Saguntines, not by Hannibal, and that the Roman People would be doing wrong
                    if they preferred the Saguntines to their very ancient alliance with the

                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> While the Romans were wasting time in
                    dispatching embassies, Hannibal had allowed his soldiers, exhausted as they were
                    with fighting and constructing works, to rest for a few days, after posting
                    outguards to look to the pent-houses and other engines. <pb n="p.33"/> Meanwhile
                    he kindled their ardour, now by inciting <note anchored="true"

                    should go to the soldiers, they were so excited, one and all, that if the signal
                    had been given instantly, it seemed as if no force could have withstood them.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Saguntines, though they had had a rest
                    from fighting, neither attacking nor being attacked for several days, had
                    laboured incessantly, both day and night, to replace the wall where its collapse
                    had exposed the town. </p>
                <p> The assault was now resumed, with far greater fury than before, and it was hard
                    for the inhabitants to know, when shouts and cries were resounding on every
                    hand, to what point they should first, or preferably, bring up supports.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Hannibal was present in person to urge on
                    his men, where they were pushing up a movable tower that surpassed in height all
                    the defences of the city. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As soon as it had

                    about five hundred Africans with pickaxes to undermine the wall. This was no
                    hard task, for the rubble had not been solidified with mortar, but filled in
                    with mud, after an ancient mode of building. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    It therefore fell for wider stretches than were actually hacked away, and
                    through the breaches bands of armed men passed into the city. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> They even seized an elevation, and setting up catapults and
                        <hi rend="italics">ballistae</hi> there, built a wall around it, so as to
                    have within the town itself a stronghold that commanded it like a citadel.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The <pb n="p.35"/> Saguntines too built a

                        type="margin">B.C. 219</note> protect that part of the city that was not yet
                    taken. On both sides the soldiers worked and fought with the utmost energy; but
                    the Saguntines, contracting their defences, were bringing their city day by day
                    within a smaller compass. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> At the same time
                    there was an increasing scarcity of everything, on account of the long blockade;

                    while by the sudden departure of Hannibal for the territories of the Oretani and
                    the Carpetani. These two nations, exasperated by a rigorous conscription, had
                    seized the recruiting officers and thereby given rise to fears of a revolt, but
                    were caught unprepared by Hannibal's celerity, and laid down the arms they had

                    Maharbal, the son of Himilco, whom Hannibal had left in charge, so bestirred
                    himself that the absence of the general was felt neither by his countrymen nor
                    by the enemy. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He fought a number of successful
                    skirmishes, and with three battering-rams laid low a considerable portion of the

                <p> An all but hopeless attempt to arrange a peace was then made by two men, Alco, a

                    Hannibal in the night, without the knowledge of the Sanguntines. But finding
                    that tears were of no avail and that the terms obtainable were such as a
                    wrathful conqueror would impose, he changed from pleader to deserter, and
                    remained with the enemy, declaring that anybody who should treat for peace on
                    those conditions would be put to death. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The
                    conditions were as follows: they must make restitution to the Turdetani, and,

                        unit="section"/> It was there, as they tell, that he saw in his sleep a

                    guide. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> At first he was afraid and followed,
                    neither looking to the right nor to the left, nor yet behind him; but presently
                    wondering, with that curiosity to which all of us are prone, what it could be
                    that he had been forbidden to look back upon, he was unable to command his eyes;
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> then he saw behind him a serpent of
                    monstrous size, that moved along with vast destruction of trees and underbrush,
                    and a storm-cloud coming after, with loud claps of thunder; <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> and, on his asking what this prodigious portent was, he was
                    told that it was the devastation of Italy: he was therefore to go on, nor
                    enquire further, but suffer destiny to be wrapped in darkness. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Rejoicing at this vision, he led his troops
                    across the Ebro in three columns, after sending agents ahead, to win over with
                    presents the Gauls who dwelt in the region which the army had to cross, and to
                    explore the passes of the Alps. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He had ninety
                    thousand foot and twelve thousand horse <pb n="p.67"/> when he crossed the Ebro.
                    He now subdued the <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.

                    which lies at the foot of the Pyrenees. All this coast he put in charge of
                    Hanno, that the passes connecting Spain and Gaul might be under his control.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> To garrison this district, he gave Hanno

                    lead over the Pyrenees, and more definite rumours had spread amongst the
                    barbarians that the war was to be with Rome, three thousand of the Carpetanian
                    foot turned back. It was understood that they were influenced not so much by the

                    been hazardous, for it might have roused resentment in the savage bosoms of the
                    others. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> And so Hannibal sent back to their
                    homes above seven thousand more, whom he had perceived to be chafing at the

                    were driven by the fear of servitude to arm themselves, and several tribes

                        Livy has said nothing of any negotiations between Hannibal and the Boi,

                    soon on the scene himself, and a twofold terror hemmed them in, as that mighty

                    villages. Hannibal brought over at leisure the rest of his forces, and giving
                    himself no more concern over Gallic outbreaks, pitched his camp. </p>
                <p> I believe that there were various plans for transporting the elephants; at all
                    events the tradition varies as to how it was accomplished. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Some say that the elephants were first assembled on the
                    bank, and then the keeper of the fiercest of them provoked the beast and fled
                    into the water; as he swam off, the elephant pursued him and drew the herd in
                    his train; and though they were afraid of the deep water, yet as soon as each of
                    them got out of his depth, the current itself swept him over to the other bank.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It is, however, more generally believed
                    that they were carried across on rafts; this method, as it would be the safer,
                    if the thing were to be done, so, in view of its accomplishment, is more
                    probably the one employed. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> A raft, two hundred
                    feet long and fifty feet wide, was thrust out from the shore into the stream,
                    and, after being moored to the bank above by a number of stout hawsers, so as
                    not to be carried down the current, was covered with earth, <pb n="p.83"/> like
                    a bridge, in order that the beasts might boldly <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 218</note> venture upon it, as on

                    and a hundred feet long, and fit for crossing the river, was coupled to the
                    first. Then the elephants, with the females leading, were driven out over the
                    stationary raft, as over a road; and after they had passed on to the smaller
                    raft adjoining it, the ropes by which this had been loosely attached were cast
                    off and it was towed across by some rowboats to the eastern bank. <milestone
                        n="9" unit="section"/> After landing the first contingent in this fashion,
                    they returned and fetched the others over. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    The elephants exhibited no signs of fear so long as they were being driven along
                    as though on a connected bridge; they first became frightened when the raft was
                    cast loose from the other and was carried out into mid-channel. <milestone
                        n="11" unit="section"/> The crowding together which resulted, as those on
                    the outside shrank back from the water, gave rise to a slight panic, till terror
                    itself, as they looked at the water all about them, made them quiet. <milestone

                        that those that went overboard were saved by the length of their trunks,
                        which they kept above the surface, and, breathing so, passed through the
                        water, for the most part on their feet (III. xlvii. 12). Livy seems to have
                        thought of them as swimming. </note>

                    Hannibal had dispatched five hundred Numidian horsemen in the direction of the

                    the Romans, who were by that time fairly exhausted. The victors lost about a

                    two hundred. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This was at once the beginning of

                    movements of the enemy; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> while Hannibal,
                    uncertain whether to march on, as he had begun, to Italy, or give battle to the

                    of strength by the arrival of Boian envoys, with their chief Magalus. These
                    assured him that they would guide his march and share its perils, and urged him
                    to avoid a battle and to keep his forces whole and unimpaired for the invasion
                    of Italy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The rank and file were fearful of

                        would be no great difficulty in reconciling the account in Livy with that in

                    the shaggy, unkempt men; animals and inanimate objects alike stiff with cold,
                    and all more dreadful to look upon than words can tell, renewed their

                    the first slopes, mountaineers were discovered posted on the heights above, who,
                    had they lain concealed in hidden valleys, might have sprung out suddenly and
                    attacked them with great rout and slaughter. Hannibal gave the command to halt,
                    and sent forward some Gauls to reconnoitre. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    When informed by them that there was no getting by that way, he encamped in the

                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He then employed these same Gauls, whose
                    speech and customs did not differ greatly from those of the mountaineers, to
                    mingle in their councils, and in this way learned that his enemies guarded the
                    pass only by day, and at night dispersed, every man to his own home. As soon as
                    it was light, he advanced up the hills, as though lie hoped to rush the defile

                    in from their fastnesses to occupy their customary post, when they suddenly
                    perceived that some of their enemies were in possession of the heights and
                    threatened them from above, and that others were marching through the pass.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Both facts presenting themselves at the
                    same time to their eyes and minds kept them for a moment rooted to the spot.
                    Then, when they saw the helter-skelter in the pass and the column becoming
                    embarrassed by its own confusion, the horses especially being frightened
                        <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> and unmanageable, they thought that
                    whatever they could add themselves to the consternation of the troops would be
                    sufficient to destroy them, and rushed down from the cliffs on either side, over

                        unit="section"/> Then indeed the Phoenicians had to contend at one and the

                    struggle amongst themselves, as each endeavoured to outstrip the rest in
                    escaping from the danger, was greater than the struggle with the enemy.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The horses occasioned the greatest peril
                    to the column. Terrified by the discordant yells, which the woods and ravines
                    redoubled with their echoes, they quaked <pb n="p.99"/> with fear; and if they
                    happened to be hit or <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin"
                        >B.C. 218</note> wounded, were so maddened that they made enormous havoc not
                    only of men but of every sort of baggage. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Indeed the crowding in the pass, which was steep and precipitous on both sides,
                    caused many —some of them armed men —to be flung down to a great depth; but when
                    beasts of burden with their packs went hurtling down, it was just like the crash
                    of falling walls. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Dreadful as these sights
                    were, still Hannibal halted for a little while and held back his men, so as not
                    to augment the terror and confusion. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Then,
                    when he saw that the column was being broken in two, and there was danger lest
                    he might have got his army over to no avail, if it were stripped of its baggage,
                    he charged down from the higher ground and routed the enemy by the very impetus
                    of the attack, though he added to the disorder amongst his own troops.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But the flurry thus occasioned quickly
                    subsided, as soon as the roads were cleared by the flight of the mountaineers;
                    and the whole army was presently brought over the pass, not only without

                    then seized a stronghold which was the chief place in that region, together with
                    the outlying hamlets, and with the captured food and flocks supported his troops
                    for three days. And in those three days, being hindered neither by the natives,
                    who had been utterly cowed at the outset, nor very greatly by the nature of the

                    Hannibal, neither blindly trusting nor yet repulsing them, lest, being spurned,
                    they might become openly hostile, returned a friendly answer, accepted the
                    proffered hostages, and used the supplies, which they had brought down,
                    themselves, to the road. But he drew up his column, before following their

                    himself, with the main strength of the infantry, came next, looking warily about

                    to a narrow place, which was overhung on one side by a ridge, the tribesmen rose
                    up on every quarter from their ambush and assailed them, front and rear,
                    fighting hand to hand and at long range, and rolling down huge boulders on the

                    on the mountaineers appeared in smaller numbers, and, more in the manner of

                    whenever the ground afforded an advantage, or the invaders, pushing on too far

                    trails; but wherever they went they made the column safe from its enemies, who

                    to them, and just under the Alps the plains about the Po, he told them that they
                    were now scaling the ramparts not only of Italy, but of Rome itself; the rest of
                    the way would be level or downhill; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> and after
                    one, or, at the most, two battles, they would have in their hands and in their

                    and even the enemy had ceased to annoy them, except to make a stealthy raid, as
                    occasion offered. But the way was much more difficult than the ascent had been,
                    as indeed the slope of the Alps on the Italian <milestone n="11??"

                    shorter. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> For practically every road was
                    steep, narrow, and treacherous, so that neither could they keep from slipping,
                    nor could those who had been thrown a little off their balance retain their
                    footing, but came down, one on top of the other, and the beasts on top of the

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> They then came to a much narrower cliff, and
                    with rocks so perpendicular that it was difficult for an unencumbered soldier to
                    manage the descent, though he felt his way and clung with his hands to the
                    bushes and roots that projected here and there. <milestone n="2" unit="section"

                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 218</note> of the road, and as
                    Hannibal was wondering what it could be that held the column back, word was
                    brought to him that the cliff was impassable. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Going then to inspect the place himself, he thought that there was nothing for
                    it but to lead the army round, over trackless and untrodden steeps, however
                    circuitous the detour might be. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But that way
                    proved to be insuperable; for above the old, untouched snow lay a fresh deposit
                    of moderate depth, through which, as it was soft and not very deep, the men in
                    front found it easy to advance; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> but when it
                    had been trampled down by the feet of so many men and beasts, the rest had to
                    make their way over the bare ice beneath and the slush of the melting snow.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Then came a terrible struggle on the
                    slippery surface, for it afforded them no foothold, while the downward slope
                    made their feet the more quickly slide from under them; so that whether they
                    tried to pull themselves up with their hands, or used their knees, these
                    supports themselves would slip, and down they would come again! Neither were
                    there any stems or roots about, by which a man could pull himself up with foot
                    or hand —only smooth ice and thawing snow, on which they were continually
                    rolling. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But the baggage animals, as they went
                    over the snow, would sometimes even cut into the lowest crust, and pitching
                    forward and striking out with their hoofs, as they struggled to rise, would
                    break clean through it, so that numbers of them were caught fast, as if
                    entrapped, in the hard, deep-frozen snow. </p>

                    <milestone n="37" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> At last, when men and beasts had been worn out
                    to no avail, they encamped upon the ridge, <pb n="p.109"/> after having, with
                    the utmost difficulty, cleared <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 218</note> enough ground even for this purpose, so much
                    snow were they obliged to dig out and remove. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    The soldiers were then set to work to construct a road across the cliff-their
                    only possible way. Since they had to cut through the rock, they felled some huge
                    trees that grew near at hand, and lopping off their branches, made an enormous
                    pile of logs. This they set on fire, as soon as the wind blew fresh enough to
                    make it burn, and pouring vinegar over the glowing rocks, caused them to
                    crumble. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> After thus heating the crag with
                    fire, they opened a way in it with iron tools, and relieved the steepness of the
                    slope with zigzags of an easy gradient, so that not only the baggage animals but
                    even the elephants could be led down. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        This famous story has provoked much ridicule, but in Livy's defence may be
                        noted, (1) the well-known disintegrating effect on certain kinds of stone of
                        heat followed by a douche of cold water; (2) the belief entertained in
                        ancient times, and as late as the sixteenth century, that vinegar helped to
                        make stones friable; (3) the likelihood that Hannibal had at least a few
                        skins of sour wine in his baggage-train (some have held that a vast quantity
                        would have been required, but it must be remembered that Livy may have
                        conceived of the <hi rend="italics">width</hi> of the landslip as only a few
                        rods; see last note). In any case those who regard the vinegar story as
                        fiction must not fasten the fiction on Livy, if, as I think, we may discern
                        an allusion to it in Varro's Menippean Satires ( <hi rend="italics"

                    the Romans, if only the Gauls made no disturbance, but was far from acceptable

                    this state of affairs, and in order at the same time to sustain his troops with

                        unit="section"/> Sempronius, on the contrary, held that the strongest bond
                    for keeping the allies to their obligations was the defence of those who should

                    rout to the very outposts of the Carthaginian camp. Thence the enemy poured out
                    in numbers and repulsed the Romans, in their turn; but reserves came up and

                    he himself had been successful. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He declared

                    lacked experience, while the abler of their generals was incapacitated by his

                    soon be fought, and was eager, should there be any hesitation, to force it on.
                    And so, when his Gallic scouts —who were safer for gathering the information
                    that he wanted because there were men of that nation in both camps —had reported
                    that the Romans were prepared to fight, the Phoenician began to look about for a

                    When Hannibal, riding over the ground himself, saw that this place afforded

                    of his troops. He had fully made up his mind beforehand and was eager for the

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Hannibal's soldiers had in the meantime made
                    fires before their tents; in each company they had been served with oil to
                    supple their joints, and had breakfasted at leisure. When, therefore, they were
                    told that the enemy had crossed the river, they were eager both in mind and
                    body, as they armed and went out to battle. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In
                    front of the standards Hannibal placed the Baliares, light-armed troops
                    numbering about eight thousand, and behind these his heavy infantry, tile
                    strength and flower of his army; the wings he formed of ten thousand horse, and,
                    dividing the elephants, stationed them outside the wings. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> The consul's troopers were scattered in pursuit of the
                    Numidians, when suddenly the latter made a stand and took them unawares;
                    whereupon he called them back and posted them on either flank of the infantry.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> There were eighteen thousand Romans and
                    twenty thousand allies of the Latin name, besides the auxiliaries of the
                    Cenomani, the only Gallic tribe that continued loyal. These were the contending
                    forces. </p>
                <p> The Baliares began the battle, but those light-armed troops, finding the legions
                    too strong to cope with, were quickly withdrawn and sent to the wings.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This manœuvre at once caused the Roman
                    cavalry acute distress; for they numbered but four thousand, and, tired as they
                    were, would scarce have been able to hold out any longer against the enemy's ten
                        <pb n="p.165"/> thousand cavalry alone, who were most of them <note

                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> and now they were overwhelmed, as it were

                    Besides this, the elephants, looming large on the outer extremities of the
                    wings, gave rise to such a panic, particularly among the horses, not only by
                    their strange appearance, but also by their unfamiliar smell, as to bring about
                    a general flight. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As for the infantry, they
                    were fairly matched in courage, but not in strength, which was unimpaired in the
                    case of the Phoenicians, who had refreshed themselves shortly before entering
                    the battle, while the Romans were faint with fasting and fatigue, and were stiff
                    and numb with cold. Yet their courage would have enabled them to resist, had
                    they fought against infantry alone. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But the
                    Baliares, having put the cavalry to flight, were raining missiles on their
                    flanks; the elephants had now charged the centre of the line; and Mago and his
                    Numidians, as soon as the Roman army had passed their ambuscade without
                    observing it, started up in their rear, and caused the wildest panic and
                    confusion. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Nevertheless, amidst all these
                    evils, the line held for a time unshaken, and even —what no one had dared to

                    expressly posted to deal with the beasts, would throw darts at them and make
                    them turn away, and then pursuing them would strike them under the tail, where

                    presently the moisture taken up by the wind had been congealed over the cold
                    mountain ridges, it descended in such a storm of sleet that the men let go of
                    everything and threw themselves on their faces on the ground, overwhelmed by

                    be unable, because his sinews were so stiff and tense that he could hardly bend

                    Sempronius, who had now returned from Rome, decline the combat. That day there
                    were only three miles between the two encampments. On the following day they
                    fought, with great spirit and with shifting fortunes. <milestone n="3"

                    that not only were they victorious in the battle, but they pursued the beaten

                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When Hannibal heard this and perceived
                    that the fighting had grown lax and that the enemy had retired from his rampart,
                    he suddenly sent his cavalry against them from the right and left and rushed out
                    himself with the strength of his infantry from the centre of the camp.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Seldom has there been a fiercer battle or
                    one more notable for the losses on both sides than this would have been, had the

                    had been begun with the greatest ardour. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                    fury of the combatants was consequently greater than the carnage, and as the
                    battle was practically a drawn one, so were the losses equal when the opposing
                    forces separated. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> On neither side had more
                    than six hundred of the infantry fallen or half as many of the cavalry; but the
                    loss of the Romans was out of proportion to the number slain, for it included
                    several knights, five tribunes of the soldiers, and three praefects of the
                    allies. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> After this engagement Hannibal
                    retired into Liguria and Sempronius to Luca. The Ligurians had ambushed and made
                    prisoners of two Roman quaestors, Gaius Fulvius and Lucius Lucretius, with two
                    tribunes of the soldiers and five members of the equestrian order —mostly sons
                    of senators. These men they handed over to Hannibal on his coming among them, as

                    The blockade lasted thirty days, during which time the snow rarely lay less than

                        described by Livy in §§ 1-4. The source which Livy used for the latter part
                        of the chapter was perhaps a Greek writer whose account of Hasdrubal's
                        offensive was so different from that of Polybius that Livy thought that they
                        related to two distinct campaigns. It is possible that Livy's immediate
                        source in §§ 5-11 was Coelius and that the discomfiture of the Lacetani is
                        an embellishment of the story due to the latter's patriotic inventiveness.

                    that winter, or —as often happens when men's thoughts are once turned upon
                    religion —many were reported and too easily credited. Some of these portents
                    were: that a free-born infant of six months had cried <quote>Triumph!</quote>
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> in the provision market; that in the cattle

                    to the third storey of a house and then, alarmed by the outcry of the occupants,
                    had thrown itself down; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> that phantom ships had
                    been seen gleaming in the sky; that the temple of Hope, in the provision market,
                    had been struck by lightning; that in Lanuvium a slain victim had stirred, and a
                    raven had flown down into Juno's temple and alighted on her very couch; that in
                    the district of Amiternum, in many places, apparitions of men in shining raiment
                    had appeared in the distance, but had not drawn near to anyone; <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> that in the Picentian country there had been a shower of

                    expiation of the other portents, and in this virtually all the citizens bore a
                    part. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> First of all, the city was purified, and
                    major victims were offered up to the designated gods; <milestone n="8"

                    Lanuvium for Juno, and a bronze statue was dedicated to Juno, by the matrons, on

                    where the lots had shrunk; and a supplication was ordered to be made to Fortune

                        their magistracies on the ground that unfavourable auguries had been
                        reported. But Flaminius refused to return, fought and won a battle, and
                        triumphed in the face of senatorial opposition <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> —by virtue of a decree of the people. </note> He was
                    also hated by the senators on account of an unprecedented law which Quintus
                    Claudius the tribune of the plebs had introduced, despite the opposition of the
                    senate, with the backing of Gaius Flaminius alone of all that body, providing
                    that no senator or senator's son should own a sea-going ship of more than three
                    hundred amphoras burden <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The amphora
                        —a wine-jar with two handles —was standardized as a liquid measure roughly
                        equal to six gallons. In our terminology such a vessel would be described as
                        of about seven tons burden. </note> —this was reckoned to be sufficient to
                    transport the crops from one's fields, and all money-making was held unseemly
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> in a senator. The measure, which was
                    vehemently opposed, had been productive of great resentment on the part of the
                    nobles against Flaminius, who had advocated its enactment; but had procured for
                    him the favour of the plebs and afterwards <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> a
                    second consulship. Believing, therefore, that his enemies would falsify the

                        they had duly presided over the sacrifice to Jupiter Latiaris, which was the

                    consul, to detain him in the City, he pretended that he had to take a journey,

                    aroused fresh indignation in the breasts of the already hostile senators: Gaius
                    Flaminius, they said, was waging war not only with the senate, but this time
                    with <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> the immortal gods. He had formerly been
                    made consul without the confirmation of the auspices, and, though both gods and
                    men had sought to recall him from the very battle-line, he <pb n="p.191"/> had
                    not obeyed; now, conscious of having spurned <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 217</note> them, he had fled the

                        unit="section"/> Jupiter Optimus Maximus; that he might not see and consult
                    the senate, which hated him and which he alone of all men hated; that he might
                    not proclaim the Latin Festival and offer the accustomed sacrifice to Jupiter
                    Latiaris on <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> the Alban Mount; that he might
                    not, after receiving auspices, go up to the Capitol to make his vows, and thence

                    he entered on his magistracy, and as he was offering up a calf, it escaped
                    —after being struck —out of the hands of those who would have sacrificed it, and
                    spattered many of the bystanders <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> with its
                    blood. The dismay and confusion <pb n="p.193"/> were even greater among those
