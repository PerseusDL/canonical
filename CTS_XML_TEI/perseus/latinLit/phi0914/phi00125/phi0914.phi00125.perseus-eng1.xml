                        days' march from Tarentum; cf. viii. 12. He had previously been near Arpi,
                        in Apulia; XXIV. xlv. 11 ff. </note> in the hope of getting possession of
                    the city of Tarentum through treachery. Meantime, however, Sallentine cities of
                    no importance went over to his side. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> At the
                    same time among the Bruttians, out of twelve states which in the previous year
                    had revolted to the Carthaginians, Consentia and Taurianum returned to their
                    allegiance to the Roman people; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and more would
                    have returned if a prefect of the allies, Titus Pomponius Veientanus, who by
                    successfully ravaging Bruttian territory a number of times gained the appearance
                    of a regularly appointed general, had not gathered a hastily mustered army and
                    engaged Hanno. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A great many men were slain or
                    captured there, an ill-organized mass, however, of rustics and slaves. It was
                    the smallest part of the loss that, along with the rest, the prefect was
                    captured, who was responsible at that time for a reckless battle, and had
                    previously been a tax-farmer possessed of all the dishonest devices, faithless
                    and ruinous both to the state and to the companies. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Sempronius, the consul, fought many small engagements in
                    Lucania, not one worthy of record, and took by storm a number of unimportant
                    Lucanian towns. </p>

                <p> The longer the war dragged on and success and <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 213</note> failure altered the
                    situation, and quite as much so the attitude of men, superstitious fears, in
                    large part foreign at that, invaded the state to such a degree that either men
                    or else gods suddenly seemed changed. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> And now
                    not only in secret and within the walls of houses were Roman rites abandoned,
                    but in public places also and in the Forum and on the Capitol there was a crowd
                    of women who were following the custom of the fathers neither in their
                    sacrifices nor in prayers to the gods. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        > Forsaken, as they felt, by their own gods, the populace were turning to

                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Petty priests and also prophets had taken hold
                    on men's minds. And the number of these was increased by the mass of rustics
                    forced by want and fear into the city from their farms neglected and endangered
                    because of the long war, and by easy profit from the delusion of others-a trade
                    which they plied as though it were sanctioned. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    At first good men's indignation was voiced in private; then the matter reached
                    the senate and now even official complaints. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    The aediles and the three police magistrates were roundly censured by the senate
                    because they did not stop it; and after they had attempted to drive that crowd
                    out of the Forum and to scatter the properties required for the rites, they
                    narrowly escaped violence. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Now that the
                    disorder appeared to be too strong to be quelled by the lower magistrates, the
                    senate assigned to Marcus Aemilius, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    issued an edict that whoever had books of prophecies or prayers or a ritual of

                    year: Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, pontifex maximus, and Gaius Papirius Masso, son
                    of Gaius, a pontifex, and Publius Furius Philus, an augur, and Gaius Papirius

                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In place of Lentulus they made Marcus
                    Cornelius Cethegus a pontiff and Gnaeus Servilius Caepio in that of Papirius;
                    Lucius Quinctius Flamininus was named augur, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, decemvir
                    in charge of rites. </p>

                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> For the consular elections the time was now
                    approaching, but because the consuls were occupied with the war and it was not
                    thought advisable to call them away, Tiberius Sempronius, the consul, named
                    Gaius Claudius Cento dictator to hold the elections. He in turn named Quintus
                    Fulvius Flaccus master of the horse. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> On the
                    first day available for elections the dictator announced the choice as consuls
                    of Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, master of the horse, and Appius Claudius Pulcher,
                    who as praetor had had Sicily as his province. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Then the following were elected praetors: Gnaeus Fulvius Flaccus, Gaius Claudius
                    Nero, Marcus Junius Silanus, Publius Cornelius Sulla. Having finished the
                    elections, the dictator laid down his office. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Curule aedile that year, together with Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, was Publius

                    candidate for the aedileship, and the tribunes of the plebs tried to oppose him,
                    saying that he ought not to be considered because he did <pb n="p.347"/> not

                    Marcellus, whose province was Syracuse and up to the former boundaries of

                    that before his time the decemvirs, under whose laws they were then still

                    of the people in their cases; that Postumius of Pyrgi had wrested the vote from
                    the Roman people, had brought to naught an assembly of the plebs, reduced the
                    tribunes to the ranks, drawn up a battle-line against the Roman people, had
                    taken his position, to separate the tribunes from the people and to prevent the
                    tribes from being summoned to vote. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Nothing
                    had restrained men from slaughter and battle but the forbearance of the
                    magistrates in yielding for the moment to the mad audacity of a few men, and in
                    allowing themselves and the Roman people to be worsted, also in that, as regards
                    the voting, which the defendant would have prevented by force of arms, they had
                    of their own accord suspended it, to avoid giving excuse to those eager for the
                    fray. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> These words were interpreted by all the
                    best citizens as deserved by an outrageous occurrence, and the senate declared
                    that this violence had been employed against the state, setting a dangerous
                    precedent. Thereupon the Carvilii, tribunes of the people, in place of the
                    procedure to fix the amount of the fine, at once named a day for Postumius'
                    appearance on a capital charge, and ordered that if he did not furnish sureties
                    he should be seized by an attendant and taken to prison. Postumius furnished
                    sureties, but did not appear. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    <pb n="p.355"/> The tribunes put the question to the plebs and the <note

                    ordained that, if Marcus Postumius should not appear before the first of May,
                    and on being summoned on that day should not reply nor be excused, it should be
                    understood that he was in exile, and be decided that his property should be sold
                    and himself refused water and fire. The tribunes then began to name a day for
                    the appearance on a capital charge of each of those who had been instigators of
                    riot and sedition, and to demand sureties from them. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> At first they threw into prison those who did not give
                    security, and then even those who were able to do so. Avoiding this danger many
                    went into exile. </p>
                <p> V. Such was the outcome of dishonesty on the part of the publicans and of
                    audacity seeking to cover dishonesty. Next was held an election for the choice
                    of a pontifex maximus. This election was conducted by a new pontiff, Marcus
                    Cornelius Cethegus. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Three men canvassed with
                    great rivalry: Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, the consul, who had been consul twice
                    before and also censor, and Titus Manlius Torquatus, likewise distinguished by
                    two consulships and a censorship, and Publius Licinius Crassus, who was only
                    about to be a candidate for a curule aedileship. This young man defeated in that
                    contest old men who had held high offices. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    Before him for a hundred and twenty years no one who had not occupied a curule
                    chair had been elected pontifex maximus, except Publius Cornelius Calussa. </p>
                <p> The consuls were finding it difficult to complete the levy, since the scant
                    supply of young men was hardly sufficient for the two purposes, enrollment of

                    if they had been recruited at seventeen years or older. In accordance with this

                    His well-known voice and the now familiar signal having aroused a sentry, the

                    garrison would be so reduced by serious losses that the Tarentines by themselves
                    could easily defend the city against them. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    After fortification began, a gate was suddenly opened and the Romans made an

                    Hannibal had kept drawn up for this purpose, rose up on all sides. And the
                    Romans did not withstand the attack, but limited space and ground obstructed
                    partly by the work already begun, partly by preparations for the work, kept them
                    from a disorderly flight. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Very many leaped
                    into the fosse, and more were slain in flight than in battle. Then even

                    encouraged the Romans to make a surprise attack by night upon the works of the
                    enemy. Some of these they pulled apart, others they ruined by fire; and this was
                    the end of Hannibal's attack upon the citadel from that side. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> His remaining hope was in a blockade, and that was not very
                    effectual, because the occupants of the citadel, which is situated on a

                    the city on the other hand was shut off from supplies by sea and the besiegers
                    were nearer to starvation than the besieged. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Hannibal summoned the leading men of Tarentum and laid before them all the
                    difficulties of the situation, saying that he neither saw a way to take so well
                    fortified <milestone n="13??" unit="section"/> a citadel by storm, nor had any

                    be brought from neighbouring places to Capua. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Hannibal ordered Hanno to march with his army from the land of the Bruttii over
                    into Campania, and to see to it that the Campanians should have a supply of
                    grain. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Hanno set out from the land of the
                    Bruttii with his army, avoided camps of the enemy and the consuls, who were in
                    Samnium, and when he was now nearing Beneventum, pitched camp on high ground
                    three miles from the city itself. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Then he
                    ordered grain to be brought into camp from allied peoples of the neighbourhood,
                    among whom it had been garnered in the summer; and he furnished troops to escort
                    the supplies. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Then he sent word to Capua,
                    naming a day on which they should appear at the camp to get their grain, after
                    bringing together from the farms on all sides every kind of vehicle and beast of
                    burden. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This order was carried out by the
                    Campanians with their usual carelessness and indifference. Little more than four
                    hundred vehicles were sent, and a few beasts of burden besides. For this they
                    were censured by Hanno, that not even hunger, which, as he said, inflames even
                    dumb brutes, could spur their diligence; and another day was assigned for
                    getting their grain with ampler means of transport. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> When all this was reported, just as it happened, to the
                    Beneventans, they at once <pb n="p.391"/> sent ten legates to the consuls, the
                    camp of the <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        212</note> Romans being near Bovianum. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                    consuls, on hearing what was going on near Capua, mutually arranged that one of
                    them should lead his army into Campania, and Fulvius, to whom that assignment
                    had fallen, set out and entered the walls of Beneventum at night. <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/> Being near now, he learned that Hanno had gone with
                    a part of his army to procure grain; that through his quaestor grain had been
                    furnished to the Campanians; that two thousand wagons and in addition a mixed
                    and unarmed multitude had arrived; that everything was being done in confusion
                    and excitement, and that the arrangement of the camp and military routine had
                    been broken down by the influx of rustics, foreigners <note anchored="true"

                <p>
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> These facts being sufficiently established,
                    the consul ordered the soldiers to make ready their standards and arms, and
                    nothing else, for the following night; they must attack the Carthaginian camp.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Setting out at the fourth watch, leaving
                    all their packs and baggage at Beneventum, they reached the camp shortly before
                    daylight and inspired such panic that, if the camp had been placed on level
                    ground, it could undoubtedly have been taken by the first assault. <milestone
                        n="13" unit="section"/> The lofty situation protected it, also the
                    fortifications, which could not be approached from any side except by a steep
                    and difficult slope. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> At daybreak a great
                    battle blazed up. And the Carthaginians not only defended the earthwork but, as
                    they had the more favourable situation, pushed down the enemy struggling up the
                    steep slope. <milestone n="14" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Nevertheless obstinate courage surmounted
                    everything, and so the earthwork and the trenches were reached in several places
                    at once, but with many wounds and heavy loss of <pb n="p.393"/> men. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> Accordingly the consul called together his <note

                    lieutenants and tribunes of the soldiers and told them he must give up his rash
                    undertaking; that it seemed to him safer to lead the army back that day to
                    Beneventum, and then on the following day to pitch camp close to that of the
                    enemy, so that the Campanians might not be able to leave it nor Hanno to return.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> To accomplish that more readily, he would
                    summon his colleague also and his army, and they would focus the entire war upon
                    that point. These plans of the general were disrupted, when he was already
                    sounding the recall, by the shouts of the soldiers rejecting an order so lacking
                    in spirit. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Nearest to the enemy happened to be
                    a Paelignian cohort, whose prefect Vibius Accaus seized the banner and threw it
                    over the enemy's earthwork. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Then, with a curse
                    upon himself and the cohort if the enemy should get possession of that banner,
                    he was himself the first to dash over the trench and wall into the camp.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> And already the Paelignians were fighting
                    inside the wall, when from the other side of the camp, while Valerius Flaccus,
                    tribune of the soldiers of the third legion, was reproaching the Romans for
                    their cowardice in yielding to allies the honour of capturing the camp, Titus
                    Pedanius, first centurion of the <hi rend="italics">principes,</hi> took a
                    standard away from the standard-bearer and said <quote> This standard and this
                        centurion will in a moment be inside the enemy's wall. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Let those follow who are to prevent the standard from
                        being captured by the enemy. </quote>
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> First the men of his own maniple followed him
                    as he crossed the trench, then the whole legion. And now the consul at the sight
                    of men crossing the wall changed his plan, turned from recalling his soldiers to
                    arousing <pb n="p.395"/> and encouraging them, and pointed out to them in <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 212</note> what a
                    critical and perilous situation were the bravest cohort of the allies and a
                    legion of their fellow-citizens. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> And so, each
                    doing his best, over ground favourable and unfavourable, while javelins were
                    being hurled from every side and the enemy were interposing weapons and their
                    bodies, they made their way and burst in. Many wounded men, even those whose
                    strength and blood were ebbing, strove to fall inside the enemy's wall.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> And so in a moment's time the camp was
                    captured, just as if pitched on level ground and not strongly fortified. Then
                    came slaughter, no longer mere battle, since everything inside the wall was in
                    confusion. </p>
                <p> Over six thousand of the enemy were slain, over seven thousand men captured,
                    including the Campanians who came for grain, and the entire train of wagons and
                    mules. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> In addition there was the immense
                    booty which Hanno, having set out to plunder far and wide, had taken from farms
                    of allies of the Roman people. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Then after
                    destroying the enemy's camp they returned to Beneventum, and there the two
                    consuls —for Appius Claudius came there a few days late —sold and divided the
                    booty. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> And the men by whose efforts the camp
                    of the enemy had been captured, were rewarded, first of all Accaus the
                    Paelignian and Titus Pedanius, first centurion of the third legion. <milestone
                        n="14" unit="section"/> Hanno, leaving Cominium Ocritum, where he received
                    news of the disaster at the camp, with the few men he happened to have with him
                    to get grain, returned in what resembled a flight rather than a march to the
                    land of the Bruttii. <milestone n="15" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> And the Campanians, hearing of what was a
                    disaster as much to themselves as to their allies, sent legates to <pb n="p.397"

                    did not come to their aid in haste, Capua would fall into the power of the enemy
                    more promptly than Arpi. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Cf. XXIV.

                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They said that not even Tarentum, to say
                    nothing of its citadel, ought to be of such importance that he should hand over
                    to the Roman people the deserted and undefended Capua, which he had usually
                    compared with Carthage. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Hannibal, promising
                    that the Campanian cause would be his concern, for the present sent two thousand
                    horsemen with his lieutenants, that with this force they might be able to
                    protect their farms from devastation. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The Romans meantime were concerned among other
                    things for the citadel of Tarentum and the garrison there besieged. Gaius
                    Servilius, who as lieutenant had been sent by Publius Cornelius, the praetor,
                    into Etruria by authority of the senate to purchase grain, made his way through
                    the enemy's blockade into the harbour of Tarentum with a number of shiploads.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Thanks to his coming, the men who until
                    then in their faint hope had often been invited by the enemy in parleys to
                    change sides were actually inviting and urging the enemy to change sides. And
                    the garrison was in fact strong enough, now that soldiers who were at Metapontum
                    had been transferred to defend the citadel of Tarentum. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Accordingly the Metapontines were at once relieved of the
                    fear by which they were restrained, and went over to Hannibal. </p>
                <p> The Thurians also, on the same coast, did the same. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> What impelled them was not more the <pb n="p.399"/> revolt
                    of the Tarentines and that of the <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 212</note> Metapontines, with whom they were linked by

                    on account of the recent execution of the hostages. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Friends and relatives of these sent a letter and messengers
                    to Hanno and Mago, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Not the brother of

                        unit="section"/> Marcus Atinius was in command at Thurii with a garrison of
                    moderate size, and they thought that he could easily be tempted to dash rashly
                    into battle, from his confidence not so much in his soldiers, of whom he had
                    very few, as in the young men of Thurii. He had purposely organized them in

                    Carthaginian generals divided their forces between them and, on entering the
                    territory of Thurii, Hanno, with the infantry column ready to attack, proceeded
                    to the city. Mago with the cavalry halted under cover of hills conveniently
                    interposed to conceal an ambuscade. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Atinius,
                    informed of the infantry column alone by scouts, led his troops out into line,
                    he being unaware both of the conspiracy within and of the enemy's ambuscade.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The infantry battle was very lacking in
                    spirit, for only a few Romans were fighting in the front line, and the men of
                    Thurii were awaiting the outcome, rather than contributing to it. And the
                    Carthaginian line purposely retreated, in order to draw the heedless enemy to
                    the other side of the hill occupied by their own cavalry. <milestone n="13"
                        unit="section"/> When they reached the place, the cavalry, suddenly
                    attacking with a shout, at once put to flight the mass of the Thurians, which
                    was 399 <pb n="p.401"/> almost undisciplined and not entirely loyal to the side

                    which they were fighting. The Romans, though surrounded and hard pressed on one
                    side by the infantry, on the other by the cavalry, nevertheless kept on fighting
                    for some time. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Finally they also faced about
                    and fled to the city. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> There the traitors
                    massed together and admitted the column of their citizens through wide-open
                    gates; but when they saw the routed Romans moving toward the city, they shouted
                    that the Carthaginian was upon them, and unless they hastily closed the gates
                    the enemy also, mingling with them, would make their way into the city.
                        <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Thus they shut out the Romans and left
                    them to be slain by the enemy. Atinius, however, with a few men was admitted.
                    Then for a short time dissension continued, the other party <note

                    prevailed. Atinius and his men were brought down to the sea and ships, more
                    because they wished his personal safety, on account of his mild and just rule
                    over them, than out of regard for the Romans, and then they admitted the
                    Carthaginians to the city. </p>

                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> The consuls led their legions from Beneventum
                    into the Campanian territory, not merely to ruin the grain, which was by now

                    thought to make theirs a notable consulship by the destruction of so rich a

                    in the second year of his office, having been elected praetor by that same

                    which he said he would bring Gracchus with a few men; there Mago should conceal
                    armed infantry and cavalry; and the hiding-place had room, he said, for a very

                    which in that general commotion in Italy had gone over to the Carthaginians, to
                    return to the friendship of the Romans, since the Roman state also, which had
                    been nearly destroyed by the disaster at Cannae, was daily improving and
                    increasing, while Hannibal's power was growing feebler and had been reduced

                    said, the Romans would not be implacable; no people had ever been more easily

                    How often had a rebellion even of their own ancestors been pardoned! These

                    Gracchus, thinking that both speech and proposal were free from guile, and
                    misled by the plausibility of it, set out from the camp with his lictors and a
                    troop of cavalry, and with a guest-friend as his guide fell into the ambush.

                    raw, in large part also irregular and half-armed. When the columns were in sight
                    of each other and neither side refused battle, the lines were immediately drawn

                    expected where nothing was fairly matched. For more than two hours the battle

                    the rashness of one Roman general he was eager for an opportunity to surprise a

                    informing him that the praetor Gnaeus Fulvius had at first been very active
                    while besieging some Apulian cities which had revolted to Hannibal; but that
                    later, owing to unmerited success, both he himself and his soldiers, who were
                    loaded with booty, had gone to such lengths in licence and indifference that
                    there was no military discipline. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Hannibal,
                    who frequently at other times, and particularly within a few days, had
                    discovered what an army is under an incompetent general, moved his camp into

                    praetor Fulvius. When the news reached them there that the enemy were
                    approaching, they barely refrained from catching up their standards and going
                    out into battle-line without orders from the praetor. And nothing restrained
                    them more than the hope, now beyond question, that they would do so at their own
                    discretion whenever they pleased. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The
                    following night Hannibal, knowing that there had been an uproar in the camp and
                    that many, calling to arms, had over-confidently pressed the commander to give
                    the signal, had no doubt that an opportunity for a victory was offered.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He accordingly posted three thousand
                    lightly equipped soldiers in farmhouses near by and in the thickets and the

                    signal was given. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> And he ordered Mago <note

                    two thousand horsemen to lie in wait along all the roads in the direction which
                    he believed the flight would take. After making these preparations at night, he
                    led his troops out into line at daybreak. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Nor
                    did Fulvius hesitate, dragged into it not so much by any hope of his own as by
                    the haphazard impulse of the soldiers. And so, with the same recklessness with
                    which they went out to form, they drew up even the line of battle according to
                    the whim of soldiers who happened to dash forward and take their stand wherever
                    their own fancy had carried them, and then capriciously or in fear abandoned

                        was at times employed instead of the usual three lines, <hi rend="italics"

                    to resist, and that wherever the enemy should make their attack they would
                    pierce it, the men in line allowed no advice that was helpful to reach even
                    their ears, not to say their attention. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And
                    there was Hannibal, surely not that sort of a general, nor with that sort of an
                    army, drawn up in that fashion. Consequently the Romans did not withstand even
                    their shout and the first onset. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The general,

                    confusion, seized a horse and with about two hundred horsemen made his escape.

                    thinking it considerably lower than his own previous estimate of it and that of

                    of such importance, and after ladders had been secretly made ready, he ordered
                    the signal to be given to the others to eat early and then rest. In the night,

                    the ladders. And about a thousand armed men were led in a thin column to the

                    followed one after another, since the boldness of those ahead of them gave

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The thousand armed men had already taken a

                    were unaware of the great danger; for all were heavy with wine and sleep, and in

                    for Hippocrates and Himilco to move up their camp and legions, and not doubting
                    that, if he should get them into the citadel, the Roman army, shut up within the
                    city walls, could be destroyed. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Consequently
                    Marcellus, seeing that Euryalus could neither be won by surrender nor by
                    assault, pitched his camp between Neapolis and Tycha, these being the names of
                    quarters of the city, virtually cities in themselves. For he feared that, if he
                    should enter thickly settled parts, the soldiers in their eagerness for booty
                    could not be restrained from scattering. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> To

                    Marcellus held a council in regard to their prayers —such they were rather than
                    demands —and with the approval of all gave an order to the soldiers that no one
                    should injure a free person; everything else would be spoil. <milestone n="8"

                        not easily to be reconciled with the idea of an open space lying between two

                    To plundering there was no limit until they had carried away all the possessions

                    laid siege to Achradina with three camps placed in suitable positions, in the

                    For Hippocrates, after fortifying a camp by the Great Harbour and giving the

                    shore lying between the city and <pb n="p.443"/> the Roman camp, to make it

                    the enemy offered. For Crispinus not only drove Hippocrates back from his
                    fortifications, but also pursued him as he fled in disorder, and Marcellus
                    likewise forced Epicydes into the city. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> And

                    Then in addition pestilence brought to both sides a calamity which forthwith
                    diverted the attention of the two armies from strategy. For owing to the autumn
                    season and places naturally unhealthy, unendurable heat affected the health of
                    nearly all the men in both camps, but much more outside the city than within.

                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Later the mere care of the ill and
                    contagion spread the disease, so that those who had fallen ill died neglected
                    and abandoned, or else they carried off with them those who sat by them and
                    those who nursed, having caught the same malignant disease. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> And so every day funerals and death were before their eyes,

                        unit="section"/> Finally, from habituation to misery they had so lost their
                    humane feelings that, so far from escorting the dead with tears and the wailing
                    that was their due, they did not even carry them out and bury them; and dead
                    bodies lay strewn about before the eyes of men awaiting a like death, and the
                    dead seriously affected the ill, the ill the sound, not only through fear, but

                    conferences the wish of the besieged, they sent legates to Marcellus to make

                    virtually agreed that all that had anywhere belonged to the kings should belong
                    to the Romans, that everything else should be secured to the Sicilians along
                    with freedom and their own laws. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Accordingly
                    the legates summoned to a conference the men to whom power had been entrusted by
                    Epicydes, and said that they had been sent by the army of the Sicilians at the
                    same time to Marcellus and to them, in order that all, the besieged and those
                    who had been outside of the operations, might share the same lot and neither

                    then, being admitted by them, that they might speak with their relatives and

                    Marcellus, and by holding out assurances of safety prevailed upon them to join
                    with themselves in an attack upon Epicydes' prefects, Polyclitus and Philistion
                    and an Epicydes surnamed Sindon. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> After slaying
                    them and <pb n="p.451"/> calling the populace to an assembly, they complained

                    privation and other things at which among themselves they had been in the habit
                    of murmuring in secret. And they said that, although so many hardships were a
                    burden to them, they ought not to blame fortune, because it was in their own
                    power to say how long they would endure them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    The Romans, they said, had had as their ground for besieging Syracuse their
                    love, not hatred, of the Syracusans. For on learning that the power had been
                    seized by Hippocrates and Epicydes, minions of Hannibal and later of Hieronymus,
                    it was then that they had made war and had begun to besiege the city, in order
                    to capture, not the city itself, but its cruel tyrants. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> But now that Hippocrates had perished, that Epicydes had
                    been cut off from Syracuse and his prefects slain, now that the Carthaginians
                    had everywhere been driven by land and sea from their occupation of Sicily, what
                    reason remained for the Romans not to wish Syracuse to be preserved, just as if

                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> One of the three prefects of Achradina was
                    a Spaniard, Moericus by name. To him, among the- retinue of the legates, one

                    said, was held by Roman arms. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> If he should do

                    Moericus was impressed by these words, and when it was decided to send legates
                    to Marcellus, sent his brother as one of them. He was escorted separately from

                        unit="section"/> Then Moericus, to divert the attention of everybody from

                    and forth; that none should be admitted or sent; and that, in order to keep a
                    closer guard, suitable positions should be divided among the prefects, so that

                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Thereupon a council was called and all

                    And they believed they had sufficient reinforcements for that purpose in twenty

                    a veteran commander in Spain. He had his army near a city called Amtorgis.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It was he that the <pb n="p.465"/> Roman

                    forces for that end. The one remaining concern was the fear that, if he was

                    forests and mountains and prolong the war. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    They thought it best therefore to divide their forces into two armies and
                    include the whole of Spain in their plan of operations. And they divided in such
                    manner that Publius Cornelius should lead two-thirds of the army of Romans and

                    auxiliaries. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Then, as he was well acquainted
                    with every form of treachery practised by barbarians and particularly by those

                    Romans either, if they, being so few in number, should try to hold them by
                    force. It will always be a necessary precaution for Roman generals, and these
                    instances must really be accounted warnings, not so to trust their foreign
                    auxiliaries as not to have in camp more of their own strength and of forces that
                    are absolutely their own. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Celtiberians
                    suddenly took up their standards and departed, and when Romans asked the reason
                    and implored them to remain, they gave no other answer than that they were
                    called away by a war at home. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Scipio, now that
                    his allies could not be held either by entreaties or by force, saw that he could
                    neither be a match for the enemy without them nor rejoin his brother, and that
                    no other promising plan was available. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Thereupon he decided to retire as far as possible, taking every care and being

                    wandered far from the camp in search of wood and fodder, but also rode up to the

                        unit="section"/> Consequently Scipio, though a general marked by caution and
                    foresight, being forced by his straits, adopted the rash plan of going by night

                    and putting his lieutenant, Tiberius Fonteius, in command of it, he set out at

                    /> It was a battle of columns rather than lines; yet, so far as could be in an

                    whose notice the general had thought he had escaped, by outflanking them
                    inspired great alarm, and in addition, when they had entered a fresh battle with
                    the Numidians, a third enemy also arrived, the Carthaginian generals, who from

                    And the Romans found themselves between two battles, uncertain against which

                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> As the general was fighting and

                    dying Scipio slipping from his horse, dashed everywhere along the line, wild
                    with delight, shouting and announcing that the Roman commander had fallen.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The broadcasting of that announcement far
                    and wide made the enemy as good as victors beyond a doubt and the Romans as good

                    Upon their arrival there was great congratulation between the armies and

                    enemy's forces had been so greatly increased, was more inclined by logical
                    inference to suspect that a disaster had occurred than to entertain any good
                    hope. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> For how, he thought, could Hasdrubal and
                    Mago, unless they had quite finished their own war, have been able to bring up
                    their army without an engagement? <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> And how had
                    his brother failed to confront them or to follow in their rear, so that, if
                    unable to prevent the generals and armies of the enemy from uniting, he might
                    himself at least combine his forces with those of his brother? <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> Troubled by these anxieties, he believed that the one safe
                    course at present was to retreat as faraway as possible. Then in one night,
                    while the enemy were unaware of it and hence made no move, he marched a
                    considerable distance. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> In the morning the
                    enemy, on discovering that they had gone, sent the Numidians in advance and
                    began to follow them in a column at its utmost speed. Before night the Numidians
                    had overtaken them, and charging now in the rear, now on the flanks, compelled
                    them to halt and defend their column. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Scipio
                    kept encouraging them to fight and advance at the same time, so far, that is, as
                    they could do so with safety, before the infantry forces should overtake them.

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> But while he now urged his column forward, now
                    ordered it to halt, for a long time little progress was being made and night was
                    now at hand. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Scipio therefore recalled his men
                    from battle, concentrated them and led them up a hill that was not indeed quite
                    safe, especially <pb n="p.475"/> for a terrified column, but still was higher
                    than the <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 212</note>
                    country around it. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> There the infantry,
                    surrounding the baggage and cavalry placed in the centre, at first kept off the
                    charges of the Numidians without difficulty. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Then, when three generals arrived in full force with three regular armies, and
                    it was evident that they would be unable by arms to defend an unfortified
                    position, the general began to cast about and consider whether he could in some
                    way surround it with an earthwork.. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But the
                    hill was so bare and rocky that neither could thickets be found for the cutting
                    of stakes nor ground such that they could get turf or carry a trench in it or
                    any other earthwork. And yet no spot was naturally so elevated or rugged as to
                    make approach or ascent difficult for the enemy. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                    /> Everywhere the ground rose at a gentle slope. However, in order to interpose
                    some semblance of an earthwork, they laid <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/>
                    up, as it were, to the usual height all around them, pack-saddles still tied to
                    their loads, while, wherever the pack-saddles failed to make a barricade, they
                    piled on top lighter baggage of every kind. </p>

                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The Carthaginian armies, on arriving, very
                    easily marched in column up the hill; but the strange appearance of the defences
                    at first checked them in a certain amazement, while their commanders kept
                    shouting from all sides, asking why they stood still and did not pull apart and
                    scatter that pretence, hardly strong enough to delay women or children. The
                    enemy, they said, was held captive, lurking behind his baggage. Such were the
                    scornful taunts of the commanders. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But it was
                    not easy to leap over or clear away <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> the

                    however, after fleeing into the neighbouring forest, made their escape to
                    Publius Scipio's camp, of which Tiberius Fonteius, his lieutenant, was
                    commander. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> As for Gnaeus Scipio, some relate
                    that he was slain on the hill in the first onset of the enemy, others that with
                    a few men he made his escape to a tower near the camp; that fire was lighted
                    around this, and so, by burning the doors which they had been unable to force in
                    any way, they captured the tower and all were slain in it along with the

                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In the army was Lucius Marcius, son of
                    Septimus, a Roman knight, an active <pb n="p.479"/> young man of much more

                    had had the training of Gnaeus Scipio, in which during so many years he had
                    mastered all the arts of the soldier. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This man
                    had made an army that was not to be despised out of soldiers gathered up from
                    the flight and in part withdrawn from garrison towns, and he had united it with
                    that of Tiberius Fonteius, the lieutenant of Publius Scipio. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> But so preeminent was a mere Roman knight in his personal
                    influence with the soldiers and in the respect they paid him that, after they
                    had fortified a camp on this side of the Hiberus <milestone n="6??"
                        unit="section"/> and decided that a commander of the army should be chosen
                    in an election by the soldiers, relieving each other as sentries on the wall and
                    in outpost duty until all had cast their votes, they unanimously conferred the
                    high command upon Lucius Marcius. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He then
                    spent the whole time —and it was very short —in fortifying the camp and bringing
                    up supplies. And the soldiers carried out all his commands, not only with
                    energy, but also in no dejected spirit. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But
                    when the news came that Hasdrubal the son of Gisgo, on his way to wipe out the

                    soldiers <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> saw the signal for battle raised by
                    a new general, they remembered what commanders they had had a short time before,
                    and upon what generals and forces they had usually relied as they went into
                    battle. Suddenly they all were weeping and dashing their heads against
                    obstacles; and some raised their hands to heaven, blaming the gods, others lying

                    womanish and useless weeping, instead of whetting their courage to defend
                    themselves and with them the state, and begged them not to let their commanders
                    lie unavenged, when suddenly —for the enemy were now near the earthwork —a shout

                    that, their grief instantly changing to anger, they scatter to arms, and as if
                    fired by frenzy, to the different gates, and dash into the enemy coming on
                    carelessly and in disorder. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> At once the
                    unexpected act inspired alarm among the Carthaginians, and they wondered whence
                    so many enemies had suddenly appeared after the army had been almost wiped out,
                    whence came such boldness and self-confidence so great in men beaten and put to
                    flight, what commander had arisen after the two Scipios had been slain, who was
                    in command of the camp, who had given the signal for battle. <milestone n="13"
                        unit="section"/> In the face of all that —so many things so unexpected —they
                    at first retreated, completely at a loss and dumbfounded; then beaten back by
                    the strength of the attack they took to flight. <milestone n="14" unit="section"
                    /> And there would have been either a terrible slaughter of the fleeing or a
                    reckless and dangerous attack on the part of the pursuers, had not Marcius
                    promptly given the signal for the recall and kept back his own excited line,
                    facing his men in the front line and laying hold of some with his own hands. He
                    then led them back to camp still thirsting for slaughter and bloodshed.
                        <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The Carthaginians were at first forced
                    away in confusion from the enemies' earthwork; then, when they saw that no one

                <p>
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> There was just as much carelessness in
                    guarding the camp. For, although the enemy was near, still they kept reflecting
                    that it was only a remnant of the two armies wiped out a few days before.
                        <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Since for this reason every precaution
                    had been omitted on the enemy's side, Marcius, informed of the facts, turned his
                    attention to a plan at first sight reckless rather than bold, actually to attack
                    the camp of the enemy, in the <milestone n="18??" unit="section"/> belief that
                    it was easier to storm the camp of Hasdrubal alone than to defend his own, if

                        unit="section"/> At the same time he thought that, if his efforts should
                    prove successful, he would relieve his critical situation or, even if defeated,
                    by venturing to attack he would at least take away their contempt for himself.

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> But for fear an unexpected action, and alarm
                    in the night and a plan no longer in keeping with his present situation, might
                    bring confusion, he thought he must address his soldiers and encourage them,

                        incredible that we should dare; for the very reason that it appears most

                        One army is near, two not far away. If we attack now there is <pb n="p.489"

                        perished, so the enemy, if divided and in different places, can be

                    The road being thus cut off at the half-way, the rest of the forces were led in
                    a silent column to the nearest enemy. And as there was no outpost before the

                    made their way into the camp as if it were their own. <milestone n="3"

                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Some rush to the gates, others, since the
                    roads are blocked, leap over the earthwork. And everyone who escaped fled at

                    whereupon they were surrounded by the cohort and cavalry dashing out of their

                    Yet, even if a man had escaped from that slaughter, so swiftly did the Romans
                    hasten from the captured nearer camp to the other camp that news of the disaster
                    could not anticipate them. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But there, the
                    farther it was from their enemy, and since some had scattered just before
                    daylight to bring in fodder and firewood and booty, the more neglect and
                    disorder did they find everywhere; only stacked arms at the outposts, the
                    soldiers unarmed, either sitting and lying on the ground or strolling outside
                    the wall and the gates. Against these men, so care-free and regardless of order,
                    the Romans, who were still fired by their recent battle and made confident by
                    victory, went into battle. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> And so no
                    resistance whatever could be offered at the gates. Inside the gates there was a
                    rush from every part of the camp at the first shouting and commotion, and a
                    fierce battle began. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> It would have lasted
                    long too, had not the sight of the Romans' bloody shields given the

                    themselves be attacked by their own cavalry. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly it was no great struggle; the first shout, the first onset, decided
                    the matter. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Numidians, having remained
                    motionless on the wings at the beginning of the battle, seeing their men
                    retreating, shared only the flight with them for a short time. When they saw
                    them all making for <pb n="p.501"/> Agrigentum in a panic-stricken column, they

                    themselves scattered in every direction to the neighbouring cities, fearing a
                    siege. Many thousand men were slain . . . thousand captured, also eight
                    elephants. This was Marcellus' last battle in Sicily; from it he returned as
                    victor to Syracuse. </p>

                    Accordingly the senate at Rome decreed that Publius Cornelius, the praetor,
                        <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> should send a letter to the consuls at
                    Capua, saying that, while Hannibal was far away and there was no decisive action
                    around Capua, one of them, if they thought it best, should come to Rome for the
                    replacement of magistrates. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> On receiving the
                    letter the consuls arranged between them that Claudius should conduct the
                    elections, and Fulvius remain near Capua. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> For
                    the consulship Claudius announced the election of Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus and
                    Publius Sulpicius Galba, son of Servius, although he had previously held no
                    curule office. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> As praetors the following were
                    then elected: Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, Gaius
                    Sulpicius, Gaius Calpurnius Piso. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The duties
                    of the city praetor fell to Piso, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        Evidently the duties of the praetor peregrinus also were assigned to the
