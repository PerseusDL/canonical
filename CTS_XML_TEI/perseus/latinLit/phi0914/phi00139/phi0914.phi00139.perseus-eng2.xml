                        Marcus Aemilius, the consul, having subdued the Ligurians, made a road
from Placentia as far as Ariminum, and connected it with the Flaminian
way. The commencement of luxury, introduced by the Asiatic army,
is related. All the Ligurians who dwell on the hither side of the
Apennines were subdued. The Bacchanalia, a Grecian sacred cere-
mony, held at night, a hot-bed of every vice, after having become a
conspiracy including great numbers, were discovered by one of the con-
suls and suppressed, while many of those concerned were punished.
Lucius Quinctius Flamininus, the brother of Titus, was expelled the
senate, by the censors Lucius Valerius Flaccus and Marcus Porcius
Cato, who was most distinguished in the arts of war and peace, for the
following reason: because when, as consul, he had held the province of
Gaul, he slew with his own hand a certain Gaul, at the request of
Philip, a Carthaginian, his noble minion; or, as some have stated,
because he had beheaded a condemned criminal at the request of a
courtesan of Placentia, with whom he was desperately in love. The
speech of Marcus Cato against him is still extant. Scipio died at Liter-
num. And, as if fortune destined for the same period the death of the
two most distinguished men of the day, Hannibal committed suicide by
taking poison, when he was on the point of being given up to the
Romans by Prusias, king of Bithynia, to whom he had fled for refuge
on the defeat of Antiochus: the Romans had sent Titus Quinctius
Flamininus to demand Hannibal. Philop≈ìmen likewise, the general of
the Achcaeans, a most distinguished man, after having fallen into the
hands of the Messenians in war, was put to death by poison. Colonies
are planted at Potentia, Pisaurus, Modena, and Parma. This book
contains in addition the success over the Celtiberians, and the commence-
ment and cause of the Macedonian war; the origin of which proceeded
from the following source: Philip was dissatisfied that his kingdom was
being diminished by the Romans, and because he was compelled to with-
draw his garrisons from Thrace and other places.

                    WHILE these things are done at Rome, (if they were really transacted in this year,) both the consuls were em-

                    ployed in the war with the Ligurians.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    This enemy seemed born for the purpose of preserving military discipline among the Romans, during the intervals between important wars; nor was any province better calculated to form a soldier to active valour.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    For Asia, from the enticing pleasures of its cities, the abundance of every production both of land and sea, the unwarlike temper of the enemy, and the wealth of its princes, made Roman armies rich, rather than brave. Under the command of Cneius Manlius, particularly, the troops were kept in a state of idleness and licentiousness.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Therefore, in Thrace, a passage somewhat more difficult, and a more vigorous enemy, checked them with severe loss.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Whereas in Liguria there was every circumstance that could invigorate the courage of soldiers; the country mountainous and rugged, so that even the taking possession of unoccupied posts, and much more the dislodging of an enemy from those already in possession, was attended with much labour; the roads hilly, narrow, and exposed to ambuscades;
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    the enemy light, active, and energetic in their motions, so as to allow no season or place to be quiet or secure; the necessary attack on the strong forts with much toil and danger; and the country so poor as to constrain the soldier to a sparing mode of living, while it afforded but a small share of' booty.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly, no sutler followed the army, no long train of baggage horses extended its line of march, nothing was to be seen but arms, and men having all their hopes in their arms.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    Nor was either subject or cause for hostilities with them ever wanting; because on account of their poverty at home they made frequent incursions on the territories of their neighbours; they did not, however, fight a battle which could decide the entire war.

                    The consul, Caius Flaminius, after several successful battles against the Frinian Ligurians in their own country, received the submission of that tribe, and ordered them to deliver up their arms;
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    as they did not give them up honourably, and were reproved for their behaviour, who abandoned their villages, and fled to the mountain called Auginus, whither the consul immediately followed them.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    A part of the enemy again betook themselves to flight; and, running with precipitate haste, the greatest part without arms, over pathless tracts and rocky precipices, they escaped to places where an enemy could not follow them. Thus they
                    <pb n="1793" xml:id="p.1793"/>
                    got away beyond the Apennine; the rest, who remained in the camp, were surrounded and reduced by assault.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    The legions were then led over the Apennine; then the enemy, assisted by the height of the mountain, which they had occupied at first, stood on their defence; but, in a little time, submitted. Their arms were then sought for with greater care, and all taken from them.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    The war was then transferred to the Apuan tribe of Ligurians, who had made so many incursions into the territory of Pisa and Bononia, that it could not be cultivated.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    These being entirely subdued, the consul restored peace to the neighbourhood. And, as he had effected the security of the province from the war, he made a road from Bononia to Anetium, that he might not keep the soldiers in a state of idleness.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    The other consul, Marcus Aemilius, ravaged with fire and sword the lands of the Ligurians, together with their villages that stood in the plains, while the inhabitants remained posted on two mountains, Ballista and Suismontium.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    He then attacked those who were on the mountains, harassed them for some time in skirmishes, and, at last, compelled them to come to an engagement, and utterly defeated them in a regular battle: in which he vowed a temple to Diana.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Having now reduced all on this side of the Apennine, he marched against those on the other side of that mountain; among whom were the Brinian tribe, which had not been attacked by Flaminius: Aemilius subdued them all, stripped them of their arms, and obliged the multitude to come down from the mountains into the plains.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    The Ligurians being brought to a state of peace, he led his army into the Gallic territory, and drew a road from Placentia to Ariminum, to meet that made by Flaminius.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    During the last engagement, when he fought a pitched battle with the Ligurians, he vowed a temple to Imperial Juno. Such were the transactions of this year in Liguria.

                    In Gaul, the praetor, Marcus Furius, seeking a pretext for war in the midst of peace, deprived the unoffending Caenomanians of their arms.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    The Caenomanians complained of this to the senate at Rome, and were by them referred to the consul Aemilius, whom the senate authorized to examine into and determine the cause; after a warm contest with the praetor they gained their cause.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    The praetor was ordered to restore their arms to the Caenomanians, and quit the province.
                    <pb n="1794" xml:id="p.1794"/>
                    The senate afterwards gave audience to envoys of the Latin confederation, who had come, in great numbers, from all parts of Latium.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    On their complaint that a great multitude of their citizens had been removed to Rome, and had been assessed there in the survey; a commission was given to Quintus Terentius Culleo, the praetor, to make inquiry after such persons;
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    and on the allies proving that those persons themselves, or their fathers, had been assessed in the surveys of their states in the censorship of Caius Claudius and Marcus Livius, or at some time subsequent to their censorship, he was ordered to compel all such to return to the several states wherein they had been so rated.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    In consequence of this inquiry, twelve thousand Latins returned home; as the multitude of foreigners even then burdened the city.

                    Before the consuls came home to Rome, Marcus Fulvius, the proconsul, returned from Aetolia.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    He, when he had as usual recited to the senate, in the temple of Apollo, the services which he had performed in Aetolia and Cephallenia, then requested of the fathers, that, in consideration of his having conducted the business of the public with good fortune and success, they would think proper to order public thanks to be offered to the immortal gods, and to decree a triumph to him.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Marcus Abutius, a tribune of the commons, gave notice, that, if any thing were determined on that subject before the arrival of Marcus Aemilius, he would enter his protest:

                        the consul intended to oppose that measure; and, at his setting out for his province, had given him a charge to keep the discussion of it open until he should come home. That Fulvius would suffer a loss of nothing but time; for, notwithstanding the presence of the consul, the senate would determine according to their own wishes.

                        yet it was insufferable, that the absence of the consul should both obstruct the worship of the immortal gods, and delay a triumph merited and due;
