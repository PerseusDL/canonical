<div1 type="Poem" n="1">
<head>MELIBOEUS TITYRUS</head>
<sp><speaker>MELIBOEUS</speaker>
<l n="tr">You, Tityrus, 'neath a broad beech-canopy</l>
<l n="tr">reclining, on the slender oat rehearse</l>
<l n="tr">your silvan ditties: I from my sweet fields,</l>
<l n="tr">and home's familiar bounds, even now depart.</l>
<l n="tr">Exiled from home am I; while, Tityrus, you</l>
<l n="tr">sit careless in the shade, and, at your call,</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Fair Amaryllis&rdquo; bid the woods resound.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>TITYRUS</speaker>
<l n="tr">O Meliboeus, 'twas a god vouchsafed</l>
<l n="tr">this ease to us, for him a god will I</l>
<l n="tr">deem ever, and from my folds a tender lamb</l>
<l n="tr">oft with its life-blood shall his altar stain.</l>
<l n="tr">His gift it is that, as your eyes may see,</l>
<l n="tr">my kine may roam at large, and I myself</l>
<l n="tr">play on my shepherd's pipe what songs I will.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MELIBOEUS</speaker>
<l n="tr">I grudge you not the boon, but marvel more,</l>
<l n="tr">such wide confusion fills the country-side.</l>
<l n="tr">See, sick at heart I drive my she-goats on,</l>
<l n="tr">and this one, O my Tityrus, scarce can lead:</l>
<l n="tr">for 'mid the hazel-thicket here but now</l>
<l n="tr">she dropped her new-yeaned twins on the bare flint,</l>
<l n="tr">hope of the flock&mdash;an ill, I mind me well,</l>
<l n="tr">which many a time, but for my blinded sense,</l>
<l n="tr">the thunder-stricken oak foretold, oft too</l>
<l n="tr">from hollow trunk the raven's ominous cry.</l>
<l n="tr">But who this god of yours? Come, Tityrus, tell.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>TITYRUS</speaker>
<l n="tr">The city, Meliboeus, they call <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>,</l>
<l n="tr">I, simpleton, deemed like this town of ours,</l>
<l n="tr">whereto we shepherds oft are wont to drive</l>
<l n="tr">the younglings of the flock: so too I knew</l>
<l n="tr">whelps to resemble dogs, and kids their dams,</l>
<l n="tr">comparing small with great; but this as far</l>
<l n="tr">above all other cities rears her head</l>
<l n="tr">as cypress above pliant osier towers.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MELIBOEUS</speaker>
<l n="tr">And what so potent cause took you to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>TITYRUS</speaker>
<l n="tr">Freedom, which, though belated, cast at length</l>
<l n="tr">her eyes upon the sluggard, when my beard</l>
<l n="tr">'gan whiter fall beneath the barber's blade&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">cast eyes, I say, and, though long tarrying, came,</l>
<l n="tr">now when, from Galatea's yoke released,</l>
<l n="tr">I serve but Amaryllis: for I will own,</l>
<l n="tr">while Galatea reigned over me, I had</l>
<l n="tr">no hope of freedom, and no thought to save.</l>
<l n="tr">Though many a victim from my folds went forth,</l>
<l n="tr">or rich cheese pressed for the unthankful town,</l>
<l n="tr">never with laden hands returned I home.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MELIBOEUS</speaker>
<l n="tr">I used to wonder, Amaryllis, why</l>
<l n="tr">you cried to heaven so sadly, and for whom</l>
<l n="tr">you left the apples hanging on the trees;</l>
<l n="tr">'twas Tityrus was away. Why, Tityrus,</l>
<l n="tr">the very pines, the very water-springs,</l>
<l n="tr">the very vineyards, cried aloud for you.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>TITYRUS</speaker>
<l n="tr">What could I do? how else from bonds be freed,</l>
<l n="tr">or otherwhere find gods so nigh to aid?</l>
<l n="tr">There, Meliboeus, I saw that youth to whom</l>
<l n="tr">yearly for twice six days my altars smoke.</l>
<l n="tr">There instant answer gave he to my suit,</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Feed, as before, your kine, boys, rear your bulls.&rdquo;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MELIBOEUS</speaker>
<l n="tr">So in old age, you happy man, your fields</l>
<l n="tr">will still be yours, and ample for your need!</l>
<l n="tr">Though, with bare stones o'erspread, the pastures all</l>
<l n="tr">be choked with rushy mire, your ewes with young</l>
<l n="tr">by no strange fodder will be tried, nor hurt</l>
<l n="tr">through taint contagious of a neighbouring flock.</l>
<l n="tr">Happy old man, who 'mid familiar streams</l>
<l n="tr">and hallowed springs, will court the cooling shade!</l>
<l n="tr">Here, as of old, your neighbour's bordering hedge,</l>
<l n="tr">that feasts with willow-flower the Hybla bees,</l>
<l n="tr">shall oft with gentle murmur lull to sleep,</l>
<l n="tr">while the leaf-dresser beneath some tall rock</l>
<l n="tr">uplifts his song, nor cease their cooings hoarse</l>
<l n="tr">the wood-pigeons that are your heart's delight,</l>
<l n="tr">nor doves their moaning in the elm-tree top.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>TITYRUS</speaker>
<l n="tr">Sooner shall light stags, therefore, feed in air,</l>
<l n="tr">the seas their fish leave naked on the strand,</l>
<l n="tr">germans and Parthians shift their natural bounds,</l>
<l n="tr">and these the <placeName key="tgn,1084764">Arar</placeName>, those the <placeName key="tgn,1130850">Tigris</placeName> drink,</l>
<l n="tr">than from my heart his face and memory fade.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MELIBOEUS</speaker>
<l n="tr">But we far hence, to burning <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> some,</l>
<l n="tr">some to the Scythian steppes, or thy swift flood,</l>
<l n="tr">cretan Oaxes, now must wend our way,</l>
<l n="tr">or <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, from the whole world sundered far.</l>
<l n="tr">Ah! shall I ever in aftertime behold</l>
<l n="tr">my native bounds&mdash;see many a harvest hence</l>
<l n="tr">with ravished eyes the lowly turf-roofed cot</l>
<l n="tr">where I was king? These fallows, trimmed so fair,</l>
<l n="tr">some brutal soldier will possess these fields</l>
<l n="tr">an alien master. Ah! to what a pass</l>
<l n="tr">has civil discord brought our hapless folk!</l>
<l n="tr">For such as these, then, were our furrows sown!</l>
<l n="tr">Now, Meliboeus, graft your pears, now set</l>
<l n="tr">your vines in order! Go, once happy flock,</l>
<l n="tr">my she-goats, go. Never again shall I,</l>
<l n="tr">stretched in green cave, behold you from afar</l>
<l n="tr">hang from the bushy rock; my songs are sung;</l>
<l n="tr">never again will you, with me to tend,</l>
<l n="tr">on clover-flower, or bitter willows, browse.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>TITYRUS</speaker>
<l n="tr">Yet here, this night, you might repose with me,</l>
<l n="tr">on green leaves pillowed: apples ripe have I,</l>
<l n="tr">soft chestnuts, and of curdled milk enow.</l>
<l n="tr">And, see, the farm-roof chimneys smoke afar,</l>
<l n="tr">and from the hills the shadows lengthening fall!</l></sp></div1>
<div1 type="Poem" n="2">
<head>ALEXIS</head>
<l n="tr">the shepherd Corydon with love was fired</l>
<l n="tr">for fair Alexis, his own master's joy:</l>
<l n="tr">no room for hope had he, yet, none the less,</l>
<l n="tr">the thick-leaved shadowy-soaring beech-tree grove</l>
<l n="tr">still would he haunt, and there alone, as thus,</l>
<l n="tr">to woods and hills pour forth his artless strains.</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Cruel Alexis, heed you naught my songs?</l>
<l n="tr">Have you no pity? you'll drive me to my death.</l>
<l n="tr">Now even the cattle court the cooling shade</l>
<l n="tr">and the green lizard hides him in the thorn:</l>
<l n="tr">now for tired mowers, with the fierce heat spent,</l>
<l n="tr">pounds Thestilis her mess of savoury herbs,</l>
<l n="tr">wild thyme and garlic. I, with none beside,</l>
<l n="tr">save hoarse cicalas shrilling through the brake,</l>
<l n="tr">still track your footprints 'neath the broiling sun.</l>
<l n="tr">Better have borne the petulant proud disdain</l>
<l n="tr">of Amaryllis, or Menalcas wooed,</l>
<l n="tr">albeit he was so dark, and you so fair!</l>
<l n="tr">Trust not too much to colour, beauteous boy;</l>
<l n="tr">white privets fall, dark hyacinths are culled.</l>
<l n="tr">You scorn me, Alexis, who or what I am</l>
<l n="tr">care not to ask&mdash;how rich in flocks, or how</l>
<l n="tr">in snow-white milk abounding: yet for me</l>
<l n="tr">roam on Sicilian hills a thousand lambs;</l>
<l n="tr">summer or winter, still my milk-pails brim.</l>
<l n="tr">I sing as erst Amphion of Circe sang,</l>
<l n="tr">what time he went to call his cattle home</l>
<l n="tr">on Attic Aracynthus. Nor am I</l>
<l n="tr">so ill to look on: lately on the beach</l>
<l n="tr">I saw myself, when winds had stilled the sea,</l>
<l n="tr">and, if that mirror lie not, would not fear</l>
<l n="tr">daphnis to challenge, though yourself were judge.</l>
<l n="tr">Ah! were you but content with me to dwell.</l>
<l n="tr">Some lowly cot in the rough fields our home,</l>
<l n="tr">shoot down the stags, or with green osier-wand</l>
<l n="tr">round up the straggling flock! There you with me</l>
<l n="tr">in silvan strains will learn to rival Pan.</l>
<l n="tr">Pan first with wax taught reed with reed to join;</l>
<l n="tr">for sheep alike and shepherd Pan hath care.</l>
<l n="tr">Nor with the reed's edge fear you to make rough</l>
<l n="tr">your dainty lip; such arts as these to learn</l>
<l n="tr">what did Amyntas do?&mdash;what did he not?</l>
<l n="tr">A pipe have I, of hemlock-stalks compact</l>
<l n="tr">in lessening lengths, Damoetas' dying-gift:</l>
<l n="tr">&lsquo;Mine once,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;now yours, as heir to own.&rsquo;</l>
<l n="tr">Foolish Amyntas heard and envied me.</l>
<l n="tr">Ay, and two fawns, I risked my neck to find</l>
<l n="tr">in a steep glen, with coats white-dappled still,</l>
<l n="tr">from a sheep's udders suckled twice a day&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">these still I keep for you; which Thestilis</l>
<l n="tr">implores me oft to let her lead away;</l>
<l n="tr">and she shall have them, since my gifts you spurn.</l>
<l n="tr">Come hither, beauteous boy; for you the Nymphs</l>
<l n="tr">bring baskets, see, with lilies brimmed; for you,</l>
<l n="tr">plucking pale violets and poppy-heads,</l>
<l n="tr">now the fair Naiad, of narcissus flower</l>
<l n="tr">and fragrant fennel, doth one posy twine&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">with cassia then, and other scented herbs,</l>
<l n="tr">blends them, and sets the tender hyacinth off</l>
<l n="tr">with yellow marigold. I too will pick</l>
<l n="tr">quinces all silvered-o'er with hoary down,</l>
<l n="tr">chestnuts, which Amaryllis wont to love,</l>
<l n="tr">and waxen plums withal: this fruit no less</l>
<l n="tr">shall have its meed of honour; and I will pluck</l>
<l n="tr">you too, ye laurels, and you, ye myrtles, near,</l>
<l n="tr">for so your sweets ye mingle. Corydon,</l>
<l n="tr">you are a boor, nor heeds a whit your gifts</l>
<l n="tr">alexis; no, nor would Iollas yield,</l>
<l n="tr">should gifts decide the day. Alack! alack!</l>
<l n="tr">What misery have I brought upon my head!&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">loosed on the flowers Siroces to my bane,</l>
<l n="tr">and the wild boar upon my crystal springs!</l>
<l n="tr">Whom do you fly, infatuate? gods ere now,</l>
<l n="tr">and Dardan Paris, have made the woods their home.</l>
<l n="tr">Let Pallas keep the towers her hand hath built,</l>
<l n="tr">us before all things let the woods delight.</l>
<l n="tr">The grim-eyed lioness pursues the wolf,</l>
<l n="tr">the wolf the she-goat, the she-goat herself</l>
<l n="tr">in wanton sport the flowering cytisus,</l>
<l n="tr">and Corydon Alexis, each led on</l>
<l n="tr">by their own longing. See, the ox comes home</l>
<l n="tr">with plough up-tilted, and the shadows grow</l>
<l n="tr">to twice their length with the departing sun,</l>
<l n="tr">yet me love burns, for who can limit love?</l>
<l n="tr">Ah! Corydon, Corydon, what hath crazed your wit?</l>
<l n="tr">Your vine half-pruned hangs on the leafy elm;</l>
<l n="tr">why haste you not to weave what need requires</l>
<l n="tr">of pliant rush or osier? Scorned by this,</l>
<l n="tr">elsewhere some new Alexis you will find.&rdquo;</l></div1>
<div1 type="Poem" n="3">
<head>MENALCAS   DAMOETAS   PALAEMON</head>
<sp><speaker>MENALCAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">Who owns the flock, Damoetas? Meliboeus?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAMOETAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">Nay, they are Aegon's sheep, of late by him</l>
<l n="tr">committed to my care.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENALCAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">O every way</l>
<l n="tr">unhappy sheep, unhappy flock! while he</l>
<l n="tr">still courts Neaera, fearing lest her choice</l>
<l n="tr">should fall on me, this hireling shepherd here</l>
<l n="tr">wrings hourly twice their udders, from the flock</l>
<l n="tr">filching the life-juice, from the lambs their milk.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAMOETAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">Hold! not so ready with your jeers at men!</l>
<l n="tr">We know who once, and in what shrine with you&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">the he-goats looked aside&mdash;the light nymphs laughed&mdash;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENALCAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">Ay, then, I warrant, when they saw me slash</l>
<l n="tr">micon's young vines and trees with spiteful hook.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAMOETAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">Or here by these old beeches, when you broke</l>
<l n="tr">the bow and arrows of Damon; for you chafed</l>
<l n="tr">when first you saw them given to the boy,</l>
<l n="tr">cross-grained Menalcas, ay, and had you not</l>
<l n="tr">done him some mischief, would have chafed to death.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENALCAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">With thieves so daring, what can masters do?</l>
<l n="tr">Did I not see you, rogue, in ambush lie</l>
<l n="tr">for Damon's goat, while loud Lycisca barked?</l>
<l n="tr">And when I cried, &ldquo;Where is he off to now?</l>
<l n="tr">Gather your flock together, Tityrus,&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">you hid behind the sedges.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAMOETAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">Well, was he</l>
<l n="tr">whom I had conquered still to keep the goat.</l>
<l n="tr">Which in the piping-match my pipe had won!</l>
<l n="tr">You may not know it, but the goat was mine.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENALCAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">You out-pipe him? when had you ever pipe</l>
<l n="tr">wax-welded? in the cross-ways used you not</l>
<l n="tr">on grating straw some miserable tune</l>
<l n="tr">to mangle?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAMOETAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">Well, then, shall we try our skill</l>
<l n="tr">each against each in turn? Lest you be loth,</l>
<l n="tr">I pledge this heifer; every day she comes</l>
<l n="tr">twice to the milking-pail, and feeds withal</l>
<l n="tr">two young ones at her udder: say you now</l>
<l n="tr">what you will stake upon the match with me.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENALCAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">Naught from the flock I'll venture, for at home</l>
<l n="tr">I have a father and a step-dame harsh,</l>
<l n="tr">and twice a day both reckon up the flock,</l>
<l n="tr">and one withal the kids. But I will stake,</l>
<l n="tr">seeing you are so mad, what you yourself</l>
<l n="tr">will own more priceless far&mdash;two beechen cups</l>
<l n="tr">by the divine art of Alcimedon</l>
<l n="tr">wrought and embossed, whereon a limber vine,</l>
<l n="tr">wreathed round them by the graver's facile tool,</l>
<l n="tr">twines over clustering ivy-berries pale.</l>
<l n="tr">Two figures, one Conon, in the midst he set,</l>
<l n="tr">and one&mdash;how call you him, who with his wand</l>
<l n="tr">marked out for all men the whole round of heaven,</l>
<l n="tr">that they who reap, or stoop behind the plough,</l>
<l n="tr">might know their several seasons? Nor as yet</l>
<l n="tr">have I set lip to them, but lay them by.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAMOETAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">For me too wrought the same Alcimedon</l>
<l n="tr">a pair of cups, and round the handles wreathed</l>
<l n="tr">pliant acanthus, Orpheus in the midst,</l>
<l n="tr">the forests following in his wake; nor yet</l>
<l n="tr">have I set lip to them, but lay them by.</l>
<l n="tr">Matched with a heifer, who would prate of cups?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENALCAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">You shall not balk me now; where'er you bid,</l>
<l n="tr">I shall be with you; only let us have</l>
<l n="tr">for auditor&mdash;or see, to serve our turn,</l>
<l n="tr">yonder Palaemon comes! In singing-bouts</l>
<l n="tr">i'll see you play the challenger no more.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAMOETAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">Out then with what you have; I shall not shrink,</l>
<l n="tr">nor budge for any man: only do you,</l>
<l n="tr">neighbour Palaemon, with your whole heart's skill&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">for it is no slight matter&mdash;play your part.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAEMON</speaker>
<l n="tr">Say on then, since on the greensward we sit,</l>
<l n="tr">and now is burgeoning both field and tree;</l>
<l n="tr">now is the forest green, and now the year</l>
<l n="tr">at fairest. Do you first, Damoetas, sing,</l>
<l n="tr">then you, Menalcas, in alternate strain:</l>
<l n="tr">alternate strains are to the Muses dear.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAMOETAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;From Jove the Muse began; Jove filleth all,</l>
<l n="tr">makes the earth fruitful, for my songs hath care.&rdquo;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENALCAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Me Phoebus loves; for Phoebus his own gifts,</l>
<l n="tr">bays and sweet-blushing hyacinths, I keep.&rdquo;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAMOETAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Gay Galatea throws an apple at me,</l>
<l n="tr">then hies to the willows, hoping to be seen.&rdquo;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENALCAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;My dear Amyntas comes unasked to me;</l>
<l n="tr">not Delia to my dogs is better known.&rdquo;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAMOETAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Gifts for my love I've found; mine eyes have marked</l>
<l n="tr">where the wood-pigeons build their airy nests.&rdquo;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENALCAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Ten golden apples have I sent my boy,</l>
<l n="tr">all that I could, to-morrow as many more.&rdquo;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAMOETAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;What words to me, and uttered O how oft,</l>
<l n="tr">hath Galatea spoke! waft some of them,</l>
<l n="tr">ye winds, I pray you, for the gods to hear.&rdquo;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENALCAS</speaker>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;It profiteth me naught, Amyntas mine,</l>

<l n="tr">the hapless body of the son she bare,</l>
<l n="tr">to gods and stars unpitying, poured her plaint.</l>
<l n="tr">Then, Daphnis, to the cooling streams were none</l>

<head>TO VARUS</head>
<l n="tr">first my Thalia stooped in sportive mood</l>
<l n="tr">to Syracusan strains, nor blushed within</l>
<l n="tr">the woods to house her. When I sought to tell</l>
<l n="tr">of battles and of kings, the Cynthian god</l>
<l n="tr">plucked at mine ear and warned me: &ldquo;Tityrus,</l>
<l n="tr">beseems a shepherd-wight to feed fat sheep,</l>
<l n="tr">but sing a slender song.&rdquo; Now, Varus, I&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">for lack there will not who would laud thy deeds,</l>
<l n="tr">and treat of dolorous wars&mdash;will rather tune</l>
<l n="tr">to the slim oaten reed my silvan lay.</l>
<l n="tr">I sing but as vouchsafed me; yet even this</l>
<l n="tr">if, if but one with ravished eyes should read,</l>
<l n="tr">of thee, O Varus, shall our tamarisks</l>
<l n="tr">and all the woodland ring; nor can there be</l>
<l n="tr">a page more dear to Phoebus, than the page</l>
<l n="tr">where, foremost writ, the name of Varus stands.</l>
<lg><l n="tr">Speed ye, Pierian Maids! Within a cave</l>
<l n="tr">young Chromis and Mnasyllos chanced to see</l>
<l n="tr">silenus sleeping, flushed, as was his wont,</l>
<l n="tr">with wine of yesterday. Not far aloof,</l>
<l n="tr">slipped from his head, the garlands lay, and there</l>
<l n="tr">by its worn handle hung a ponderous cup.</l>
<l n="tr">Approaching&mdash;for the old man many a time</l>
<l n="tr">had balked them both of a long hoped-for song&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">garlands to fetters turned, they bind him fast.</l>
<l n="tr">Then Aegle, fairest of the Naiad-band,</l>
<l n="tr">aegle came up to the half-frightened boys,</l>
<l n="tr">came, and, as now with open eyes he lay,</l>
<l n="tr">with juice of blood-red mulberries smeared him o'er,</l>
<l n="tr">both brow and temples. Laughing at their guile,</l>
<l n="tr">and crying, &ldquo;Why tie the fetters? loose me, boys;</l>
<l n="tr">enough for you to think you had the power;</l>
<l n="tr">now list the songs you wish for&mdash;songs for you,</l>
<l n="tr">another meed for her&rdquo;&mdash;forthwith began.</l>
<l n="tr">Then might you see the wild things of the wood,</l>
<l n="tr">with Fauns in sportive frolic beat the time,</l>
<l n="tr">and stubborn oaks their branchy summits bow.</l>
<l n="tr">Not Phoebus doth the rude Parnassian crag</l>
<l n="tr">so ravish, nor Orpheus so entrance the heights</l>
<l n="tr">of Rhodope or Ismarus: for he sang</l>
<l n="tr">how through the mighty void the seeds were driven</l>
<l n="tr">of earth, air, ocean, and of liquid fire,</l>
<l n="tr">how all that is from these beginnings grew,</l>
<l n="tr">and the young world itself took solid shape,</l>
<l n="tr">then 'gan its crust to harden, and in the deep</l>
<l n="tr">shut Nereus off, and mould the forms of things</l>
<l n="tr">little by little; and how the earth amazed</l>
<l n="tr">beheld the new sun shining, and the showers</l>
<l n="tr">fall, as the clouds soared higher, what time the woods</l>
<l n="tr">'gan first to rise, and living things to roam</l>
<l n="tr">scattered among the hills that knew them not.</l>
<l n="tr">Then sang he of the stones by Pyrrha cast,</l>
<l n="tr">of Saturn's reign, and of Prometheus' theft,</l>
<l n="tr">and the Caucasian birds, and told withal</l>
<l n="tr">nigh to what fountain by his comrades left</l>
<l n="tr">the mariners cried on Hylas till the shore</l>
<l n="tr">then re-echoed &ldquo;Hylas, Hylas!&rdquo; soothed</l>
<l n="tr">pasiphae with the love of her white bull&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">happy if cattle-kind had never been!&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">o ill-starred maid, what frenzy caught thy soul</l>
<l n="tr">the daughters too of Proetus filled the fields</l>
<l n="tr">with their feigned lowings, yet no one of them</l>
<l n="tr">of such unhallowed union e'er was fain</l>
<l n="tr">as with a beast to mate, though many a time</l>
<l n="tr">on her smooth forehead she had sought for horns,</l>
<l n="tr">and for her neck had feared the galling plough.</l>
<l n="tr">O ill-starred maid! thou roamest now the hills,</l>
<l n="tr">while on soft hyacinths he, his snowy side</l>
<l n="tr">reposing, under some dark ilex now</l>
<l n="tr">chews the pale herbage, or some heifer tracks</l>
<l n="tr">amid the crowding herd. Now close, ye Nymphs,</l>
<l n="tr">ye Nymphs of Dicte, close the forest-glades,</l>
<l n="tr">if haply there may chance upon mine eyes</l>
<l n="tr">the white bull's wandering foot-prints: him belike</l>
<l n="tr">following the herd, or by green pasture lured,</l>
<l n="tr">some kine may guide to the Gortynian stalls.</l>
<l n="tr">Then sings he of the maid so wonder-struck</l>
<l n="tr">with the apples of the Hesperids, and then</l>
<l n="tr">with moss-bound, bitter bark rings round the forms</l>
<l n="tr">of Phaethon's fair sisters, from the ground</l>
<l n="tr">up-towering into poplars. Next he sings</l>
<l n="tr">of Gallus wandering by Permessus' stream,</l>
<l n="tr">and by a sister of the Muses led</l>
<l n="tr">to the Aonian mountains, and how all</l>
<l n="tr">the choir of Phoebus rose to greet him; how</l>
<l n="tr">the shepherd Linus, singer of songs divine,</l>
<l n="tr">brow-bound with flowers and bitter parsley, spake:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;These reeds the Muses give thee, take them thou,</l>
<l n="tr">erst to the aged bard of Ascra given,</l>
<l n="tr">wherewith in singing he was wont to draw</l>
<l n="tr">time-rooted ash-trees from the mountain heights.</l>
<l n="tr">With these the birth of the Grynean grove</l>
<l n="tr">be voiced by thee, that of no grove beside</l>
<l n="tr">apollo more may boast him.&rdquo; Wherefore speak</l>
<l n="tr">of Scylla, child of Nisus, who, 'tis said,</l>
<l n="tr">her fair white loins with barking monsters girt</l>
<l n="tr">vexed the Dulichian ships, and, in the deep</l>
<l n="tr">swift-eddying whirlpool, with her sea-dogs tore</l>
<l n="tr">the trembling mariners? or how he told</l>
<l n="tr">of the changed limbs of Tereus&mdash;what a feast,</l>

<l n="tr">had gathered in the flock, Thyrsis the sheep,</l>
<l n="tr">and Corydon the she-goats swollen with milk&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">both in the flower of age, Arcadians both,</l>
<l n="tr">ready to sing, and in like strain reply.</l>
<l n="tr">Hither had strayed, while from the frost I fend</l>

<l n="tr">Soon as he saw me, &ldquo;Hither haste,&rdquo; he cried,</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;O Meliboeus! goat and kids are safe;</l>
<l n="tr">and, if you have an idle hour to spare,</l>
<l n="tr">rest here beneath the shade. Hither the steers</l>

<l n="tr">untended come to drink. Here Mincius hath</l>

<l n="tr">No Phyllis or Alcippe left at home</l>

<l n="tr">I let my business wait upon their sport.</l>
<l n="tr">So they began to sing, voice answering voice</l>

<l n="tr">but the woods echo it. What groves or lawns</l>
<l n="tr">held you, ye Dryad-maidens, when for love&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">love all unworthy of a loss so dear&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">Gallus lay dying? for neither did the slopes</l>
<l n="tr">of Pindus or <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> stay you then,</l>
<l n="tr">no, nor Aonian Aganippe. Him</l>
<l n="tr">even the laurels and the tamarisks wept;</l>
<l n="tr">for him, outstretched beneath a lonely rock,</l>
<l n="tr">wept pine-clad Maenalus, and the flinty crags</l>
<l n="tr">of cold Lycaeus. The sheep too stood around&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">of us they feel no shame, poet divine;</l>
<l n="tr">nor of the flock be thou ashamed: even fair</l>
<l n="tr">Adonis by the rivers fed his sheep&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">came shepherd too, and swine-herd footing slow,</l>
<l n="tr">and, from the winter-acorns dripping-wet</l>
<l n="tr">Menalcas. All with one accord exclaim:</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;From whence this love of thine?&rdquo; Apollo came;</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Gallus, art mad?&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;thy bosom's care</l>
<l n="tr">another love is following.&rdquo; Therewithal</l>
<l n="tr">Silvanus came, with rural honours crowned;</l>
<l n="tr">the flowering fennels and tall lilies shook</l>
<l n="tr">before him. Yea, and our own eyes beheld</l>
<l n="tr">pan, god of Arcady, with blood-red juice</l>
<l n="tr">of the elder-berry, and with vermilion, dyed.</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Wilt ever make an end?&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;behold</l>
<l n="tr">love recks not aught of it: his heart no more</l>
<l n="tr">with tears is sated than with streams the grass,</l>
<l n="tr">bees with the cytisus, or goats with leaves.&rdquo;</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Yet will ye sing, Arcadians, of my woes</l>
<l n="tr">upon your mountains,&rdquo; sadly he replied&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">&ldquo;Arcadians, that alone have skill to sing.</l>
<l n="tr">O then how softly would my ashes rest,</l>
<l n="tr">if of my love, one day, your flutes should tell!</l>
<l n="tr">And would that I, of your own fellowship,</l>
<l n="tr">or dresser of the ripening grape had been,</l>
<l n="tr">or guardian of the flock! for surely then,</l>
<l n="tr">let Phyllis, or Amyntas, or who else,</l>
<l n="tr">bewitch me&mdash;what if swart Amyntas be?</l>
<l n="tr">Dark is the violet, dark the hyacinth&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">among the willows, 'neath the limber vine,</l>
<l n="tr">reclining would my love have lain with me,</l>
<l n="tr">Phyllis plucked garlands, or Amyntas sung.</l>
<l n="tr">Here are cool springs, soft mead and grove, Lycoris;</l>
<l n="tr">here might our lives with time have worn away.</l>
<l n="tr">But me mad love of the stern war-god holds</l>
<l n="tr">armed amid weapons and opposing foes.</l>
<l n="tr">Whilst thou&mdash;Ah! might I but believe it not!&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">alone without me, and from home afar,</l>
<l n="tr">look'st upon Alpine snows and frozen <placeName key="tgn,7012611">Rhine</placeName>.</l>
<l n="tr">Ah! may the frost not hurt thee, may the sharp</l>
<l n="tr">and jagged ice not wound thy tender feet!</l>
<l n="tr">I will depart, re-tune the songs I framed</l>
<l n="tr">in verse Chalcidian to the oaten reed</l>
<l n="tr">of the Sicilian swain. Resolved am I</l>
<l n="tr">in the woods, rather, with wild beasts to couch,</l>
<l n="tr">and bear my doom, and character my love</l>
<l n="tr">upon the tender tree-trunks: they will grow,</l>
<l n="tr">and you, my love, grow with them. And meanwhile</l>
<l n="tr">I with the Nymphs will haunt Mount Maenalus,</l>
<l n="tr">or hunt the keen wild boar. No frost so cold</l>
<l n="tr">but I will hem with hounds thy forest-glades,</l>
<l n="tr">parthenius. Even now, methinks, I range</l>
<l n="tr">o'er rocks, through echoing groves, and joy to launch</l>
<l n="tr">Cydonian arrows from a Parthian bow.&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">as if my madness could find healing thus,</l>
<l n="tr">or that god soften at a mortal's grief!</l>
<l n="tr">Now neither Hamadryads, no, nor songs</l>
<l n="tr">delight me more: ye woods, away with you!</l>
<l n="tr">No pangs of ours can change him; not though we</l>
<l n="tr">in the mid-frost should drink of <placeName key="tgn,7002660">Hebrus</placeName>' stream,</l>
<l n="tr">and in wet winters face Sithonian snows,</l>
<l n="tr">or, when the bark of the tall elm-tree bole</l>
<l n="tr">of drought is dying, should, under Cancer's Sign,</l>
<l n="tr">in Aethiopian deserts drive our flocks.</l>
<l n="tr">Love conquers all things; yield we too to love!&rdquo;</l>
<lg><l n="tr">These songs, Pierian Maids, shall it suffice</l>
<l n="tr">your poet to have sung, the while he sat,</l>
<l n="tr">and of slim mallow wove a basket fine:</l>
<l n="tr">to Gallus ye will magnify their worth,</l>
<l n="tr">Gallus, for whom my love grows hour by hour,</l>
<l n="tr">as the green alder shoots in early Spring.</l>
<l n="tr">Come, let us rise: the shade is wont to be</l>
<l n="tr">baneful to singers; baneful is the shade</l>
<l n="tr">cast by the juniper, crops sicken too</l>
<l n="tr">in shade. Now homeward, having fed your fill&mdash;</l>
<l n="tr">eve's star is rising&mdash;go, my she-goats, go.</l></lg></div1>
