<head>THE ADVENTURES OF ATYS</head>
<l n="1">O'er high deep seas in speedy ship his voyage Atys sped</l>
<l n="2">Until he trod the Phrygian grove with hurried eager tread</l>
<l n="3">And as the gloomy tree-shorn stead, the she-god's home, he sought</l>
<l n="4">There sorely stung with fiery ire and madman's vaguing thought,</l>
<l n="5">Share he with sharpened flint the freight wherewith his form was fraught.</l>
<l n="6">Then as the she-he sensed limbs were void of manly strain</l>
<l n="7">And sighted freshly shed a-ground spot of ensanguined stain,</l>
<l n="8">Snatched she the timbrel's legier load with hands as snowdrops white,</l>
<l n="9">Thy timbrel, Mother Cybele, the firstings of thy rite,</l>
<l n="10">And as her tender finger-tips on bull-back hollow rang</l>
<l n="11">She rose a-grieving and her song to listening comrades sang.</l>
<l n="12">"Up Gallae, hie together, haste for Cybele's deep grove,</l>
<l n="13">Hie to the Dindymnean dame, ye flocks that love to rove;</l>
<l n="14">The which affecting stranger steads as bound in exile's brunt</l>
<l n="15">My sect pursuing led by me have nerved you to confront</l>
<l n="16">The raging surge of salty sea and ocean's tyrant hand</l>
  <l n="17">As your hate of <persName><surname>Venus</surname></persName>' hest your manly forms unmann'd,</l>
<l n="18">Gladden your souls, ye mistresses, with sense of error bann'd.</l>
<l n="19">Drive from your spirits dull delay, together follow ye</l>
<l n="20">To hold of Phrygian goddess, home of Phrygian Cybebe,</l>
<l n="21">Where  loud the cymbal's voice resounds with timbrel-echoes blending,</l>
<l n="22">And where the Phrygian piper drones grave bass from reed a-bending,</l>
<l n="23">Where toss their ivy-circled heads with might the Maenades</l>
<l n="24">Where ply mid shrilly lullilooes the holiest mysteries,</l>
<l n="25">Where to fly here and there be wont the she-god's vaguing train,</l>
<l n="26">Thither behoves us lead the dance in quick-step hasty strain."</l>
<l n="27">Soon as had Atys (bastard-she) this lay to comrades sung</l>
<l n="28">The Chorus sudden lulliloos with quivering, quavering tongue,</l>
<l n="29">Again the nimble timbrel groans, the scooped-out cymbals clash,</l>
<l n="30">And up green Ida flits the Choir, with footsteps hurrying rash</l>
<l n="31">Then Atys frantic, panting, raves, a-wandering, lost, insane,</l>
<l n="32">And leads with timbrel hent and treads the shades where shadows rain,</l>
<l n="33">Like heifer spurning load of yoke in yet unbroken pride;</l>
<l n="34">And the swift Gallae follow fain their first and fleet-foot guide.</l>
<l n="35">But when the home of Cybele they make with toil out-worn</l>
  <l n="36">O'er much, they lay them down to sleep and gifts of <persName><surname>Ceres</surname></persName> scorn;</l>
<l n="37">Till heavy slumbers seal their eyelids langourous, drooping lowly,</l>
<l n="38">And raving frenzy flies each brain departing softly, slowly.</l>
<l n="39">But when Dan Sol with radiant eyes that fire his face of gold</l>
<l n="40">Surveyed white aether and solid soil and waters uncontrol'd,</l>
<l n="41">And chased with steeds sonorous-hooved the shades of lingering night,</l>
<l n="42">Then sleep from waking Atys fled fleeting with sudden flight,</l>
<l n="43">By Nymph Pasithae welcomed to palpitating breast.</l>
<l n="44">Thus when his frenzy raging rash was soothed to gentlest rest,</l>
<l n="45">Atys revolved deeds lately done, as thought from breast unfolding,</l>
<l n="46">And what he'd lost and what he was with lucid sprite beholding,</l>
<l n="47">To shallows led by surging soul again the way 'gan take.</l>
<l n="48">There casting glance of weeping eyes where vasty billows brake,</l>
<l n="49">Sad-voiced in pitifullest lay his native land bespake.</l>
<l n="50">"Country of me, Creatress mine, born to thee and bred,</l>
<l n="51">By hapless me abandoned as by thrall from lordling fled,</l>
<l n="52">When me to Ida's groves and glades these vaguing footsteps bore</l>
<l n="53">To tarry 'mid the snows and where lurk beasts in antres frore</l>
<l n="54">And seek the deeply hidden lairs where furious ferals meet!</l>
<l n="55">Where, Country! whither placed must I now hold thy site and seat?</l>
<l n="56">Lief would these balls of eyes direct to thee their line of sight,</l>
<l n="57">Which for a while, a little while, would free me from despite.</l>
<l n="58">Must I for ever roam these groves from house and home afar?</l>
<l n="59">Of country, parents, kith and kin (life's boon) myself debar?</l>
<l n="60">Fly Forum, fly  Palestra, fly the Stadium, the Gymnase?</l>
<l n="61">Wretch, ah poor wretch, I'm doomed (my soul!) to mourn throughout my days,</l>
<l n="62">For what of form or figure is, which I failed to enjoy?</l>
<l n="63">I full-grown man, I blooming youth, I stripling, I a boy,</l>
<l n="64">I of Gymnasium erst the bloom, I too of oil the pride:</l>
<l n="65">Warm was my threshold, ever stood my gateways opening wide,</l>
<l n="66">My house was ever garlanded and hung with flowery freight,</l>
<l n="67">And couch to quit with rising sun, has ever been my fate:</l>
<l n="68">Now must I Cybele's she-slave, priestess of gods, be hight?</l>
<l n="69">I Maenad I, mere bit of self, I neutral barren wight?</l>
<l n="70">I spend my life-tide couch't beneath high-towering Phrygian peaks?</l>
<l n="71">I dwell on Ida's verdant slopes mottled with snowy streaks,</l>
<l n="72">Where homes the forest-haunting doe, where roams the wildling boar?</l>
<l n="73">Now, now I rue my deed foredone, now, now it irks me sore!"</l>
<l n="74">Whenas from out those roseate lips these accents rapid flew,</l>
<l n="75">Bore them to ears divine consigned a Nuncio true and new;</l>
<l n="76">Then Cybele her lions twain disjoining from their yoke</l>
<l n="77">The left-hand enemy of the herds a-goading thus bespoke:</l>
<l n="78">"Up feral fell! up, hie with him, see rage his foot-steps urge,</l>
<l n="79">See that his fury smite him till he seek the forest verge,</l>
<l n="80">He who with over-freedom fain would fly mine empery.</l>
<l n="81">Go, slash thy flank with lashing tail and sense the strokes of thee,</l>
<l n="82">Make the whole mountain to thy roar sound and resound again,</l>
<l n="83">And fiercely toss thy brawny neck that bears the tawny mane!"</l>
<l n="84">So quoth an angered Cybele, and yoke with hand untied:</l>
<l n="85">The feral rose in fiery wrath and self-inciting hied,</l>
<l n="86">A-charging, roaring through the brake with breaking paws he tore.</l>
<l n="87">But when he reached the humid sands where surges cream the shore,</l>
<l n="88">Spying soft Atys lingering near the marbled pave of sea</l>
<l n="89">He springs: the terror-madded wretch back to the wood doth flee,</l>
<l n="90">Where for the remnant of her days a bondmaid's life led she.</l>
<l n="91">Great Goddess, Goddess Cybele, Dindymus dame divine,</l>
<l n="92">Far from my house and home thy wrath and wrack, dread mistress mine:</l>
<l n="93">Goad others on with Fury's goad, others to Ire consign!</l>

<head>Marriage of Peleus and Thetis</head>
<l n="1">Pine-trees gendered whilome upon soaring Peliac summit</l>
  <l n="2">Swam (as the tale is told) through liquid surges of <persName><surname>Neptune</surname></persName></l>
<l n="3">Far as the Phasis-flood and frontier-land Aeetean;</l>
<l n="4">Whenas the youths elect, of <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> vigour the oak-heart,</l>
<l n="5">Longing the Golden Fleece of the Colchis-region to harry,</l>
<l n="6">Dared in a poop swift-paced to span salt seas and their shallows,</l>
<l n="7">Sweeping the deep blue seas with sweeps a-carven of fir-wood.</l>
<l n="8">She, that governing Goddess of citadels crowning the cities,</l>
<l n="9">Builded herself their car fast-flitting with lightest of breezes,</l>
<l n="10">Weaving plants of the pine conjoined in curve of the kelson;</l>
<l n="11">Foremost of all to imbue rude Amphitrite with ship-lore.</l>
<l n="12">Soon as her beak had burst through wind-rackt spaces of ocean,</l>
<l n="13">While the oar-tortured wave with spumy whiteness was blanching,</l>
<l n="14">Surged from the deep abyss and hoar-capped billows the faces</l>
<l n="15">Seaborn, Nereids eyeing the  prodigy wonder-smitten.</l>
<l n="16">There too mortal orbs through softened spendours regarded</l>
<l n="17">Ocean-nymphs who exposed bodies denuded of raiment</l>
<l n="18">Bare to the breast upthrust from hoar froth capping the sea-depths.</l>
<l n="19">Then Thetis Peleus fired (men say) a-sudden with love,</l>
<l n="20">Then Thetis nowise spurned to mate and marry with mortal,</l>
<l n="21">Then Thetis' Sire himself her yoke with Peleus sanctioned.</l>
<l n="22">Oh, in those happier days now fondly yearned-for, you heroes</l>
<l n="23">Born; (all hail!) of the gods begotten, and excellent issue</l>
<l n="23b">Bred by your mothers, all hail! and placid deal me your favour.</l>
<l n="24">Oft with the sound of me, in strains and spells I'll invoke you;</l>
<l n="25">You too by wedding-torch so happily, highly augmented,</l>
  <l n="26">Peleus, <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>'s ward, in whose favor <persName><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName> himself,</l>
<l n="27">The Father of the gods, resigned his passions.</l>
<l n="28">You Thetis, fairest of maids Nereian, vouchsafed to marry?</l>
<l n="29">You did Tethys empower to woo and wed with her grandchild;</l>
<l n="30">Nor less Oceanus, with water compassing th' Earth-globe?</l>
<l n="31">But when ended the term, and wisht-for light of the day-tide</l>

<l n="35">Cieros abides a desert: they quit Phthiotican Tempe,</l>
<l n="36">Homesteads of Crannon-town, eke bulwarkt walls Larissa;</l>
<l n="37">Meeting at <placeName key="tgn,7010797">Pharsalus</placeName>, and roof Pharsalian seeking.</l>
<l n="38">None will the fields now till; soft wax all necks the oxen,</l>
<l n="39">Never the humble vine is purged by curve of the rake-tooth,</l>
<l n="40">Never a pruner's hook thins out the shade of the tree-tufts,</l>
<l n="41">Never a bull up-plows broad glebe with bend of the coulter,</l>
<l n="42">Over whose point unuse displays the squalor of rust-stain.</l>
<l n="43">But in the homestead's heart, where'er that opulent palace</l>
<l n="44">Hides a retreat, all shines with splendour of gold and of silver.</l>
<l n="45">Ivory blanches the seats, bright gleam the flagons a-table,</l>
<l n="46">All of the mansion joys in royal riches and grandeur.</l>
<l n="47">But for the Diva's use bestrewn is the genial bedstead,</l>
<l n="48">Hidden in midmost stead, and its polisht framework of Indian</l>
<l n="49">Tusk underlies its cloth empurpled by juice of the dye-shell.</l>
<l n="50">This be a figured cloth with forms of manhood primeval</l>
<l n="51">Showing by marvel-art the gifts and graces of heroes.</l>
<l n="52">Here upon Dia's strand wave-resonant, ever-regarding</l>
<l n="53">Theseus borne from sight outside by fleet of the fleetest,</l>
<l n="54">Stands Ariadne with heart full-filled with furies unbated,</l>
<l n="55">Nor can her sense as yet believe she 'spies the espied,</l>
<l n="56">When like one that awakes new roused from slumber deceptive,</l>
<l n="57">Sees she her hapless self lone left on loneliest sandbank:</l>
<l n="58">While as the mindless youth with oars disturbeth the shallows,</l>
<l n="59">Casts to the windy storms what vows he vainly had vowed.</l>
<l n="60">Him through the sedges afar the sad-eyed maiden of Minos,</l>
<l n="61">Likest a Bacchant-girl stone-carven, (O her sorrow!)</l>
<l n="62">'Spies, a-tossing the while on sorest billows of love-care.</l>
<l n="63">Now no more on her blood-hued hair fine fillets retains she,</l>
<l n="64">No more now light veil conceals her bosom erst hidden,</l>
<l n="65">Now no more smooth zone contains her milky-hued paplets:</l>
<l n="66">All gear dropping adown from every part of her person</l>
<l n="67">Thrown, lie fronting her feet to the briny wavelets a sea-toy.</l>
<l n="68">But at such now no more of her veil or her fillet a-floating</l>
<l n="69">Had she regard: on you, Theseus! all of her heart-strength,</l>
<l n="70">All of her sprite, her mind, forlorn, were evermore hanging.</l>
<l n="71">Ah, sad soul, by grief and grievance driven beside you,</l>
<l n="72">Sowed Erycina first those brambly cares in thy bosom,</l>
<l n="73">What while issuing fierce with will enstarkened, Theseus</l>
<l n="74">Forth from the  bow-bent shore Piraean putting a-seawards</l>
<l n="75">Reacht the Gortynian roofs where dwelt the injurious Monarch.</l>
<l n="76">For 'twas told of yore how forced by pestilence cruel,</l>
<l n="77">Eke as a blood rite due for the Androgeonian murder,</l>
<l n="78">Many a chosen youth and the bloom of damsels unmarried</l>
<l n="79">Food for the Minotaur, Cecropia was wont to befurnish.</l>
<l n="80">Seeing his narrow walls in such wise vexed with evils,</l>

<l n="83">Lives by Cecropia doomed to burials burying nowise;</l>
<l n="84">Then with a swifty ship and soft breathed breezes a-stirring,</l>
<l n="85">Sought he Minos the Haughty where homed in proudest of Mansions.</l>
<l n="86">Him as with yearning glance forthright espied the royal</l>

<l n="98">All for a blond-haired youth suspiring many a singulf!</l>
<l n="99">Whiles how dire was the dread she dreed in languishing heart-strings;</l>
<l n="100"><milestone n="100" unit="line"/>How yet more, ever more, with golden splendour she paled!</l>
<l n="101">Whenas yearning to mate his might with the furious monster</l>
<l n="102">Theseus braved his death or sought the prizes of praises.</l>
<l n="103">Then of her gifts to gods not ingrate, nor profiting naught,</l>
<l n="104">Promise with silent lip, addressed she timidly vowing.</l>
<l n="105">For as an oak that shakes on topmost summit of Taurus</l>
<l n="106">Its boughs, or cone-growing pine from bole bark resin exuding,</l>
<l n="107">Whirlwind of passing might that twists the stems with its storm-blasts,</l>
<l n="108">Uproots, deracinates, forthright its trunk to the farthest,</l>
<l n="109">Prone falls, shattering wide what lies in line of its downfall,&mdash;</l>
<l n="110">Thus was that wildling flung by Theseus and vanquisht of body,</l>
<l n="111">Vainly tossing its horns and goring the wind to no purpose.</l>
<l n="112">Thence with abounding praise returned he, guiding his footsteps,</l>
<l n="113">While a fine drawn thread checked steps in wander abounding,</l>
<l n="114">Lest when issuing forth of the winding maze labyrinthine</l>
<l n="115">Baffled become his track by inobservable error.</l>
<l n="116">But for what cause should I, from early subject digressing,</l>
<l n="117">Tell of the daughter who the face of her sire unseeing,</l>
<l n="118">Eke her sister's embrace nor less her mother's endearments,</l>
<l n="119">Who in despair bewept her hapless child that so gladly</l>
<l n="120">Chose before every and each the lively wooing of Theseus?</l>
<l n="121">Or how borne by the ship to the yeasting shore-line of Dia</l>
<l n="122">Came she? or how when bound her eyes in bondage of slumber</l>
<l n="123">Left her that chosen mate with mind unmindful departing?</l>
<l n="124">Often (they tell) with heart inflamed by fiery fury</l>
<l n="125">Poured she shrilling of shrieks from deepest depths of her bosom;</l>
<l n="126">Now she would sadly scale the broken faces of mountains,</l>
<l n="127">Whence she might overglance the boundless boiling of billows,</l>
<l n="128">Then she would  rush to bestem the salt-plain's quivering wavelet</l>
<l n="129">And from her ankles bare the dainty garment uplifting,</l>
<l n="130">Spoke she these words ('tis said) from sorrow's deepest abysses,</l>
<l n="131">While from her tear-drencht face outburst cold shivering sobs.</l>
<l n="132">"Thus from my patrial shore, O traitor, hurried to exile,</l>

<l n="135">(Reckless, alas!) to your home convoying perjury-curses?</l>
<l n="136">Naught, then, ever availed that mind of cruelest counsel</l>
<l n="137">Alter? No saving grace in you was evermore ready,</l>
<l n="138">That to have pity on me vouchsafed your pitiless bosom?</l>
<l n="139">Nevertheless not in past time such were the promises wordy</l>
<l n="140">Lavished; nor such hopes to me the hapless were bidden;</l>

<l n="154">Say me, what lioness bare you 'neath lone rock of the desert?</l>
<l n="155">What sea spued you conceived from out the spume of his surges!</l>
<l n="156">What manner Syrt, what ravening Scylla, what vasty Charybdis?</l>
<l n="157">you who for sweet life saved such meeds are lief of returning!</l>
<l n="158">If never willed your breast with me to mate you in marriage,</l>

<l n="160">Still of your competence 'twas within your household to home me,</l>
<l n="161">Where I might serve as slave in gladsome service familiar,</l>
<l n="162">Laving your snow-white feet in clearest chrystalline waters</l>
<l n="163">Or with its purpling gear your couch in company strewing.</l>
<l n="164">Yet for what cause should I complain in vain to the winds that unknow me,</l>
<l n="165">(I so beside me with grief!) which ne'er of senses endued</l>
<l n="166">Hear not the words sent forth nor aught avail they to answer?</l>
<l n="167">Now be his course well-nigh engaged in midway of ocean,</l>
<l n="168">Nor any mortal shape appears in barrens of sea-wrack.</l>
<l n="169">Thus at the latest hour with insults over-sufficient</l>
