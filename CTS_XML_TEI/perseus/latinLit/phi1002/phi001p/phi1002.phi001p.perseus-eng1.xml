                <p>
                    You have daily importuned me with the request
that I should at length take steps to publish the
book on the Education of an Orator which I dedicated
to my friend Marcellus. For my own view was that
it was not yet ripe for publication. As you know I
have spent little more than two years on its composition, during which time moreover I have been distracted by a multitude of other affairs. These two
years have been devoted not so much to actual writing
as to the research demanded by a task to which
practically no limits can be set and to the reading
of innumerable authors.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Further, following the precept of Horace who in his Art of Poetry deprecates
hasty publication and urges the would-be author
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <l part="F">To withhold</l>
                        <l part="N">His work till nine long years have passed away,</l>
                    </quote>
                    I proposed to give them time, in order that the
ardour of creation might cool and that I might
revise them with all the consideration of a dispassionate reader.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    But if there is such a demand for
their publication as you assert, why then let us
spread our canvas to the gale and offer up a fervent
prayer to heaven as we put out to sea. But remember I rely on your loyal care to see that they
reach the public in as correct a form as possible.
