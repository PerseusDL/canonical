                    I undertook my present task, Marcellus Victorius,
mainly to gratify your request,

                    but also with a view
to assist the more earnest of our young men as far
as lay in my power, while latterly the energy with
which I have devoted myself to my labours has
been inspired by the almost imperative necessity
imposed by the office conferred on me,

                    </note>
                    though
all the while I have had an eye to my own
personal pleasure. For I thought that this work
would be the most precious part of the inheritance
that would fall to my son, whose ability was so
remarkable that it called for the most anxious
cultivation on the part of his father. Thus if, as
would have been but just and devoutly to be
wished, the fates had torn me from his side, he
would still have been able to enjoy the benefit of
his father's instruction.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Night and day I pursued
this design, and strove to hasten its completion in
the fear that death might cut me off with my task
unfinished, when misfortune overwhelmed me with
such suddenness, that the success of my labours now
interests no one less than myself. A second bereavement has fallen upon me, and I have lost him of
whom I had formed the highest expectations, and
in whom I reposed all the hopes that should solace
my old age. What is there left for me to do?
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Or
                    <pb id="p.375"/>
                    what further use can I hope to be on earth, when
heaven thus frowns upon me? For it so chances
that just at the moment when I began my book on
the causes of the decline of eloquence, I was stricken
by a like affliction. Better had I thrown that illomened work and all my ill-starred learning upon
the flames of that untimely pyre that was to consume
the darling of my heart, and had not sought to
burden my unnatural persistence in this wicked
world with the fatigue of fresh labours!
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    For what
father with a spark of proper feeling would pardon
me for having the heart to pursue my researches
further, and would not hate me for my insensibility,
had I other use for my voice than to rail against
high heaven for having suffered me to outlive all
my nearest and dearest, and to testify that providence deigns not at all to watch over this earth of
ours? If this is not proved by my own misfortune
(and yet my only fault is that I still live), it is most
surely manifest in theirs, who were cut off thus
untimely; their mother was taken from me earlier
still, she had borne me two sons ere the completion of
her nineteenth year; but for her, though she too died
most untimely, death was a blessing.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Yet for me her
death alone was such a blow that thereafter no good
fortune could bring me true happiness. For she had
every virtue that is given to woman to possess, and
left her husband a prey to irremediable grief; nay,
so young was she when death took her, that if her
age be compared with mine, her decease was like
the loss not merely of a wife, but of a daughter.
Still her children survived her, and I, too,
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    lived on
by some unnatural ordinance of fate, which for all
its perversity was what she herself desired; and
                    <pb id="p.377"/>
                    thus by her swift departure from this life she escaped
tile worst of tortures. My youngest boy was barely
five, when he was the first to leave me, robbing me
as it were of one of my two eyes.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    I have no desire
to flaunt my woes in the public gaze, nor to exaggerate the cause I have for tears; would that I had
some means to make it less! But how can I forget
the charm of his face, the sweetness of his speech,
his first flashes of promise, and his actual possession
of a calm and, incredible though it may seem, a
powerful mind. Such a child would have captivated
my affections, even had he been another's.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    Nor was
this all; to enhance my agony the malignity of
designing fortune had willed that he should devote
all his love to me, preferring me to his nurses, to
his grandmother who brought him up, and all those
who, as a rule, win the special affection of infancy.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    I am, therefore, grateful to the grief that came to
me some few months before his loss in the death
of his mother, the best of women, whose virtues
were beyond all praise. For I have less reason to
weep my own fate than to rejoice at hers.

                    After these calamities all my hopes, all my delight
were centred on my little Quintilian, and he might
have sufficed to console me.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    For his gifts were not
merely in the bud like those of his brother: as
early as his ninth birthday he had put forth sure
and well-formed fruit. By my own sorrows, by the
testimony of my own sad heart, by his departed
spirit, the deity at whose shrine my grief does
worship, I swear that I discerned in him such talent,
not merely in receiving instruction, although in all
my wide experience I have never seen his like, nor
in his power of spontaneous application, to which his
                    <pb id="p.379"/>
                    teachers can bear witness, but such upright, pious,
humane and generous feelings, as alone might have
sufficed to fill me with the dread of the fearful
thunder-stroke that has smitten me down: for it
is a matter of common observation that those who
ripen early die young, and that there is some malign
influence that delights in cutting short the greatest
promise and refusing to permit our joys to pass
beyond the bound allotted to mortal man.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    He
possessed every incidental advantage as well, a
pleasing and resonant voice, a sweetness of speech,
and a perfect correctness in pronouncing every letter
both in Greek and Latin, as though either were his
native tongue. But all these were but the promise
of greater things. He had finer qualities, courage
and dignity, and the strength to resist both fear
and pain. What fortitude he showed during an illness of eight months, till all his physicians marvelled
at him! How he consoled me during his last
moments. How even in the wanderings of delirium
did his thoughts recur to his lessons and his literary
studies, even when his strength was sinking and he
was no longer ours to claim!
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Child of my vain
hopes, did I see your eyes fading in death and your
breath take its last flight? Had I the heart to
receive your fleeting spirit,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        It was customary for the next-of-kin to receive in the
mouth the last breath of the dying to continue the existence
of the spirit.
                    </note>
                    as I embraced your cold
pale body, and to live on breathing the common air.
Justly do I endure the agony that now is mine, and
the thoughts that torment me.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    Have I lost you at
the moment when adoption by a consular had given
hope that you would rise to all the high offices of
state, when you were destined to be the son-in-law
of your uncle the praetor, and gave promise of
rivalling the eloquence of your grandsire? and do I
                    <pb id="p.381"/>
                    your father survive only to weep? May my endurance (not my will to live, for that is gone from me)
prove me worthy of you through all my remaining
years. For it is in vain that we impute all our ills
to fortune. No man grieves long save through his
own fault.
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    But I still live, and must find something
to make life tolerable, and must needs put faith in
the verdict of the wise, who held that literature
alone can provide true solace in adversity. Yet, if
ever the violence of my present grief subside and
admit the intrusion of some other thought on so
many sorrowful reflexions, I may with good cause
ask pardon for the delay in bringing my work to
completion. Who can wonder that my studies have
been interrupted, when the real marvel is that they
have not been broken off altogether?
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    Should
certain portions therefore betray a lack of finish
compared with what was begun in the days when
my affliction was less profound, I would ask that the
imperfections should be regarded with indulgence,
as being due to the cruel tyranny of fortune, which,
if it has not utterly extinguished, has at any rate
weakened such poor powers of intellect as I once
possessed. But for this very reason I must rouse
myself to face my task with greater spirit, since it
is easy to despise fortune, though it may be hard
to bear her blows. For there is nothing left that
she can do to me, since out of my calamities she
has wrought for me a security which, full of sorrow
though it be, is such that nothing can shake it.
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    And the very fact that I have no personal interest
in persevering with my present work, but am moved
solely by the desire to serve others, if indeed anything that I write can be of such service, is a reason
                    <pb id="p.383"/>
                    for regarding my labours with an indulgent eye.
Alas! I shall bequeath it, like my patrimony, for
others than those to whom it was my design to
leave it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
                    The next subject which I was going to discuss
was the peroration which some call the completion
and others the conclusion. There are two kinds of
peroration, for it may deal either with facts or with
the emotional aspect of the case. The repetition
and grouping of the facts, which the Greeks call
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)nakefalai/wsis</foreign>
                    and some of our own writers call the
enumeration, serves both to refresh the memory of
the judge and to place the whole of the case before
his eyes, and, even although the facts may have
made little impression on him in detail, their cumulative effect is considerable.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    This final recapitulation must be as brief as possible and, as the
Greek term indicates, we must summarise the facts
under the appropriate heads. For if we devote
too much time thereto, the peroration will cease
to be an enumeration and will constitute something very like a second speech. On the other
hand the points selected for enumeration must
be treated with weight and dignity, enlivened
by apt reflexions and diversified by suitable figures;
for there is nothing more tiresome than a dry repetition of facts, which merely suggests a lack of
confidence in the judges' memory.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    There are however innumerable ways in which this may be done.
The finest example is provided by Cicero's prosecution of Verres.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">V. lii. 136</note>
                    <quote>
                        If your own father were among
your judges, what would he say when these facts
were proved against you?
                    </quote>
                    Then follows the
                    <pb id="p.385"/>
                    enumeration. Another admirable example
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">ib.</hi>
                        lxxii.
                    </note>
                    may be found
in the same speech where the enumeration of the
temples which the praetor had despoiled takes the
form of invoking the various deities concerned. We
may also at times pretend to be in doubt whether
we have not omitted something and to wonder what
the accused will say in reply to certain points or
what hope tile accuser can have after the manner in
which we have refuted all the charges brought against
us.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    But the most attractive form of peroration is
that which we may use when we have an opportunity of drawing some argument from our opponent's
speech, as for instance when we say
                    <quote>He omitted to deal with this portion of tile case,</quote>
                    or
                    <quote>He preferred to crush us by exciting odium against us,</quote>
                    or
                    <quote>He had good reason for resorting to entreaty, since lie knew certain facts.</quote>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    But I must refrain from dealing with the various methods individually, for fear
that the instances that I produce should be regarded
as exhaustive, whereas our opportunities spring from
the nature of the particular case, from the statements
of our opponents and also from fortuitous circumstances. Nor must we restrict ourselves to recapitulating the points of our own speech, but must call
upon our opponent to reply to certain questions.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    This however is only possible if there is time for him
to do so and if the arguments which we have put
forward are such as not to admit of refutation. For
to challenge points which tell in our opponent's
favour is not to argue against him, but to play the
part of prompter to him.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    The majority of Athenians
and almost all philosophers who have left anything
in writing on the art of oratory have held that the
recapitulation is the sole form of peroration. I
                    <pb id="p.387"/>
                    imagine that the reason why the Athenians did so
was that appeals to the emotions were forbidden to
Athenian orators, a proclamation to this effect being
actually made by the court-usher.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        Athenaens (xiii. 6, 590 E) states that a law against
appeals to the emotions was passed at Athens after Hyperides' defence of 'hryne (
                        <hi rend="italics">see</hi>
                        <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
                        xv. 9.). But there is no real
evidence for the existence of such a law save in cases tried
before the Areopagps (see Arist.
                        <hi rend="italics">Rhet.</hi>
                        I. i. 5). Appeals for
pity were as freely employed in the ordinary courts of
Athens during the fourth century as at Rome. When Xenophon (
                        <hi rend="italics">Mem.</hi>
                        iv. iv. 4) says that Socrates refused to beg
mercy of his judges contrary to the law, he seems to refer
to the spirit, not the letter.
                    </note>
                    I am less surprised at the philosophers taking this view, for they
regard susceptibility to emotion as a vice, and think
it immoral that the judge should be distracted from
the truth by an appeal to his emotions and that
it is unbecoming for a good man to make use of
vicious procedure to serve his ends. None the less
they must admit that appeals to emotion are necessary if there are no other means for securing the
victory of truth, justice and the public interest.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    It
is however admitted by all that recapitulation may
be profitably employed in other portions of the
speech as well, if the case is complicated and a
number of different arguments have been employed
in the defence; though no one will doubt but that
there are many cases, in which no recapitulation at
all is necessary at any point, assuming, that is, that
the cases are both brief and simple. This part of
the peroration is common both to the prosecution
and the defence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Both parties as a general rule may likewise employ the appeal to the emotions, but they will
appeal to different emotions and the defender will
employ such appeals with greater frequency and
fulness. For the accuser has to rouse the judge,
while the defender has to soften him. Still even
the accuser will sometimes make his audience weep
by the pity excited for the man whose wrongs he
seeks to avenge, while the defendant will at times
develop no small vehemence when he complains of
the injustice of the calumny or conspiracy of which
                    <pb id="p.389"/>
                    he is the victim. It will therefore be best to treat
these duties separately: as I have already said,

former.

                    For our attempts to sway the judges are
made more sparingly at the commencement of the
speech, when it is enough that such an attempt
should gain admittance and we have the whole
speech before us. On the other hand in the peroration we have to consider what the feelings of the
judge will be when he retires to consider his verdict,
for we shall have no further opportunity to say anything and cannot any longer reserve arguments to be
produced later.

                    It is therefore the duty of both parties
to seek to win the judge's goodwill and to divert it
from their opponent, as also to excite or assuage his
emotions. And the following brief rule may be laid
down for the observation of both parties, that the
orator should display the full strength of his case
before the eyes of the judge, and, when he has made
up his mind what points in his case actually deserve
or may seem to deserve to excite envy, goodwill,
dislike or pity, should dwell on those points by which
he himself would be most moved were he trying the
case.

                    There are however certain things
which require fuller treatment in the peroration
than in the exordium, where it is sufficient merely to
outline them. This fuller treatment is specially
required if the accused be a man of violent, unpopular or dangerous character or if the

                    condemnation of the accused is likely to cover the judges with

                    Calvus for

admirable remark:

                    says that the ill-name acquired by the courts may
be effaced by the condemnation of Verres, a statement that comes under the head of the conciliatory
methods mentioned above. The appeal to tear also,
if it is necessary to employ it to produce a like effect,
occupies a more prominent place in the peroration
than in the exordium, but I have expressed my views
on this subject in an earlier book.

                    The peroration
also provides freer opportunities for exciting the
passions of jealousy, hatred or anger. As regards the
circumstances likely to excite such feelings in the
judge, jealousy will be produced by the influence of
the accused, hatred by the disgraceful nature of his
conduct, and anger by his disrespectful attitude to
the court, if, for instance, he be contumacious,
arrogant or studiously indifferent: such anger may be
aroused not merely by specific acts or words, but by
his looks, bearing and manner. In this connexion

                    The best way however for the accuser to excite the
feelings of the judge is to make the charge which he
brings against the accused seem as atrocious or, if
feasible, as deplorable as possible. Its atrocity may
be enhanced by considerations of the nature of
the act, the position of its author or the victim, the
                    <pb id="p.393"/>
                    purpose, time, place and manner of the act: all of
which may be treated with infinite variety.
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    Suppose
that we are complaining that our client has been
beaten. We must first speak of the act itself; we
shall then proceed to point out that the victim was
an old man, a child, a magistrate, an honest man or
a benefactor to the state; we shall also point out
that the assailant was a worthless and contemptible
fellow, or (to take the opposite case) was in a
position of excessive power or was the last man who
should have given the blow, or again that the
occasion was a solemn festival, or that the act was
committed at a time when such crimes were
punished with special severity by the courts or when
public order was at a dangerously low ebb. Again
the hatred excited by the act will be enhanced if it
was committed in the theatre, in a temple, or at
a public assembly,
                    <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    and if the blow was given not
in mistake or in a moment of passion or, if it
was the result of passion which was quite unjustifiable, being due to the fact that the victim
had gone to the assistance of his father or had
made some reply or was a candidate for the same
office as his assailant; or finally we may hint that
he wished to inflict more serious injury than he
succeeded in inflicting. But it is the manner of the
act that contributes most to the impression of its
atrocity, if, for example, the blow was violent or insulting: thus Demosthenes
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

against Midias by emphasising the position of the
blow, the attitude of the assailant and the expression
of his face.

                    It is in this connexion that we shall
have to consider whether a man was killed by sword
or fire or poison, by one wound or several, and
                    <pb id="p.395"/>
                    whether he was slain on the spot or tortured by
being kept in suspense. The accuser will also
frequently attempt to excite pity by complaining of
the fate of the man whom he is seeking to avenge or
of the desolation which has fallen upon his children
or parents.
                    <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    The judges may also be moved by drawing a picture of the future, of the fate which awaits
those who have complained of violence and wrong,
if they fail to secure justice. They must go into exile,
give up their property or endure to the end whatever their enemy may choose to inflict upon them.
                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    But it will more frequently be the duty of the
accuser to divert the judge from all the temptations
to pity which the accused will place before him, and
to incite him to give a strong and dispassionate
verdict. It will also be his duty in this connexion
to forestall the arguments and actions to which his
opponent seems likely to have recourse. For it
makes the judge more cautious in observing the
sanctity of his oath and destroys the influence of
those who are going to reply to us when the arguments used by the defence have already been dealt
with by the prosecution, since they lose their novelty.
An instance of this will be found in the speech of
Messala against Aufidia,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

line of defence which Demosthenes will pursue.
There are also occasions when the judges should be
told what answer they should make to requests on
behalf of the accused, a proceeding which is a form
of recapitulation.

                    If we turn to the defendant, we must note that
                    <pb id="p.397"/>
                    his worth, nis manly pursuits, the scars from wounds
received in battle, his rank and the services rendered
by his ancestors, will all commend him to the goodwill of the judges. Cicero,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See iv. i. 69.</note>
                    as I have already pointed
out, and Asinius both make use of this form of
appeal: indeed they may almost be regarded as
rivals in this respect, since Cicero employed it when
defending the elder Scaurus, Asinius when defending the son. Again,
                    <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>
                    the cause which has brought
the accused into peril may serve to produce the
same effect, if, for example, it appears that he has
incurred enmity on account of some honourable
action: above all his goodness, humanity or pity
may be emphasised with this end in view. For it
adds to the apparent justice of his claim, if all that
he asks of the judge is that he should grant to him
what he himself has granted to others. We may
also in this connexion lay stress on the interests of
the state, the glory which will accrue to the judges,
the importance of the precedent which their verdict
will set and the place it will hold in the memory of
after generations.
                    <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                    But the appeal which will carry
most weight is the appeal to pity, which not merely
forces the judge to change his views, but even to
betray his emotion by tears. Such appeals to pity
will be based either on the previous or present
sufferings of the accused, or on those which await
him if condemned. And the force of our appeal will
be doubled if we contrast the fortune which he now
enjoys with that to which he will be reduced, if he
fail.
                    <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>
                    In this connexion great play may be made by
reference to the age and sex of the accused, or to
his nearest and dearest, that is, his children, parents
and kindred, all of which topics are treated in
                    <pb id="p.399"/>
                    different ways. Sometimes the advocate himself may
even assume the role of close intimacy with his
client, as Cicero does in the
                    <hi rend="italics">pro Milone,</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">xxxvii. 102.</note>

cries:

                        Alas, unhappy that I am! Alas, my unfortunate friend! You succeeded by the agency of

my native land, and cannot I through the same
agency retain you in yours?
                    </quote>
                    Such a method is
especially serviceable when, as was the case with
Milo, entreaty is not in keeping with the character
of the accused.
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    Who would have endured to hear
Milo pleading for his life, when he admitted that
he had killed a man of noble birth because it was
his duty to do so? Consequently Cicero sought to
win the judges' goodwill for Milo by emphasising
the staunchness of his character, and himself assumed
the role of suppliant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Impersonation may also be employed with profit
in such passages, and by impersonations I mean
fictitious speeches supposed to be uttered, such as
an advocate puts into the mouth of his client. The
bare facts are no doubt moving in themselves; but
when we pretend that the persons concerned themselves are speaking, the personal note adds to the
emotional effect.
                    <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>
                    For then the judge seems no
longer to be listening to a voice bewailing another's
ills, but to hear the voice and feelings of the unhappy
victims, men whose appearance alone would call
forth his tears even though they uttered never a
word. And as their plea would awaken yet greater
pity if they urged it with their own lips, so it is
rendered to some extent all the more effective when
it is, as it were, put into their mouth by their
advocate: we may draw a parallel from the stage,
                    <pb id="p.401"/>
                    where the actor's voice and delivery produce greater
emotional effect when he is speaking in an assumed
role than when he speaks in his own character.
Consequently Cicero, to quote him once again,
                    <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>
                    although he will not put entreaties into Milo's
mouth, and prefers to commend him by his staunchness of character, still lends him words in the form
of such complaint as may become a brave man.

                    Time assuages even
genuine grief, and it is therefore inevitable that the
semblance of grief portrayed in our speech should
vanish yet more rapidly. And if we spend too much
time over such portrayal our hearer grows weary of
his tears, takes a breathing space, and returns once
more to the rational attitude from which lie has
been distracted by the impulse of the moment.

produced to fall flat, and must consequently abandon
our appeal to the emotion just when that emotion
is at its height, nor must we expect anyone to
weep for long over another's ills. For this reason
our eloquence ought to be pitched higher in this
portion of our speech than in any other, since,

while a

                    bringing accused persons into court wearing squalid

blood-stained swords, fragments of bone taken from

                    The
impression produced by such exhibitions is generally
enormous, since they seem to bring the spectators
face to face with the cruel facts. For example, the
sight of the bloodstains on the purple-bordered toga
of Gaius Caesar, which was carried at the head of
his funeral procession, aroused the Roman people to
fury. They knew that he had been killed; they
had even seen his body stretched upon the bier:
but his garment, still wet with his blood, brought
such a vivid image of the crime before their minds,
that Caesar seemed not to have been murdered, but
to be being murdered before their very eyes.

would not for this reason go so far as to approve a
practice of which I have read, and which indeed I
have occasionally witnessed, of bringing into court
a picture of the crime painted on wood or canvas,
that the judge might be stirred to fury by the
horror of the sight. For the pleader who prefers
a voiceless picture to speak for him in place of his
own eloquence must be singularly incompetent.

                    On
the other hand, I know that the wearing of mourning and the presentation of an unkempt appearance,
and the introduction of relatives similarly arrayed,
has proved of value, and that entreaties have been
of great service to save the accused from condemnation. The practice therefore of appealing to the
judges by all that is near and dear to them will be
                    <pb id="p.405"/>

                    Invocation of the
gods, again, usually gives the impression that the
speaker is conscious of the justice of his cause, while
it may produce a good effect if the accused throws
himself on the ground and embraces the knees of
the judges, unless his character, his past life and
station prohibit a resort to this device: for there are
some acts which require to be defended with no less
boldness than was required for their commission. But
we must take care not to carry matters with too
high a hand, for fear of creating a bad impression
by an appearance of over-confidence.

always be employed. Thus they would have been out of
place in the case of Milo, whose character was such that it
was necessary to defend him with a boldness worthy of the
boldness required to perform the deed of which he was

of affairs than that Murena should assume the consulship on the thirty-first of December. This form of
appeal is now, however, almost entirely obsolete,

                    It is also worth while pointing out that, in my
opinion, the manner in which the client whose
sorrows we parade before the court conforms his
behaviour to the methods of his advocate is of the
utmost importance. For sometimes our appeal falls
flat owing to the ignorance, rusticity, indifference or
uncouthness of our client, and it is consequently
most important that the advocate should take all
necessary precautions in this connexion.

                    I have
often seen clients whose behaviour was wholly out
of keeping with the line adopted by their counsel,
since their expression showed not the slightest
emotion, while they displayed a most unseasonable
cheerfulness and even aroused laughter by their
looks or actions; such incongruity is especially frequent when the appeal is of a theatrical character.

                    On one occasion an advocate produced a girl alleged
to be the sister of the opposing party (for it was on
this point that the dispute turned) and led her
across to the benches occupied by his opponents as
though to leave her in the arms of her brother: I however had given tile brother timely warning and he had
left his seat. The advocate, although as a rule an
eloquent speaker, was struck dumb by the unexpected
turn of events and took his little girl back again in
the tamest possible manner.

the duty of handing in the portrait had no idea

                    of the nature of a peroration and displayed it whenever the advocate looked their way, and when at last
it was produced at the proper moment it destroyed
all the good effect of his previous eloquence by its
hideousness, for it was a wax cast taken from an old

                    We are also familiar with the story

warning as to the perils which beset the peroration
is the story told by Cicero

who have no difficulty in changing their line of
pleading. Those however who cannot get away
from what they have written, are reduced to silence
by such emergencies or else led into making false
statements, as for instance if an advocate should say,
                    <quote>He stretches out suppliant hands to embrace your knees,</quote>
                    or
                    <quote>The unhappy man is locked in the embrace of his children,</quote>

                    Such faults are due to the
practice of the schools, where we are free to feign
what we will with impunity, because we are at
liberty to invent facts. But this is impossible when
we are confronted with realities, and it was an
excellent remark that Cassius made to a young
orator who said,
                    <quote>Why do you look so fiercely at me, Severus?</quote>
                    To which he replied,

                    There is one point which it is specially important to
                    <pb id="p.411"/>
                    remember, that we should never attempt to move our
audience to tears without drawing on all the resources
of our eloquence. For while this form of emotional
appeal is the most effective of all, when successful,
its failure results in anti-climax, and if the pleader is
a feeble speaker he would have been wiser to leave
the pathos of the situation to the imagination of the
judges.
                    <milestone n="45" unit="section"/>
                    For look and voice and even the expression
on the face of the accused to which the attention of
the court is drawn will generally awaken laughter
where they fail to awaken compassion. Therefore
the pleader must measure and make a careful
estimate of his powers, and must have a just comprehension of the difficulty of the task which he
contemplates. For there is no halfway house in such
matters between tears and laughter.

                    The task of the peroration is not however confined
to exciting pity in the judges: it may also be required to dispel the pity which they feel, either by
a set speech designed to recall them from their tears
to a consideration of the justice of the case, or by a
few witticisms such as,
                    <quote>Give the boy some bread to stop him crying,</quote>
                    or the remark made by counsel
to a corpulent client, whose opponent, a mere child,
had been carried round the court by his advocate,
                    <quote>What am I to do? I can't carry you!</quote>
                    <milestone n="47" unit="section"/>
                    Such
jests should not however descend to buffoonery.
Consequently I cannot give my approval to the
orator, although he was one of the most distinguished speakers of his day, who, when his opponent
brought in some children to enhance the effect of
his peroration, threw some dice among them, with
the result that they began to scramble for them.
For their childish ignorance of the perils with which
                    <pb id="p.413"/>
                    they were threatened might in itself have awakened
compassion.

                    For the same reason I cannot commend
the advocate who, when his opponent the accuser
produced a bloodstained sword in court, fled suddenly
from the benches as though in an agony of terror,
and then, when his turn came to plead, peeped out
of the crowd with his head half covered by his robe
and asked whether the man with the sword had
gone away. For though he caused a laugh, he made
himself ridiculous.

                    Still, theatrical effects of the
kind we are discussing can be dispelled by the
power of eloquence. Cicero provides most admirable
examples of the way in which this may be done both
in the

                    where he attacks the production
in court of the portrait of Saturninus in the most
dignified language, and in the
                    <hi rend="italics">pro Vareno</hi>
                    where he
launches a number of witticisms against a youth

                    There are also milder kinds of peroration in which,
if our opponent is of such a character that he deserves to be treated with respect, we strive to
ingratiate ourselves with him or give him some
friendly warning or urge him to regard us as his
friends. This method was admirably employed by
Passienus when he pleaded in a suit brought by his
wife Domitia against her brother Ahenobarbus for
the recovery of a sum of money: he began by
making a number of remarks about the relationship
of the two parties and then, referring to their
wealth, which was in both cases enormous, added,
                    <quote>There is nothing either of you need less than the subject of this dispute.</quote>

                    All these appeals to emotion, although some hold
                    <pb id="p.415"/>
                    that they should be confined to the exordium and
the peroration, which are, I admit, the places where
they are most often used, may be employed in other
portions of the speech as well, but more briefly, since
most of them must be reserved for the opening or
the close. But it is in tile peroration, if anywhere,
that we must let loose the whole torrent of our
eloquence.
                    <milestone n="52" unit="section"/>
                    For, if we have spoken well in the rest
of our speech, we shall now have the judges on our
side, and shall be in a position, now that we have
emerged from the reefs and shoals, to spread all our
canvas, while since the chief task of the peroration
consists of amplification, we may legitimately make
free use of words and reflexions that are magnificent
and ornate. It is at the close of our drama that we
must really stir the theatre, when we have reached
the place for the phrase with which the old tragedies
and comedies used to end,
                    <quote>Friends, give us your applause.</quote>

                    In other portions of the speech we must appeal
to the emotions as occasion may arise. For it would
clearly be wrong to set forth facts calling for horror
and pity without any such appeal, while, if the
question arises as to the quality of any fact, such
an appeal may justifiably be subjoined to the proofs
of the fact in question.

                    When we are pleading a
complicated case which is really made up of several
cases, it will be necessary to introduce a number of
passages resembling perorations, as Cicero does in
the
                    <hi rend="italics">Vetrines,</hi>
                    where he laments over Philodamus, the
ships' captains, the crucifixion of the Roman citizen,
and a number of other tragic incidents.

                    I should regard them rather as

                    than as
                    <hi rend="italics">parts</hi>
                    of the peroration, since the terms epilogue and
peroration both clearly indicate that they form the
conclusion of a speech.

                    II. The peroration is the most important part of
forensic pleading, and in the main consists of appeals
to the emotions, concerning which I have consequently been forced to say something. But I
have not yet been able to give the topic specific
consideration as a whole, nor should I have been
justified in doing so. We have still, therefore,
to discuss a task which forms tile most powerful
means of obtaining what we desire, and is also
more difficult than any of those which we have
previously considered, namely that of stirring the
emotions of the judges, and of moulding and
transforming them to the attitude which we
desire.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    The few remarks which I have already
made on this subject were only such as were
essential to my theme, while my purpose was rather
to show what ought to be done than to set forth the
manner in which we can secure our aim. I must
now review the whole subject in a more exhaustive
fashion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is scope for an appeal to the emotions, as
I have already said,1 in every portion of a speech.
Moreover these emotions present great variety, and
demand more than cursory treatment, since it is in
their handling that the power of oratory shews itself
at its highest. Even a slight and limited talent may,
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    with the assistance of practice or learning, perhaps
succeed in giving life to other departments of oratory,
and in developing them to a serviceable extent. At
any rate there are, and have always been, a
                    <pb id="p.419"/>
                    considerable number of pleaders capable of discovering
arguments adequate to prove their points. I am far
from despising such, but I consider that their utility
is restricted to providing the judge with such facts
as it is necessary for him to know, and, to be quite
frank, I regard them merely as suitable persons to
instruct pleaders of real eloquence in the facts of
a case. But few indeed are those orators who can
sweep the judge with them, lead him to adopt
that attitude of mind which they desire, and compel
him to weep with them or share their anger.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    And
yet it is this emotional power that dominates
the court, it is this form of eloquence that is the
queen of all. For as a rule arguments arise out of
the case itself, and the better cause has always the
larger number to support it, so that the party who
wills by means of them will have no further satisfaction than that of knowing that his advocate did not
fail him.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    But the peculiar task of the orator arises
when the minds of the judges require force to move
them, and their thoughts have actually to be led away
from the contemplation of the truth. No instruction
from the litigant can secure this, nor can such power
be acquired merely by the study of a brief. Proofs, it
is true, may induce the judges to regard our case
as superior to that of our opponent, but the appeal
to the emotions will do more, for it will make them
wish our case to be the better. And what they
wish, they will also believe.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    For as soon as they
begin to be angry, to feel favourably disposed, to
hate or pity, they begin to take a personal interest
in the case, and just as lovers are incapable of
forming a reasoned judgment on the beauty of the
object of their affections, because passion forestalls
                    <pb id="p.421"/>
                    the sense of sight, so the judge, when overcome by
his emotions, abandons all attempt to enquire into
the truth of the arguments, is swept along by the
tide of passion, and yields himself unquestioning to
the torrent.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Thus the verdict of the court shows
how much weight has been carried by the arguments
and the evidence; but when the judge has been
really moved by the orator he reveals his feelings
while he is still sitting and listening to the case.
When those tears, which are the aim of most perorations, well forth from his eyes, is he not giving his
verdict for all to see? It is to this, therefore, that
the orator must devote all his powers,

                    Emotions however, as we learn from ancient

                    (emotion): the other is
called

                    a word for which in my opinion Latin has
no equivalent: it is however rendered
                    <hi rend="italics">by mores</hi>
                    (morals)
and consequently the branch of philosophy known as
                    <hi rend="italics">ethics</hi>
                    is styled

                    in general that is meant as certain peculiar
aspects; for the term
                    <hi rend="italics">morals</hi>
                    includes every attitude
of the mind. The more cautious writers have preferred to give the sense of the term rather than to
translate it into Latin. They therefore explain
                    <hi rend="italics">pathos</hi>
                    <pb id="p.423"/>
                    as describing the more violent emotions and
                    <hi rend="italics">ethos</hi>
                    as
designating those which are calm and gentle: in the
one case the passions are violent, in the other subdued, the former command and disturb, the latter
persuade and induce a feeling of goodwill.

                    <hi rend="italics">pathos</hi>
                    is momentary. While admitting that this is usually the ease,
I still hold that there are some subjects which
demand that the more violent emotion should be
continuous. But, although the gentler emotions
require less force and impetus, they call for no less
art and experience than the more vehement, and are
demanded in a greater number of cases, indeed in a
certain sense they are required in all.

                    For as everything treated by the orator may be regarded from
the ethical standpoint, we may apply the word
                    <hi rend="italics">ethos</hi>
                    whenever he speaks of what is honourable and expedient or of what ought or ought not to be done.

to our approval by goodness more than aught else

                    ingratiating and courteous and such as to excite
pleasure and affection in our hearers, while the chief
merit in its expression lies in making it seem that
all that we say derives directly from the nature of
the facts and persons concerned and in the revelation of the character of the orator in such a way that
all may recognise it.

                    This kind of
                    <hi rend="italics">ethos</hi>
                    should be
especially displayed in cases where the persons concerned are intimately connected, whenever we
tolerate or pardon any act or offer satisfaction or
admonition, in all of which cases there should be no
trace of anger or hatred. On the other hand the
moderation shown by a father to his son, a guardian
to his ward or a husband to his wife will differ from
that which is shown by an old man to a youthful
stranger who has insulted him or by a man of high
rank to his inferior, since in the former cases they
emphasise their affection for the wrongdoer and
there is no desire to do anything that will excite
dislike against them save by the manifestation of
the fact that they still love them; while in the one
case the offended party should be no more than provoked, in the other he should he really deeply moved.
Of the same character, though less violent,

amour. Sometimes again gentle raillery of another's
passion may derive its tone from
                    <hi rend="italics">ethos,</hi>
                    though only
to a partial extent. More closely dependent on

                    are the skilful exercise of feigned emotion or the
employment of irony in making apologies or asking
questions, irony being the term which is applied to
words which mean something other than they seem
to express.

                    more powerful method of exciting hatred, when by
a feigned submission to our opponents we pass silent
censure on their violence. For the very fact of our
yielding serves to demonstrate their insupportable
arrogance, while orators who have a passion for abuse
or are given to affect freedom of speech fail to realise
that it is a far more effective course to make your
antagonist unpopular than to abuse him. For the
former course makes our antagonists disliked, the
latter ourselves.

                    The emotion of love and longing
for our friends and connexions is perhaps of an intermediate character, being stronger than

                    in all its forms requires the speaker to
be a man of good character and courtesy. For it is
most important that he should himself possess or be
thought to possess those virtues for the possession of
which it is his duty, if possible, to commend his client
as well, while the excellence of his own character
will make his pleading all the more convincing and
will be of the utmost service to the cases which he
undertakes. For the orator who gives the impression of being a bad man while he is speaking, is
actually speaking badly, since his words seem to be
insincere owing to the absence of
                    <hi rend="italics">ethos</hi>
                    which would

                    of the Greeks, which we correctly
translate by
                    <hi rend="italics">emotion,</hi>
                    is of a different character, and
I cannot better indicate the nature of the difference
than by saying that
                    <hi rend="italics">ethos</hi>
                    rather resembles comedy
and
                    <hi rend="italics">pathos</hi>
                    tragedy. For
                    <hi rend="italics">pathos</hi>
                    is almost entirely
concerned with anger, dislike, fear, hatred and pity.
It will be obvious to all what topics are appropriate
to such appeals and I have already spoken on the
subject in discussing the exordium and the peroration.

                    I wish however to point out that fear is of
two kinds, that which we feel and that which we
cause in others. Similarly there are two kinds of
                    <hi rend="italics">invidia</hi>
                    (hatred, envy), to which the two adjectives
                    <hi rend="italics">invidus</hi>
                    (envious) and
                    <hi rend="italics">invidious</hi>
                    (invidious, hateful)
correspond. The first supplies an epithet for persons,
the second for things, and it is in this latter connexion that the orator's task is even more onerous.
For though some things are hateful in themselves
such as parricide, murder, poisoning, other things
have to be made to seem hateful.

                    This latter contingency arises when we attempt to shew that what
we have suffered is of a more horrible nature than
what are usually regarded as great evils. Vergil will
provide an example in the lines

                    Again the same problem arises when we endeavour to magnify our wrongs by saying that other
far lesser ills are intolerable;

                    Meanwhile
I will content myself with the observation that the
aim of appeals to the emotion is not merely to slew
the bitter and grievous nature of ills that actually
are so, but also to make ills which are usually regarded as tolerable seem unendurable, as for instance
when we represent insulting words as inflicting more
grievous injury than an actual blow or represent
disgrace as being worse than death.
                    <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>
                    For the force
of eloquence is such that it not merely compels the
judge to the conclusion toward which the nature of
the facts lead him, but awakens emotions which
either do not naturally arise from the case or are
stronger than the case would suggest. This is known
as

                    If I thought it sufficient to follow traditional rules,
I should regard it as adequate treatment for this
topic to omit nothing that I have read or been
taught, provided that it be reasonably sound. But
my design is to bring to light the secret principles
of this art, and to open up the inmost recesses of
the subject, giving the result not of teaching received from others, but of my own experience and
the guidance of nature herself.
                    <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>
                    The prime essential
for stirring the emotions of others is, in my opinion,
                    <pb id="p.433"/>
                    first to feel those emotions oneself. It is sometimes
positively ridiculous to counterfeit grief, anger and
indignation, if we content ourselves with accommodating our words and looks and make no attempt
to adapt our own feelings to the emotions to be
expressed. What other reason is there for the
eloquence with which mourners express their grief;
or for the fluency which anger lends even to the
uneducated, save the fact that their minds are
stirred to power by the depth and sincerity of their
feelings? Consequently,
                    <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>
                    if we wish to give our
words the appearance of sincerity, we must assimilate
ourselves to the emotions of those who are genuinely
so affected, and our eloquence must spring from the
same feeling that we desire to produce in the mind
of the judge. Will he grieve who can find no trace
of grief in the words with which I seek to move
him to grief? Will he be angry, if the orator who
seeks to kindle his anger shows no sign of labouring
under the emotion which he demands from his
audience? Will he shed tears if the pleader's eyes
are dry? It is utterly impossible.
                    <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>
                    Fire alone can
kindle, and moisture alone can wet, nor can one
thing impart any colour to another save that which
it possesses itself. Accordingly, the first essential
is that those feelings should prevail with us that
we wish to prevail with the judge, and that we
should be moved ourselves before we attempt to
move others.
                    <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>
                    But how are we to generate these
emotions in ourselves, since emotion is not in our
own power? I will try to explain as best I may. There
are certain experiences which the Greeks call
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">fantasi/ai,</foreign>
                    and the Romans
                    <hi rend="italics">visions,</hi>
                    whereby things absent
are presented to our imagination with such extreme
                    <pb id="p.435"/>
                    vividness that they seem actually to be before
our very eyes.
                    <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>
                    It is the man who is really sensitive to such impressions who will have the greatest
power over the emotions. Some writers describe
the possessor of this power of vivid imagination,
whereby things, words and actions are presented
in the most realistic manner, by the Greek word
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">eu)fantasi/wtos</foreign>
                    and it is a power which all may
readily acquire if they will. When the mind is unoccupied or is absorbed by fantastic hopes or daydreams, we are haunted by these visions of which
I am speaking to such an extent that we imagine
that we are travelling abroad, crossing the sea, fighting, addressing the people, or enjoying the use of
wealth that we do not actually possess, and seem
to ourselves not to be dreaming but acting. Surely,
then, it may be possible to turn this form of hallucination to some profit.

hiding-place, the victim tremble, cry for help, beg
for mercy, or turn to run? Shall I not see the fatal
blow delivered and the stricken body fall? Will
not the blood, the deathly pallor, the groan of
agony, the death-rattle, be indelibly impressed upon
my mind?

                    we must
actually believe that the ills of which we complain
have befallen our own selves, and must persuade
our minds that this is really the case. We must
identify ourselves with the persons of whom we
complain that they have suffered grievous, unmerited
and bitter misfortune, and must plead their case and
for a brief space feel their suffering as though it
were our own, while our words must be such as we
should use if we stood in their shoes.

                    I have often
seen actors, both in tragedy and comedy, leave the
theatre still drowned in tears after concluding the
performance of some moving role. But if the mere
delivery of words written by another has the power
to set our souls on fire with fictitious emotions, what
will the orator do whose duty it is to picture to
himself the facts and who has it in his power to feel
the same emotion as his client whose interests are
at stake?

                    Even in the schools it is desirable that
the student should be moved by his theme, and
should imagine it to be true; indeed, it is all the
more desirable then, since, as a rule in scholastic
                    <pb id="p.439"/>
                    declamations, the speaker more often appears as the
actual litigant than as his advocate. Suppose we are
impersonating an orphan, a shipwrecked man, or one
in grave peril. What profit is there in assuming
such a rôle unless we also assume the emotions
which it involves? I have thought it necessary not
to conceal these considerations from my reader, since
they have contributed to the acquisition of such
reputation for talent as I possess or once possessed.
I have frequently been so much moved while speaking, that I have not merely been wrought upon to
tears, but have turned pale and shown all the
symptoms of genuine grief.

                    I now turn to a very different talent, namely
that which dispels the graver emotions of the judge
by exciting his laughter, frequently diverts his attention from the facts of the case, and sometimes even
refreshes him and revives him when he has begun
to be bored or wearied by the case. How hard it
is to attain success in this connexion is shown by
the cases of the two great masters of Greek and
Roman oratory.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    For many think that Demosthenes
was deficient in this faculty, and that Cicero used
it without discrimination. Indeed, it is impossible
to suppose that Demosthenes deliberately avoided
all display of humour, since his few jests are so
unworthy of his other excellences that they clearly
show that he lacked the power, not merely that he
disliked to use it.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Cicero, on the other hand, was
regarded as being unduly addicted to jests, not
merely outside the courts, but in his actual speeches
as well. Personally (though whether I am right in
this view, or have been led astray by an exaggerated
admiration for the prince of orators, I cannot say),
                    <pb id="p.441"/>
                    I regard him as being the possessor of a remarkable
turn of wit. For his daily speech was full of humour,
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    while in his disputes in court and in his examination
of witnesses he produced more good jests than any
other, while the somewhat insipid jokes which he
launches against Verres are always attributed by him
to others and produced as evidence: wherefore, the
more vulgar they are, the more probable is it that
they are not the invention of the orator, but were
current as public property. I wish, however,
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    that
Tiro, or whoever it may have been that published
the three books of Cicero's jests, had restricted their
number and had shown more judgment in selecting
than zeal in collecting them. For he would then
have been less exposed to the censure of his calumniators, although the latter will, in any case, as in
regard to all the manifestations of his genius, find
it easier to detect superfluities than deficiencies.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    The chief difficulty which confronts the orator in
this connexion lies in the fact that sayings designed
to raise a laugh are generally untrue (and falsehood
always involves a certain meanness), and are often
deliberately distorted, and, further, never complimentary: while the judgments formed by the audience
on such jests will necessarily vary, since the effect of
a jest depends not on the reason, but on an emotion
which it is difficult, if not impossible, to describe.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    For
I do not think that anybody can give an adequate
explanation, though many have attempted to do so, of
the cause of laughter, which is excited not merely
by words or deeds, but sometimes even by touch.
Moreover, there is great variety in the things which
raise a laugh, since we laugh not merely at those
words or actions which are smart or witty, but also
                    <pb id="p.443"/>
                    at those which reveal folly, anger or fear. Consequently, the cause of laughter is uncertain, since
laughter is never far removed from derision.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    For,
as Cicero

                    <quote>Laughter has its basis in some kind or other of deformity or ugliness,</quote>
                    and whereas,
when we point to such a blemish in others, the
result is known as wit, it is called folly when the
same jest is turned against ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, though laughter may be regarded as a trivial
matter, and an emotion frequently awakened by
buffoons, actors or fools, it has a certain imperious
force of its own which it is very hard to resist.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    It
often breaks out against our will and extorts confession of its power, not merely from our face and
voice, but convulses the whole body as well. Again,
it frequently turns the scale in matters of great
importance, as I have already observed:
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Where?</note>

it often dispels hatred or anger.

                    A proof of this is
given by the story of the young men of Tarentum,
who had made a number of scurrilous criticisms of
Pyrrhus over the dinner table: they were called
upon to answer for their statements, and, since the
charge was one that admitted neither of denial nor
of excuse, they succeeded in escaping, thanks to a
happy jest which made the king laugh: for one of
the accused said,
                    <quote>Yes, and if the bottle hadn't been empty, we should have killed you!</quote>
                    a jest
which succeeded in dissipating the animosity which
the charge had aroused.

                    Still, whatever the essence of humour may be, and
although I would not venture to assert that it is altogether independent of art (for it involves a certain
power of observation, and rules for its employment
have been laid down by writers both of Greece and
                    <pb id="p.445"/>
                    Rome), I will insist on this much, that it depends
mainly on nature and opportunity.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    The influence
of nature consists not merely in the fact that one
man is quicker or cleverer than another in the
invention of jests (for such a power can be increased
by teaching), but also in the possession of some
peculiar charm of look or manner, the effect of which
is such that the same remarks would be less entertaining if uttered by another.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    Opportunity, on the
other hand, is dependent on circumstances, and is of
such importance that with its assistance not merely
the unlearned, but even mere country bumpkins are
capable of producing effective witticisms: while
much again may depend on some previous remark
made by another which will provide opportunity for
repartee. For wit always appears to greater advantage in reply than in attack.
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    We are also confronted by the additional difficulty that there are
no specific exercises for the development of humour
nor professors to teach it. Consequently, while
convivial gatherings and conversation give rise to
frequent displays of wit, since daily practice develops
the faculty, oratorical wit is rare, for it has no fixed
rules to guide it, but must adapt itself to the ways
of the world.
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    There has, however, never been anything to prevent the composition of themes such as
will afford scope for humour, so that our controversial declamations may have an admixture of jests,
while special topics may be set which will give the
young student practice in the play of wit.

                    There are various names by which we describe
wit, but we have only to consider them separately
to perceive their specific meaning. First, there is
                    <hi rend="italics">urbanitas,</hi>
                    which I observe denotes language with a
smack of the city in its words, accent and idiom,
and further suggests a certain tincture of learning
derived from associating with well-educated men;
in a word, it represents the opposite of rusticity.
The meaning of
                    <hi rend="italics">venustus</hi>
                    is obvious;
                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    it means that
which is said with grace and charm.
                    <hi rend="italics">Salsus</hi>
                    is, as
a rule, applied only to what is laughable: but this
is not its natural application, although whatever is
laughable should have the salt of wit in it. For
Cicero,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">Orat.</hi>

                    </note>
                    when he says that whatever has the salt of
wit is Attic, does not say this because persons of
the Attic school are specially given to laughter;
and again when Catullus says—
                    <quote rend="blockquote">

                    </quote>
                    he does not mean that there is nothing in her body to
give cause for laughter.
                    <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    When, therefore, we speak
of the salt of wit, we refer to wit about which there
is nothing insipid, wit, that is to say, which serves
as a simple seasoning of language, a condiment which
is silently appreciated by our judgment, as food is
appreciated by the palate, with the result that it
stimulates our taste and saves a speech from becoming tedious. But just as salt, if sprinkled freely
over food, gives a special relish of its own, so long
as it is not used to excess, so in the case of those
who have the salt of wit there is something about
                    <pb id="p.449"/>
                    their language which arouses in us a thirst to hear.
Again, I do not regard the epithet
                    <hi rend="italics">facelus</hi>
                    as applicable solely to that which raises a laugh.

                    If that

I think that the term is rather applied to a certain
grace and polished elegance. This is the meaning
which it bears in Cicero's letters, where he quotes
the words of Brutus,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">This letter is lost.</note>

meaning suits the passage in Horace,

                    is usually taken to mean
the opposite of seriousness. This view is, however,
somewhat too narrow. For to feign, to terrify, or to

                    <hi rend="italics">Dicacitas</hi>
                    is no doubt derived from

                    and is therefore
common to all forms of wit, but is specially applied
to the language of banter, which is a humorous form
of attack. Therefore, while the critics allow that
Demosthenes was
                    <hi rend="italics">urbanus,</hi>
                    they deny that he was

                    The essence, however, of the subject which we
are now discussing is the excitement of laughter,
and consequently the whole of this topic is entitled
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">peri\ geloi/ou</foreign>
                    by the Greeks. It has the same primary
division as other departments of oratory, that is to

                    <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                    The
application of humour to oratory may be divided
into three heads: for there are three things out of
which we may seek to raise a laugh, to wit, others,
ourselves, or things intermediate. In the first case
we either reprove or refute or make light of or
retort or deride the arguments of others. In the
                    <pb id="p.451"/>
                    second we speak of things which concern ourselves in a humorous manner and, to quote the
words of Cicero,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi>

                    </note>
                    say things which have a suggestion of absurdity. For there are certain sayings
which are regarded as folly if they slip from us
unawares, but as witty if uttered ironically.
                    <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>
                    The
third kind consists, as Cicero also tells us, in cheating
expectations, in taking words in a different sense
from what was intended, and in other things which
affect neither party to the suit, and which I have,
therefore, styled intermediate.
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    Further, things designed to raise a laugh may either be said or done.
In the latter case laughter is sometimes caused by
an act possessing a certain element of seriousness
as well, as in the case of Marcus Caelius the praetor,
who, when the consul Isauricus broke his curule
chair, had another put in its place, the seat of which
was made of leather thongs, by way of allusion to
the story that the consul had once been scourged
by his father: sometimes, again, it is aroused by
an act which passes the grounds of decency, as in
the case of Caelius' box,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">cp. Pro Cael</hi>
                        xxix. 69. There is no jest in this passage
which lays itself open to such censure. The jest must have
consisted in some action on the part of the orator.
                    </note>
                    a jest which was not fit
for an orator or any respectable man to make.
                    <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>
                    On
the other hand the joke may lie in some remark
about a ridiculous look or gesture; such jests are
very attractive, more especially when delivered with
every appearance of seriousness; for there are no
jests so insipid as those which parade the fact that
they are intended to be witty. Still, although the
gravity with which a jest is uttered increases its
attraction, and the mere fact that the speaker does
not laugh himself makes his words laughable, there
is also such a thing as a humorous look, manner or
                    <pb id="p.453"/>
                    gesture, provided always that they observe the happy
mean. Further, a jest will either be free and lively,
like the majority of those uttered by Aulus Galba,
or abusive, like those with which Junius Bassus
recently made us familiar, or bitter, like those of
Cassius Severus, or gentle, like those of Domitius
Afer.
                    <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>
                    Much depends on the occasion on which a
jest is uttered. For in social gatherings and the intercourse of every day a certain freedom is not unseemly
in persons of humble rank, while liveliness is becoming to all. Our jests should never be designed
to wound, and we should never make it our ideal
to lose a friend sooner than lose a jest. Where the
battles of the courts are concerned I am always
better pleased when it is possible to indulge in
gentle raillery, although it is, of course, permissible
to be abusive or bitter in the words we use against
our opponents, just as it is permissible to accuse
them openly of crime, and to demand the last penalty
of the law. But in the courts as elsewhere it is
regarded as inhuman to hit a man when he is down,
either because he is the innocent victim of misfortune or because such attacks may recoil on those
who make them. Consequently, the first points to
be taken into consideration are who the speaker
is, what is the nature of the case, who is the judge,
who is the victim, and what is the character of
the remarks that are made.

                    It is most unbecoming
for an orator to distort his features or use uncouth
gestures, tricks that arouse such merriment in farce.
No less unbecoming are ribald jests, and such as
are employed upon the stage. As for obscenity, it
should not merely be banished from his language,
but should not even be suggested. For even if our
                    <pb id="p.455"/>
                    opponent has rendered himself liable to such a
charge, our denunciation should not take the form
of a jest.

                    Further, although I want my orator to
speak with wit, he must not give the impression of
striving after it. Consequently lie must not display
his wit on every possible occasion, but must sacrifice
a jest sooner than sacrifice his dignity.
                    <milestone n="31" unit="section"/>
                    Again, no
one will endure an accuser who employs jests to
season a really horrible case, nor an advocate for the
defence who makes merry over one that calls for pity.
Moreover, there is a type of judge whose temperament is too serious to allow him to tolerate laughter.
                    <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>
                    It may also happen that a jest directed against an
opponent may apply to the judge or to our own client,
although there are some orators who do not refrain
even from jests that may recoil upon themselves.
This was the case with Sulpicius Longus, who,
despite the fact that he was himself surpassingly
hideous, asserted of a man against whom he was
appearing in a case involving his status as a free
man, that even his face was the face of a slave. To
this Domitius Afer replied,
                    <quote>Is it your profound conviction, Longus, that an ugly man must be a slave?</quote>
                    <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>
                    Insolence and arrogance are likewise to
be avoided, nor must our jests seem unsuitable to
the time or place, or give the appearance of studied
premeditation, or smell of the lamp, while those
directed against the unfortunate are, as I have
already said, inhuman. Again, some advocates are
men of such established authority and such known
respectability, that any insolence shown them
would only hurt the assailant. As regards the
way in which we should deal with friends I have
already given instructions.

                    It is the duty not merely
                    <pb id="p.457"/>
                    of an orator, but of any reasonable human being,
when attacking one whom it is dangerous to offend
to take care that his remarks do not end in exciting
serious enmity, or the necessity for a grovelling
apology. Sarcasm that applies to a number of
persons is injudicious: I refer to cases where it is
directed against whole nations or classes of society,
or against rank and pursuits which are common to
many.

                    A good man will see that everything he

                    It is, however, a difficult task to indicate the
sources from which laughter may be legitimately
derived or the topics where it may be naturally employed. To attempt to deal exhaustively with the
subject would be an interminable task and a waste
of labour.
                    <milestone n="36" unit="section"/>
                    For the topics suitable to jests are no

                    as they are called, and are, moreover,
identical with the latter. The powers of invention
and expression come into play no less where jests
are concerned, while as regards expression its force
will depend in part on the choice of words, in part
on the figures employed.
                    <milestone n="37" unit="section"/>
                    Laughter then will be
derived either from the physical appearance of our
opponent or from his character as revealed in his
words and actions, or from external sources; for all
forms of raillery come under one or other of these
heads; if the raillery is serious, we style it as
severe; if, on the other hand, it is of a lighter
character, we regard it as humorous. These themes
for jest may be pointed out to the eye or described

                    The narration of a
humorous story may often be used with clever effect
and is a device eminently becoming to an orator.
Good examples are the story told of Caepasius and
Fabricius, which Cicero tells in the
                    <hi rend="italics">pro Cluentio,</hi>
                    or
the story told by Caelius of the dispute between
Decimus Laelius and his colleague when they were
both in a hurry to reach their province first. But
in all such cases the whole narrative must possess
elegance and charm, while the orator's own contribution to the story should be the most humorous
element. Take for instance the way in which Cicero
gives a special relish to the flight of Fabricius.

                    thinks that humour belongs to narrative and wit to
sallies against the speaker's antagonist. Domitius
Afer showed remarkable finish in this department;
for, while narratives of the kind I have described
are frequent in his speeches, several books have been
published of his witticisms as well.

                    Brutus was prosecuting Cnaeus Plancus and had

                    to show that Lucius Crassus,
who was counsel for the defence, in the speech
which he delivered on the subject of the colony of
Narbo had advocated measures contrary to those
which he recommended in speaking of the Servilian
law. Crassus, in reply, called for three readers and
gave them the dialogues of Brutus' father to read
out. One of these dialogues was represented as
taking place on his estate at Privernum, the second
on his estate at Alba, and the third on his estate at
Tibur. Crassus then asked where these estates were.
Now Brutus had sold them all, and in those days it
was considered somewhat discreditable to sell one's
                    <pb id="p.463"/>
                    paternal acres. Similar attractive effects of narrative

                    On the other hand brevity in wit gives greater
point and speed. It may be employed in two ways,
according as we are the aggressors, or are replying
to our opponents; the method, however, in both
cases is to some extent the same. For there is
nothing that can be said in attack that cannot
be used in riposte.
                    <milestone n="46" unit="section"/>
                    But there are certain points
which are peculiar to reply. For remarks designed
for attack are usually brought ready-made into
court, after long thought at home, whereas those
made in reply are usually improvised during a dispute or the cross-examination of witnesses. But
though there are many topics on which we may
draw for our jests, I must repeat that not all these
topics are becoming to orators:

                    and obscenity, such as is dear to the Atellan
farce, are to be avoided, as also are those coarse
jibes so common on the lips of the rabble, where
the ambiguity of words is turned to the service of
abuse. I cannot even approve of a similar from of
jest, that sometimes slipped out even from Cicero,
though not when he was pleading in the courts:
for example, once when a candidate, alleged to be
the son of a cook, solicited someone else's vote in
his presence, he said,
                    <hi rend="italics">Ego quoque tibi favebo.</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        The pun is untranslatable, turning as it does on the
similarity of sound between
                        <hi rend="italics">coque</hi>
                        and
                        <hi rend="italics">quoque,</hi>
                        so that the
sentence might mean either
                        <hi rend="italics">I will support you, cook, or I too will support you.</hi>

                    I say
this not because I object absolutely to all play on
words capable of two different meanings, but because
such jests are rarely effective, unless they are helped
out by actual facts as well as similarity of sound.

rushing to and fro while he was pleading, waving
his hands, letting his toga fall and replacing it, was
not merely pleading, but giving himself a lot of
needless trouble.

                    Sometimes, however, a lucky

such jests with effect, as for instance when Cicero

                    We may note therefore that jests which turn on
the meaning of things are at once more pointed and
more elegant. In such cases resemblances between
things produce the best effects, more especially
if we refer to something of an inferior or more trivial
nature, as in the jests of which our forefathers were
so fond, when they called Lentulus Spinther and
Scipio Serapio.

                    But such jests may be drawn not
merely from the names of men, but from animals as
well; for example when I was a boy, Junius Bassus,
one of the wittiest of men, was nicknamed the white

                    Still more ingenious is the application of
one thing to another on the ground of some resemblance, that is to say the adaptation to one thing of
a circumstance which usually applies to something
else, a type of jest which we may regard as being an
ingenious form of fiction. For example, when ivory
models of captured towns were carried in Caesar's
triumphal procession, and a few days later wooden
models of the same kind were carried at the triumph
of Fabius Maximus,

                    I
need say no more on this form of humour. But the
practice of combining different types of jest is very
common, and those are best which are of this composite character. A like use may be made of dissimilarity. Thus a Roman knight was once drinking
at tile games, and Augustus sent him the following
message,
                    <quote>If I want to dine, I go home.</quote>
                    To which

                    Contraries give rise to more than
one kind of jest. For instance the following jests
made by Augustus and Galba differ in form. Augustus
was engaged in dismissing an officer with dishonour
from his service: the officer kept interrupting him
with entreaties and said,
                    <quote>What shall I say to my father?</quote>
                    Augustus replied,
                    <quote>Tell him that I fell under your displeasure.</quote>
                    Galba, when a friend asked
him for the loan of a cloak, said,
                    <quote>I cannot lend it you, as I am going to stay at home,</quote>
                    the point being
that the rain was pouring through the roof of his
garret at the time. I will add a third example,
although out of respect to its author I withhold his
name:
                    <quote>You are more lustful than a eunuch,</quote>
                    where
we are surprised by the appearance of a word which
is the very opposite of what we should have expected.
Under the same heading, although it is quite
different from any of the preceding, we must place
the remark made by Marcus Vestinus when it was
reported to him that a certain man was dead.
                    <quote>Some day then he will cease to stink,</quote>

to make fun of folly, for folly is laughable in itself;
but we may improve such jests by adding something

to Campatius, who was leaving the theatre, when he
asked him if he had been watching the play.

                    Refutation consists in denying, rebutting, defending or making light of a charge, and each of these
affords scope for humour. Manius Curius, for example,
showed humour in the way in which he denied a
charge that had been brought against him. His
accuser had produced a canvas, in every scene of
which he was depicted either as naked and in prison
or as being restored to freedom by his friends paying
off his gambling debts. His only comment was,
                    <quote>Did I never win, then?</quote>

                    Sometimes we rebut a

                    charge openly, as Cicero did when he refuted the
extravagant lies of Vibius Curius about his age:
                    <quote>Well, then,</quote>
                    he remarked,
                    <quote>
                        in the days when you

                    At other times we may rebut
it by pretending to agree. Cicero, for example, when
Fabia the wife of Dolabella asserted that her age was
thirty, remarked,
                    <quote>That is true, for I have heard it for the last twenty years.</quote>

                    Sometimes too it is
effective to add something more biting in place of
the charge which is denied, as was done by Junius
Bassus when Domitia the wife of Passienus

                    complained that by way of accusing her of meanness he

                    A witty travesty of defence

                    As regards making light of a charge, there
are two ways in which this may be done. We may
throw cold water on the excessive boasted of our
opponent, as was done by Gaius Caesar,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">A cousin of the father of C. Julius Caesar.</note>
                    when Pomponius displayed a wound in his face which he had
received in the rebellion of Sulpicius and which he
boasted he had received while fighting for Caesar:
                    <quote>You should never look round,</quote>
                    he retorted,
                    <quote>when you are running away.</quote>
                    Or we may do the same
with some charge that is brought against us, as was
done by Cicero when he remarked to those who
reproached him for marrying Publilia, a young unwedded girl, when he was already over sixty,
                    <quote>Well, she will be a woman to-morrow.</quote>

                    and, on the ground that both
                    <pb id="p.481"/>
                    jests seem to follow so naturally and inevitably, class
it with the jest which Cicero levelled against Curio,
who always began his speeches by asking indulgence
for his youth:
                    <quote>You will find your exordium easier every day,</quote>
                    he said.
                    <milestone n="77" unit="section"/>
                    Another method of making
light of a statement is to suggest a reason. Cicero
employed this method against Vatinius. The latter
was lame and, wishing to make it seem that his health
was improved, said that he could now walk as much
as two miles.
                    <quote>Yes,</quote>
                    said Cicero,
                    <quote>for the days are longer.</quote>
                    Again Augustus, when the inhabitants of
Tarraco reported that a palm had sprung up on the
altar dedicated to him, replied,
                    <quote>That shows how often you kindle fire upon it.</quote>

                    Cassius Severus
showed his wit by transferring a charge made against
himself to a different quarter. For when lie was
reproached by the praetor on the ground that his
advocates had insulted Lucius Varus, an Epicurean
and a friend of Caesar, he replied,
                    <quote>I do not know who they were who insulted him, I suppose they were Stoics.</quote>

                    Of retorts there are a number of forms, the wittiest
being that which is helped out by a certain verbal
similarity, as in the retort made by Trachalus to
Suelius. The latter had said,
                    <quote>If that is the case, you go into exile</quote>
                    : to which Trachalus replied,

                    Cassius Severus baffled an opponent who reproached
him with the fact that Proculeius had forbidden him
to enter his house by replying,
                    <quote>Do I ever go there?</quote>
                    But one jest may also be defeated by another: for
example, Augustus of blessed memory, when the
Gauls gave him a golden necklet weighing a hundred
pounds, and Dolabella, speaking in jest but with an
                    <pb id="p.483"/>
                    eye to the success of his jest, said,
                    <quote>General, give me your necklet,</quote>
                    replied,
                    <quote>I had rather give you the crown of oak leaves.</quote>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        The civic crown of oak leaves was given as a reward for
saving the life of a fellow-citizen in war. The

                        was
often given as a reward for valour, and Augustus pretends
to believe that Dolabella had asked for a military decoration.
The point lies in the contrast between the intrinsic value and
weight of the two decorations. Further, Augustus was very
parsimonious in bestowing military decorations and had himself received the crown of oak leaves from the senate as the
saviour of Rome, a fact which must have rendered its bestowal on others rare, if not non-existent.

                    So, too, one lie may be

someone told him that he once bought a lamprey
five feet long for half a denarius in Sicily, replied,
                    <quote>
                        There is nothing extraordinary in that: for they
grow to such a length in those seas that the fishermen tie them round their waists in lieu of ropes!
                    </quote>
                    Then there is the opposite of denial,

                    namely a feigned

Thus Afer, when pleading against a freedman of
Claudius Caesar and when another freedman called
out from the opposite side of the court,
                    <quote>You are always speaking against Caesar's freedmen,</quote>
                    replied,
                    <quote>Yes, but I make precious little headway.</quote>
                    A
similar trick is not to deny a charge, though it is
obviously false and affords good opportunity for an
excellent reply. For example, when Philippus said
to Catulus,
                    <quote>Why do you bark so?</quote>
                    the latter replied,

                    To make jokes against oneself is

strongly to be disapproved in an orator. This form

although it is not infrequently employed.

                    But the loudest laughter of all is produced by simulation and dissimulation, proceedings which differ but
little and are almost identical; but whereas simulation
implies the pretence of having a certain opinion of
one's own, dissimulation consists in feigning that
one does not understand someone else's meaning.
Afer employed simulation, when his opponents in a
certain case kept saying that Celsina (who was an
influential lady) knew all about the facts, and he,

                    Indeed the essence of all wit lies in the
distortion of the true and natural meaning of words:
a perfect instance of this is when we misrepresent
our own or another's opinions or assert some impossibility.

                    There is also a form of misrepresentation which has
its basis in irony, of which a saying of Gaius Caesar
will provide an example. A witness asserted that
the accused attempted to wound him in the thighs,
and although it would have been easy to ask him
why he attacked that portion of his body above all
others, he merely remarked,

                    Best of all is it when pretence is met by
pretence, as was done in the following instance by
Domitius Afer. He had made his will long ago,
and one of his more recent friends, in the hopes of
securing a legacy if he could persuade him to change
it, produced a fictitious story and asked him whether
he should advise a senior centurion who, being an old
man, had already made his will to revise it; to which
Afer replied,
                    <quote>Don't do it: you will offend him.</quote>

                    But the most agreeable of all jests are those which
are good humoured and easily digested. Take
another example from Afer. Noting that an ungrateful client avoided him in the forum, he sent his
servant

                    It is a

                    he replied, although he might
easily have denied the statement,

                    Sometimes it may be a good joke to
speak of oneself, while one may often raise a laugh
by reproaching a person to his face with things that
it would have been merely bad-mannered to bring

all that is incongruous, coarse, unpolished and exotic

the judgment of Marsus, who was a man of the
greatest learning, I will add that he divides serious
utterances into three classes, the honorific, the
derogatory and the intermediate. As an example
of the honorific he quotes the words uttered by

                    The
derogatory he illustrates by the words used by
Cicero of Pompey and Caesar in a letter to Atticus:

                    Finally, he illustrates the intermediate, which he calls apophthegmatic (as it is), by
the passage from Cicero's speech against Catiline

give the name only to those sayings that are of

                    Of the same kind,
too, was the remark recorded by Marsus as having
been made by Pompey to Cicero when the latter
expressed distrust of his party:

                    Had this last remark
been uttered on a less serious subject and with less
serious purpose, or had it not been uttered by Pompey
himself, we might have counted it among examples
of humour.

                    it might seem that I should
delay such instructions until I had finished dealing
with all the details of continuous speaking, since
such debates come after the set speeches are done.
But since the art of debate turns on invention alone,
does not admit of arrangement, has little need for
the embellishments of style, and makes no large
demand on memory or delivery, I think that it will
not be out of place to deal with it here before I
proceed to the second of the five parts,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See v. Pr. 5.</note>
                    since it is

                    entirely dependent on the first. Other writers have
omitted to deal with it on the ground perhaps that
they thought the subject had been sufficiently covered
by their precepts on other topics.

                    For debate consists in attack and defence, on which enough has
already been said, since whatever is useful in a continuous speech for the purpose of proof must necessarily be of service in this brief and discontinuous
form of oratory. For we say the same things in
debate, though we say them in a different manner,
since debate consists of questions and replies, a topic
with which we have dealt fairly exhaustively in
connexion with the examination of witnesses.

                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    But
since this work is designed on an ample scale and
since no one can be called a perfect orator unless he
be an expert debater, we must devote a little special
attention to this accomplishment as well, which as a
matter of fact is not seldom the deciding factor in a
forensic victory.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    For just as the continuous speech
is the predominant weapon in general questions of
quality (where the inquiry is as to whether an act
was right or wrong), and as a rule is adequate to
clear up questions of definition and almost all those
in which the facts are ascertained or inferred by
conjecture

that there is no occasion when the advocate has to
come to closer grips with his adversary.

                    For all the
strongest points of the argument have to be sharply
impressed on the memory of the judge, while we
have also to make good all the promises we may

                    have made in the course of our speech and to refute
the lies of our opponents. There is no point of a
trial where the judge's attention is keener. And
even mediocre speakers have not without some reason
acquired the reputation of being good advocates
simply by their excellence in debate.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Some on the
other hand think they have done their duty to their
clients by an ostentatious and fatiguing display of
elaborate declamation and straightway march out of
court attended by an applauding crowd and leave the
desperate battle of debate to uneducated performers
who often are of but humble origin.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    As a result
in private suits you will generally find that different
counsel are employed to plead and to prove the case.
If the duties of advocacy are to be thus divided, the
latter duty must surely be accounted the more
important of the two, and it is a disgrace to oratory
that inferior advocates should be regarded as adequate
to render the greater service to the litigants. In
public cases at any rate the actual pleader is cited
by the usher as well as the other advocates.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        The allusion is obscure. But Quintilian's point seems to
he merely that the pleader is officially regarded as being
of at least equal importance with the other advocates.
                    </note>
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    For debate the chief requisites are a quick and
nimble understanding and a shrewd and ready judgment. For there is no time to think; the advocate
must speak at once and return the blow almost
before it has been dealt by his opponent. Consequently while it is most important for every portion
of the case that the advocate should not merely have
given a careful study to the whole case, but that he
should have it at his fingers' ends, when he comes
to the debate it is absolutely necessary that he
should possess a thorough acquaintance with all the
persons, instruments and circumstances of time and
place involved: otherwise he will often be reduced
                    <pb id="p.507"/>
                    to silence and forced to give a hurried assent to
those who prompt him as to what he should say,
suggestions which are often perfectly fatuous owing
to excess of zeal on the part of the prompter. As a
result it sometimes happens that we are put to the
blush by too ready acceptance of the foolish suggestions of another.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Moreover, we have to deal with
others beside these prompters who speak for our ear
alone. Somego so far as to turn the debate into an open
brawl. For you may sometimes see several persons
shouting angrily at the judge and telling him that the
arguments thus suggested are contrary to the truth,
and calling his attention to the fact that some point
which is prejudicial to the case has been deliberately
passed over in silence.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently the skilled
debater must be able to control his tendency to
anger; there is no passion that is a greater enemy
to reason, while it often leads an advocate right
away from the point and forces him both to use
gross and insulting language and to receive it in
return; occasionally it will even excite him to such
an extent as to attack the judges. Moderation, and
sometimes even longsuffering, is the better policy,
for the statements of our opponents have not merely
to be refuted: they are often best treated with contempt, made light of or held up to ridicule, methods
which afford unique opportunity for the display of
wit. This injunction, however, applies only so long
as the case is conducted with order and decency: if,
on the other hand, our opponents adopt turbulent
methods we must put on a bold front and resist
their impudence with courage.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    For there are some
advocates so brazen-faced that they bluster and
bellow at us, interrupt us in the middle of a sentence
                    <pb id="p.509"/>
                    and try to throw everything into confusion. While,
then, it would be wrong to pay them the compliment of imitation, we must none the less repel their
onslaughts with vigour by crushing their insolence
and making frequent appeals to the judges or presiding magistrates to insist on the observance of the
proper order of speaking. The debater's task is
not one that suits a meek temper or excessive
modesty, and we are apt to be misled because that
which is really weakness is dignified by the name of
honesty.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    But the quality which is the most serviceable in debate is acumen, which while it is not the
result of art (for natural gifts cannot be taught),
may none the less be improved by art.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    In this
connexion the chief essential is never for a moment
to lose sight either of the question at issue or the
end which we have in view. If we bear this in
mind, we shall never descend to mere brawling
nor waste the time allotted to the case by indulging
in abuse, while we shall rejoice if our adversary
does so.

                    Those who have given a careful study to the arguments that are likely to be produced by their
opponents or the replies which may be made by
themselves are almost always ready for the fray.
There is, however, a further device available which
consists in suddenly introducing into the debate arguments which were deliberately concealed in our set
speech: it is a procedure which resembles a surprise
attack or a sally from an ambush. The occasion for
its employment arises when there is some point to
which it is difficult to improvise an answer, though
it would not be difficult to meet if time were
allowed for consideration. For solid and irrefutable
                    <pb id="p.511"/>
                    arguments are best produced at once in the actual
pleading in order that they may be repeated and
treated at greater length.
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    I think I need hardly
insist on the necessity for the avoidance in debate of
mere violence and noise and such forms of pleasantry
as are dear to tile uneducated. For unscrupulous
violence, although annoying to one's antagonist,
makes an unpleasant impression on the judge. It is
also bad policy to light hard for points which you
cannot prove.
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    For where defeat is inevitable, it is
wisest to yield, since, if there are a number of other
points in dispute, we shall find it easier to prove
what remains, while if there is only one point at
issue, surrender with a good grace will generally
secure some mitigation of punishment. For obstinacy
in the defence of a fault, more especially after detection, is simply the commission of a fresh fault.

                    While the battle still rages, the task of luring on
our adversary when he has once committed himself
to error, and of forcing him to commit himself as
deeply as possible, even to the extent at times of
being puffed up with extravagant hopes of success,
requires great prudence and skill. It is, therefore,
wise to conceal some of our weapons: for our
opponents will often press their attack and stake
everything on some imagined weakness of our own,
and will give fresh weight to our proofs by the
instancy with which they demand us to produce
them.
                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    It may even be expedient to yield ground
which the enemy thinks advantageous to himself:
for in grasping at the fancied advantage he may
be forced to surrender some greater advantage: at
times, too, it may serve our purpose to give him a
choice between two alternatives, neither of which
                    <pb id="p.513"/>
                    he can select without damage to his cause. Such
a course is more effective in debate than in a set
speech, for the reason that in the latter we reply
to ourselves,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        We propound the dilemma and ourselves point out that
whichever answer our opponent gives must tell against him.
                    </note>
                    while in the former our opponent
replies, and thereby delivers himself into our hands.
It is, above all,
                    <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    the mark of a shrewd debater to
perceive what remarks impress the judge and what
he rejects: this may often be detected from his
looks, and sometimes from some action or utterance.
Arguments which help us must be pressed home,
while it will be wise to withdraw as gently as
possible from such as are of no service. We may
take a lesson from doctors who continue or cease
to administer remedies according as they note that
they are received or rejected by the stomach.
Sometimes,
                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    if we find difficulty in developing our
point, it is desirable to raise another question and
to divert the attention of the judge to it if this be
feasible. For what can you do, if you are unable
to answer an argument, save invent another to which
your opponent can give no answer?
                    <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                    In most respects the rules to be observed in debate are, as I
have said,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">§2.</note>
                    identical with those for the cross examination of witnesses, the only difference lying in the
fact that the debate is a battle between advocates,
whereas cross-examination is a fight between advocate
and witness.

                <p>
                    To practise the art of debate is, however, far
easier. For it is most profitable to agree with
a fellow-student on some subject, real or fictitious,
and to take different sides, debating it as would
be done in the courts. The same may also be
done with the simpler class of questions.

                    which his proofs should be presented to the judge:
the method to be followed is the same as in arguments: the strongest should be placed first and

                    V. Having dealt with these points to the best of
my ability, I should have had no hesitation in proceeding to discuss arrangement, which is logically
the next consideration, did I not fear that, since
there are some who include judgment
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See III. iii. 5 and 6.</note>
                    under the
head of invention, they might think that I had
deliberately omitted all discussion of judgment,
although personally I regard it as so inextricably
blent with and involved in every portion of this
work, that its influence extends even to single
sentences or words, and it is no more possible to
teach it than it is to instruct the powers of taste
and smell.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently, all I can do is now and
hereafter to show what should be done or avoided
in each particular case, with a view thereby to guide
the judgment. What use then is it for me to lay
down general rules to the effect that we should not
attempt impossibilities, that we should avoid whatever contradicts our case or is common to both, and
shun all incorrectness or obscurity of style? In all
these cases it is common sense that must decide,
and common sense cannot be taught.

                <p>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    There is no great difference, in my opinion,
between judgment and sagacity, except that the
former deals with evident facts, while the latter is
concerned with hidden facts or such as have not
yet been discovered or still remain in doubt. Again
judgment is more often than not a matter of
                    <pb id="p.517"/>
                    certainty, while sagacity is a form of reasoning from
deep-lying premises, which generally weighs and
compares a number of arguments and in itself
involves both invention and judgment.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    But here
again you must not expect me to lay down any
general rules. For sagacity depends on circumstances
and will often find its scope in something preceding
the pleading of the cause. For instance in the prosecution of Verres Cicero seems to have shown the
highest sagacity in preferring to cut down the time
available for his speech rather than allow the trial to
be postponed to the following year when Quintus
Hortensius was to be consul.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    And again in the
actual pleading sagacity holds the first and most
important place. For it is the duty of sagacity to
decide what we should say and what we should pass
by in silence or postpone; whether it is better to
deny an act or to defend it, when we should employ
an exordium and on what lines it should be designed,
whether we should make a statement of facts and if
so, how, whether we should base our plea on law or
equity and what is the best order to adopt, while it
must also decide on all the nuances of style, and
settle whether it is expedient to speak harshly,
gently or even with humility.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    But I have already
given advice on all these points as far as each
occasion permitted, and I shall continue to do the
same in the subsequent portions of this work. In
the meantime, however, I will give a few instances
to make my meaning clearer, since it is not possible,
in my opinion, to do so by laying down general rules.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>

                    pointed out that so far their action had been entirely
irrational. For they might still make amends for their
negligence, whereas, if they had made no mistakes,

                    since he feared to
give offence if he taxed the people with lack of
energy in defending the liberties of their country,
he preferred to praise their ancestors for their
courageous policy. Thus lie gained a ready hearing,
with the natural result that the pride which they
felt in the heroic past made them repent of their
own degenerate behaviour.

                    If we turn to Cicero, we
shall find that one speech alone, the
                    <hi rend="italics">pro Cluenltio,</hi>
                    will suffice to provide a number of examples. The
difficulty is to know what special exhibition of sagacity to admire most in this speech. His opening
statement of the case, by which he discredited the
mother whose authority pressed so hardly on her
son?
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">vi. 17.</note>
                    The fact that he preferred to throw the
charge of having bribed the jury back upon his
opponents rather than deny it on account of what he
calls the notorious infamy of the verdict?
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">i 4.</note>
                    Or his
recourse, last of all, to the support of the law in spite
of the odious nature of the affair, a method by which
lie would have set the judges against him but for
the fact that he had already softened their feelings
towards him?

an outstanding instance of his sagacity in the
                    <hi rend="italics">pro Milone?</hi>
                    The fact that he refrains from proceeding

ground by disposing of the previous verdicts against
the accused?

although as a matter of fact the encounter was a

it was forced upon his client? Or the skill with
which he avoided making Milo plead for consideration and undertook the role of suppliant himself?

of his sagacity, how he discredited Cotta,

It is enough, I think,
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    to say that there is nothing
not merely in oratory, but in all the tasks of life
that is more important than sagacity and that without it all formal instruction is given in vain, while
prudence unsupported by learning will accomplish
more than learning unsupported by prudence. It is
sagacity again that teaches us to adapt our speech to
circumstances of time and place and to the persons
with whom we are concerned. But since this topic
covers a wide field and is intimately connected with
eloquence itself, I shall reserve my treatment of it
till I come to give instructions on the subject of
appropriateness in speaking.
