                    I have now, my dear Marcellus Victorius, completed the third book of the work which I have
dedicated to you, and have nearly finished a quarter
of my task, and am confronted with a motive for
renewed diligence and increased anxiety as to the
judgment it may be found to deserve. For up to
this point we were merely discussing rhetoric
between ourselves and, in the event of our system
being regarded as inadequate by the world at large,
were prepared to content ourselves with putting it
into practice at home and to confine ourselves to the
education of your son and mine.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    But now Domitianus Augustus has entrusted me with the education
of his sister's grandsons, and I should be undeserving of the honour conferred upon me by such
divine appreciation, if I were not to regard this
distinction as the standard by which the greatness
of my undertaking must be judged.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    For it is
clearly my duty to spare no pains in moulding
the character of my august pupils, that they may
earn the deserved approval of the most righteous
of censors. The same applies to their intellectual
                    <pb id="p.5"/>
                    training, for I would not be found to have disappointed the expectations of a prince pre-eminent
in eloquence as in all other virtues.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    But no one
is surprised at the frequency with which the
greatest poets invoke the Muses not merely at the
commencement of their works, but even further
on when they have reached some important passage
and repeat their vows and utter fresh prayers for
assistance.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Assuredly therefore I may ask indulgence
for doing what I omitted to do when I first entered
on this task and calling to my aid all the gods and
Himself before them all (for his power is unsurpassed and there is no deity that looks with such
favour upon learning), beseeching him to inspire me
with genius in proportion to the hopes that he has
raised in me, to lend me propitious and ready aid and
make me even such as he has believed me to be.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    And this, though the greatest, is not the only
motive for this act of religious devotion, but my work is
of such a nature that, as it proceeds, I am confronted
with greater and more arduous obstacles than have
yet faced me. For my next task is to explain the
order to be followed in forensic causes, which
present the utmost complication and variety. I must
set forth the function of the
                    <hi rend="italics">exordium,</hi>
                    the method
of the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts,</hi>
                    the cogency of
                    <hi rend="italics">proofs,</hi>
                    whether
we are confirming our own assertions or refuting
those of our opponents, and the force of the
                    <hi rend="italics">peroration,</hi>
                    whether we have to refresh the memory of the
judge by a brief recapitulation of the facts, or to do
what is far more effective, stir his emotions.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Some
have preferred to give each of these points separate
treatment, fearing that if they undertook them as
a whole the burden would be greater than they
                    <pb id="p.7"/>
                    could bear, and consequently have published several
books on each individual point. I have ventured
to treat them altogether and foresee such infinite
labour that I feel weary at the very thought of the
task I have undertaken. But I have set my hand to
the plough and must not look back. My strength
may fail me, but my courage must not fail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. The commencement or
                    <hi rend="italics">exorditum</hi>
                    as we call it in
Latin is styled a
                    <hi rend="italics">proem</hi>
                    by the Greeks. This seems
to me a more appropriate name, because whereas we
merely indicate that we are beginning our task, they
clearly show that this portion is designed as an introduction to the subject on which the orator has to
speak.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    It may be because
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">oi)/mh</foreign>
                    means a tune, and
players on the lyre have given the name of
                    <hi rend="italics">proem</hi>
                    to
the prelude which they perform to win the favour of
the audience before entering upon the regular contest
for the prize, that orators before beginning to plead
make a few introductory remarks to win the indulgence of the judges.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Or it may be because
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">oi)=mos</foreign>
                    in Greek means a
                    <hi rend="italics">way,</hi>
                    that the practice has arisen of
calling an introduction a
                    <hi rend="italics">proem.</hi>
                    But in any case
there can be no doubt that by
                    <hi rend="italics">proem</hi>
                    we mean the
portion of a speech addressed to the judge before he
has begun to consider the actual case. And it is a
mistaken practice which we adopt in the schools of
always assuming in our
                    <hi rend="italics">exordia</hi>
                    that the judge is
already acquainted with the case.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    This form of
licence arises from the fact that a sketch of the case
is always given before actual declamation.

                    may, however, be employed in the
                    <pb id="p.9"/>
                    courts, when a case comes on for the second time, but
never or rarely on the first occasion, unless we are
speaking before a judge who has knowledge of
the case from some other source.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    The sole purpose of the
                    <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi>
                    is to prepare our
audience in such a way that they will be disposed to
lend a ready ear to the rest of our speech. The
majority of authors agree that this is best effected in
three ways, by making the audience well-disposed,
attentive and ready to receive instruction. I need
hardly say that these aims have to be kept in
view throughout the whole speech, but they are especially necessary at the commencement, when we
gain admission to the mind of the judge in order
to penetrate still further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    As regards good-will, we secure that either from
persons connected with the case or from the case
itself. Most writers have divided these persons into
three classes, the plaintiff, the defendant and the
judge.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    This classification is wrong, for the
                    <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi>
                    may sometimes derive its conciliatory force from the
person of the pleader. For although he may be
modest and say little about himself, yet if he is
believed to be a good man, this consideration will
exercise the strongest influence at every point of
the case. For thus he will have the good fortune to
give the impression not so much that he is a
zealous advocate as that he is an absolutely reliable
witness. It is therefore pre-eminently desirable
that he should be believed to have undertaken
the case out of a sense of duty to a friend or
relative, or even better, if the point can be made,
by a sense of patriotism or at any rate some serious
moral consideration. No doubt it is even more
                    <pb id="p.11"/>
                    necessary for the parties themselves to create the
impression that they have been forced to take legal
action by some weighty and honourable reason or even
by necessity.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    But just as the authority of the speaker
carries greatest weight, if his undertaking of the case
is free from all suspicion of meanness, personal spite
or ambition, so also we shall derive some silent support
from representing that we are weak, unprepared, and
no match for the powerful talents arrayed against us,
a frequent trick in the
                    <hi rend="italics">exordia</hi>
                    of Messala.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    For
men have a natural prejudice in favour of those
who are struggling against difficulties, and a scrupulous judge is always specially ready to listen to an
advocate whom he does not suspect to have designs
on his integrity. Hence arose the tendency of
ancient orators to pretend to conceal their eloquence,
a practice exceedingly unlike the ostentation of our
own times.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    It is also important to avoid giving the
impression that we are abusive, malignant, proud
or slanderous toward any individual or body of
men, especially such as cannot be hurt without
exciting the disapproval of the judges.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    As to the
judge, it would be folly for me to warn speakers
not to say or even hint anything against him, but
for the fact that such things do occur. Our opponent's advocate will sometimes provide us with
material for our
                    <hi rend="italics">exordium:</hi>
                    we may speak of him
in honorific terms, pretending to fear his eloquence
and influence with a view to rendering them suspect
to the judge, or occasionally, though very seldom, we
may abuse him, as Asinius did in his speech on behalf
of the heirs of Urbinia, where he includes among the
proofs of the weakness of the plaintiff's case the fact
that he has secured Labienus as his advocate.
                    <pb id="p.13"/>
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Cornelius Celsus denies that such remarks can be
considered as belonging to the
                    <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi>
                    on the
ground that they are irrelevant to the actual case.
Personally I prefer to follow the authority of the
greatest orators, and hold that whatever concerns the
pleader is relevant to the case, since it is natural that
the judges should give readier credence to those to
whom they find it a pleasure to listen.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    The character
of our client himself may, too, be treated in various
ways: we may emphasise his worth or we may
commend his weakness to the protection of the
court. Sometimes it is desirable to set forth his
merits, when the speaker will be less hampered by
modesty than if he were praising his own. Sex, age
and situation are also important considerations, as for
instance when women, old men or wards are pleading
in the character of wives, parents or children.
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    For pity alone may move even a strict judge.
These points, however, should only be lightly touched
upon in the
                    <hi rend="italics">exordium,</hi>
                    not run to death. As regards
our opponent he is generally attacked on similar
lines, but with the method reversed. For power is
generally attended by envy, abject meanness by
contempt, guilt and baseness by hatred, three
emotions which are powerful factors to alienate the
good-will of the judges.
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    But a simple statement will
not suffice, for even the uneducated are capable of
that: most of the points will require exaggeration
or extenuation as expediency may demand: the
method of treatment belongs to the orator, the
points themselves belong to the case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We shall win the good-will of the judge not
merely by praising him,
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    which must be done with
tact and is an artifice common to both parties, but
                    <pb id="p.15"/>
                    by linking his praise to the furtherance of our own
case. For instance, in pleading for a man of good
birth we shall appeal to his own high rank, in speaking
for the lowly we shall lay stress on his sense of justice, on his pity in pleading the cause of misfortune,
and on his severity when we champion the victims
of wrong, and so on.
                    <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    I should also wish, if possible,
to be acquainted with the character of the judge.
For it will be desirable to enlist their temperaments
in the service of our cause, where they are such as
are like to be useful, or to mollify them, if they are
like to prove adverse, just according as they are
harsh, gentle, cheerful, grave, stern, or easy-going.
It will, however,
                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    sometimes happen that the judge
is hostile to us and friendly to our adversaries. Such
cases demand the attention of both parties and I am
not sure that the party favoured by the judge does
not require to handle the situation with even more
care than his opponent. For perverse judges have
sometimes a preposterous tendency to give judgment against their friends or in favour of those with
whom they have a quarrel, and of committing injustice merely to avoid the appearance of partiality.
                    <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    Again some have been judges in cases where their
own interests were involved. I note, for instance,
in the books of observations published by Septimius
that Cicero appeared in such a case, while I myself,
when I appeared on behalf of Queen Berenice,
actually pleaded before her. In such cases we must
be guided by the same principles that I have laid
down above. The opponent of the judge will
emphasise his confidence in the justice of his client's
cause, while the advocate of his interests will
express the fear that the judge may be influenced
                    <pb id="p.17"/>
                    by a quixotic delicacy.
                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    Further, if the judge is
thought to have come into court with a prejudice
in favour of one side, we must try to remove or
strengthen that prejudice as circumstances may
demand. Again occasionally we shall have to calm
the judges' fears, as Cicero does in the
                    <hi rend="italics">pro Milone,</hi>
                    where he strives to persuade them not to think that
Pompey's soldiers have been stationed in the court
as a threat to themselves. Or it may be necessary
to frighten them, as Cicero does in the
                    <hi rend="italics">Verrines.</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">i. 15.</note>
                    <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                    There are two ways of bringing fear to bear upon
the judges. The commonest and most popular is to
threaten them with the displeasure of the Roman
people or the transference of the juries to another
class
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi>

                    If the case affords us the means of winning the

the most important of the questions that are to be
raised. There is nothing to object to in this rule,
save that he would make it of universal application,
whereas it is not possible with every question nor
desirable in every case. For instance, seeing that
the plaintiff's advocate speaks first, and that
till he has spoken the judge is ignorant of the
nature of the dispute, how is it possible for us to
introduce reflexions relating to all the questions
involved? The facts of the case must be stated
before that can be done. We may grant that some
questions may be mentioned, for that will sometimes
be absolutely necessary; but can we introduce all
the most important questions, or in other words the
whole case? If we do we shall have completed our

naked harshness before we have done anything to
secure his favour. If the main questions ought
always to be treated at the beginning of a speech,

                    the points which are likely to gain us such favour,

them here.

                    Just, however, as it is in the interest
of our case to note and amplify these points, so it is
also to rebut or at any rate lessen the force of
anything that is damaging to our case. Again
our case may justify an appeal to compassion with
regard to what we have suffered in the past or are
likely to suffer.

                    For I do not share the opinion

                    are to be distinguished by the fact that the latter
deals with the past, the former with the future.
Rather I hold that the difference between them is
this: in our opening any preliminary appeal to the
compassion of the judge must be made sparingly
and with restraint, while in the peroration we may
give full rein to our emotions, place fictitious
speeches in the mouths of our characters, call the
dead to life, and produce the wife or children of the

                    Confidence often labours under the disadvantage
of being regarded as arrogance. But there are
certain tricks for acquiring good-will, which though
almost universal, are by no means to be neglected, if
only to prevent their being first employed against
ourselves. I refer to rhetorical expressions of wishing, detestation, entreaty, or anxiety. For it keeps
the judge's attention on the alert, if he is led to
think the case novel, important, scandalous, or
likely to set a precedent, still more if he is excited
by concern for himself or the common weal, when

this effect if we give a brief and lucid summary of

and this we cannot do unless we render him attentive
to what we have to say and ready to be instructed.
What are we to do then? I agree to the view that
we should cut down, depreciate and deride some of
our opponent's arguments with a view to lessening
the attention shown him by the judge, as Cicero did

contain a direct appeal to the good-will and attention
of the judge. But as this is impossible in scandalous
cases, they would have the orator on such occasions insinuate himself little by little into the minds of his
judges, especially when the features of the case which
meet the eye are discreditable, or because the subject
is disgraceful or such as to meet with popular disapproval, or again if the outward circumstances of the
case are such as to handicap it or excite odium (as for
instance when a patron appears against a client or a

                    To save the situation the rhetoricians lay down a number of rules at
quite inordinate length: they invent fictitious cases
and treat them realistically on the lines which would
be followed in actual pleading. But these peculiar
circumstances arise from such a variety of causes as

therefore depend on the individual nature of each
case. As a general principle, however, I should
advise the avoidance of points which tell against us
and concentrate on those which are likely to be of
service. If the case itself is weak, we may derive
help from the character of our client; if his character
is doubtful, we may find salvation in the nature of

                    the case. If both are hopeless, we must look out for
something that will damage our opponent. For
though it is desirable to secure as much positive
good-will as possible, the next best thing is to incur
the minimum of actual dislike.

                    Where we cannot
deny the truth of facts that are urged against us, we
must try to show that their significance has been
exaggerated or that the purpose of the act was not
what is alleged or that the facts are irrelevant or
that what was done may be atoned for by penitence
or has already been sufficiently punished. It is
consequently easier for an advocate to put forward
such pleas than for his client, since the former can
praise without laying himself open to the charge of
arrogance and may sometimes even reprove him with
advantage to the case.

he himself is strongly moved, in order to win the
ear of the judge and to give the impression of
one who is absolutely convinced of the truth of his
cause, that so his statements may find all the readier
credence whether he defends or denies the actions
attributed to his client. Consequently it is of the first
importance, wherever the alternative is open to us,

                    is that which draws its material
from the speech of our opponent, if only for the
reason that the fact of its not having been composed
at home, but having been improvised on the spot to
meet the needs of the case increases the orator's
reputation for natural talent by the readiness with
which it is produced and carries conviction owing to
the simple and ordinary language in which it is
clothed. As a result, even although the rest of the
speech has been committed to writing and carefully
elaborated, the whole of the speech will often be
regarded as extempore, simply because its commencement is clearly not the result of previous
study.

                    that
even in a case where there is no room for doubt the
confidence of the speaker should not reveal itself too
openly. For as a rule the judge dislikes self-confidence in a pleader, and conscious of his rights
tacitly demands the respectful deference of the
orator.

                    No less care must be taken to avoid exciting

should therefore give no hint of elaboration in the
                    <hi rend="italics">exordium,</hi>
                    since any art that the orator may employ

                    <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi>
                    is entirely
unnecessary. Sometimes however it is impossible
to employ it, even if we desire to do so, when,
for instance, the judge is much occupied, when time
is short or superior authority forces us to embark
upon the subject right away.

recommended as a means of wakening them when

                    but there is some excuse for him owing to the
fact that he is compelled to weld together subjects
of the most diverse nature so as to form a continuous
whole.

                    But what necessity is there for an orator to
gloss over his transitions or to attempt to deceive the
judge, who requires on the contrary to be warned to
give his attention to the sequence of the various
portions of the speech? For instance the first part
of our
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of the facts</hi>

                    Therefore, although we should not be too

to prepare the judge for it, as Cicero often does,
most notably in the following passage:

                    However
let us pass to matters of more importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The majority regard the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    as being
indispensable: but there are many considerations
which show that this view is erroneous. In the first
place there are some cases which are so brief, that
they require only a brief summary rather than a full
statement of the facts.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    This may apply to both
parties to a suit, as for instance in cases where there
is no necessity for explanation or where the facts are
                    <pb id="p.53"/>
                    admitted and the whole question turns on a point of
law, as it so often does in the centumviral court, as
for example when we discuss, whether the heir of a
woman who has died intestate should be her son or
brother, or whether puberty is to be reckoned by age
or by physical development. The same situation
arises also in cases where the facts admit of full
statement, but are well known to the judge or have
been correctly set forth by a previous speaker.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Sometimes again the statement of facts can be
dispensed with only by one party, who is generally
the plaintiff, either because it is sufficient for him to
make a simple summary of his case or because it is
more expedient for him to do so. It may, for instance, suffice to say,
                    <quote>I claim repayment of a certain sum of money which was lent on certain conditions</quote>
                    or
                    <quote>I claim a legacy in accordance with the terms of the will.</quote>
                    It is for the other party to
explain why these sums are not due to the plaintiff.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Again it is sometimes sufficient and expedient to
summarise a case in one sentence such as
                    <quote>I say that Horatius killed his sister.</quote>
                    For the judge will
understand the whole charge from this simple
affirmation: the sequence of events and the motive
for the deed will be matters for the defence to expound.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    On the other hand in some cases the
accused may dispense with the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts,</hi>
                    when for instance the charge can neither be denied
nor palliated, but turns solely on some point of law:
the following case will illustrate my meaning. A
man who has stolen from a temple money belonging
to a private individual is accused of sacrilege: in
such a case a confession will be more seemly than
a full
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts:</hi>
                    <quote>
                        We do not deny that the
                        <pb id="p.55"/>
                        money was taken from the temple; but the accuser
is bringing a false accusation in charging my client
with sacrilege, since the money was not consecrated,
but private property: it is for you to decide whether
under these circumstances sacrilege has been
committed.

                    While however I think that there are occasional
cases where the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    may be dispensed
with, I disagree with those who say that there is no
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    when the accused simply denies the
charge. This opinion is shared by Cornelius Celsus
who holds that most cases of murder and all of
bribery and extortion fall into this class.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    For he
thinks that the only
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    is that which
gives a general account of the charge before the
court. Yet he himself acknowledges that Cicero
employed the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    in his defence of
Rabirius Postumus, in spite of the fact that Cicero
denies that any money came into the hands of
Rabirius (and this was the question at issue) and
gives no explanations relating to the actual charge in
his

                    For my part I follow the very
highest authorities in holding that there are two
forms of
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    in forensic speeches, the
one expounding the facts of the case itself, the other
setting forth facts which have a bearing on the case.

                    I agree that a sentence such as
                    <quote>I did not kill the man</quote>
                    does not amount to a
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts:</hi>
                    but there will be a
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts,</hi>
                    occasionally, too,
a long one, in answer to the arguments put forward
by the accuser: it will deal with the past life of the
accused, with the causes which have brought an
innocent man into peril, and other circumstances
such as show the charge to be incredible.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    For the
                    <pb id="p.57"/>
                    accuser does not merely say
                    <quote>You killed him,</quote>
                    but
sets forth the facts proving his assertion: tragedy will
provide an example, where Teucer accuses Ulysses
of murdering Ajax, and states that he was found in a
lonely place near the lifeless body of his enemy with
a blood-stained sword in his hands. To this Ulysses
does not merely reply that he did not do the deed,
but adds that he had no quarrel with Ajax, the
contest between them having been concerned solely
with the winning of renown: he then goes on to
say how he came to be in the lonely place, how he
found Ajax lying lifeless and drew the sword from
the wound. Then follow arguments based on these
facts.
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    But even when the accuser says
                    <quote>You were found on the spot where your enemy was killed</quote>
                    and the accused says
                    <quote>I was not,</quote>
                    a
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    is involved; for he must say where he was. Consequently cases of bribery and extortion will require
as many statements of this kind as there are
charges: the charges themselves will be denied, but
it will be necessary to counter the arguments of the
accuser either singly or all together by setting forth
the facts in quite a different light.
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    Is it, I ask you,
irrelevant for one accused of bribery to set forth
his parentage, his past life and the services on which
he relied for success in his candidature? And if a
man is indicted for extortion, will it not be to his
advantage to set forth not merely his past record,
but also the reasons which have made the whole
province or the accuser or a witness hostile to
himself?

                    of facts familiar to the judge

takes a view of the facts which is favourable to our

not merely to instruct, but rather to persuade the

instruction, we shall preface our statement with
some such remarks as these:
                    <quote>

that we are repeating the facts for the benefit of
some new member of the jury,

                    at times that we do
so with a view to letting every bystander as well realise
the gross unfairness of our opponents' assertions.
Under these circumstances our statement must be
diversified by a free use of figures to avoid wearying
those to whom the facts are familiar: we shall for
instance use phrases such as
                    <quote>You remember,</quote>
                    <quote>It may perhaps be superfluous to dwell on this point,</quote>

                    Besides, if we are always to
regard as superfluous a

                    made before

                    There is a further question which is still more
frequently raised, as to whether the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">exordium.</hi>
                    Those who hold that it should always do so
must be admitted to have some reason on their side.
For since the purpose of the
                    <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi>
                    is to make
the judge more favourably disposed and more
attentive to our case and more amenable to
instruction, and since the
                    <hi rend="italics">proof</hi>
                    cannot be brought
forward until the facts of the case are known, it
seems right that the judge should be instructed in
the facts without delay.
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    But the practice may be
altered by circumstances, unless it is contended that
Cicero in his magnificent published defence of Milo
delayed his
                    <hi rend="italics">statement</hi>
                    too long by placing three
questions before it; or unless it is argued that, if it
bad been held to be impermissible to defend a man
at all who acknowledged that he had killed another,
or if Milo's case had already been prejudged and
condemnation passed by the senate, or if Gnaeus
Pompeius, who in addition to exerting his influence
in other ways had surrounded the court with an
armed guard, had been regarded with apprehension
as hostile to the accused, it would have served his
case to set forth how Clodius had set an ambush for
Milo.
                    <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>
                    These three questions, then, served the
purpose of an exordium, since they all of them were
designed to prepare the minds of the judges.
Again in the
                    <hi rend="italics">pro Vareno</hi>
                    Cicero delayed his
statement of facts until he had first rebutted
certain allegations put forward by the prosecution.
This may be done with advantage whenever we
have not merely to rebut the charge, but to turn
the tables on our opponents: thus after first
rebutting the charge, we make
                    <hi rend="italics">our statement of facts</hi>
                    the opening of an incrimination of the other
party just as in actual fighting we are most
                    <pb id="p.65"/>
                    concerned to parry our adversary's blows before
we strike him ourselves.
                    <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>
                    There will also not
infrequently be certain cases, in which it is easy to
rebut the charge that is under trial, but the conduct
of which is hampered by the past life of our client
and the many and serious crimes which he has
committed. We must dispose of these first, in order
that the judge may give a favourable hearing to our
defence of the actual facts which form the question
at issue. For example, if we have to defend
Marcus Caelius, the best course for his advocate to
adopt will be to meet the imputations of luxury,
wantonness and immorality which are made against
him before we proceed to the actual charge of poisoning. It is with these points that the speech of Cicero
in his defence is entirely concerned. Is he then to
go on to make a statement about the property of
Palla and explain the whole question of rioting, a
charge against which Caelius has already defended
himself in the speech which he delivered on his own
behalf?
                    <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>
                    We however are the victims of the practice
of the schools in accordance with which certain points
or themes as we call them are put forward for discussion, outside which our refutation must not go,
and consequently a
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    always follows
the
                    <hi rend="italics">exordium.</hi>
                    It is this too that leads declaimers to
take the liberty of inserting a
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    even
when they speak second for their side.
                    <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>
                    For when
they speak for the prosecution they introduce both a
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts,</hi>
                    as if they were speaking first, and a
refutation of the arguments for the defence, as if
they were replying: and they are right in so doing.
For since declamation is merely an exercise in forensic
pleading, why should they not qualify themselves to
                    <pb id="p.67"/>
                    speak either first or second
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See note prefixed to Index.</note>
                    ? Those however who
do not understand the reason for such a practice,
think that when they appear in the courts they
should stick to the custom of the schools with which
they have become familiar.
                    <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>
                    But even scholastic
rhetoricians occasionally substitute a brief summary
for the full statement of the facts. For what statement of the case can be made when a wife is accusing
a jealous husband of maltreating her, or a father is
indicting his son turned Cynic before the censors
for indecent behaviour

                    ? In both cases the charge
can be sufficiently indicated by one word placed
in any part of the speech. But enough of these
points.

                    I will now proceed to the method to be adopted
in making our
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts.</hi>
                    The
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    consists in the persuasive exposition of that
which either has been done, or is supposed to
have been done, or, to quote the definition given by
Apollodorus, is a speech instructing the audience as to
the nature of the case in dispute. Most writers, more
especially those of the Isocratean school, hold that
it should be lucid, brief and plausible (for it is of
no importance if we substitute clear for lucid, or
credible or probable for plausible).
                    <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>
                    I agree with
this classification of its qualities, although Aristotle
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    </note>
                    disagrees with Isocrates on one point, and pours
scorn on his injunction to be brief, as though it
were necessary that a statement should be either
long or short and it were impossible to hit the happy
mean. The followers of Theodorus on the other
hand recognise only plausibility on the ground
that it is not always expedient that our exposition
should be either short or clear.
                    <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>
                    It will be necessary

                    therefore for me to devote some care to the differentiation of the various features of this portion of a
speech, in order that I may show under what
circumstances each is specially useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The
                    <hi rend="italics">statement</hi>
                    will be either wholly in our favour
or wholly in that of our opponent or a mixture of
both. If it is entirely in our own favour, we may
rest content with the three qualities just mentioned,
the result of which is to make it easier for the judge
to understand, remember and believe what we say.
                    <milestone n="34" unit="section"/>
                    Now I should regret that anyone should censure my
conduct in suggesting that a
                    <hi rend="italics">statement</hi>
                    which is
wholly in our favour should be
                    <hi rend="italics">plausible,</hi>
                    when as
a matter of fact it is
                    <hi rend="italics">true.</hi>
                    There are many things
which are true, but scarcely credible, just as there
are many things which are plausible though false.
It will therefore require just as much exertion on
our part to make the judge believe what we say
when it is true as it will when it is fictitious.
                    <milestone n="35" unit="section"/>
                    These
good qualities, which I have mentioned above, do
not indeed cease to be virtues in other portions of the
speech; for it is our duty to avoid obscurity in every
part of our pleading, to preserve due proportion
throughout and to say nothing save what is likely
to win belief. But they require special observance
in that portion of the speech which is the first
from which the judge can learn the nature of the
case: if at this stage of the proceedings he fails to
understand, remember or believe what we say, our
labour is but lost in the remainder of the speech.

                    We shall achieve lucidity and clearness in our
statement of facts, first by setting forth our story in
words which are appropriate, significant and free
from any taint of meanness, but not on the other
                    <pb id="p.71"/>
                    hand farfetched or unusual, and secondly by giving
a distinct account of facts, persons, times, places and
causes, while our delivery must be adapted to our
matter, so that the judge will take in what we say
with the utmost readiness.
                    <milestone n="37" unit="section"/>
                    This latter virtue is
disregarded by the majority of speakers who are
used to the noisy applause of a large audience,
whether it be a chance gathering or an assembly of
                    <hi rend="italics">claqueurs,</hi>
                    and consequently are unnerved by the
attentive silence of the courts. They feel that they
have fallen short of eloquence, if they do not make
everything echo with noise and clamour; they think
that to state a matter simply is suited only to everyday speech such as falls within the capacity of any
uneducated man, while all the time it is hard to say
whether they are less willing or less capable of
performing a task which they despise on account of
its supposed easiness.

                    For even when they have
tried everything, they will never find anything more
difficult in the whole range of oratory than that
which, once heard, all think they would have said,—
a delusion due to the fact that they regard what has
been said as having no merit save that of truth. But
it is just when an orator gives the impression of
absolute truth that he is speaking best.
                    <milestone n="39" unit="section"/>
                    As it is,
when such persons as these get a fair field for stating their case, they select this as the precise occasion
for affected modulations of the voice, throwing back
their heads, thumping their sides and indulging in
every kind of extravagance of statement, language
and style. As a result, while the speech, from its
very monstrosity, meets with applause, the case
remains unintelligible. However, let us pass to
another subject; my aim is to win favour for
                    <pb id="p.73"/>
                    pointing out the right road rather than to give

                    will be brief, if in the first
place we start at that point of the case at which it
begins to concern the judge, secondly avoid irrelevance, and finally cut out everything the removal
of which neither hampers the activities of the judge
nor harms our own case.
                    <milestone n="41" unit="section"/>
                    For frequently conciseness
of detail is not inconsistent with length in the
whole. Take for instance such a statement as the
following:

                        I came to the harbour, I saw a ship, I
asked the cost of a passage, the price was agreed, I
went on board, the anchor was weighed, we loosed
our cable and set out.
                    </quote>
                    Nothing could be terser
than these assertions, but it would have been quite
sufficient to say
                    <quote>I sailed from the harbour.</quote>
                    And
whenever the conclusion gives a sufficiently clear
idea of the premisses, we must be content with
having given a hint which will enable our audience
to understand what we have left unsaid.

                    For this reason some of the Greeks draw a
distinction between a concise statement (the word
they use is
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">su/ntomos</foreign>

former being free from all superfluous matter, while
the latter may conceivably omit something that
requires to be stated.

                    Personally, when I use the
word brevity, I mean not saying less, but not saying
more than occasion demands. As for repetitions
and tautologies and diffuseness, which some writers
of textbooks tell us we must avoid, I pass them by;
                    <pb id="p.75"/>
                    they are faults which we should shun for other reasons

                    But we must be
equally on our guard against the obscurity which
results from excessive abridgment, and it is better to
say a little more than is necessary than a little less.
For though a diffuse irrelevance is tedious, the
omission of what is necessary is positively dangerous.

                    We must therefore avoid even tile famous terseness
of Sallust (though in his case of course it is a merit),
and shun all abruptness of speech, since a style
which presents no difficulty to a leisurely reader,
flies past a hearer and will not stay to be
looked at again; and whereas the reader is
almost always a man of learning, the judge often
comes to his panel from the country side and is
expected to give a decision on what he can understand. Consequently we must aim, perhaps everywhere, but above all in our
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts,</hi>
                    at
striking the happy mean in our language, and the

                    I mean not the bare minimum
necessary to convey our meaning; for our brevity
must not be devoid of elegance, without which it
would be merely uncouth: pleasure beguiles the
attention, and that which delights us ever seems less
long, just as a picturesque and easy journey tires us
less for all its length than a difficult short cut through
an arid waste.

                    And I would never carry my desire
for brevity so far as to refuse admission to details
which may contribute to the plausibility of our

facts in every direction and you will turn it into
something more like a confession. Moreover, the

                    Division of our statement into its various

                    Such a
division will give the impression of three short statements rather than of one long one. At times it will be
well to interrupt our narrative by interjecting some
brief remark like the following:
                    <quote>You have heard what happened before: now learn what follows.</quote>
                    The

brought our previous remarks to a close and will

start.

                    If however after employing all these artifices

place we take care to say nothing contrary to nature,
secondly if we assign reasons and motives for the
facts on which the inquiry turns (it is unnecessary to
do so with the subsidiary facts as well), and if we
make the characters of the actors in keeping with
the facts we desire to be believed: we shall for
instance represent a person accused of theft as
covetous, accused of adultery as lustful, accused of
homicide as rash, or attribute the opposite qualities
to these persons if we are defending them: further
we must do the same with place, time and the like.

                    It is also possible to treat the subject in such a way
as to give it an air of credibility, as is done in
comedy and farce. For some things have such natural
sequence and coherence that, if only the first
portion of your

by a certain amount of argument, though this must
be short and simple: for instance in a case of
poisoning we shall say,

                    for instance, is extraordinarily happy in the way he
mentions in advance everything that shows that
Clodius lay in wait for Milo and not Milo for Clodius.
The most effective stroke of all is his cunning feint
of simplicity:

                        Milo, on the other hand, having
been in the senate all day till the house rose, went

the way with women.

                    What an absence of haste
and premeditation this gives to Milo's proceedings.
And the great orator secures this effect not merely
by producing facts which indicate the slow and
tardy nature of Milo's departure, but by the use of
the ordinary language of everyday speech and a
careful concealment of his art. Had he spoken
otherwise, his words would by their very sound have
warned the judge to keep an eye on the advocate.

has language that rises above the ordinary level in
the majority of private suits dealing with loans,
letting and hiring and interdicts? Nor yet is it

confession, excuse or modification are necessary with
regard to our statements: and magnificence is a
quality wholly out of keeping with such procedure.
Magnificence of diction is therefore no more specially
appropriate to the statement of facts than language
calculated to excite pity or hatred, or characterised
by dignity, charm or wit. Each of these qualities
is admirable in its proper place, but none can be
regarded as the peculiar and inalienable property of

                    himself
holds that more qualities are required. For in
addition to demanding that it should be plain, brief
and credible, he would have it clear, characteristic
and worthy of the occasion. But everything in
a speech should be characteristic and worthy of the
occasion as far as possible. Palpalility, as far
as I understand the term, is no doubt a great virtue,
when a truth requires not merely to be told, but to
some extent obtruded, still it may be included under
lucidity. Some, however, regard this quality as
actually being injurious at times, on the ground that
in certain cases it is desirable to obscure the truth.
This contention is, however, absurd.

need is there for me to set forth the facts as they

you desire me to confess my own guilt in the matter,
I was a hard father to them and watched over my

them, with miserly tenacity.

we make no statement, he cannot help believing

their tone represents the truth. What are we to
do then? Are we to restate the same facts? Yes,
if the question turns on the nature of the act, as
it will if there is no doubt about the commission,

alleging other motives and another purpose and
putting a different complexion on the case.

                    should not be somewhat
longer and fuller than usual, since we shall require
to make some preliminary remarks and to introduce
certain special arguments (note that I say arguments,
and not argumentation), while it will add greatly
to the force of our defence if we assert not once
nor twice that we shall prove what we say is true
and that the significance of the facts cannot be
brought out by one opening statement, bidding them

questions of fact—require a statement, which will
more often deal with the circumstances from which
a knowledge of the point at issue may be derived
than with the actual point which is under trial.
When the accuser states these circumstances in
such a manner as to throw suspicion on the case for
the defence, and the accused has consequently to
dispel that suspicion, the facts must be presented to
the judge in quite a different light by the latter.

                    But,
it may be urged, some arguments are strong when put
forward in bulk, but far less effective when employed
separately. My answer is that this remark does not
affect the question whether we ought to make a
statement of fact, but concerns the question how it
should be made. For what is there to prevent us
from amassing and producing a number of arguments
in the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement,</hi>
                    if that is likely to help our cause?
Or from subdividing our statement of facts and
appending the proofs to their respective sections
and so passing on to what remains to be said?
                    <milestone n="83" unit="section"/>
                    Neither do I agree with those who assert that
the order of our
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    should always
follow the actual order of events, but have a preference for adopting the order which I consider
most suitable. For this purpose we can employ a
variety of figures. Sometimes, when we bring up
a point in a place better suited to our purpose,
we may pretend that it had escaped our notice;
                    <pb id="p.97"/>
                    occasionally, too, we may inform the judge that we
shall adhere to the natural order for the remainder
of our statement, since by so doing we shall make
our case clearer, while at times after stating a fact,
we may append the causes which preceded it.
                    <milestone n="84" unit="section"/>
                    For
there is no single law or fixed rule governing the
method of defence. We must consider what is
most advantageous in the circumstances and nature
of the case, and treat the wound as its nature
dictates, dressing at once or, if the dressing can be
delayed, applying a temporary bandage.
                    <milestone n="85" unit="section"/>
                    Again I
do not regard it as a crime to repeat a statement of
a fact more than once, as Cicero does in the
                    <hi rend="italics">pro Cluentio.</hi>
                    It is not merely permissible, but sometimes necessary, as in trials for extortion and all
complicated cases; and only a lunatic will allow a
superstitious observance of rules to lead him counter
to the interests of his case.
                    <milestone n="86" unit="section"/>
                    The reason for placing
the statement of facts before the proof is to prevent
the judge from being ignorant of the question at
issue. Why then, if each individual point has to be
proved or refuted, should not each individual point be
stated as well? If my own experience may be
trusted, I know that I have followed this practice in
the courts, whenever occasion demanded it, and my
procedure has been approved both by learned authorities and the judges themselves, while the duty of
setting forth the case was generally entrusted to me.
I am not boasting, for there are many with whom I
have been associated as counsel, who can bring me to
book if I lie.
                    <milestone n="87" unit="section"/>
                    On the other hand this is no reason
for not following the order of events as a general rule.
Indeed inversion of the order has at times a most
unhappy effect, as for example if you should mention
                    <pb id="p.99"/>
                    first that a woman has brought forth and then that
she has conceived, or that a will has been read and
then that it has been signed. In such cases, if you
should happen to have mentioned the later incident,
it is better to say nothing about the former, which
must quite obviously have come first.

                    Sometimes, too, we get false statements of facts;
these, as far as actual pleading in the courts is concerned, fall into two classes. In the first case the statement depends on external support; Publius Clodius,
for instance, relied on his witnesses when he stated
that he was at Interamna on the night when he committed abominable sacrilege at Rome. The other has
to be supported by the speaker's native talent, and
sometimes consists simply in an assumption of modesty,
which is, I imagine, the reason why it is called a
gloss,

                    Whichever of these two forms
we employ, we must take care, first that our fiction
is within the bounds of possibility, secondly that it
is consistent with the persons, dates and places involved and thirdly that it presents a character and
sequence that are not beyond belief: if possible,
it should be connected with something that is
admittedly true and should be supported by some
argument that forms part of the actual case. For if
we draw our fictions entirely from circumstances
lying outside the case, the liberty which we have
taken in resorting to falsehood will stand revealed.
                    <milestone n="90" unit="section"/>
                    Above all we must see that we do not contradict
ourselves, a slip which is far from rare on the part of
spinners of fiction: for some things may put a most
favourable complexion on portions of our case, and
yet fail to agree as a whole. Further, what we say
                    <pb id="p.101"/>
                    must not be at variance with the admitted truth. Even
in the schools, if we desire a

stick to it, if it turns on an act committed by others,

what they say is not liable to contradiction) or
again in the mouth of someone whose interests are
identical with ours (for he will not contradict), or

                    For my own part (for I will not conceal my
opinion, though it rests rather on actual examples
than on rules), I hold that the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of fact</hi>
                    more
than any portion of the speech should be adorned
with the utmost grace and charm. But much will
depend on the nature of the subject which we have
to set forth.
                    <milestone n="117" unit="section"/>
                    In slighter cases, such as are the
majority of private suits, the decoration must be
restrained and fit close to the subject, while the
utmost care must be exercised in choice of words.
The words which in our purple passages are swept
along by the force of our eloquence and lost in the
profusion of our language, must in cases such as
these be clear and, as Zeno says,
                    <quote>steeped with meaning.</quote>
                    The rhythm should be unobtrusive, but as
attractive as possible,
                    <milestone n="118" unit="section"/>
                    while the figures must neither
be derived from poetry nor such as are contrary to
current usage, though warranted by the authority of
antiquity (for it is important that our language should
be entirely normal), but should be designed to relieve
tedium by their variety and should be frequently
                    <pb id="p.115"/>
                    changed to relax the strain of attention. Thus we
shall avoid repeating the same terminations and
escape monotony of rhythm and a stereotyped turn
of phrase. For the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    lacks all the
other allurements of style and, unless it is characterised by this kind of charm, will necessarily fall flat.
                    <milestone n="119" unit="section"/>
                    Moreover there is no portion of a speech at which
the judge is more attentive, and consequently nothing
that is well said is lost. And the judge is, for some
reason or other, all the more ready to accept what
charms his ear and is lured by pleasure to belief.
                    <milestone n="120" unit="section"/>
                    When on the other hand the subject is on a larger
scale, we have a chance to excite horror by our
narration of abominable wrongs or pity by a tale
of woe: but we must do so in such a way as not to
exhaust our stock of emotions on the spot, but
merely to indicate our harrowing story in outline so
that it may at once be clear what the completed
picture is like to be.
                    <milestone n="121" unit="section"/>
                    Again I am far from disapproving of the introduction of some striking
sentence designed to stimulate the judge's jaded
palate. The best way of so doing is the interposition of a short sentence like the following:

                    If this was

practical purposes rather than display and the courts
were far stricter than to-day, how much more should
we do it now, when the passion for producing a
                    <pb id="p.117"/>
                    thrill of pleasure has forced its way even into cases
where a man's life or fortunes are in peril? I shall

popular taste in this respect: in the meantime I
shall admit that some such indulgence is necessary.

                    A powerful effect may be created if to the actual
facts of the case we add a plausible picture of what
occurred, such as will make our audience feel as if
they were actual eyewitnesses of the scene. Such
is the description introduced by Marcus Caelius in
his speech against Antonius.

however perceived the approach of the enemy and,
half-dead with terror, attempted to arouse Antonius,
called him by name, heaved up his head, but all in
vain, while one whispered endearing words into his
ear, and another slapped him with some violence.
At last he recognised the voice and touch of each
and tried to embrace her who happened to be
nearest. Once wakened he could not sleep, but
was too drunk to keep awake, and so was bandied
to and fro between sleeping and waking in the
hands of his centurions and his paramours.

                    There is another point to which I must call attention, namely the credit which accrues to the

                    from the authority of the speaker. Now

                    It is therefore
specially important in this part of our speech to avoid
anything suggestive of artful design, for the judge is
never more on his guard than at this stage. Nothing
must seem fictitious, nought betray anxiety; everything must seem to spring from the case itself rather
than the art of the orator.

                    But our modern orators
cannot endure this and imagine that their art is
wasted unless it obtrudes itself, whereas as a matter

We are the slaves of applause and think it the goal
of all our effort. And so we betray to the judges
what we wish to display to the bystanders.

                    It belongs to
declamation rather than forensic oratory, and was invented to enable the speaker (in view of the fact that
the statement should be brief) to set forth his facts
at greater length and with more profusion of ornament, as a means of exciting indignation or pity. I
think that this should be done but rarely and that
we should never go to the extent of repeating the

                    As regards the conclusion of the

                    there is a controversy with those who would have
the statement end where the issue to be determined
begins. Here is an example.
                    <quote>
                        After these events
the praetor Publius Dolabella issued an interdict in
the usual form dealing with rioting and employment
of armed men, ordering, without any exception, that
Aebutius should restore the property from which he
had ejected Caecina. He stated that he had done so.
A sum of money was deposited. It is for you to
decide to whom this money is to go.

                    III. In the natural order of things the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of fact</hi>
                    is followed by the
                    <hi rend="italics">verification.</hi>
                    For it
                    <pb id="p.123"/>
                    is necessary to prove the points which we stated
with the proof in view. But before I enter on this
portion, I have a few words to say on the opinions
held by certain rhetoricians. Most of them are in
the habit, as soon as they have completed the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts,</hi>
                    of digressing to some pleasant and
attractive topic with a view to securing the utmost
amount of favour from their audience.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    This practice
originated in the display of the schools of declaration and thence extended to the courts as soon as
causes came to be pleaded, not for the benefit of the
parties concerned, but to enable the advocates to
flaunt their talents. I imagine that they feared that
if the slender stream of concise statement, such as is
generally required, were followed by the pugnacious
tone inevitable in the arguing of the case, the speech
would fall flat owing to the postponement of the
pleasures of a more expansive eloquence.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    The objection to this practice lies in the fact that they do
this without the slightest consideration of the
difference between case and case or reflecting
whether what they are doing will in any way assist
them, on the assumption that it is always expedient
and always necessary. Consequently they transfer
striking thoughts from the places which they should
have occupied elsewhere and concentrate them in
this portion of the speech, a practice which involves
either the repetition of a number of things that they
have already said or their omission from the place
which was really theirs owing to the fact that they
have already been said.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    I admit however that this
form of digression can be advantageously appended,
not merely to the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts,</hi>
                    but to each of
the different questions or to the questions as a whole,
                    <pb id="p.125"/>
                    so long as the case demand, or at any rate permit it.
Indeed such a practice confers great distinction and
adornment on a speech, but only if the digression
fits in well with the rest of the speech and follows
naturally on what has preceded, not if it is thrust in
like a wedge parting what should naturally come
together.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    For there is no part of a speech so closely
connected with any other as the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement</hi>
                    with the
                    <hi rend="italics">proof,</hi>
                    though of course such a digression may be
intended as the conclusion of the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement</hi>
                    and the
beginning of the
                    <hi rend="italics">proof</hi>
                    There will therefore sometimes be room for digression; for example if the end
of the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement</hi>
                    has been concerned with some specially horrible theme, we may embroider the theme
as though our indignation must find immediate
vent.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    This, however, should only be done if
there is no question about the facts. Otherwise it is more important to verify your charge than
to heighten it, since the horrible nature of a charge
is in favour of the accused, until the charge is
proved. For it is just the most flagrant crimes that
are the most difficult to prove.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Again a digression
may be advantageous if after setting forth the services
rendered by your client to his opponent you denounce
the latter for his ingratitude, or after producing a
variety of charges in your statement, you point out
the serious danger in which the advancement of such
charges is likely to involve you.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    But all these digressions should be brief. For as soon as he has
heard the facts set forth in order, the judge is in a
hurry to get to the proof and desires to satisfy himself of the correctness of his impressions at the
earliest possible moment. Further, care must be
taken not to nullify the effect of the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement</hi>
                    by
                    <pb id="p.127"/>
                    diverting the minds of the court to some other theme
and wearying them by useless delay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    But, though such digressions are not always necessary at the end of the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement,</hi>
                    they may form a very
useful preparation for the examination of the main
question, more especially if at first sight it presents
an aspect unfavourable to our case, if we have to
support a harsh law or demand severe punishment.
For this is the place for inserting what may be
regarded as a second
                    <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi>
                    with a view to
exciting or mollifying the judge or disposing him
to lend a favouring ear to our proofs. Moreover we can do this with all the greater freedom
and vehemence at this stage of the proceedings
since the case is already known to the judge.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    We
shall therefore employ such utterances as emollients to soften the harder elements of our statement, in order that the ears of the jury may be
more ready to take in what we have to say in the
sequel and to grant us the justice which we ask.
For it is hard to persuade a man to do anything
against the grain.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    It is also important on such
occasions to know whether the judge prefers equity
or a strict interpretation of the law, since the necessity for such digression will vary accordingly.

                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Such passages may also serve as a kind of peroration after the main question. The Greeks call
this
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">pare/kbasis,</foreign>
                    the Romans
                    <hi rend="italics">egressus</hi>
                    or
                    <hi rend="italics">egressio</hi>
                    (digression). They may however, as I have said,
be of various kinds and may deal with different
themes in any portion of the speech. For instance
we may extol persons or places, describe regions,
record historical or even legendary occurrences.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    As
examples I may cite the praise of Sicily and the rape
                    <pb id="p.129"/>
                    of Proserpine

                    where the great orator as though the course of his
eloquence had been broken by the mere mention of
the general's name, interrupts the topic on which he
had already embarked and digresses forthwith to sing
his praises.

                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">pare/kbasis</foreign>
                    may, I think, be defined as the
handling of some theme, which must however have
some bearing on the case, in a passage that involves
digression from the logical order of our speech. I do
not see therefore why it should be assigned a special
position immediately following on the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    any more than I understand why they think
that the name is applicable only to a digression where
some statement has to be made, when there are so
many different ways in which a speech may leave
the direct route.
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    For whatever we say that falls
outside the five divisions of the speech already laid
down is a digression, whether it express indignation,
pity, hatred, rebuke, excuse, conciliation or be designed to rebut invective. Other similar occasions
for digression on points not involved by the question
at issue arise when we amplify or abridge a topic,
make any kind of emotional appeal or introduce any
of those topics which add such charm and elegance
to oratory, topics that is to say such as luxury,
avarice, religion, duty: but these would hardly
seem to be digressions as they are so closely attached
to arguments on similar subjects that they form part
of the texture of the speech.
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    There are however a
number of topics which are inserted in the midst of
matter which has no connexion with them, when
for example we strive to excite, admonish, appease,
entreat or praise the judge. Such passages are
                    <pb id="p.131"/>
                    innumerable. Some will have been carefully prepared beforehand, while others will be produced to
suit the occasion or the necessity of the moment, if
anything extraordinary should occur in the course of
our pleading, such as an interruption, the intervention of some individual or a disturbance.
                    <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    For example,
this made it necessary for Cicero to digress even in
the
                    <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi>
                    when he was defending Milo, as is
clear from the short speech
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        The speech actually delivered, not the long speech which

                    </note>
                    which he made on
that occasion. But the orator who makes some
preface to the main question or proposes to
follow up his proofs with a passage designed to
commend them to the jury, may digress at some
length. On the other hand, if he breaks as say in
the middle of his speech, he should not be long in
returning to the point from which he departed.

                    But it seems to me
that the beginning of every

                    is a
                    <hi rend="italics">proposition,</hi>
                    such as often occurs in the demonstration of the

                    But for the moment
I shall speak of the first kind. It is not always necessary to employ it.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    The nature of the main question
is sometimes sufficiently clear without any

                    especially if the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    ends exactly where
the question begins. Consequently the recapitulation generally employed in the case of arguments is
sometimes placed immediately after the statement
of facts.

                        It is expressly stated in the law that

                    Others, on the contrary, think that such a course is
dangerous to the speaker on two grounds, namely
that sometimes we may forget to perform what we
have promised and may, on the other hand, come
upon something which we have omitted in the

                    Besides, what can be simpler or clearer than a straightforward

                    ? It follows nature as a guide and
the adhesion to a definite method is actually of the
greatest assistance to the speaker's memory. Therefore I cannot approve the view even of those who
lay down that

                    should not extend beyond
the length of three

a danger, if our

                    may slip the memory of the judge and disturb his

tied down to a definite number of

                    since
the case may quite conceivably require more.

                    There
are further reasons why we should sometimes dispense with
                    <hi rend="italics">partition.</hi>
                    In the first place there are
many points which can be produced in a more
attractive manner, if they appear to be discovered on
the spot and not to have been brought ready made
from our study, but rather to have sprung from the
requirements of the case itself while we were speaking. Thus we get those not unpleasing figures such
as
                    <quote>It has almost escaped me,</quote>
                    <quote>I had forgotten,</quote>
                    or
                    <quote>You do well to remind me.</quote>
                    For if we set forth
all that we propose to prove in advance, we shall
deprive ourselves of the advantage springing from
tile charm of novelty.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Sometimes we shall even
have to hoodwink the judge and work upon him by
various artifices so that he may think that our aim is
other than what it really is. For there are cases
when a
                    <hi rend="italics">proposition</hi>
                    may be somewhat startling: if the
judge foresees this, he will shrink from it in advance,
like a patient who catches sight of the surgeon's
knife before the operation. On the other hand, if
we have given him no preliminary notice and our
words take him unawares, without his interest in
them having been previously roused by any warning,
we shall gain a credence which we should not have
secured had we stated that we were going to raise
the point.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    At times we must not merely avoid
distinguishing between the various questions, but must
omit them altogether, while our audience must be
distracted by appeals to the emotion and their attention diverted. For the duty of the orator is not
                    <pb id="p.141"/>
                    merely to instruct: the power of eloquence is greatest
in emotional appeals. Now there is no room for
passion if we devote our attention to minute and
microscopic division at a time when we are seeking
to mislead the judgment of the person who is trying
the case.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Again, there are certain arguments which
are weak and trivial when they stand alone, but
which have great force when produced in a body.
We must, therefore, concentrate such arguments,
and our tactics should be those of a sudden charge
in mass. This, however, is a practice which should
be resorted to but rarely and only under extreme
necessity when reason compels us to take a course
which is apparently irrational.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    In addition it must
be pointed out that in any
                    <hi rend="italics">partition</hi>
                    there is always
some one point of such special importance, that when
the judge has heard it he is impatient with the remainder, which he regards as superfluous. Consequently if we have to prove or refute a number of
points
                    <hi rend="italics">partition</hi>
                    will be both useful and attractive,
since it will indicate in order what we propose to say
on each subject. On the other hand, if we are defending one point on various grounds
                    <hi rend="italics">partition</hi>
                    will
be unnecessary.

                    in that case all the proofs
which you propose to bring before this, the final
proof, must needs seem superfluous to the judge.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    For the judge is always in a hurry to reach the most
important point. If he has a patient disposition he
will merely make a silent appeal to the advocate,
                    <pb id="p.143"/>
                    whom he will treat as bound by his promise. On
the other hand, if he is busy, or holds exalted
position, or is intolerant by nature, he will insist in
no very courteous manner on his coming to the point.

                    There are also a number who are in doubt as to

                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See III. vi 10.</note>
                    What, they ask, is the value of the
first part, if the second can be proved, since they are
mutually inconsistent, and if anyone employs both
arguments, we should believe neither? This contention is partially justified; we should employ the

                    But if we have any doubts as to being able
to prove the stronger argument, we shall do well to
rely on both. Different arguments move different
people. He who thinks that the act was committed
may regard it as a just act, while he who is deaf to
the plea that the act was just may perhaps believe
that it was never committed: one who is confident
of his powers as a marksman may be content with one
shaft, whereas he who has no such confidence will do
well to launch several and give fortune a chance to

the judges giving us only a grudging and reluctant hearing on the point of law, we shall have to
warn them with some frequency that we shall shortly

he discusses the law dealing with judicial corruption.
Occasionally we may stop, as though interrupted by
our clients, while often we shall address them and
exhort them to let us act as we think best. Thus
we shall make a gradual impression on the mind of
the judge, and, buoyed up by the hope that we are
going to clear our client's honour, he will be less ill-disposed toward the harder portions of our proof.
And when he has accepted these,

                    he will be all the
readier to listen to our defence of our client's

assistance to each other; the judge will be more
attentive to our legal proofs owing to his hope that
we shall proceed to a vindication of character and
better disposed to accept that vindication because

                    <hi rend="italics">partitions,</hi>
                    although Cicero more than once indulges in kindly
mockery of his habit of counting his headings on his
fingers. For there is a limit to gesture, and we must
be specially careful to avoid excessive minuteness and
any suggestion of articulated structure in
                    <hi rend="italics">our partition.</hi>
                    If our divisions are too small,
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    they cease to be limbs
and become fragments, and consequently detract not
a little from the authority of our speech. Moreover,
those who are ambitious of this sort of reputation,
in order that they may appear to enhance the nicety
and tile exhaustive nature of their division, introduce
what is superfluous and subdivide things which
naturally form a single whole. The result of their
labours is, however, not so much to increase the
number of their divisions as to diminish their importance, and after all is done and they have split
up their argument into a thousand tiny compartments,
they fall into that very obscurity which the
                    <hi rend="italics">partition</hi>
                    was designed to eliminate.

                    The
                    <hi rend="italics">proposition,</hi>
                    whether single or multiple, must,
on every occasion when it can be employed with
profit, be clear and lucid; for what could be more
discreditable than that a portion of the speech,
whose sole purpose is to prevent obscurity elsewhere, should itself be obscure? Secondly it must
be brief and must not be burdened with a single
superfluous word; for we are not explaining what
we
                    <hi rend="italics">are</hi>
                    saying, but what we are going to say.
                    <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>
                    We
must also ensure that it is free alike from omissions
and from redundance. Redundance as a rule occurs
through our dividing into
                    <hi rend="italics">species</hi>
                    when it would be
sufficient to divide into
                    <hi rend="italics">genera,</hi>
                    or through the addition of
                    <hi rend="italics">species</hi>
                    after stating the
                    <hi rend="italics">genus.</hi>
                    The following
will serve as an example:
                    <quote>I will speak of virtue, justice and abstinence.</quote>
                    But justice and abstinence
are
                    <hi rend="italics">species</hi>
                    of tile
                    <hi rend="italics">genus</hi>
                    virtue.
                    <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>
                    Our first
                    <hi rend="italics">partition</hi>
                    will be between admitted and disputed facts.
Admitted facts will then be divided into those
acknowledged by our opponent and those acknowledged by ourselves. Disputed facts will be divided
into those which we and those which our opponents
allege. But the worst fault of all is to treat your
points in an order different from that which was
assigned them in your
                    <hi rend="italics">proposition.</hi>
