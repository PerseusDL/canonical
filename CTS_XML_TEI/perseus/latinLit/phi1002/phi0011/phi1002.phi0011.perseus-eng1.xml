                    Having at length, after twenty years devoted to
the training of the young, obtained leisure for study,
I was asked by certain of my friends to write
something on the art of speaking. For a long time I
resisted their entreaties, since I was well aware that
some of the most distinguished Greek and Roman
writers had bequeathed to posterity a number of
works dealing with this subject, to the composition
of which they had devoted the utmost care.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    This
seemed to me to be an admirable excuse for my refusal, but served merely to increase their enthusiasm.
They urged that previous writers on the subject had
expressed different and at times contradictory
opinions, between which it was very difficult to
choose. They thought therefore that they were
justified in imposing on me the task, if not of
discovering original views, at least of passing definite
judgment on those expressed by my predecessors.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    I was moved to comply not so much because I
felt confidence that I was equal to the task, as
                    <pb id="p.7"/>
                    because I had a certain compunction about refusing.
The subject proved more extensive than I had first
imagined; but finally I volunteered to shoulder a
task which was on a far larger scale than that which
I was originally asked to undertake. I wished on
the one hand to oblige my very good friends beyond
their requests, and on the other to avoid the beaten
track and the necessity of treading where others
had gone before.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    For almost all others who have
written on the art of oratory have started with the
assumption that their readers were perfect in all
other branches of education and that their own task
was merely to put the finishing touches to their
rhetorical training; this is due to the fact that they
either despised the preliminary stages of education
or thought that they were not their concern, since
the duties of the different branches of education
are distinct one from another, or else, and this
is nearer the truth, because they had no hope of
making a remunerative display of their talent in
dealing with subjects, which, although necessary,
are far from being showy: just as in architecture it
is the superstructure and not the foundations which
attracts the eye.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    I on the other hand hold that the
art of oratory includes all that is essential for the
training of an orator, and that it is impossible to reach
the summit in any subject unless we have first passed
through all the elementary stages. I shall not therefore refuse to stoop to the consideration of those
minor details, neglect of which may result in there
being no opportunity for more important things, and
propose to mould the studies of my orator from infancy, on the assumption that his whole education has
been entrusted to my charge.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    This work I dedicate
                    <pb id="p.9"/>
                    to you, Marcellus Victorius. You have been the truest
of friends to me and you have shown a passionate
enthusiasm for literature. But good as these reasons
are, they are not the only reasons that lead me to
regard you as especially worthy of such a pledge of
our mutual affection. There is also the consideration
that this book should prove of service in the
education of your son Geta, who, young though he
is, already shows clear promise of real talent. It has
been my design to lead my reader from the very
cradle of speech through all the stages of education
which can be of any service to our budding orator
till we have reached the very summit of the art.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    I
have been all the more desirous of so doing because
two books on the art of rhetoric are at present
circulating under my name, although never published
by me or composed for such a purpose. One is a
two days' lecture which was taken down by the boys
who were my audience. The other consists of such
notes as my good pupils succeeded in taking down
from a course of lectures on a somewhat more
extensive scale: I appreciate their kindness, but
they showed an excess of enthusiasm and a certain
lack of discretion in doing my utterances the honour
of publication.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently in the present work
although some passages remain the same, you will
find many alterations and still more additions, while
the whole theme will be treated with greater system
and with as great perfection as lies within my
power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    My aim, then, is the education of the perfect
orator. The first essential for such an one is that he
should be a good man, and consequently we demand
of him not merely the possession of exceptional
                    <pb id="p.11"/>
                    gifts of speech, but of all the excellences of character
as well.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    For I will not admit that the principles of
upright and honourable living should, as some have
held, be regarded as the peculiar concern of philosophy. The man who can really play his part as a
citizen and is capable of meeting the demands both
of public and private business, the man who can
guide a state by his counsels, give it a firm basis by
his legislation and purge its vices by his decisions as
a judge, is assuredly no other than the orator of our
quest.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    Wherefore, although I admit I shall make
use of certain of the principles laid down in philosophical textbooks, I would insist that such principles
have a just claim to form part of the subject-matter
of this work and do actually belong to the art of
oratory.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    I shall frequently be compelled to speak of
such virtues as courage, justice, self-control; in fact
scarcely a case comes up in which some one of these
virtues is not involved; every one of them requires
illustration and consequently makes a demand on
the imagination and eloquence of the pleader. I
ask you then, can there be any doubt that, wherever
imaginative power and amplitude of diction are required, the orator has a specially important part to
play?
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    These two branches of knowledge were, as
Cicero has clearly shown,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi>
                        iii. 15.
                    </note>
                    so closely united, not
merely in theory but in practice, that the same men
were regarded as uniting the qualifications of orator
and philosopher. Subsequently this single branch
of study split up into its component parts, and
thanks to the indolence of its professors was regarded as consisting of several distinct subjects.
As soon as speaking became a means of livelihood
and the practice of making an evil use of the
                    <pb id="p.13"/>
                    blessings of eloquence came into vogue, those who
had a reputation for eloquence ceased to study moral
philosophy, and ethics,
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    thus abandoned by the
orators, became the prey of weaker intellects. As
a consequence certain persons, disdaining the toil of
learning to speak well, returned to the task of
forming character and establishing rules of life and
kept to themselves what is, if we
                    <hi rend="italics">must</hi>
                    make a
division, the better part of philosophy, but presumptuously laid claim to the sole possession of the
title of philosopher, a distinction which neither the
greatest generals nor the most famous statesmen
and administrators have ever dared to claim for themselves. For they preferred the performance to the
promise of great deeds.
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    I am ready to admit that
many of the old philosophers inculcated the most excellent principles and practised what they preached.
But in our own day the name of philosopher has
too often been the mask for the worst vices. For
their attempt has not been to win the name of
philosopher by virtue and the earnest search for
wisdom; instead they have sought to disguise the
depravity of their characters by the assumption
of a stern and austere mien accompanied by the
wearing of a garb differing from that of their fellow
men.
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    Now as a matter of fact we all of us frequently
handle those themes which philosophy claims for its
own. Who, short of being an utter villain, does not
speak of justice, equity and virtue? Who (and even
common country-folk are no exception) does not
make some inquiry into the causes of natural phenomena? As for the special uses and distinctions of
words, they should be a subject of study common to
all who give any thought to the meaning of language.
                    <pb id="p.15"/>
                    <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    But it is surely the orator who will have the greatest
mastery of all such departments of knowledge and
the greatest power to express it in words. And if ever
he had reached perfection, there would be no need
to go to the schools of philosophy for the precepts of
virtue. As things stand, it is occasionally necessary
to have recourse to those authors who have, as I
said above, usurped the better part of the art of
oratory after its desertion by the orators and to
demand back what is ours by right, not with a view
to appropriating their discoveries, but to show them
that they have appropriated what in truth belonged
to others.
                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    Let our ideal orator then be such as to
have a genuine title to the name of philosopher: it
is not sufficient that he should be blameless in point
of character (for I cannot agree with those who hold
this opinion): he must also be a thorough master of
the science and the art of speaking, to an extent
that perhaps no orator has yet attained.
                    <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    Still we
must none the less follow the ideal, as was done by
not a few of the ancients, who, though they refused
to admit that the perfect sage had yet been found,
none the less handed down precepts of wisdom for
the use of posterity.
                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    Perfect eloquence is assuredly
a reality, which is not beyond the reach of human
intellect. Even if we fail to reach it, those whose
aspirations are highest, will attain to greater heights
than those who abandon themselves to premature
despair of ever reaching the goal and halt at the
very foot of the ascent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                    I have therefore all the juster claim to indulgence,
if I refuse to pass by those minor details which are
none the less essential to my task. My first book
will be concerned with the education preliminary to
                    <pb id="p.17"/>
                    the duties of the teacher of rhetoric. My second will
deal with the rudiments of the schools of rhetoric
and with problems connected with the essence of
rhetoric itself.
                    <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>
                    The next five will be concerned
with Invention, in which I include Arrangement.
The four following will be assigned to Eloquence,
under which head I include Memory and Delivery.
Finally there will be one book in which our complete orator will be delineated; as far as my feeble
powers permit, I shall discuss his character, the
rules which should guide him in undertaking,
studying and pleading cases, the style of his eloquence, the time at which he should cease to plead
cases and the studies to which he should devote
himself after such cessation.
                    <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                    In the course of these
discussions I shall deal in its proper place with
the method of teaching by which students will
acquire not merely a knowledge of those things
to which the name of art is restricted by certain
theorists, and will not only come to understand the
laws of rhetoric, but will acquire that which will
increase their powers of speech and nourish their
eloquence.
                    <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>
                    For as a rule the result of the dry textbooks on the art of rhetoric is that by straining
after excessive subtlety they impair and cripple
all the nobler elements of style, exhaust the lifeblood of the imagination and leave but the bare
bones, which, while it is right and necessary that
they should exist and be bound each to each by
their respective ligaments, require a covering of flesh
as well.
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    I shall therefore avoid the precedent set
by the majority and shall not restrict myself to this
narrow conception of my theme, but shall include in
my twelve books a brief demonstration of everything
                    <pb id="p.19"/>
                    which may seem likely to contribute to the education of an orator. For if I were to attempt to say
all that might be said on each subject, the book
would never be finished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>
                    There is however one point which I must emphasise before I begin, which is this. Without
natural gifts technical rules are useless. Consequently the student who is devoid of talent will
derive no more profit from this work than barren
soil from a treatise on agriculture.
                    <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>
                    There are, it is
true, other natural aids, such as the possession of a
good voice and robust lungs, sound health, powers of
endurance and grace, and if these are possessed only
to a moderate extent, they may be improved by
methodical training. In some cases, however, these
gifts are lacking to such an extent that their absence
is fatal to all such advantages as talent and study
can confer, while, similarly, they are of no profit in
themselves unless cultivated by skilful teaching, persistent study and continuous and extensive practice
in writing, reading and speaking.

                    I would, therefore, have a father conceive the
highest hopes of his son from the moment of his
birth. If he does so, he will be more careful about
the groundwork of his education. For there is
absolutely no foundation for the complaint that but
few men have the power to take in the knowledge
that is imparted to them, and that the majority are
so slow of understanding that education is a waste
of time and labour. On the contrary you will find
that most are quick to reason and ready to learn.
Reasoning comes as naturally to man as flying to
birds, speed to horses and ferocity to beasts of prey:
                    <pb id="p.21"/>
                    our minds are endowed by nature with such activity
and sagacity that the soul is believed to proceed
from heaven.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Those who are dull and unteachable
are as abnormal as prodigious births and monstrosities, and are but few in number. A proof of what
I say is to be found in the fact that boys commonly
show promise of many accomplishments, and when
such promise dies away as they grow up, this is
plainly due not to the failure of natural gifts, but to
lack of the requisite care. But, it will be urged,
there are degrees of talent.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Undoubtedly, I reply,
and there will be a corresponding variation in actual
accomplishment: but that there are any who gain
nothing from education, I absolutely deny. The
man who shares this conviction, must, as soon as he
becomes a father, devote the utmost care to fostering the promise shown by the son whom he destines
to become an orator.
                </p>

                    Above all see that the child's nurse speaks
correctly. The ideal, according to Chrysippus,
would be that she should be a philosopher: failing
that he desired that the best should be chosen, as
far as possible. No doubt the most important point
is that they should be of good character: but they
should speak correctly as well.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    It is the nurse that
the child first hears, and her words that he will first
attempt to imitate. And we are by nature most
tenacious of childish impressions, just as the flavour
first absorbed by vessels when new persists, and the
colour imparted by dyes to the primitive whiteness
of wool is indelible. Further it is the worst
impressions that are most durable. For, while what
is good readily deteriorates, you will never turn vice
                    <pb id="p.23"/>
                    into virtue. Do not therefore allow the boy to
become accustomed even in infancy to a style of
speech which he will subsequently have to unlearn.

                    As regards parents, I should like to see them as
highly educated as possible, and I do not restrict this
remark to fathers alone. We are told that the
eloquence of the Gracchi owed much to their
mother Cornelia, whose letters even to-day testify to
the cultivation of her style. Laelia, the daughter
of Gaius Laelius, is said to have reproduced the
elegance of her father's language in her own speech,
while the oration delivered before the triumvirs by
Hortensia, the daughter of Quintus Hortensius, is
still read and not merely as a compliment to her sex.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    And even those who have not had the fortune to
receive a good education should not for that reason
devote less care to their son's education; but should
on the contrary show all the greater diligence in
other matters where they can be of service to their
children.

                    I would urge that they should have had a thorough
education, or if they have not, that they should be
aware of the fact. There are none worse than
those, who as soon as they have progressed beyond
a knowledge of the alphabet delude themselves
into the belief that they are the possessors of real
knowledge. For they disdain to stoop to the
drudgery of teaching, and conceiving that they
have acquired a certain title to authority—a frequent
source of vanity in such persons—become imperious
or even brutal in instilling a thorough dose of their

                    If any of my readers regards me as somewhat
exacting in my demands, I would ask him to reflect
that it is no easy task to create an orator, even
though his education be carried out under the most
favourable circumstances, and that further and
greater difficulties are still before us. For continuous application, the very best of teachers and
a variety of exercises are necessary.

                    Therefore the
rules which we lay down for the education of our

method, but with the individual. Still if it should
prove impossible to secure the ideal nurse, the ideal

error and prevent its becoming a habit. But it must

                    I prefer that a boy should begin with Greek,
because Latin, being in general use, will be picked
up by him whether we will or no; while the fact
that Latin learning is derived from Greek is a
further reason for his being first instructed in the

                    I do not however desire that this principle
should be so superstitiously observed that he should
for long speak and learn only Greek, as is done in the
majority of cases. Such a course gives rise to many
faults of language and accent; the latter tends to
acquire a foreign intonation, while the former
through force of habit becomes impregnated with
Greek idioms, which persist with extreme obstinacy
even when we are speaking another tongue.

                    The
study of Latin ought therefore to follow at no great
distance and in a short time proceed side by side
with Greek. The result will be that, as soon as we
begin to give equal attention to both languages,
neither will prove a hindrance to the other.

                    Some hold that boys should not be taught to

however who hold that a child's mind should not be
allowed to lie fallow for a moment are wiser.
Chrysippus, for instance, though he gives the nurses
a three years' reign, still holds the formation of
the child's mind on the best principles to be a part
of their duties.

                    Why, again, since children are
capable of moral training, should they not be
capable of literary education? I am well aware
that during the whole period of which I am speaking
we can expect scarcely the same amount of progress
                    <pb id="p.29"/>
                    that one year will effect afterwards. Still those who
disagree with me seem in taking this line to spare
the teacher rather than the pupil.

                    What better
occupation can a child have so soon as he is able to
speak? And he must be kept occupied somehow or
other. Or why should we despise the profit to be
derived before the age of seven, small though it be?
For though the knowledge absorbed in the previous
years may be but little, yet the boy will be learning
something more advanced during that year, in which
he would otherwise have been occupied with something more elementary.
                    <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    Such progress each successive year increases the total, and the time gained
during childhood is clear profit to the period of
youth. Further as regards the years which follow
I must emphasise the importance of learning what
has to be learnt in good time. Let us not therefore
waste the earliest years: there is all the less excuse
for this, since the elements of literary training are
solely a question of memory, which not only exists
even in small children, but is specially retentive at
that age.

                    I am not however so blind to differences of age
as to think that the very young should be forced on
prematurely or given real work to do. Above all
things we must take care that the child, who is not
yet old enough to love his studies, does not come to
hate them and dread the bitterness which he has
once tasted, even when the years of infancy are
left behind. His studies must be made an amusement: he must be questioned and praised and
taught to rejoice when he has done well; sometimes
too, when he refuses instruction, it should be given
to some other to excite his envy, at times also he
                    <pb id="p.31"/>
                    must be engaged in competition and should be
allowed to believe himself successful more often than
not, while he should be encouraged to do his best by
such rewards as may appeal to his tender years.

                    These instructions may seem but trivialities in
view of the fact that I am professing to describe the
education of an orator. But studies, like men, have
their infancy, and as the training of the body which
is destined to grow to the fulness of strength begins
while the child is in his cradle and at his mother's
breast, so even the man who is destined to rise to
the heights of eloquence was once a squalling babe,
tried to speak in stammering accents and was
puzzled by the shapes of letters. Nor does the
fact that capacity for learning is inadequate, prove
that it is not necessary to learn anything.
                    <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>
                    No
one blames a father because he thinks that such
details should on no account be neglected in the
case of his own son. Why then should he be criticised who sets down for the benefit of the public
what he would be right to put into practice in his
own house? There is this further reason why he
should not be blamed. Small children are better
adapted for taking in small things, and just as the
body can only be trained to certain flexions of the
limbs while it is young and supple, so the acquisition
of strength makes the mind offer greater resistance
to the acquisition of most subjects of knowledge.

                    Would Philip of Macedon have wished that his son
Alexander should be taught the rudiments of letters
by Aristotle, the greatest philosopher of that age, or
would the latter have undertaken the task, if he had
not thought that even the earliest instruction is best
given by the most perfect teacher and has real
                    <pb id="p.33"/>
                    reference to the whole of education?
                    <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>
                    Let us assume
therefore that Alexander has been confided to our
charge and that the infant placed in our lap deserves
no less attention than he—though for that matter
every man's child deserves equal attention. Would
you be ashamed even in teaching him the alphabet
to point out some brief rules for his education?

                <p>
                    At any rate I am not satisfied with the course
(which I note is usually adopted) of teaching small
children the names and order of the letters before
their shapes.
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    Such a practice makes them slow
to recognise the letters, since they do not pay
attention to their actual shape, preferring to be
guided by what they have already learned by
rote. It is for this reason that teachers, when
they think they have sufficiently familiarised their
young pupils with the letters written in their
usual order, reverse that order or rearrange it in
every kind of combination, until they learn to know
the letters from their appearance and not from
the order in which they occur. It will be best
therefore for children to begin by learning their
appearance and names just as they do with men.
                    <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>
                    The method, however, to which we have objected in
teaching the alphabet, is unobjectionable when
applied to syllables. I quite approve on the other
hand of a practice which has been devised to
stimulate children to learn by giving them ivory
letters to play with, as I do of anything else that
may be discovered to delight the very young, the
sight, handling and naming of which is a pleasure.

                    As soon as the child has begun to know the
shapes of the various letters, it will be no bad thing
to have them cut as accurately as possible upon a
                    <pb id="p.35"/>
                    board, so that the pen may be guided along the
grooves. Thus mistakes such as occur with wax
tablets will be rendered impossible; for the pen
will be confined between the edges of the letters
and will be prevented from going astray. Further
by increasing the frequency and speed with which
they follow these fixed outlines we shall give steadiness to the fingers, and there will be no need to
guide the child's hand with our own.
                    <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>
                    The art of
writing well and quickly is not unimportant for our
purpose, though it is generally disregarded by persons
of quality. Writing is of the utmost importance
in the study which we have under consideration and
by its means alone can true and deeply rooted
proficiency be obtained. But a sluggish pen delays
our thoughts, while an unformed and illiterate hand
cannot be deciphered, a circumstance which necessitates another wearisome task, namely the dictation of what we have written to a copyist.
                    <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>
                    We shall
therefore at all times and in all places, and above all
when we are writing private letters to our friends,
find a gratification in the thought that we have not
neglected even this accomplishment.

                    As regards syllables, no short cut is possible: they
must all be learnt, and there is no good in putting
off learning the most difficult; this is the general
practice, but the sole result is bad spelling.
                    <milestone n="31" unit="section"/>
                    Further
we must beware of placing a blind confidence in a
child's memory. It is better to repeat syllables and
impress them on the memory and, when he is
reading, not to press him to read continuously or
with greater speed, unless indeed the clear and
obvious sequence of letters can suggest itself without
its being necessary for the child to stop to think.
                    <pb id="p.37"/>
                    The syllables once learnt, let him begin to construct
words with them and sentences with the words.
                    <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>
                    You will hardly believe how much reading is delayed
by undue haste. If the child attempts more than
his powers allow, the inevitable result is hesitation,
interruption and repetition, and the mistakes which
he makes merely lead him to lose confidence in what
he already knows.
                    <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>
                    Reading must therefore first be
sure, then connected, while it must be kept slow for
a considerable time, until practice brings speed
unaccompanied by error.

                    For to look to the right,
which is regularly taught, and to look ahead depends not so much on precept as on practice; since
it is necessary to keep the eyes on what follows
while reading out what precedes, with the resulting difficulty that the attention of the mind must
be divided, the eyes and voice being differently engaged. It will be found worth while, when the boy
begins to write out words in accordance with the
usual practice, to see that he does not waste his
labour in writing out common words of everyday
occurrence.

obscure words by the way and, while he is still engaged on the first rudiments, acquire what would
otherwise demand special time to be devoted to it.
And as we are still discussing minor details, I would
urge that the lines, which he is set to copy, should
not express thoughts of no significance, but convey
some sound moral lesson.

                    He will remember such
aphorisms even when he is an old man, and the impression made upon his unformed mind will contribute
to the formation of his character. He may also be
entertained by learning the sayings of famous men
                    <pb id="p.39"/>
                    and above all selections from the poets, poetry being
more attractive to children. For memory is most necessary to an orator, as I shall point out in its proper
place, and there is nothing like practice for strengthening and developing it. And at the tender age
of which we are now speaking, when originality is
impossible, memory is almost the only faculty which
can be developed by the teacher.

                    It will be worth
while, by way of improving the child's pronunciation
and distinctness of utterance, to make him rattle
off a selection of names and lines of studied difficulty:
they should be formed of a number of syllables
which go ill together and should be harsh and
rugged in sound: the Greeks call them

                    This sounds a trifling matter, but its omission will
result in numerous faults of pronunciation, which,

                    But the time has come for the boy to grow up
little by little, to leave the nursery and tackle his
studies in good earnest. This therefore is the place
to discuss the question as to whether it is better to
have him educated privately at home or hand him
over to some large school and those whom I may
call public instructors.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    The latter course has, I
know, won the approval of most eminent authorities
and of those who have formed the national character
of the most famous states. It would, however, be folly
to shut our eyes to the fact that there are some who
disagree with this preference for public education
owing to a certain prejudice in favour of private
tuition. These persons seem to be guided in the
main by two principles. In the interests of morality
they would avoid the society of a number of human
                    <pb id="p.41"/>
                    beings at an age that is specially liable to acquire
serious faults: I only wish I could deny the truth of
the view that such education has often been the
cause of the most discreditable actions. Secondly
they hold that whoever is to be the boy's teacher, he
will devote his time more generously to one pupil
than if he has to divide it among several.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    The first
reason certainly deserves serious consideration. If
it were proved that schools, while advantageous
to study, are prejudicial to morality, I should give
my vote for virtuous living in preference to even
supreme excellence of speaking. But in my opinion
the two are inseparable. I hold that no one can be
a true orator unless he is also a good man and,
even if he could be, I would not have it so. I will
therefore deal with this point first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is held that schools corrupt the morals.

                    It is
true that this is sometimes the case. But morals
may be corrupted at home as well. There are
numerous instances of both, as there are also of
the preservation of a good reputation under either
circumstance. The nature of the individual boy
and the care devoted to his education make all the
difference. Given a natural bent toward evil or
negligence in developing and watching over modest
behaviour in early years, privacy will provide equal
opportunity for sin. The teacher employed at
home may be of bad character, and there is just as
much danger in associating with bad slaves as there
is with immodest companions of good birth.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    On the
other hand if the natural bent be towards virtue,
and parents are not afflicted with a blind and torpid
indifference, it is possible to choose a teacher of the
highest character (and those who are wise will make
                    <pb id="p.43"/>
                    this their first object), to adopt a method of education of the strictest kind and at the same time to
attach some respectable man or faithful freedman to
their son as his friend and guardian, that his unfailing companionship may improve the character
even of those who gave rise to apprehension.

Would that we did not too often ruin our children's
character ourselves! We spoil them from the
cradle. That soft upbringing, which we call kindness, saps all the sinews both of mind and body. If
the child crawls on purple, what will he not desire

can distinguish scarlet and cries for the very best
brand of purple. We train their palates before we

Hence springs habit, and habit in time becomes
second nature. The poor children learn these things

                    On the other hand in the case of inferior teachers a consciousness of their own defects
not seldom reconciles them to being attached to a

                    But let us assume that influence, money or friendship succeed in securing a paragon of learning to
teach the boy at home. Will he be able to devote
the whole day to one pupil? Or can we demand
such continuous attention on the part of the learner?
The mind is as easily tired as the eye, if given no
relaxation. Moreover by far the larger proportion
of the learner's time ought to be devoted to private
study.

                    The teacher does not stand over him while
he is writing or thinking or learning by heart. While
he is so occupied the intervention of anyone, be he
who he may, is a hindrance. Further, not all reading requires to be first read aloud or interpreted by
a master. If it did, how would the boy ever become
acquainted with all the authors required of him? A
small time only is required to give purpose and
direction to the day's work, and consequently
individual instruction can be given to more than one
pupil.

                    There are moreover a large number of
subjects in which it is desirable that instruction
should be given to all the pupils simultaneously.

                    The voice of a lecturer is not like a dinner which
will only suffice for a limited number; it is like the
sun which distributes the same quantity of light and
heat to all of us. So too with the teacher of
literature. Whether he speak of style or expound
disputed passages, explain stories or paraphrase
poems, everyone who hears him will profit by his
teaching.
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    But, it will be urged, a large class is
unsuitable for the correction of faults or for explanation. It may be inconvenient: one cannot hope for
absolute perfection; but I shall shortly contrast the
inconvenience with the obvious advantages.

                <p>
                    Still I do not wish a boy to be sent where he will
be neglected. But a good teacher will not burden
himself with a larger number of pupils than he can
manage, and it is further of the very first importance that he should be on friendly and intimate
terms with us and make his teaching not a duty
but a labour of love. Then there will never be
any question of being swamped by the number of
our fellow-learners.

                    Moreover any teacher who has
the least tincture of literary culture will devote
special attention to any boy who shows signs of
industry and talent; for such a pupil will redound
to his own credit. But even if large schools are to
be avoided, a proposition from which I must dissent
if the size be due to the excellence of the teacher,
it does not follow that all schools are to be avoided.
It is one thing to avoid them, another to select the
best.

                    It is above all things necessary that our future orator, who will have to live
in the utmost publicity and in the broad daylight of
public life, should become accustomed from his
childhood to move in society without fear and
habituated to a life far removed from that of the
pale student, the solitary and recluse. His mind
requires constant stimulus and excitement, whereas
retirement such as has just been mentioned induces
languor and the mind becomes mildewed like things
that are left in the dark, or else flies to the opposite
extreme and becomes puffed up with empty conceit;
for he who has no standard of comparison by which
to judge his own powers will necessarily rate them
too high.

                    Again when the fruits of his study have
to be displayed to the public gaze, our recluse is
blinded by the sun's glare, and finds everything new
and unfamiliar, for though he has learnt what is required to be done in public, his learning is but the
theory of a hermit.
                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    I say nothing of friendships
which endure unbroken to old age having acquired
the binding force of a sacred duty: for initiation
in the same studies has all the sanctity of initiation
in the same mysteries of religion. And where shall
he acquire that instinct which we call common
feeling, if he secludes himself from that intercourse
which is natural not merely to mankind but even to
dumb animals?
                    <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                    Further, at home he can only learn
what is taught to himself, while at school he will
learn what is taught others as well. He will hear
many merits praised and many faults corrected every
day: he will derive equal profit from hearing the
indolence of a comrade rebuked or his industry
commended.
                    <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>
                    Such praise will incite him to

                    emulation, he will think it a disgrace to be outdone by
his contemporaries and a distinction to surpass his
seniors. All such incentives provide a valuable
stimulus, and though ambition may be a fault in
itself, it is often the mother of virtues.
                    <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                    I remember
that my own masters had a practice which was not
without advantages. Having distributed the boys
in classes, they made the order in which they were
to speak depend on their ability, so that the boy
who had made most progress in his studies had the
privilege of declaiming first.
                    <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>
                    The performances
on these occasions were criticised. To win commendation was a tremendous honour, but the prize
most eagerly coveted was to be the leader of the
class. Such a position was not permanent. Once a
month the defeated competitors were given a fresh
opportunity of competing for the prize. Consequently success did not lead the victor to relax his
efforts, while the vexation caused by defeat served
as an incentive to wipe out the disgrace.
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    I will
venture to assert that to the best of my memory
this practice did more to kindle our oratorical ambitions than all the exhortations of our instructors,
the watchfulness of our

                    Further while emulation promotes
progress in the more advanced pupils, beginners who
are still of tender years derive greater pleasure from
imitating their comrades than their masters, just
because it is easier. For children still in the elementary stages of education can scarce dare hope to
reach that complete eloquence which they understand to be their goal: their ambition will not soar
so high, but they will imitate the vine which has to
grasp the lower branches of the tree on which it is
                    <pb id="p.53"/>
                    trained before it can reach the topmost boughs.

                    So
true is this that it is the master's duty as well, if he
is engaged on the task of training unformed minds
and prefers practical utility to a more ambitious
programme, not to burden his pupils at once with
tasks to which their strength is unequal, but to curb
his energies and refrain from talking over the heads
of his audience.

not receive liquids if too much be poured into them

drop; similarly you must consider how much a
child's mind is capable of receiving: the things
which are beyond their grasp will not enter their
minds, which have not opened out sufficiently to
take them in.
                    <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>
                    It is a good thing therefore that a
boy should have companions whom he will desire
first to imitate and then to surpass: thus he will be
led to aspire to higher achievement. I would add
that the instructors themselves cannot develop the
same intelligence and energy before a single listener
as they can when inspired by the presence of a
numerous audience.

                    For eloquence depends in the main on the state
of the mind, which must be moved, conceive images
and adapt itself to suit the nature of the subject
which is the theme of speech. Further the loftier
and the more elevated the mind, the more powerful
will be the forces which move it: consequently
praise gives it growth and effort increase, and the
thought that it is doing something great fills it with
joy.

                    The duty of stooping to expend that power of
speaking which has been acquired at the cost of such
effort upon an audience of one gives rise to a silent
                    <pb id="p.55"/>
                    feeling of disdain, and the teacher is ashamed to
raise his voice above the ordinary conversational
level. Imagine the air of a declaimer, or the voice
of an orator, his gait, his delivery, the movements of
his body, the emotions of his mind, and, to go no
further, the fatigue of his exertions, all for the sake
of one listener! Would he not seem little less than
a lunatic? No, there would be no such thing as
eloquence, if we spoke only with one person at
a time.

                    The skilful teacher will make it his first care,
as soon as a boy is entrusted to him, to ascertain his
ability and character. The surest indication in
a child is his power of memory. The characteristics of a good memory are twofold: it must be
quick to take in and faithful to retain impressions
of what it receives. The indication of next importance is the power of imitation: for this is a
sign that the child is teachable: but he must imitate
merely what he is taught, and must not, for
example, mimic someone's gait or bearing or defects.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    For I have no hope that a child will turn
out well who loves imitation merely for the purpose
of raising a laugh. He who is really gifted will also
above all else be good. For the rest, I regard
slowness of intellect as preferable to actual badness. But a good boy will be quite unlike the
dullard and the sloth.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    My ideal pupil will absorb
instruction with ease and will even ask some
questions; but he will follow rather than anticipate
his teacher. Precocious intellects rarely produce
sound fruit.

                    By the precocious I mean those who

                    without being asked: but their accomplishments are
only of the most obvious kind: they string words together and trot them out boldly and undeterred by
the slightest sense of modesty. Their actual achievement is small, but what they can do they perform with
ease.

                    They have no real power and what they have
is but of shallow growth: it is as when we cast
seed on the surface of the soil: it springs up too
rapidly, the blade apes the loaded ear, and yellows
ere harvest time, but bears no grain. Such tricks
please us when we contrast them with the performer's age, but progress soon stops and our admiration withers away.

                    Such indications once noted, the teacher must next
consider what treatment is to be applied to the mind
of his pupil. There are some boys who are slack,
unless pressed on; others again are impatient of
control: some are amenable to fear, while others are
paralysed by it: in some cases the mind requires
continued application to form it, in others this result
is best obtained by rapid concentration. Give me
the boy who is spurred on by praise, delighted by
success and ready to weep over failure.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Such an

rebuke will bite him to the quick; honour will be a

                    Still, all our pupils will require some relaxation,
not merely because there is nothing in this world
that can stand continued strain and even unthinking
and inanimate objects are unable to maintain their
strength, unless given intervals of rest, but because
study depends on the good will of the student, a
quality that cannot be secured by compulsion.

                    Consequently if restored and refreshed by a holiday

                    they will bring greater energy to their learning and
approach their work with greater spirit of a kind
that will not submit to be driven.

                    I approve of play
in the young; it is a sign of a lively disposition; nor
will you ever lead me to believe that a boy who is
gloomy and in a continual state of depression is ever
likely to show alertness of mind in his work, lacking
as he does the impulse most natural to boys of his
age.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    Such relaxation must not however be unlimited: otherwise the refusal to give a holiday will
make boys hate their work, while excessive indulgence will accustom them to idleness. There are
moreover certain games which have an educational
value for boys, as for instance when they compete
in posing each other with all kinds of questions
which they ask turn and turn about.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Games
too reveal character in the most natural way, at
least that is so if the teacher will bear in mind
that there is no child so young as to be unable to
learn to distinguish between right and wrong, and
that the character is best moulded, when it is still
guiltless of deceit and most susceptible to instruction: for once a bad habit has become engrained,
it is easier to break than bend.

                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    in either case the method
is the same. This profession may be most briefly
considered under two heads, the art of speaking
correctly and the interpretation of the poets; but
there is more beneath the surface than meets the
eye.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    For the art of writing is combined with that of
speaking, and correct reading precedes interpretation, while in each of these cases criticism has its
work to perform. The old school of teachers indeed
carried their criticism so far that they were not
content with obelising lines or rejecting books whose
titles they regarded as spurious, as though they
were expelling a supposititious child from the family
circle, but also drew up a canon of authors, from
which some were omitted altogether.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Nor is it
sufficient to have read the poets only; every kind of
writer must be carefully studied, not merely for the
subject matter, but for the vocabulary; for words
often acquire authority from their use by a particular
author. Nor can such training be regarded as complete if it stop short of music, for the teacher of
literature has to speak of metre and rhythm: nor
again if he be ignorant of astronomy, can he understand the poets; for they, to mention no further points,
frequently give their indications of time by reference
to the rising and setting of the stars. Ignorance of
philosophy is an equal drawback, since there are
numerous passages in almost every poem based on
the most intricate questions of natural philosophy,
while among the Greeks we have Empedocles and
among our own poets Varro and Lucretius, all of
                    <pb id="p.65"/>
                    whom have expounded their philosophies in verse.

                    No small powers of eloquence also are required to
enable the teacher to speak appropriately and
fluently on the various points which have just been
mentioned. For this reason those who criticise the
art of teaching literature as trivial and lacking in
substance put themselves out of court. Unless the
foundations of oratory are well and truly laid by
the teaching of literature, the superstructure will

                    The elementary stages of the teaching of literature must not therefore be despised as trivial. It is
of course an easy task to point out the difference
between vowels and consonants, and to subdivide the
latter into semivowels and mutes. But as the pupil
gradually approaches the inner shrine of the sacred
place, he will come to realise the intricacy of the subject, an intricacy calculated not merely to sharpen the
wits of a boy, but to exercise even the most profound
knowledge and erudition.

                    It is not every ear that
can appreciate the correct sound of the different
letters. It is fully as hard as to distinguish the
different notes in music. But all teachers of literature will condescend to such minutiae: they
will discuss for instance whether certain necessary
letters are absent from the alphabet, not indeed
when we are writing Greek words (for then we
borrow two letters
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Y and Z.</note>
                    from them), but in the case of
genuine Latin words:
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    for example in words such as
                    <hi rend="italics">seruus</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">uulgus</hi>
                    we feel the lack of the Aeolic
digamma; there is also a sound intermediate between

                    Again there is the question whether certain letters
are not superfluous, not to mention the mark of the
aspirate, to which, if it is required at all, there
should be a corresponding symbol to indicate the
opposite: for instance
                    <hi rend="italics">k,</hi>
                    which is also used as an
abbreviation for certain nouns, and
                    <hi rend="italics">q,</hi>
                    which, though
slanted slightly more by us, resembles both in sound
and shape the Greek
                    <hi rend="italics">koppa,</hi>
                    now used by the Greeks
solely as a numerical sign

                    the last

                    Again the teacher of
literature will have to determine whether certain
vowels have not been consonantalised. For instance
                    <hi rend="italics">iam</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">etiam</hi>
                    are both spelt with an
                    <hi rend="italics">i, uos</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">tuos</hi>
                    both with a
                    <hi rend="italics">u.</hi>
                    Vowels, however, when joined as
vowels, either make one long vowel (compare the
obsolete method of indicating a long vowel by
doubling it as the equivalent of the circumflex),
or a diphthong, though some hold that even three
vowels can form a single syllable; this however is
only possible if one or more assume the role of
consonants.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    He will also inquire why it is that
there are two vowels which may be repeated, while
a consonant can only be followed and modified by
a different consonant.

                    must be

mention Aristarchus and in our own day Palaemon,

of the genus noun. Those on the other hand who
distinguish between the noun and the vocable, make
nine parts of speech. But yet again there are
some who differentiate between the vocable and the
appellation, saying that the

be familiar with their various kinds and qualities,
their different persons and numbers. Such subjects belong to the elementary school and the
rudiments of knowledge. Some, however, will
find points undetermined by inflexion somewhat
perplexing. For there are certain participles, about
which there may be doubts as to whether they are
really nouns or verbs, since their meaning varies
with their use, as for example

                    A single word is more likely to be faulty than
to possess any intrinsic merit. For though we
may speak of a word as appropriate, distinguished

save in relation to connected and consecutive speech;
since when we praise words, we do so because they
suit the matter.

making the first syllable acute; or again the substitution of the circumflex for the grave on the
second syllable of
                    <hi rend="italics">Appi,</hi>
                    where the contraction of
two syllables into one circumflexed syllable involves
a double error.

                    This, however, occurs far more frequently in Greek words such as
                    <hi rend="italics">Atrei,</hi>
                    which in our
young days was pronounced by the most learned of
our elders with an acute accent on the first syllable,
necessitating a grave accent on the second; the
same remark applies to
                    <hi rend="italics">Nerei</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">Terei.</hi>
                    Such has
been the tradition as regards accents.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        The Roman accent was a stress, while the Greek was a
pitch accent, though by the Christian era tending to change
into stress. Roman grammarians borrow the Greek terminology and speak of accents in terms of pitch. The explanation of this is probably that the Roman stress accent was
accompanied by an elevation of the pitch. Here the acute
accent certainly implies stress; the grave implies a drop in
pitch and the absence of stress. The circumflex means that
the voice rises slightly and then falls slightly, but implies
stress. See Lindsay,

                    Still I am well aware that certain learned men
and some professed teachers of literature, to ensure
that certain words may be kept distinct, sometimes
place an acute accent on the last syllable, both when
they are teaching and in ordinary speech: as, for
instance, in the following passage:
                    <quote rend="blockquote">

                    acute on
the ground that, if that syllable were given the grave
accent, it might be thought that they meant
                    <hi rend="italics">circus</hi>
                    not
                    <hi rend="italics">circuitus.</hi>

                    Similarly when
                    <hi rend="italics">quale</hi>
                    is interrogative,
they give the final syllable a grave accent, but when
using it in a comparison, make it acute. This practice,
however, they restrict almost entirely to adverbs
and pronouns; in other cases they follow the old
usage.

                    Personally I think that in such phrases
as these the circumstances are almost entirely altered
by the fact that we join two words together. For
when I say
                    <hi rend="italics">circum litora</hi>
                    I pronounce the phrase as
one word, concealing the fact that it is composed of
two, consequently it contains but one acute accent,
as though it were a single word. The same thing
occurs in the phrase
                    <hi rend="italics">Troiae qui primus ab oris.</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">Aen. i.</hi>
                        l:
                        <hi rend="italics">qui</hi>
                        coalesces with
                        <hi rend="italics">primus, ab</hi>
                        with

                    It
sometimes happens that the accent is altered by
the metre as in pecudes pictaeque volucres
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">Georg.</hi>

                    </note>
                    ; for I shall
read
                    <hi rend="italics">volucres</hi>
                    with the acute on the middle syllable,
because, although that syllable is short by nature, it
is long by position: else the last two syllables
would form an iambus, which its position in the
hexameter does not allow.
                    <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>
                    But these same words,
if separated, will form no exception to the rule: or
if the custom under discussion prevails, the old law
                    <pb id="p.93"/>
                    of the language will disappear. (This law is more
difficult for the Greeks to observe, because they
have several dialects, as they call them, and what is
wrong in one may be right in another.) But with us
the rule is simplicity itself.
                    <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>
                    For in every word
the acute accent is restricted to three syllables,
whether these be the only syllables in the word or
the three last, and will fall either on the penultimate
or the antepenultimate. The middle of the three
syllables of which I speak will be acute or circumflexed, if long, while if it be short, it will have a
grave accent and the acute will be thrown back to
the preceding syllable, that is to say the antepenultimate.
                    <milestone n="31" unit="section"/>
                    Every word has an acute accent, but
never more than one. Further the acute never falls
on the last syllable and therefore in dissyllabic words
marks the first syllable. Moreover the acute accent
and the circumflex are never found in one and the
same word, since the circumflex itself contains an
acute accent. Neither the circumflex nor the acute,
therefore, will ever be found in the last syllable of
a Latin word, with this exception, that monosyllables
must either be acute or circumflexed; otherwise we
should find words without an acute accent at all.

                    There are also faults of sound, which we cannot reproduce in writing, as they spring from defects of the
voice and tongue. The Greeks who are happier in
inventing names than we are call them iotacisms,
lambdacisms,

                    There are also certain peculiar and
indescribable sounds for which we sometimes take
whole nations to fault. To sum up then, if all the
faults of which we have just spoken be avoided,

                    All other faults in speaking are concerned with
more words than one; among this class of faults is
the

                    although there have been controversies
about this as well. For even those who acknowledge
that it occurs in connected speech, argue that, since
it can be corrected by the alteration of one word,
the fault lies in the word and not in the phrase or
sentence.

personally I object to neither, as Vergil is the
author of both; however, for the sake of argument
let us assume that one of the two is incorrect), still
whichever phrase is incorrect, it can be set right by
the alteration of the word in which the fault lies:
that is to say we can emend either to
                    <hi rend="italics">amari corticis</hi>
                    or
                    <hi rend="italics">media cortice.</hi>
                    But it is obvious that these critics
misrepresent the case. For neither word is faulty
in itself; the error arises from its association with
another word. The fault therefore lies in the
phrase.

in a single word, but with this proviso: there must
be something else equivalent to another word, to
which the word, in which the error lies, can be
referred, so that the

                    About substitution, that is
when one word is used instead of another, there is
no dispute. It is an error which we may detect in
connexion with all the parts of speech, but most
frequently in the verb, because it has greater variety
                    <pb id="p.99"/>
                    than any other: consequently in connexion with the
verb we get

                    native or foreign. Foreign words, like our population

Livy for his lapses into the dialect of Padua, I may be

Many Gallic words have become current coin,

the latter.
                    <hi rend="italics">Mappa</hi>
                    (napkin) again, a word familiar

                    But this distinction between
native and foreign words has reference chiefly to
Greek. For Latin is largely derived from that
language, and we use words which are admittedly
Greek to express things for which we have no Latin
equivalent. Similiarly they at tines borrow words
from us. In this connexion the problem arises
whether foreign words should be declined according
to their language or our own.

                    If you come across
an archaistic grammarian, he will insist on absolute
conformity to Latin practice, because, since we have
an ablative and the Greeks have not, it would be
absurd in declining a word to use five Greek
cases and one Latin.

of foreign practices. They, therefore, pronounced
                    <hi rend="italics">Castorem</hi>
                    with the second syllable long to bring it

                    <hi rend="italics">Plato</hi>
                    (the last being adopted by Cicero),
because they could not find any Latin nouns ending

                    <hi rend="italics">-e.</hi>
                    On the same
principle they placed an acute accent on the middle
syllable of

                    and

                    because Latin does

                    together with many other analogous forms. More recent
scholars have instituted the practice of giving Greek
nouns their Greek declension, although this is not
always possible. Personally I prefer to follow the
Latin method, so far as grace of diction will permit.
For I should not like to say

                    although Gaius Caesar in deference to
antiquity does adopt this way of declining it. Current
practice has however prevailed over his authority.

the Greek form: they will not be speaking Latin,

Reason finds its chief support in analogy and sometimes in etymology. As for antiquity, it is commended to us by the possession of a certain majesty, I

merely reveal the gender: for instance, to return to
a word previously used as an illustration,
                    <hi rend="italics">funiculus</hi>
                    proves that
                    <hi rend="italics">funis</hi>

                    is short, we can prove this to be an error,
because all verbs which in the indicative terminate
in
                    <hi rend="italics">-eo,</hi>
                    make the middle syllable of the infinitive

                    It is also possible in certain
cases to discover the present indicative of a verb from
the study of its other tenses. I remember, for instance, refuting certain scholars who criticised me for
using the word

                    for, although they admitted
that it had been used by some of the best authors,
they asserted that it was an irrational form because
the present indicative
                    <hi rend="italics">paciscor,</hi>
                    being passive in
form, made

                    I in addition
to quoting the authority of orators and historians
maintained that I was also supported by analogy.
For when I found
                    <hi rend="italics">ni ita pacunt</hi>

I noted that
                    <hi rend="italics">cadunt</hi>
                    provided a parallel: it was clear
therefore that the present indicative, though now
obsolete, was
                    <hi rend="italics">paco</hi>
                    on the analogy of
                    <hi rend="italics">cado,</hi>

was further obvious that we say

                    cannot be universally applied,

each other closely in the nominative, differ in the
plural and in the other cases, they reply that they
are not true parallels, since

between letters, they would realize that
                    <hi rend="italics">robur</hi>
                    makes
its genitive
                    <hi rend="italics">roboris</hi>
                    in precisely the same way that

                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">uindex</hi>

                    not to mention other
words to which I have already referred.

                    Do not nouns
which are similar in the nominative show, as I have
already observed, quite different terminations in the
oblique eases? Compare
                    <hi rend="italics">uirgo</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">Iuno, lusus</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">fusus, caspis</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">puppis</hi>
                    and a thousand others.
Again some nouns are not used in the plural, while
others are not used in the singular, some are indeclinable, while others, like
                    <hi rend="italics">Jupiter,</hi>
                    in the oblique
cases entirely abandon the form of the nominative.

                    The same is true of verbs: for instance
                    <hi rend="italics">fero</hi>
                    disappears in the perfect and subsequent tenses. Nor
does it matter greatly whether such forms are nonexistent or too harsh to use. For what is the genitive singular of
                    <hi rend="italics">progenies</hi>
                    or the genitive plural of
                    <hi rend="italics">spes?</hi>
                    Or how will
                    <hi rend="italics">quire</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">ruere</hi>
                    form a perfect passive or
passive participles.
                    <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>
                    Why should I mention other
words when it is even doubtful whether the genitive
of
                    <hi rend="italics">senatus</hi>
                    is
                    <hi rend="italics">senati</hi>
                    or
                    <hi rend="italics">senatus?</hi>
                    In view of what I
have said, it seems to me that the remark, that it
is one thing to speak Latin and another to speak
grammar, was far from unhappy. So much for

                    Etymology is sometimes of the utmost use, whenever the word under discussion needs interpretation.

                    For instance Marcus Caelius wishes to prove that he

                    not because he is abstemious (for he

                    Such a science
demands profound erudition, whether we are dealing with the large number of words which are
derived from the Greek, more especially those
inflected according to the practice of the Aeolic
dialect, the form of Greek which most nearly
resembles Latin; or are using ancient historians as
a basis for inquiry into the origin of names of men,
places, nations and cities. For instance what is the
origin of names such as
                    <hi rend="italics">Brutus, Publicola,</hi>
                    or

                    I now turn to minor points concerning which
enthusiasts for etymology give themselves an

                    infinity of trouble, restoring to their true form words
which have become slightly altered: the methods
which they employ are varied and manifold: they
shorten them or lengthen them, add, remove, or
interchange letters and syllables as the case may be.
As a result perverseness of judgment leads to the
most hideous absurdities. I am ready to admit that
                    <hi rend="italics">consul</hi>
                    may be derived from
                    <hi rend="italics">consulere</hi>
                    in the sense of
consulting or judging; for the ancients used
                    <hi rend="italics">consulere</hi>
                    in the latter sense, and it still survives in the

                    Archaic words not only enjoy the patronage of
distinguished authors, but also give style a certain

age behind them, and for the very reason that they
have fallen into desuetude, produce an attractive
effect not unlike that of novelty.

                    Religion, it is true,

we must treat them as sacred things. But what a

plain! Consequently in the case of old words the

although the use of words transmitted to us by the

what is right should please the majority? The
practices of depilation, of dressing the hair in
tiers, or of drinking to excess at the baths, although
they may have thrust their way into society, cannot claim the support of usage, since there is something to blame in all of them (although we have
usage on our side when we bathe or have our
hair cut or take our meals together). So too in
speech we must not accept as a rule of language
words and phrases that have become a vicious habit

                    Having stated the rules which we must
follow in speaking, I will now proceed to lay down
the rules which must be observed when we write.
Such rules are called
                    <hi rend="italics">orthography</hi>
                    by the Greeks; let
us style it the science of writing correctly. This
science does not consist merely in the knowledge of
the letters composing each syllable (such a study
is beneath the dignity of a teacher of grammar),
but, in my opinion, develops all its subtlety in connexion with doubtful points.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    For instance, while it
is absurd to place a circumflex over all long syllables
since the quantity of most syllables is obvious from
the very nature of the word which is written, it is
all the same occasionally necessary, since the same
letter involves a different meaning according as it is
long or short. For example we determine whether
                    <hi rend="italics">mains</hi>
                    is to mean an
                    <quote>apple tree</quote>
                    or a
                    <quote>bad man</quote>
                    by
the use of the circumflex;
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">palus</hi>
                    means a
                    <quote>stake,</quote>
                    if
the first syllable is long, a
                    <quote>marsh,</quote>
                    if it be short;
again when the same letter is short in the nominative
and long in the ablative, we generally require the
circumflex to make it clear which quantity to understand.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Similarly it has been held that we should
observe distinctions such as the following: if the
preposition
                    <hi rend="italics">ex</hi>
                    is compounded with
                    <hi rend="italics">specto,</hi>
                    there will
be an
                    <hi rend="italics">s</hi>
                    in the second syllable, while there will be no
                    <hi rend="italics">s</hi>
                    if it is compounded with
                    <hi rend="italics">pecto.</hi>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Again the following distinction has frequently been observed:
                    <hi rend="italics">ad</hi>
                    is
spelt with a
                    <hi rend="italics">d</hi>
                    when it is a preposition, but with a
                    <hi rend="italics">t</hi>
                    when it is a conjunction, while
                    <hi rend="italics">cum</hi>
                    is spelt
                    <hi rend="italics">quum</hi>
                    when it denotes time, but
                    <hi rend="italics">cum</hi>
                    when it denotes
accompaniment.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Still more pedantic are the practices
of making the fourth letter of
                    <hi rend="italics">quidquid</hi>
                    a
                    <hi rend="italics">c</hi>
                    to avoid
the appearance of repeating a question, and of writing

                    <hi rend="italics">quotidie</hi>
                    instead of
                    <hi rend="italics">colidie</hi>
                    to show that it stands for
                    <hi rend="italics">quot diebus.</hi>
                    But such practices have disappeared
into the limbo of absurdities.

                    It is often debated whether in our spelling of
prepositions we should be guided by their sound
when compounded, or separate. For instance when
I say
                    <hi rend="italics">optinuit,</hi>
                    logic demands that the second
letter should be a
                    <hi rend="italics">b,</hi>
                    while to the ear the sound is
rather that of
                    <hi rend="italics">p:</hi>
                    or again take the case of
                    <hi rend="italics">immunis:</hi>
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    the letter
                    <hi rend="italics">n,</hi>
                    which is required by strict adherence to
fact, is forced by the sound of the
                    <hi rend="italics">m.</hi>
                    which follows
to change into another
                    <hi rend="italics">m.</hi>
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    We must also note when
analysing compound words, whether the middle
consonant adheres to the preceding syllable or to
that which follows. For example since the latter
part of
                    <hi rend="italics">haruspex</hi>
                    is from
                    <hi rend="italics">spectare,</hi>
                    the
                    <hi rend="italics">s</hi>
                    must be
assigned to the third syllable. In
                    <hi rend="italics">abstemius</hi>
                    on the
other hand it will go with the first syllable since the
word is derived from
                    <hi rend="italics">abstinentia temeti,</hi>
                    <quote>abstention from wine.</quote>

                    As for
                    <hi rend="italics">k</hi>
                    my view is that it should not
be used at all except in such words as may be indicated by the letter standing alone as an abbreviation.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    I mention the fact because some hold that

from those which we now use, while their values also
were different. For instance in Greek the letter o

again was sometimes used to express the syllable

taught in actual practice, as for instance when the

introduce a pause into a line, where the sense ends
or begins, when the voice should be raised or
lowered, what modulation should be given to each
phrase, and when he should increase or slacken
speed, or speak with greater or less energy.

this portion of my work I will give but one golden
rule: to do all these things, he must understand
what he reads. But above all his reading must be
manly, combining dignity and charm; it must be
different from the reading of prose, for poetry is
song and poets claim to be singers. But this fact
does not justify degeneration into sing-song or the
effeminate modulations now in vogue: there is an
excellent saying on this point attributed to Gaius
Caesar while he was still a boy:

be some modulation of the voice to distinguish such
passages from those where the poet is speaking in
person.

although the intelligence needs to be further developed for the full appreciation of their merits: but
there is plenty of time for that since the boy will
read them more than once. In the meantime let his
mind be lifted by the sublimity of heroic verse,
inspired by the greatness of its theme and imbued
with the loftiest sentiments.

                    The reading of tragedy
also is useful, and lyric poets will provide nourishment for the mind, provided not merely the authors
be carefully selected, but also the passages from
their works which are to be read. For the Greek lyric
poets are often licentious and even in Horace there
are passages which I should be unwilling to explain
to a class. Elegiacs, however, more especially erotic
elegy, and hendecasyllables, which are merely sections
of Sotadean verse

                    since it is concerned with every
kind of character and emotion, I will shortly point
out in its due places what use can in my opinion
be made of it in the education of boys. As soon as
we have no fear of contaminating their morals, it
should take its place among the subjects which it is
specially desirable to read. I speak of Menander,
though I would not exclude others. For Latin
authors will also be of some service.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    But the
                    <pb id="p.151"/>
                    subjects selected for lectures to boys should be those
which will enlarge the mind and provide the greatest nourishment to the intellect. Life is quite long
enough for the subsequent study of those other subjects which are concerned with matters of interest
solely to learned men. But even the old Latin poets
may be of great value, in spite of the fact that their
strength lies in their natural talent rather than in
their art: above all they will contribute richness
of vocabulary: for the vocabulary of the tragedians
is full of dignity, while in that of the comedians
there is a certain elegance and Attic grace.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    They
are, too, more careful about dramatic structure than
the majority of moderns, who regard epigram as the
sole merit of every kind of literary work. For
purity at any rate and manliness, if I may say so,
we must certainly go to these writers, since to-day
even our style of speaking is infected with all the
faults of modern decadence.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Finally we may derive
confidence from the practice of the greatest orators
of drawing upon the early poets to support their
arguments or adorn their eloquence.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    For we find,
more especially in the pages of Cicero, but frequently in Asinius and other orators of that period, quotations from Ennius, Accius, Pacuvius, Lucilius, Terence,
Caecilius and others, inserted not merely to show
the speaker's learning, but to please his hearers
as well, since the charms of poetry provide a pleasant relief from the severity of forensic eloquence.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Such quotations have the additional advantage of
helping the speaker's case, for the orator makes use
of the sentiments expressed by the poet as evidence
in support of his own statements. But while my
earlier remarks have special application to the
education of boys, those which I have just made
                    <pb id="p.153"/>
                    apply rather to persons of riper years; for the love of
letters and the value of reading are not confined to
one's schooldays, but end only with life.

                    In lecturing the teacher of literature must give
attention to minor points as well: he will ask his
class after analysing a verse to give him the parts of
speech and the peculiar features of the feet which
it contains: these latter should be so familiar in
poetry as to make their presence desired even in
the prose of oratory. He will point out what words
are barbarous, what improperly used, and what are
contrary to the laws of language.

                    He will not do

which is generally received or at any rate rests upon
good authority. But to ferret out everything that
has ever been said on the subject even by the most

                    The man who pores

of reading, is capable of devoting his attention
to the investigation of old wives' tales. And yet
the commentaries of teachers of literature are full
of such encumbrances to learning and strangely
unfamiliar to their own authors.

                    It is, for instance,
recorded that Didymus, who was unsurpassed for
the number of books which he wrote, on one occasion
objected to some story as being absurd, whereupon
one of his own books was produced which contained
the story in question.
                    <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                    Such abuses occur chiefly in
connexion with fabulous stories and are sometimes
carried to ludicrous or even scandalous extremes:
for in such cases the more unscrupulous commentator
has such full scope for invention, that he can tell lies

                    to his heart's content about whole books and authors
without fear of detection: for what never existed
can obviously never be found, whereas if the subject
is familiar the careful investigator will often detect
the fraud. Consequently I shall count it a merit in
a teacher of literature that there should be some
things which he does not know.

                    Their pupils should
learn to paraphrase Aesop's fables, the natural successors of the fairy stories of the nursery, in simple
and restrained language and subsequently to set
down this paraphrase in writing with the same simplicity of style: they should begin by analysing
each verse, then give its meaning in different
language, and finally proceed to a freer paraphrase in
which they will be permitted now to abridge and
now to embellish the original, so far as this may be
done without losing the poet's meaning.

                    I have made my remarks on this stage of
education as brief as possible, making no attempt to
say everything, (for the theme is infinite), but confining myself to the most necessary points. I will
now proceed briefly to discuss the remaining arts in
which I think boys ought to be instructed before
being handed over to the teacher of rhetoric: for it
                    <pb id="p.161"/>
                    is by such studies that the course of education described by the Greeks as

                    For there are other subjects of education which
must be studied simultaneously with literature.
These being independent studies are capable of completion without a knowledge of oratory, while on the
other hand they cannot by themselves produce an
orator. The question has consequently been raised
as to whether they are necessary for this purpose.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    What, say some, has the knowledge of the way to
describe an equilateral triangle on a given straight
line got to do with pleading in the law-courts or
speaking in the senate? Will an acquaintance with
the names and intervals of the notes of the lyre help
an orator to defend a criminal or direct the policy
of his country?
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    They will perhaps produce a long
list of orators who are most effective in the courts
but have never sat under a geometrician and whose
understanding of music is confined to the pleasure
which their ears, like those of other men, derive
from it. To such critics I reply, and Cicero frequently
makes the same remark in his Orator, that I am
not describing any orator who actually exists or has
existed, but have in my mind's eye an ideal orator,
perfect down to the smallest detail.

                    For when the
philosophers describe the ideal sage who is to be
consummate in all knowledge and a very god incarnate, as they say, they would have him receive
instruction not merely in the knowledge of things
human and divine, but would also lead him through
a course of subjects, which in themselves are comparatively trivial, as for instance the elaborate
subtleties of formal logic: not that acquaintance

music or other subjects which I would class with
these, will not be able to create the perfect orator
(who like the philosopher ought to be a wise man),
but none the less these arts will assist in his perfection. I may draw a parallel from the use of antidotes
and other remedies applied to the eyes or to wounds.
We know that these are composed of ingredients
which produce many and sometimes contrary effects,
but mixed together they make a single compound
resembling no one of its component parts, but
deriving its peculiar properties from all:

                    Yes, but we shall
never attain completeness, if minor details be
lacking. And it will be agreed that though our
ideal of perfection may dwell on a height that is hard
to gain, it is our duty to teach all we know, that
achievement may at least come somewhat nearer
the goal. But why should our courage fail? The
perfect orator is not contrary to the laws of nature,
and it is cowardly to despair of anything that is
within the bounds of possibility.

                    Who is ignorant of the fact that
music, of which I will speak first, was in ancient
times the object not merely of intense study but of
veneration: in fact Orpheus and Linus, to mention
no others, were regarded as uniting the roles of musician, poet and philosopher. Both were of divine
origin, while the former, because by the marvel of
his music he soothed the savage breast, is recorded
to have drawn after him not merely beasts of the
wild, but rocks and trees.

                    So too Timagenes

the music of the lyre at the feasts of kings. Does not

                    If this be admitted, music will be a necessity even for an orator,

such things there can be no perfect eloquence.

music confined to cases where the efforts of a number
are given union by the sound of some sweet voice
that sets the tune, but even solitary workers find

fact that the art of letters and that of music were
once united: indeed Archytas and Euenus held
that the former was subordinate to the latter, while
we know that the same instructors were employed

                    that the uneducated were far from the company of

                    <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>
                    But let us discuss the
advantages which our future orator may reasonably
expect to derive from the study of Music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Music has two modes of expression in the voice
and in the body;
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Music includes dancing.</note>
                    for both voice and body require
to be controlled by appropriate rules. Aristoxenus
divides music, in so far as it concerns the voice, into
                    <hi rend="italics">rhythm</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">melody,</hi>
                    the one consisting in measure,
the latter in sound and song. Now I ask you whether
it is not absolutely necessary for the orator to be
acquainted with all these methods of expression
which are concerned firstly with gesture, secondly
with the arrangement of words and thirdly with the
inflexions of the voice, of which a great variety are
required in pleading.
                    <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                    Otherwise we must assume
that structure and the euphonious combination of
sounds are necessary only for poetry, lyric and otherwise, but superfluous in pleading, or that unlike
music, oratory has no interest in the variation of
arrangement and sound to suit the demands of the
case.
                    <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>
                    But eloquence does vary both tone and rhythm,
expressing sublime thoughts with elevation, pleasing
thoughts with sweetness, and ordinary with gentle
utterance, and in every expression of its art is in
sympathy with the emotions of which it is the mouthpiece.
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    It is by the raising, lowering or inflexion of
the voice that the orator stirs the emotions of his
hearers, and the measure, if I may repeat the term,
of voice or phrase differs according as we wish
to rouse the indignation or the pity of the judge.
For, as we know, different emotions are roused even
by the various musical instruments, which are
incapable of reproducing speech.

                    Further the

                    <hi rend="italics">eurythmic,</hi>
                    and this can only
be secured by the study of music. This is a most
important department of eloquence, and will receive
separate treatment in this work.

                    To proceed, an
orator will assuredly pay special attention to his
voice, and what is so specially the concern of music
as this? Here too I must not anticipate a later
section of this work, and will content myself by
citing the example of Gaius Gracchus, the leading
orator of his age, who during his speeches had a
musician standing behind him with a pitchpipe, or
                    <hi rend="italics">tonarion</hi>
                    as the Greeks call it, whose duty it was to
give him the tones in which his voice was to be
pitched.
                    <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>
                    Such was the attention which he paid to
this point even in the midst of his most turbulent
speeches, when he was terrifying the patrician party
and even when he had begun to fear their power.
I should like for the benefit of the uninstructed,
those
                    <quote>creatures of the heavier Muse,</quote>
                    as the saying
is, to remove all doubts as to the value of music.
                    <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>
                    They will at any rate admit that the poets should be
read by our future orator. But can they be read
without some knowledge of music? Or if any of
my critics be so blind as to have some doubts about
other forms of poetry, can the lyric poets at any
rate be read without such knowledge? If there
were anything novel in my insistence on the study
of music, I should have to treat the matter at
greater length.
                    <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>
                    But in view of the fact that the
study of music has, from those remote times when
Chiron taught Achilles down to our own day, continued to be studied by all except those who
have a hatred for any regular course of study, it
                    <pb id="p.175"/>
                    would be a mistake to seem to cast any doubt upon
its value by showing an excessive zeal in its defence.
                    <milestone n="31" unit="section"/>
                    It will, however, I think be sufficiently clear from
the examples I have already quoted, what I regard
as the value and the sphere of music in the training
of an orator. Still I think I ought to be more
emphatic than I have been in stating that the music
which I desire to see taught is not our modern music,
which has been emasculated by the lascivious melodies of our effeminate stage and has to no small
extent destroyed such manly vigour as we still
possessed. No, I refer to the music of old which was
employed to sing the praises of brave men and was
sung by the brave themselves. I will have none
of your psalteries and viols, that are unfit even for
the use of a modest girl. Give me the knowledge
of the principles of music, which have power to
excite or assuage the emotions of mankind.
                    <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>
                    We
are told that Pythagoras on one occasion, when some
young men were led astray by their passions to
commit an outrage on a respectable family, calmed
them by ordering the piper to change her strain to a
spondaic measure, while Chrysippus selects a special
tune to be used by nurses to entice their little charges
to sleep.
                    <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>
                    Further I may point out that among the
fictitious themes employed in declamation is one,
doing no little credit to its author's learning, in
which it is supposed that a piper is accused of manslaughter because he had played a tune in the Phrygian mode as an accompaniment to a sacrifice, with
the result that the person officiating went mad and
flung himself over a precipice. If an orator is
expected to declaim on such a theme as this, which
cannot possibly be handled without some knowledge
                    <pb id="p.177"/>

fail to agree that music is a necessary element in
the education of an orator?

                    it is granted that portions of
this science are of value for the instruction of children:
for admittedly it exercises their minds, sharpens
their wits and generates quickness of perception.
But it is considered that the value of geometry
resides in the process of learning, and not as with
other sciences in the knowledge thus acquired.
Such is the general opinion.

                    But it is not without
good reason that some of the greatest men have
devoted special attention to this science. Geometry
has two divisions; one is concerned with numbers,
the other with figures. Now knowledge of the former
is a necessity not merely to the orator, but to any
one who has had even an elementary education.
Such knowledge is frequently required in actual
cases, in which a speaker is regarded as deficient in education, I will not say if he hesitates
in making a calculation, but even if he contradicts
the calculation which he states in words by making
an uncertain or inappropriate gesture with his fingers.

yet more important way than this.

                    In the first
place logical development is one of the necessities
of geometry. And is it not equally a necessity for
oratory? Geometry arrives at its conclusions from
definite premises, and by arguing from what is certain
proves what was previously uncertain. Is not this
just what we do in speaking? Again are not the
problems of geometry almost entirely solved by the
                    <pb id="p.179"/>
                    syllogistic method, a fact which makes the majority
assert that geometry bears a closer resemblance to
logic than to rhetoric? But even the orator will
sometimes, though rarely, prove his point by formal
logic.
                    <milestone n="38" unit="section"/>
                    For, if necessary, he will use the syllogism,
and he will certainly make use of the enthymeme
which is a rhetorical form of syllogism.

                    Further
the most absolute form of proof is that which is

is the aim of oratory if not proof?
                    <milestone n="39" unit="section"/>
                    Again oratory
sometimes detects falsehoods closely resembling the
truth by the use of geometrical methods. An
example of this may be found in connexion with
numbers in the so-called pseudographs, a favourite
amusement in our boyhood.

                        When the lines bounding two figures are equal in
length, the areas contained within those lines are
equal.

of the figure.

                    Consequently if the bounding line
to which we have referred form a circle, the most

space than if the same length of line took the form
of a square, while a square contains a greater space

there are other points which perhaps present greater
                    <pb id="p.181"/>
                    difficulty. I will take an example which is easy
even for those who have no knowledge of geometry.
There is scarcely anyone who does not know that
the Roman acre is 240 feet long and 120 feet
broad, and its total perimeter and the area enclosed
can easily be calculated.
                    <milestone n="43" unit="section"/>
                    But a square of 180 feet
gives the same perimeter, yet contains a much
larger area within its four sides. If the calculation
prove irksome to any of my readers, he can learn the
same truth by employing smaller numbers. Take a
ten foot square: its perimeter is forty feet and it
contains 100 square feet. But if the dimensions be
fifteen feet by five, while the perimeter is the same,
the area enclosed is less by a quarter.
                    <milestone n="44" unit="section"/>
                    On the other
hand if we draw a parallelogram measuring nineteen
feet by one, the number of square feet enclosed will
be no greater than the number of linear feet making
the actual length of the parallelogram, though the
perimeter will be exactly as that of the figure which
encloses an area of 100 square feet. Consequently the
area enclosed by four lines will decrease in proportion
as we depart from the form of a square.
                    <milestone n="45" unit="section"/>
                    It further
follows that it is perfectly possible for the space
enclosed to be less, though the perimeter be greater.
This applies to plane figures only: for even one who
is no mathematician can see that, when we have to
consider hills or valleys, the extent of ground enclosed
is greater than the sky over it.
                    <milestone n="46" unit="section"/>
                    But geometry soars
still higher to the consideration of the system of
the universe: for by its calculations it demonstrates
the fixed and ordained courses of the stars, and
thereby we acquire the knowledge that all things
are ruled by order and destiny, a consideration
which may at times be of value to an orator.

eclipse of the sun by explaining the causes of the
phenomenon, or Sulpicius Gallus discoursed on the
eclipse of the moon to the army of Lucius Paulus to
prevent the soldiers being seized with terror at what
they regarded as a portent sent by heaven, did not

                    If Nicias

would not have shared the terror of his men nor lost
the finest army that Athens ever placed in the field.
Dion for instance when he came to Syracuse to overthrow the tyranny of Dionysius, was not frightened
away by the occurrence of a similar phenomenon.
However we are not concerned with the uses of
geometry in war and need not dwell upon the fact
that Archimedes singlehanded succeeded in appreciably prolonging the resistance of Syracuse when it
was besieged.

Within certain limits the orator must be a master of

For if an orator does command a certain art in such

There is an unfortunate tendency in the case of

                    himself out in such pursuits: I would not have him sing
or learn to read music or dive deep into the minuter
details of geometry, nor need he be a finished actor in
his delivery or a dancer in his gesture: if I did demand all these accomplishments, there would yet be
time for them; the period allotted to education is
long, and I am not speaking of duller wits.

                    Why did
Plato bear away the palm in all these branches of
knowledge which in my opinion the future orator
should learn? I answer, because he was not merely content with the teaching which Athens was able to provide or even with that of the Pythagoreans whom he
visited in Italy, but even approached the priests of
Egypt and made himself thoroughly acquainted with
all their secret lore.

                    The plea of the difficulty of the subject is put
forward merely to cloak our indolence, because we
do not love the work that lies before us nor seek to
win eloquence for our own because it is a noble art
and the fairest thing in all the world, but gird up
our loins for mercenary ends and for the winning of
filthy lucre.

                    Without such accomplishments many may
speak in the courts and make an income; but it is
my prayer that every dealer in the vilest merchandise
may be richer than they and that the public crier
may find his voice a more lucrative possession. And
I trust that there is not one even among my readers
who would think of calculating the monetary value
of such studies.

                    But he that has enough of the
divine spark to conceive the ideal eloquence, he who,
as the great tragic poet

                    and seeks not the transitory gains of advocacy, but those stable and lasting
rewards which his own soul and knowledge and

                    will easily persuade himself to spend his time not, like so many, in the theatre
or in the Campus Martius, in dicing or in idle talk,
to say naught of the hours that are wasted in sleep
or long drawn banqueting, but in listening rather to
the geometrician and the teacher of music. For by
this he will win a richer harvest of delight than can
ever be gathered from the pleasures of the ignorant,
since among the many gifts of providence to man
not the least is this that the highest pleasure is the
child of virtue.

                    But the attractions of my theme
have led me to say overmuch. Enough of those
studies in which a boy must be instructed, while he
is yet too young to proceed to greater things! My
next book will start afresh and will pass to the consideration of the duties of the teacher of rhetoric.
