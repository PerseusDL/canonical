                    But these rules of style, while part of the
student's theoretical knowledge, are not in themselves sufficient to give him oratorical power. In
addition he will require that assured facility which
the Greeks call
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">e(/cis</foreign>
                    I know that many have raised
the question as to whether this is best acquired by
writing, reading or speaking, and it would indeed
be a question calling for serious consideration, if we
could rest content with any one of the three.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    But
they are so intimately and inseparably connected,
that if one of them be neglected, we shall but waste
the labour which we have devoted to the others.
For eloquence will never attain to its full development or robust health, unless it acquires strength
by frequent practice in writing, while such practice
without the models supplied by reading will be like
a ship drifting aimlessly without a steersman.
Again, he who knows what he ought to say and
how he should say it, will be like a miser brooding
over his hoarded treasure, unless he has the weapons
of his eloquence ready for battle and prepared to
deal with every emergency.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    But the degree in
                    <pb id="p.5"/>
                    which a thing is essential does not necessarily make
it of immediate and supreme importance for the
formation of the ideal orator. For obviously the
power of speech is the first essential, since therein
lies the primary task of the orator, and it is obvious
that it was with this that the art of oratory began,
and that the power of imitation comes next, and
third and last diligent practice in writing.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    But as
perfection cannot be attained without starting at
the very beginning, the points which come first in
time will, as our training proceeds, become of quite
trivial importance. Now we have reached a stage in
our enquiry where we are no longer considering the
preliminary training of our orator; for I think the
instructions already given should suffice for that;
they are in any case as good as I could make them.
Our present task is to consider how our athlete who
has learnt all the technique of his art from his
trainer, is to be prepared by actual practice for the
contests in which he will have to engage. Consequently, we must assume that our student has
learned how to conceive and dispose his subject
matter and understands how to choose and arrange
his words, and must proceed to instruct him how to
make the best and readiest use of the knowledge
which he has acquired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    There can then be no doubt that he must accumulate a certain store of resources, to be employed
whenever they may be required. The resources of
which I speak consist in a copious supply of words
and matter.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    But while the matter is necessarily
either peculiar to the individual case, or at best
common to only a few, words must be acquired to
suit all and every case. Now, if there were special
                    <pb id="p.7"/>
                    words adapted to each individual thing, they would
require less care, since they would automatically be
suggested by the matter in hand. But since some
words are more literal, more ornate, more significant
or euphonious than others, our orator must not
merely be acquainted with all of them, but must
have them at his fingers' ends and before his very
eyes, so that when they present themselves for his
critical selection, he will find it easy to make the
appropriate choice.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    I know that some speakers
make a practice of learning lists of synonyms by
heart, in order that one word out of the several
available may at once present itself to them, and
that if, after using one word, they find that it is
wanted again after a brief interval, they may be
able to select another word with the same meaning
and so avoid the necessity of repetition. But this
practice is childish and involves thankless labour,
while it is really of very little use, as it merely
results in the assembly of a disorderly crowd of
words, for the speaker to snatch the first that comes
to hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    On the contrary, discrimination is necessary in
the acquisition of our stock of words; for we are
aiming at true oratory, not at the fluency of a
cheapjack. And we shall attain our aim by reading
and listening to the best writers and orators, since
we shall thus learn not merely the words by which
things are to be called, but when each particular
word is most appropriate.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    For there is a place in
oratory for almost every word, with the exception
only of a very few, which are not sufficiently seemly.
Such words are indeed often praised when they
occur in writers of iambics
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See §§ 59 and 96.</note>
                    or of the old comedy,
                    <pb id="p.9"/>
                    but we need do no more than consider our own
special task. All words, with these exceptions,
may be admirably employed in some place or
other. For sometimes we shall even require low
and common words, while those which would
seem coarse if introduced in the more elegant
portions of our speech may, under certain circumstances, be appropriate enough.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Now to acquire a
knowledge of these words and to be acquainted not
merely with their meaning, but with their forms and
rhythmical values, so that they may seem appropriate
wherever employed, we shall need to read and listen
diligently, since all language is received first through
the ear. It was owing to this fact that the children
who, by order of a king, were brought up by a dumb
nurse in a desert place, although they are said to
have uttered certain words, lacked the power of
speech.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        See Herodot. ii. 2. The children were alleged to have
cried

                        Phrygian for bread.
                    </note>
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    There are, however, some words of such
a nature that they express the same sense by
different sounds, so that it makes no difference to
the meaning which we use, as, for instance,
                    <hi rend="italics">gladius</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">ensis,</hi>
                    which may be used indifferently when we
have to speak of a sword. Others, again, although
properly applied to specific objects, are used by
means of a
                    <hi rend="italics">trope</hi>
                    to express the same sense, as, for
example,
                    <hi rend="italics">ferrum</hi>
                    (steel) and muro (point), which are
both used in the sense of sword.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Thus, by the
                    <hi rend="italics">figure</hi>
                    known as

                    <hi rend="italics">sicarii</hi>
                    (poniarders). In other cases we express our meaning
periphrastically, as, for instance, when Virgil
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">Ecl. i.</hi>

                    <pb id="p.11"/>
                    On the other hand, in a number of instances we
employ
                    <hi rend="italics">figures</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See i. viii. 16; ix. i. 11.</note>
                    and substitute one expression for
another. Instead of
                    <quote>I know,</quote>
                    we say
                    <quote>I am not ignorant,</quote>
                    or
                    <quote>the fact does not escape me,</quote>
                    or
                    <quote>I have not forgotten,</quote>
                    or
                    <quote>who does not know?</quote>
                    or
                    <quote>it can be doubted by none.</quote>
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    But we may also
borrow from a word of cognate meaning. For
                    <quote>I understand,</quote>
                    or
                    <quote>I feel</quote>
                    or
                    <quote>I see</quote>
                    are often
equivalent to
                    <quote>I know.</quote>
                    Reading will provide us
with a rich store of expressions such as these,
and will enable us not merely to use them when
they occur to us, but also in the appropriate manner.
For they are not always interchangeable:
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    for
example, though I may be perfectly correct in
saying,
                    <quote>I see</quote>
                    for
                    <quote>I understand,</quote>
                    it does not
follow that I can say
                    <quote>I understand</quote>
                    for
                    <quote>my eyes have seen,</quote>
                    and though
                    <hi rend="italics">mucro</hi>
                    may be employed to
describe a sword, a sword does not necessarily mean
the same as
                    <hi rend="italics">mucro</hi>
                    (point).
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    But, although a store
of words may be acquired by these means, we must
not read or listen to orators merely for the sake of
acquiring words. For in everything which we teach
examples are more effective even than the rules
which are taught in the schools, so long as the
student has reached a stage when he can appreciate
such examples without the assistance of a teacher,
and can rely on his own powers to imitate them.
And the reason is this, that the professor of rhetoric
lays down rules, while the orator gives a practical
demonstration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    But the advantages conferred by reading and
listening are not identical. The speaker stimulates
us by the animation of his delivery, and kindles the
imagination, not by presenting us with an elaborate
                    <pb id="p.13"/>
                    picture, but by bringing us into actual touch with
the things themselves. Then all is life and movement, and we receive the new-born offspring of his
imagination with enthusiastic approval. We are
moved not merely by the actual issue of the trial,
but by all that the orator himself has at stake.
                    <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    Moreover his voice, the grace of his gestures, the adaptation of his delivery (which is of supreme importance
in oratory), and, in a word, all his excellences in
combination, have their educative effect. In reading,
on the other hand, the critical faculty is a surer
guide, inasmuch as the listener's judgment is often
swept away by his preference for a particular speaker,
or by the applause of an enthusiastic audience.
                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    For
we are ashamed to disagree with them, and an unconscious modesty prevents us from ranking our own
opinion above theirs, though all the time the taste
of the majority is vicious, and the
                    <hi rend="italics">claque</hi>
                    may
praise even what does not really deserve approval.
                    <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    On the other hand, it will sometimes also happen
that an audience whose taste is bad will fail to award
the praise which is due to the most admirable utterances. Reading, however, is free, and does not hurry
past us with the speed of oral delivery; we can reread a passage again and again if we are in doubt
about it or wish to fix it in the memory. We must
return to what we have read and reconsider it with
care, while, just as we do not swallow our food till
we have chewed it and reduced it almost to a state
of liquefaction to assist the process of digestion, so
what we read must not be committed to the memory
for subsequent imitation while it is still in a crude
state, but must be softened and, if I may use the
phrase, reduced to a pulp by frequent re-perusal.

                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    For a long time also we should read none save the
best authors and such as are least likely to betray our
trust in then, while our reading must be almost as
thorough as if we were actually transcribing what we
read. Nor must we study it merely in parts, but
must read through the whole work from cover to
cover and then read it afresh, a precept which applies
more especially to speeches, whose merits are often
deliberately disguised.
                    <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                    For the orator frequently
prepares his audience for what is to come, dissembles
and sets a trap for them and makes remarks at the
opening of his speech which will not have their full
force till the conclusion. Consequently what he
says will often seem comparatively ineffective where
it actually occurs, since we do not realise his motive
and it will be necessary to re-read the speech after
we have acquainted ourselves with all that it contains.
                    <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>
                    Above all, it is most desirable that we should
familiarise ourselves with the facts of the case with
which the speech deals, and it will be well also,
wherever possible, to read the speeches delivered on
both sides, such as those of Aeschines and Demosthenes in the case of Ctesiphon, of Servius Sulpicius
and Messala for and against Aufidia,

                    We should, however, remember that the

especially in their freedom of language and their
license in the use of figures. Poetry has been compared to the oratory of display, and further aims
solely at giving pleasure, which it seeks to secure by
inventing what is not merely untrue, but sometimes
even incredible.

that it can be defended on the ground that it is tied
by certain metrical necessities and consequently cannot always use straightforward and literal language,
but is driven from the direct road to take refuge in
certain by-ways of expression; and compelled not
merely to change certain words, but to lengthen,
contract, transpose or divide them, whereas the
orator stands armed in the forefront of the battle,
fights for a high stake and devotes all his effort to
winning the victory.

                    remember that many of the excellences of the historian
require to be shunned by the orator. For history
has a certain affinity to poetry and may be regarded
as a kind of prose poem, while it is written for the
purpose of narrative, not of proof, and designed from
beginning to end not for immediate effect or the
instant necessities of forensic strife, but to record
events for the benefit of posterity and to win glory
for its author. Consequently, to avoid monotony of
narrative, it employs unusual words and indulges in
a freer use of figures.

                    the famous brevity of Sallust, than which
nothing can be more pleasing to the leisured ear of
the scholar, is a style to be avoided by the orator in
view of the fact that his words are addressed to a
judge who has his mind occupied by a number of
thoughts and is also frequently uneducated, while,
on the other hand, the milky fullness of Livy is
hardly of a kind to instruct a listener who looks not
for beauty of exposition, but for truth and credibility.

historians, which, however, despite its great importance, has no bearing on our present topic; I refer to
the advantage derived from the knowledge of historical facts and precedents, with which it is most desirable that our orator should be acquainted; for such
knowledge will save him from having to acquire all
his evidence from his client and will enable him to
draw much that is germane to his case from the
careful study of antiquity. And such arguments will
be all the more effective, since they alone will be
above suspicion of prejudice or partiality.

                    after writing pages and pages on the subject

                    No, it was a safer course that Livy adopted

                    I must not conceal
my own personal convictions on this subject. I believe
that there are few, indeed scarcely a single one of
those authors who have stood the test of time who will
not be of some use or other to judicious students, since
even Cicero himself admits that he owes a great debt
even to the earliest writers, who for all their talent
were totally devoid of art.

                    And my opinion about
the moderns is much the same. For how few of them
are so utterly crazy as not to have the least shadow
of hope that some portion or other of their work may
have claims upon the memory of posterity? If there
is such an one, he will be detected before we have
perused many lines of his writings, and we shall
escape from him before the experiment of reading
him has cost us any serious loss of time.

service for the formation of style, with which we are

the correct methods of style, we shall find that some
think that the only healthy and genuinely Attic style
is to be found in language which is restrained and
simple and as little removed as possible from the
speech of every day, while others are attracted by a
style which is more elevated and full of energy and
animation. There are, too, not a few who are devoted to a gentle, elegant and harmonious style. Of
these different ideals I shall speak in greater detail,

sublimity with which he invests great themes or the

not, I will not say observed, but actually established

                    Aeschylus was the first to bring tragedy into
prominence: he is lofty, dignified, grandiloquent

later poets to revise his tragedies and to produce
them in the dramatic contests, and many succeeded
in winning the prize by such means.

and Euripides, however, brought tragedy to far
greater perfection: they differ in style, but it is

supremacy, a question which, as it has no bearing
on my present theme, I shall make no attempt to
decide. But this much is certain and incontrovertible, that Euripides will be found of far greater service

stride and sonorous utterance of Sophocles as being
more sublime, has a closer affinity to that of oratory,
while he is full of striking reflexions, in which,
indeed, in their special sphere, he rivals the
philosophers themselves, and for defence and attack may be compared with any orator that has
won renown in the courts. Finally, although admirable in every kind of emotional appeal, he is
easily supreme in the power to excite pity.

                    And
in truth, although we must needs bow before the
immortal and superhuman genius of Homer, there
is greater diligence and exactness in the work
of Virgil just because his task was harder. And
perhaps the superior uniformity of the Roman's excellence balances Homer's pre-eminence in his outstanding passages.

wrote but one book, has acquired a high and
well-deserved reputation, while there are other

their methods of division, preparation and proof, as
well as everything concerned with invention. In
their actual style there is some difference. Demosthenes is more concentrated, Cicero more diffuse;
Demosthenes makes his periods shorter than Cicero,
and his weapon is the rapier, whereas Cicero's periods
are longer, and at times he employs the bludgeon as
well: nothing can be taken from the former, nor
added to the latter; the Greek reveals a more

different character of the Latin language debars us

one point in which the Greek has the undoubted
superiority: he comes first in point of time, and it
was largely due to him that Cicero was able to attain
greatness. For it seems to me that Cicero, who
devoted himself heart and soul to the imitation of
the Greeks, succeeded in reproducing the force of
Demosthenes, the copious flow of Plato, and the
charm of Isocrates.

time all these excellences, of which scarce one could

deliberately postponed the discussion of Seneca in
connexion with the various departments of literature
owing to the fact that there is a general, though

him. It is true that I had occasion to pass censure upon him when I was endeavouring to recall
students from a depraved style, weakened by every
kind of error, to a severer standard of taste.

at that time Seneca's works were in the hands

was never tired of disparaging; for, being conscious
of the fact that his own style was very different

                    from theirs, he was afraid that he would fail to

I only wish they had equalled or at least approached
his level. But he pleased them for his faults alone,
and each individual sought to imitate such of those
faults as lay within his capacity to reproduce: and
then brought reproach on his master by boasting
that he spoke in the genuine Senecan manner.
                    <milestone n="128" unit="section"/>
                    Seneca had many excellent qualities, a quick and
fertile intelligence with great industry and wide
knowledge, though as regards the last quality he
was often led into error by those whom he had
entrusted with the task of investigating certain
subjects on his behalf.

                    He dealt with almost every
department of knowledge; for speeches, poems,
letters and dialogues all circulate under his name.
In philosophy he showed a lack of critical power,
but was none the less quite admirable in his
denunciations of vice. His works contain a number
of striking general reflexions and much that is
worth reading for edification; but his style is for
the most part corrupt and exceedingly dangerous,
for the very reason that its vices are so many and
attractive.

                    One could wish that, while he relied on
his own intelligence, he had allowed himself to be
guided by the taste of others. For if he had only
despised all unnatural expressions and had not been
so passionately fond of all that was incorrect, if he
had not felt such affection for all that was his own,
and had not impaired the solidity of his matter by
striving after epigrammatic brevity, he would have
won the approval of the learned instead of the

                    But even as it is, he deserves
to be read by those whose powers have been formed
and firmly moulded on the standards of a severer
taste, if only because he will exercise their critical
faculties in distinguishing between his merits and
his defects. For, as I have said, there is much in
him which we may approve, much even that we may
admire. Only we must be careful in our selection:
would he had been as careful himself. For his
genius deserved to be devoted to better aims, since
what it does actually aim at, it succeeds in achieving.

                    II. It is from these and other authors worthy of
our study that we must draw our stock of words, the
variety of our figures and our methods of composition,
while we must form our minds on the model of every
excellence. For there can be no doubt that in art
no small portion of our task lies in imitation, since,
although invention came first and is all-important, it
is expedient to imitate whatever has been invented
with success.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    And it is a universal rule of life that
we should wish to copy what we approve in others.
It is for this reason that boys copy the shapes of
letters that they may learn to write, and that
musicians take the voices of their teachers, painters
the works of their predecessors, and peasants the
principles of agriculture which have been proved in
practice, as models for their imitation. In fact, we
may note that the elementary study of every branch
of learning is directed by reference to some definite
standard that is placed before the learner.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    We
must, in fact, either be like or unlike those who
have proved their excellence. It is rare for nature
to produce such resemblance, which is more often
the result of imitation. But the very fact that in
                    <pb id="p.77"/>
                    every subject the procedure to be followed is so
much more easy for us than it was for those who
had no model to guide them, is a positive drawback,
unless we use this dubious advantage with caution
and judgment.

                    The first point, then, that we must realise is that
imitation alone is not sufficient, if only for the reason
that a sluggish nature is only too ready to rest
content with the inventions of others. For what
would have happened in the days when models were
not, if men had decided to do and think of nothing
that they did not know already? The answer is
obvious: nothing would ever have been discovered.

                    Why, then, is it a crime for us to discover something
new? Were primitive men led to make so many
discoveries simply by the natural force of their
imagination, and shall we not then be spurred on to
search for novelty by the very knowledge that those
who sought of old were rewarded by success?

                    And
seeing that they, who had none to teach them anything, have handed down such store of knowledge
to posterity, shall we refuse to employ the experience
which we possess of some things, to discover yet
other things, and possess nought that is not owed to
the beneficent activity of others? Shall we follow
the example of those painters whose sole aim is to
be able to copy pictures by using the ruler and the
measuring rod?

                    Cast your eyes over the
whole of history; you will find that no art has
remained just as it was when it was discovered, nor
come to a standstill at its very birth, unless indeed
we are ready to pass special condensation on our
own generation on the ground that it is so barren of
invention that no further development is possible;
and it is undoubtedly true that no development is
possible for those who restrict themselves to imitation.

                    But if we are forbidden to add anything to
the existing stock of knowledge, how can we ever
hope for the birth of our ideal orator? For of all
the greatest orators with whom we are as yet acquainted, there is not one who has not some
deficiency or blemish. And even those who do
not aim at supreme excellence, ought to press
toward the mark rather than be content to follow
in the tracks of others.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    For the man whose aim
is to prove himself better than another, even if he
does not surpass him, may hope to equal him. But
he can never hope to equal him, if he thinks it his
duty merely to tread in his footsteps: for the mere
follower must always lag behind. Further, it is
generally easier to make some advance than to
repeat what has been done by others, since there
is nothing harder than to produce an exact likeness,
and nature herself has so far failed in this endeavour
that there is always some difference which enables
us to distinguish even the things which seem most
like and most equal to one another.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    Again, whatever is like another object, must necessarily be
inferior to the object of its imitation, just as the
                    <pb id="p.81"/>
                    shadow is inferior to the substance, the portrait to
the features which it portrays, and the acting of the
player to the feelings which he endeavours to reproduce. The same is true of oratory. For the models
which we select for imitation have a genuine and
natural force, whereas all imitation is artificial and
moulded to a purpose which was not that of the
original orator.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    This is the reason why declamations
have less life and vigour than actual speeches, since
the subject is fictitious in the one and real in the
other. Again, the greatest qualities of the orator
are beyond all imitation, by which I mean, talent,
invention, force, facility and all the qualities which
are independent of art.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently, there are
many who, after excerpting certain words from
published speeches or borrowing certain particular
rhythms, think that they have produced a perfect
copy of the works which they have read, despite
the fact that words become obsolete or current
with the lapse of years, the one sure standard being
contemporary usage; and they are not good or
bad in virtue of their inherent nature (for in themselves they are no more than mere sounds), but
solely in virtue of the aptitude and propriety (or
the reverse) with which they are arranged, while
rhythmical composition must be adapted to the
theme in hand and will derive its main charm from
its variety.

                    Consequently the nicest judgment is required in
the examination of everything connected with this
department of study. First we must consider whom
to imitate. For there are many who have shown a
passionate desire to imitate the worst and most
decadent authors. Secondly, we must consider what
                    <pb id="p.83"/>

authors thus chosen.

                    For even great authors have
their blemishes, for which they have been censured
by competent critics and have even reproached each
other. I only wish that imitators were more likely
to improve on the good things than to exaggerate
the blemishes of the authors whom they seek to
copy. And even those who have sufficient critical
acumen to avoid the faults of their models will not
find it sufficient to produce a copy of their merits,
amounting to no more than a superficial resemblance,
or rather recalling those sloughs which, according to
Epicurus, are continually given off by material things.

despite the brilliance of their imitation and the close
resemblance of their language and rhythm, not only
fail absolutely to attain the force of style and invention
possessed by the original, but as a rule degenerate
into something worse, and achieve merely those faults
which are hardest to distinguish from virtues: they
are turgid instead of grand, bald instead of concise,
and rash instead of courageous, while extravagance
takes the place of wealth, over-emphasis the place of
harmony and negligence of simplicity.

                    The next step is for each student to consult his
own powers when he shoulders his burden. For
there are some things which, though capable of
imitation, may be beyond the capacity of any given
individual, either because his natural gifts are insufficient or of a different character. The man whose
talent is for the plain style should not seek only
what is bold and rugged, nor yet should he who has
vigour without control suffer himself through love of
subtlety at once to waste his natural energy and
fail to attain the elegance at which he aims: for
there is nothing so unbecoming as delicacy wedded
to ruggedness.

                    should not confine himself to teaching
those things for which he perceived his individual
pupils to have most aptitude. For it is his further
duty to foster whatever good qualities he may perceive in his pupils, to make good their deficiencies
as far as may be, to correct their faults and turn
them to better things. For he is the guide and
director of the minds of others. It is a harder task

                    It is also necessary to avoid the fault to which the
majority of students are so prone, namely, the idea
that in composing speeches we should imitate the
poets and historians, and in writing history or poetry
should copy orators and declaimers.

                    Each branch
of literature has its own laws and its own appropriate
character. Comedy does not seek to increase its
height by the buskin and tragedy does not wear
the slipper of comedy. But all forms of eloquence
have something in common, and it is to the imitation
of this common element that our efforts should be
confined.

                    There is a further fault to which those persons
are liable who devote themselves entirely to the
imitation of one particular style: if the rude vigour
of some particular author takes their fancy, they
cling to it even when the case on which they are
engaged calls for an easy and flowing style; if, on
the other hand, it is a simple or agreeable style that
claims their devotion, they fail to meet the heavy
demands of severe and weighty cases. For not only
do cases differ in their general aspect, but one part
of a case may differ from another, and some things
require a gentle and others a violent style, some
require an impetuous and others a calm diction, while
in some cases it is necessary to instruct and in others
to move the audience, in all these instances dissimilar and different methods being necessary.

                    Consequently I should be reluctant even to advise a
                    <pb id="p.89"/>
                    student to select one particular author to follow
through thick and thin. Demosthenes is by far the
most perfect of Greek orators, yet there are some
things which others have said better in some contexts
as against the many things which he has said better
than others. But it does not follow that because we
should select one author for special imitation, he
should be our only model. What then?
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    Is it not
sufficient to model our every utterance on Cicero?
For my own part, I should consider it sufficient, if
I could always imitate him successfully. But what
harm is there in occasionally borrowing the vigour of
Caesar, the vehemence of Caelius, the precision of
Pollio or the sound judgment of Calvus?

                    For quite
apart from the fact that a wise man should always,
if possible, make whatever is best in each individual
author his own, we shall find that, in view of the
extreme difficulty of our subject, those who fix their
eyes on one model only will always find some one
quality which it is almost impossible to acquire therefrom. Consequently, since it is practically impossible
for mortal powers to produce a perfect and complete
copy of any one chosen author, we shall do well to
keep a number of different excellences before our
eyes, so that different qualities from different authors
may impress themselves on our minds, to be adopted
for use in the place that becomes them best.

                    But imitation (for I must repeat this point again
and again) should not be confined merely to words.
We must consider the appropriateness with which
those orators handle the circumstances and persons
involved in the various cases in which they were
engaged, and observe the judgment and powers of
arrangement which they reveal, and the manner
                    <pb id="p.91"/>
                    in which everything they say, not excepting those
portions of their speeches which seem designed
merely to delight their audience, is concentrated on
securing the victory over their opponents. We must
note their procedure in the exordium, the method
and variety of their statement of facts, the power
displayed in proof and refutation, the skill revealed
in their appeal to every kind of emotion, and the
manner in which they make use of popular applause
to serve their case, applause which is most honourable when it is spontaneous and not deliberately
courted. If we have thoroughly appreciated all these
points, we shall be able to imitate our models with
accuracy.
                    <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>
                    But the man who to these good qualities
adds his own, that is to say, who makes good deficiencies and cuts down whatever is redundant, will
be the perfect orator of our search; and it is now
above all times that such perfection should be
attained when there are before us so many more
models of oratorical excellence than were available
for those who have thus far achieved the highest
success. For this glory also shall be theirs, that
men shall say of them that while they surpassed
their predecessors, they also taught those who came
after.

                    Such are the aids which we may derive from

                    therefore write as much as possible and with the
utmost care. For as deep ploughing makes the soil
more fertile for the production and support of crops,
so, if we improve our minds by something more than
mere superficial study, we shall produce a richer
growth of knowledge and shall retain it with greater
accuracy. For without the consciousness of such
preliminary study our powers of speaking extempore
will give us nothing but an empty flow of words,
springing from the lips and not from the brain.

                    It
is in writing that eloquence has its roots and foundations, it is writing that provides that holy of holies
where the wealth of oratory is stored, and whence it
is produced to meet the demands of sudden emergencies. It is of the first importance that we should
develop such strength as will not faint under the
toil of forensic strife nor be exhausted by continual
use.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    For it is an ordinance of nature that nothing
great can be achieved in a moment, and that all the

                    There are, however, two questions which present
themselves in this connexion, namely, what should
be our method and what the subjects on which
we write, and I propose to treat them in this
order.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    At first, our pen must be slow yet sure: we
must search for what is best and refuse to give a
joyful welcome to every thought the moment that
it presents itself; we must first criticise the fruits of
our imagination, and then, once approved, arrange
them with care. For we must select both thoughts
and words and weigh them one by one. This done,
                    <pb id="p.95"/>
                    we must consider the order in which they should be
placed, and must examine all the possible varieties
of rhythm, refusing necessarily to place each word in
the order in which it occurs to us.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    In order to do
this with the utmost care, we must frequently revise
what we have just written. For beside the fact that
thus we secure a better connexion between what
follows and what precedes, the warmth of thought
which has cooled down while we were writing is
revived anew, and gathers fresh impetus from going
over the ground again. We may compare this protess with what occurs in jumping matches. The
competitors take a longer run and go at full speed
to clear the distance which they aim at covering;
similarly, in throwing the javelin, we draw back our
arms, and in archery pull back the bow-string to
propel the shaft.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    At times, however, we may
spread our sails before the favouring breeze, but we
must beware that this indulgence does not lead us
into error. For we love all the offspring of our
thought at the moment of their birth; were that
not so, we should never commit them to writing.
But we must give them a critical revision, and go
carefully over any passage where we have reason to
regard our fluency with suspicion.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    It is thus, we
are told, that Sallust wrote, and certainly his works
give clear evidence of the labour which he expended
on them. Again, we learn from Varius that Virgil
composed but a very small number of verses every
day.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    It is true that with orators the case is somewhat different, and it is for this reason that I
enjoin such slowness of speed and such anxious care
at the outset. For the first aim which we must fix
in our minds and insist on carrying into execution
                    <pb id="p.97"/>
                    is to write as well as possible; speed will come with
practice. Gradually thoughts will suggest themselves with increasing readiness, the words will
answer to our call and rhythmical arrangement will
follow, till everything will be found fulfilling its
proper function as in a well-ordered household.
The sum of the whole matter is this:
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    write quickly
and you will never write well, write well and you
will soon write quickly. But it is just when we
have acquired this facility that we must pause awhile
to look ahead and, if I may use the metaphor, curb
the horses that would run away with us. This will
not delay our progress so much as lend us fresh
vigour. For I do not think that those who have
acquired a certain power in writing should be condemned to the barren pains of false self-criticism.

                    How can anyone fulfil his duties as an advocate if he
wastes his time in putting unnecessary finish on each
portion of his pleadings? There are some who are
never satisfied. They wish to change everything
they have written and to put it in other words.
They are a diffident folk, and deserve but ill of their
own talents, who think it a mark of precision to cast
obstacles in the way of their own writing.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Nor is it
easy to say which are the most serious offenders, those
who are satisfied with everything or those who are
satisfied with nothing that they write. For it is
of common occurrence with young men, however
talented they may be, to waste their gifts by superfluous elaboration, and to sink into silence through
an excessive desire to speak well. I remember in
this connexion a story that Julius Secundus, my contemporary, and, as is well known, my very dear friend,
a man with remarkable powers of eloquence, but
                    <pb id="p.99"/>
                    with an infinite passion for precision, told me of the
words once used to him by his uncle,
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    Julius Florus,
the leading orator of Gaul, for it was there that he
practised, a man eloquent as but few have ever
been, and worthy of his nephew. He once noticed
that Secundus, who was still a student, was looking
depressed, and asked him the meaning of his frowns.
The youth made no concealment of the reason:
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    he
had been working for three days, and had been unable, in spite of all his efforts, to devise an exordium
for the theme which he had been given to write,
with the result that he was not only vexed over
his immediate difficulty, but had lost all hope of
future success. Florus smiled and said,
                    <quote>Do you really want to speak better than you can?</quote>
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    There
lies the truth of the whole matter. We must aim
at speaking as well as we can, but must not try to
speak better than our nature will permit. For to
make any real advance we need study, not selfaccusation. And it is not merely practice that will
enable us to write at greater length and with
increased fluency, although doubtless practice is
most important. We need judgement as well. So
long as we do not he back with eyes turned up to the
ceiling, trying to fire our imagination by muttering
to ourselves, in the hope that something will present
itself, but turn our thoughts to consider what the
circumstances of the case demand, what suits the
characters involved, what is the nature of the occasion and the temper of the judge, we shall acquire
the power of writing by rational means. It is thus
that nature herself bids us begin and pursue our
studies once well begun.
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    For most points are of a
definite character and, if we keep our eyes open,
                    <pb id="p.101"/>
                    will spontaneously present themselves. That is the
reason why peasants and uneducated persons do not
beat about the bush to discover with what they
should begin, and our hesitation is all the more
shameful if it is simply the result of education.
We must not, therefore, persist in thinking that
what is hard to find is necessarily best; for, if it
seems to us that there is nothing to be said except
that which we are unable to find, we must say
nothing at all.
                    <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    On the other hand, there is a fault
which is precisely the opposite of this, into which
those fall who insist on first making a rapid draft
of their subject with the utmost speed of which
their pen is capable, and write in the heat and
impulse of the moment. They call this their rough
copy. They then revise what they have written,
and arrange their hasty outpourings. But while
the words and the rhythm may be corrected, the
matter is still marked by the superficiality resulting
from the speed with which it was thrown together.
                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    The more correct method is, therefore, to exercise
care from the very beginning, and to form the
work from the outset in such a manner that it
merely requires to be chiselled into shape, not
fashioned anew. Sometimes, however, we must
follow the stream of our emotions, since their
warmth will give us more than any diligence can
secure.

                    The condemnation which I have passed on such
carelessness in writing will make it pretty clear what
my views are on the luxury of dictation which
is now so fashionable. For, when we write, however
great our speed, the fact that the hand cannot follow
the rapidity of our thoughts gives us time to think,
                    <pb id="p.103"/>
                    whereas the presence of our amanuensis hurries us
on, and at times we feel ashamed to hesitate or
pause, or make some alteration, as though we were
afraid to display such weakness before a witness.
                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    As a result our language tends not merely to be
haphazard and formless, but in our desire to produce
a continuous flow we let slip positive improprieties
of diction, which show neither the precision of the
writer nor the impetuosity of the speaker. Again, if
the amanuensis is a slow writer, or lacking in intelligence, he becomes a stumbling-block, our speed is
checked, and the thread of our ideas is interrupted
by the delay or even perhaps by the loss of
temper to which it gives rise.

Finally,

                    we come to the most important consideration of all, that the advantages of privacy are lost
when we dictate. Everyone, however, will agree
that the absence of company and deep silence are
most conducive to writing, though I would not go
so far as to concur in the opinion of those who think
woods and groves the most suitable localities for
the purpose, on the ground that the freedom of
the sky and the charm of the surroundings produce
sublimity of thought and wealth of inspiration.
                    <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                    Personally I regard such an environment as a

                    pleasant luxury rather than a stimulus to study.
For whatever causes us delight, must necessarily
distract us from the concentration due to our work.
The mind cannot devote its undivided and sincere
attention to a number of things at the same time,
and wherever it turns its gaze it must cease to
contemplate its appointed task.
                    <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>
                    Therefore, the
charm of the woods, the gliding of the stream, the
breeze that murmurs in the branches, the song of
birds, and the very freedom with which our eyes
may range, are mere distractions, and in my opinion
the pleasure which they excite is more likely to
relax than to concentrate our attention.

                    Demosthenes took a wiser view; for he would retire to

prospect greeted the sight, for fear that his eyes
might force his mind to neglect its duty. Therefore, let the burner of the midnight oil seclude
himself in the silence of night, within closed doors,
with but a solitary lamp to light his labours.

                    But
for every kind of study, and more especially for
night work, good health and its chief source, simple
living, are essential; for we have fallen into the
habit of devoting to relentless labour the hour which
nature has appointed for rest and relaxation. From
those hours we must take only such time as is superfluous for sleep, and will not be missed.

                    For fatigue
will make us careless in writing, and the hours of
daylight are amply sufficient for one who has no
other distractions. It is only the busy man who
is driven to encroach on the hours of darkness.
Nevertheless, night work, so long as we come to it
fiesh and untired, provides by far the best form of
privacy.

freedom of mind are devoutly to be desired, they
are not always within our power to attain. Consequently we must not fling aside our book at once,
if disturbed by some noise, and lament that we
have lost a day: on the contrary, we must make
a firm stand against such inconveniences, and train
ourselves so to concentrate our thoughts as to rise
superior to all impediments to study. If only you

the same result by the exercise of our will. We
must not give way to pretexts for sloth. For unless
we make up our mind that we must be fresh, cheerful and free from all other care when we approach our

or even at some festive gathering, our thoughts should
always have some inner sanctuary of their own to
which they may retire. Otherwise what shall we
do when we are suddenly called upon to deliver
a set speech in the midst of the forum, with lawsuits in progress on every side, and with the sound
of quarrels and even casual outcries in our ears, if
we need absolute privacy to discover the thoughts
which we jot down upon our tablets? It was for
this reason that Demosthenes, the passionate lover
of seclusion, used to study on the seashore amid the
roar of the breakers that they might teach him not
to be unnerved by the uproar of the public assembly.

                    There are also certain minor details which deserve
                    <pb id="p.109"/>
                    our attention, for there is nothing too minute for the
student. It is best to write on wax owing to the
facility which it offers for erasure, though weak
sight may make it desirable to employ parchment
by preference. The latter, however, although of
assistance to the eye, delays the hand and interrupts
the stream of thought owing to the frequency with
which the pen has to be supplied with ink.
                    <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>
                    But
whichever we employ, we must leave blank pages
that we may be free to make additions when we
will. For lack of space at times gives rise to a
reluctance to make corrections, or, at any rate, is
liable to cause confusion when new matter is
inserted. The wax tablets should not be unduly
wide; for I have known a young and over-zealous
student write his compositions at undue length,
because he measured them by the number of lines,
a fault which persisted, in spite of frequent admonition, until his tablets were changed, when it
disappeared.
                    <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>
                    Space must also be left for jotting
down the thoughts which occur to the writer out
of due order, that is to say, which refer to subjects
other than those in hand. For sometimes the most
admirable thoughts break in upon us which cannot
be inserted in what we are writing, but which, on
the other hand, it is unsafe to put by, since they are
at times forgotten, and at times cling to the memory
so persistently as to divert us from some other line
of thought. They are, therefore, best kept in
store.

                    The next point which we have to consider is
the correction of our work, which is by far the most
useful portion of our study: for there is good reason
for the view that erasure is quite as important a
                    <pb id="p.111"/>
                    function of the pen as actual writing. Correction
takes the form of addition, excision and alteration.
But it is a comparatively simple and easy task to
decide what is to be added or excised. On the
other hand, to prune what is turgid, to elevate
what is mean, to repress exuberance, arrange what
is disorderly, introduce rhythm where it is lacking,
and modify it where it is too emphatic, involves a
twofold labour. For we have to condemn what had
previously satisfied us and discover what had escaped
our notice.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    There can be no doubt that the best
method of correction is to put aside what we have
written for a certain time, so that when we return
to it after an interval it will have the air of novelty
and of being another's handiwork; for thus we may
prevent ourselves from regarding our writings with
all the affection that we lavish on a newborn child.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    But this is not always possible, especially in the case
of an orator who most frequently has to write for
immediate use, while some limit, after all, must be
set to correction. For there are some who return
to everything they write with the presumption that
it is full of faults and, assuming that a first draft
must necessarily be incorrect, think every change
an improvement and make some alteration as often
as they have the manuscript in their hands: they
are, in fact, like doctors who use the knife even
where the flesh is perfectly healthy. The result of
their critical activities is that the finished work is
full of scars, bloodless, and all the worse for their
anxious care.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    No! let there be something in all our writing which, if it does not actually please us,
at least passes muster, so that the file may only
polish our work, not wear it away. There must

                    also be a limit to the time which we spend on its
revision. For the fact that Cinna

of my work there is no necessity for me to set forth

this form of exercise. Messala likewise gave it his
approval, and we have a number of translations of
speeches from his hand; he even succeeded in
coping with the delicacy of Hyperides' speech in
defence of Phryne, a task of exceeding difficulty for
a Roman.

                    The purpose of this form of exercise is
obvious. For Greek authors are conspicuous for the
variety of their matter, and there is much art in
all their eloquence, while, when we translate them,
we are at liberty to use the best words available,
                    <pb id="p.115"/>
                    since all that we use are our very own.

                    </note>
                    As regards
figures, too, which are the chief ornament of oratory,
it is necessary to think out a great number and variety
for ourselves, since in this respect the Roman idiom
differs largely from the Greek.

                    But paraphrase from the Latin will also be of
much assistance, while I think we shall all agree that
this is specially valuable with regard to poetry;
indeed, it is said that the paraphrase of poetry was
the sole form of exercise employed by Sulpicius.
For the lofty inspiration of verse serves to elevate
the orator's style and the bold license of poetic
language does not preclude
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

render the same words in the language natural to
prose. Nay, we may add the vigour of oratory
to the thoughts expressed by the poet, make good
his omissions, and prune his diffuseness.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    But I
would not have paraphrase restrict itself to the
bare interpretation of the original: its duty is
rather to rival and vie with the original in the
expression of the same thoughts. Consequently,
I disagree with those who forbid the student to
parahrase speeches of our own orators, on the
ground that, since all the best expressions have
already been appropriated, whatever we express
differently must necessarily be a change for the
worse. For it is always possible that we may discover expressions which are an improvement on
those which have already been used, and nature
did not make eloquence such a poor and starveling
thing, that there should be only one adequate
expression for any one theme.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    It can hardly be
argued that, while the gestures of the actor are
capable of imparting a wealth of varied meaning
                    <pb id="p.117"/>
                    to the same words, the power of oratory is restricted
to a narrower scope, so that when a thing has once
been said, it is impossible to say anything else on
the same theme. Why, even if it be granted that
no new expression we discover can be better than
or even equal to the old, it may, at any rate, be
a good second.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Do we not often speak twice, or
even more frequently, on the same subject, sometimes even to the extent of a number of sentences
in succession? It will scarce be asserted that we
must not match ourselves against others when
we are permitted to match ourselves against ourselves. For if there were only one way in which
anything could be satisfactorily expressed, we
should be justified in thinking that the path to
success had been sealed to us by our predecessors.
But, as a matter of fact, the methods of expression
still left us are innumerable, and many roads lead
us to the same goal.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    Brevity and copiousness each
have their own peculiar grace, the merits of metaphor are one thing and of literalness another, and,
while direct expression is most effective in one case,
in another the best result is gained by a use of
figures. Further, the exercise is valuable in virtue
of its difficulty; and again, there is no better way of
acquiring a thorough understanding of the greatest
authors. For, instead of hurriedly running a careless
eye over their writings, we handle each separate
phrase and are forced to give it close examination,
and we come to realise the greatness of their excellence from the very fact that we cannot imitate
them.

                    Nor is it only the paraphrase of the works of
others that we shall find of advantage: much may
                    <pb id="p.119"/>
                    be gained from paraphrasing our own words in a
number of different ways: for instance, we may
specially select certain thoughts and recast them
in the greatest variety of forms, just as a sculptor
will fashion a number of different images from the
same piece of wax.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    But it is the simplest subjects
which, in my opinion, will serve us best in our
attempt to acquire facility. For our lack of talent
may easily shelter itself behind the complicated
mass of detail presented by persons, cases, circumstances of time and place, words and deeds, since
the subjects which present themselves on all sides
are so many that it will always be possible to lay
hold of some one or other.

                    True merit is revealed

number of subjects.

                    Akin to these are the proof or refutation of general statements. For such statements
are a kind of decree or rule, and whatever problem

decision passed upon the thing. Then there are
commonplaces,

justified in killing Clodius, or whether it is justifiable to kill a man who has set an ambush for his
slayer, or a citizen whose existence is a danger to
the state, even though he has set no such ambush?
What difference is there between the question
whether it was an honourable act on the part of
Cato to make over Marcia to Hortensius, or whether
such an action is becoming to a virtuous man? It is

to amuse ourselves with the writing of verse, just as

                    Indeed, in my opinion,
one of the reasons why Cicero was enabled to shed
such glory upon the art of speaking is to be found
in his excursions to such bypaths of study. For if
all our material was drawn solely from actions at
law, our eloquence must needs lose its gloss, our
limbs grow stiff, and the keen edge of the intellect
be blunted by its daily combats.

                    But although those who find their practice in the
contests of forensic warfare derive fresh strength
and repair their forces by means of this rich fare of
eloquence, the young should not be kept too long at
these false semblances of reality, nor should they be
allowed to become so familiar with these empty
shadows that it is difficult for them to leave them:
otherwise there is always the danger that, owing to
the seclusion in which they have almost grown
old, they will shrink in terror from the real perils
of public life, like men dazzled by the unfamiliar
sunlight.

                    Indeed it is recorded that this fate
actually befell Marcus Porcius Latro, the first professor of rhetoric to make a name for himself; for
when, at the height of his fame in the schools, he was
called upon to plead a case in the forum, he put
forward the most earnest request that the court
should be transferred to some public hall. He was
so unaccustomed to speak in the open air that all his
eloquence seemed to reside within the compass of a

                    roof and four walls.

                    For this reason a young man
who has acquired a thorough knowledge from his
instructors of the methods of invention and style
(which is not by any means an endless task, if those
instructors have the knowledge and the will to
teach), and who has also managed to obtain a
reasonable amount of practice in the art, should
follow the custom in vogue with our ancestors, and
select some one orator to follow and imitate. He
should attend as many trials as possible and be a
frequent spectator of the conflicts in which he is
destined to take part.

                    Next he should write out
speeches of his own dealing either with the cases
which he has actually heard pleaded or with others,
provided always they be actual cases, and should
argue them from both sides, training himself with
the real weapons of his warfare, just as gladiators do
or as Brutus did in that speech in defence of Milo
which I have already mentioned.

                    This is better

his knowledge being confined to what was said for
the defence, he could not have possessed sufficient
acquaintance with the other side of the case.

                    the really good teacher will not
burden himself with a larger number of pupils than
he can manage, and will prune any tendency to
excessive loquacity, limiting their remarks to the
actual points involved by the subject of the declamation and forbidding them to range, as some would
have them do, over every subject in heaven and
earth: further, he will either extend the period
within which he insists on their speaking, or will
permit them to divide their themes into several
portions.
                    <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                    The thorough treatment of one theme
will be more profitable than the sketchy and superficial treatment of a number of subjects. For the
latter practice has the result that nothing is put in
its proper place and that the opening of the declamation exceeds all reasonable bounds, since the
young orator crams all the flowers of eloquence
which belong to all the different portions of the
theme into that portion which he has to deliver,
and fearing to lose what should naturally come later,
introduces wild confusion into the earlier portions
of his speech.

                    Having dealt with writing, the next point
which claims our attention is premeditation, which
itself derives force from the practice of writing and
forms an intermediate stage between the labours of
the pen and the more precarious fortunes of improvisation; indeed I am not sure that it is not more
frequently of use than either. For there are places
and occasions where writing is impossible, while both
are available in abundance for premeditation. For
                    <pb id="p.129"/>
                    but a few hours' thought will suffice to cover all the
points even of cases of importance; if we wake at
night, the very darkness will assist us, while even in
the midst of legal proceedings our mind will find
some vacant space for meditation, and will refuse to
remain inactive.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Again, this practice will not merely
secure the proper arrangement of our matter without
any recourse to writing, which in itself is no small
achievement, but will also set the words which we
are going to use in their proper order, and bring the
general texture of our speech to such a stage of
completion that nothing further is required beyond
the finishing touches. And as a rule the memory is
more retentive of thoughts when the attention has
not been relaxed by the fancied security which
results from committing them to writing.

be attained in a moment or even quickly.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    For, in
the first place, we must write much before we can
form that ideal of style which must always be
present to our minds even when engaged in premeditation. Secondly, we must gradually acquire
the habit of thought: to begin with, we shall content ourselves with covering but a few details, which
our minds are capable of reproducing with accuracy;
then by advances so gradual that our labour is not
sensibly increased we must develop our powers and
confirm them by frequent practice, a task in which
the most important part is played by the memory.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    For this reason I must postpone some of my remarks
to the portion of this work reserved for the treatment of that topic.

                    If, however, some brilliant improvisation should
occur to us while speaking, we must not cling superstitiously to our premeditated scheme. For premeditation is not so accurate as to leave no room
for happy inspiration: even when writing we often
insert thoughts which occur to us on the spur of the
moment. Consequently this form of preparation
must be conceived on such lines that we shall find
no difficulty either in departing from it or returning
to it at will.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    For, although it is essential to bring
with us into court a supply of eloquence which has
been prepared in advance in the study and on which
we can confidently rely, there is no greater folly
than the rejection of the gifts of the moment.
Therefore our premeditation should be such that
fortune may never be able to fool us, but may, on
the contrary, be able to assist us. This end will be
obtained by developing the power of memory so
that our conceptions may flow from us without fear
of disaster, and that we may be enabled to look
ahead without anxious backward glances or the
feeling that we are absolutely dependent on what
we can call to mind. Otherwise I prefer the rashness of improvisation to the coherence given by
premeditation.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    For such backward glances place us
at a disadvantage, because our search for our premeditated ideas makes us miss others, and we draw
                    <pb id="p.133"/>
                    our matter from our memory rather than from the
subject on which we are speaking. And even if we
are to rely on our memory and our subject alike,
there are more things that may be discovered than
ever yet have been.

                    But the crown of all our study and the
highest reward of our long labours is the power of
improvisation. The man who fails to acquire this
had better, in my opinion, abandon the task of
advocacy and devote his powers of writing to other
branches of literature. For it is scarcely decent for
an honourable man to promise assistance to the
public at large which he may be unable to provide in
the most serious emergencies, or to attempt to enter
a harbour which his ship cannot hope to make save
when sailing before a gentle breeze.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    For there are
countless occasions when the sudden necessity may be
imposed upon him of speaking without preparation
before the magistrates or in a trial which comes on
unexpectedly. And if any such sudden emergency
befalls, I will not say any innocent citizen, but some
one of the orator's friends or connexions, is he to
stand tongue-tied and, in answer to those who seek
salvation in his eloquence and are doomed, unless
they secure assistance, to ask for delay of proceedings and time for silent and secluded study, till such
moment as he can piece together the words that fail
him, commit them to memory and prepare his voice
and lungs for the effort?
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    What theory of the duties
of an orator is there which permits him to ignore
such sudden issues? What will happen when he
has to reply to his opponent? For often the expected arguments to which we have written a reply
fail us and the whole aspect of the case undergoes
                    <pb id="p.135"/>
                    a sudden change; consequently the variation to
which cases are liable makes it as necessary for us
to change our methods as it is for a pilot to change
his course before the oncoming storm.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Again, what
use is much writing, assiduous reading and long
years of study, if the difficulty is to remain as great
as it was in the beginning? The man who is always
faced with the same labour can only confess that his
past labour has been spent in vain. I do not ask
him to prefer to speak extempore, but merely that
lie should be able to do so. And this capacity is
best acquired by the following method.
                </p>

                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    In the first place, we must note the direction which
the argument is likely to take, since we cannot run
our race unless we know the goal and the course.
It is not enough to know what are the parts
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See III. ix. 1.</note>
                    into
which forensic pleadings are divided or the principles determining the order of the various questions,
important though these points are. We must realise
what should come first, second, and so on, in the
several parts; for these points are so closely linked
together by the very nature of things that they
cannot be separated, nor their order changed, without giving rise to confusion.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    The orator, who speaks
methodically, will above all take the actual sequence
of the various points as his guide, and it is for this
reason that even but moderately trained speakers
find it easiest to keep the natural order in the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts.</hi>
                    Secondly, the orator must know
what to look for in each portion of his case: he
must not beat about the bush or allow himself to be
thrown off the track by thoughts which suggest
themselves from irrelevant quarters, or produce a
speech which is a confused mass of incongruities,
                    <pb id="p.137"/>
                    owing to his habit of leaping this way and that, and
never sticking to any one point.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Finally, he must
confine himself to certain definite bounds, and for
this
                    <hi rend="italics">division</hi>
                    is absolutely necessary. When to the
best of his ability he has dealt fully with all the
points which he has advanced, he will know that he
has reached his goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The precepts just given are dependent on theory.
Those to which I now come depend on individual
study. We must acquire a store of the best words
and phrases on lines that I have already laid down,
while our style must be formed by continuous and
conscientious practice in writing, so that even our
improvisations may reproduce the tone of our writing,
and after writing much, we must give ourselves
frequent practice in speaking.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    For facility is mainly
the result of habit and exercise and, if it be
lost only for a brief time, the result will be
not merely that we fall short of the requisite
rapidity, but that our lips will become clogged
and slow to open. For although we need to
possess a certain natural nimbleness of mind to
enable us, while we are saying what the instant
demands, to build up what is to follow and to
secure that there will always be some thought formed
and conceived in advance ready to serve our voice,
none the less,
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    it is scarcely possible either for natural
gifts or for methodic art to enable the mind to
grapple simultaneously with such manifold duties,
and to be equal at one and the same time to the
tasks of invention, arrangement, and style, together
with what we are uttering at the moment, what we
have got to say next and what we have to look to
still further on, not to mention the fact that it
                    <pb id="p.139"/>
                    is necessary all the time to give close attention to
voice, delivery and gesture.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    For our mental activities
must range far ahead and pursue the ideas which
are still in front, and in proportion as the speaker
pays out what he has in hand, he must make advances
to himself from his reserve funds, in order that, until
we reach our conclusion, our mind's eye may urge
its gaze forward, keeping time with our advance:
otherwise we shall halt and stumble, and pour forth
short and broken phrases, like persons who can only
gasp out what they have to say.

                    There is, therefore, a certain mechanical knack,
which the Greeks call
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)/logos tribh/,</foreign>
                    which enables
the hand to go on scribbling, while the eye takes
in whole lines at once as it reads, observes the intonations and the stops, and sees what is coming
before the reader has articulated to himself what
precedes. It is a similar knack which makes possible
those miraculous tricks which we see jugglers and
masters of sleight of hand perform upon the stage,
in such a manner that the spectator can scarcely
help believing that the objects which they throw
into the air come to hand of their own accord, and
run where they are bidden.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    But this knack will
only be of real service if it be preceded by the art
of which we have spoken,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">§§ 5–7.</note>
                    so that what is irrational
in itself will nevertheless be founded on reason. For
unless a man speaks in an orderly, ornate and fluent
manner, I refuse to dignify his utterance with the
name of speech, but consider it the merest rant.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    Nor again shall I ever be induced to admire a continuous flow of random talk, such as I note streams in
torrents even from the lips of women when they
quarrel, although, if a speaker is swept away by
                    <pb id="p.141"/>
                    warmth of feeling and genuine inspiration, it frequently happens that he attains a success from improvisation which would have been beyond the reach of
the most careful preparation.
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    When this occurred, the
old orators, such as Cicero,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">No such saying is found in Cicero's extant works.</note>
                    used to say that some god
had inspired the speaker. But the reason is obvious.
For profound emotion and vivid imagination sweep
on with unbroken force, whereas, if retarded by the
slowness of the pen, they are liable to grow cold and,
it put off for the moment, may never return. Above
all, if we add to these obstacles an unhealthy tendency
to quibble over the choice of words, and check our
advance at each step, the vehemence of our onset
loses its impetus; while even though our choice of
individual words may be of the happiest, the style
will be a mere patchwork with no regular pattern.

                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently those vivid conceptions of which I
spoke
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">VI. ii. 29.</note>
                    and which, as I remarked, are called
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">fantasi/ai,</foreign>
                    together with everything that we intend to say,
the persons and questions involved, and the hopes
and fears to which they give rise, must be kept
clearly before our eyes and admitted to our hearts:
for it is feeling and force of imagination that make
us eloquent. It is for this reason that even the uneducated have no difficulty in finding words to express
their meaning, if only they are stirred by some strong
emotion.
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    Further the attention of the mind must be
directed not to some one thing, but simultaneously to
a number of things in continuous sequence. The
result will be the same as when we cast our eyes
along some straight road and see at once all that is on
and near it, obtaining a view not merely of its end,
but of the whole way there. Dread of the shame
of failure is also a powerful stimulant to oratory,
                    <pb id="p.143"/>
                    and it may be regarded as a matter for wonder that,
whereas when writing we delight in privacy and
shrink from the presence of witnesses, in extempore
pleading a large audience has an encouraging effect,
like that which the sight of the massed standards
has on the soldier.
                    <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    For the sheer necessity of speaking thrusts forward and forces out our labouring
thought, and the desire to win approbation kindles
and fosters our efforts. So true is it that there is
nothing which does not look for some reward, that
eloquence, despite the fact that its activity is in itself
productive of a strong feeling of pleasure, is influenced
by nothing so much as the immediate acquisition of
praise and renown.
                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    Nor should any man put such
trust in his native ability as to hope that this power
will present itself to him at the outset of his career
as an orator; for the precepts which I laid down for
premeditation
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Ch. vi. 3.</note>
                    apply to improvisation also; we
must develop it by gradual stages from small beginnings, until we have reached that perfection which
can only be produced and maintained by practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    Moreover, the orator should reach such a pitch of
excellence that, while premeditation may still be the
safer method, it will not necessarily be the better,
since many have acquired the gift of improvisation not
merely in prose, but in verse as well, as, for example,
Antipater of Sidon and Licinius Archias (for whose
powers we have the unquestionable authority of
Cicero
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    ), not to mention the fact that there are
many, even in our own day, who have done this and
are still doing it. I do not, however, regard this
accomplishment as being particularly valuable in
itself, for it is both unpractical and unnecessary, but
mention it as a useful example to encourage students
                    <pb id="p.145"/>
                    training for the bar, in the hope that they may be
able to acquire this accomplishment.
                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    Still our confidence in our power of speaking extempore should
never be so great that we should neglect to devote
a few minutes to the consideration of what we are
going to say. There will but rarely be occasions
when this is impossible, while in the lawsuits of
the courts there is always some time allowed for the
purpose. For no one can plead a cause with the
facts of which be is unacquainted.
                    <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                    Some declaimers,
it is true, are led by a perverse ambition to attempt
to speak the moment their theme has been given
them, and even ask for a word with which to start,
an affectation which is in the worst and most
theatrical taste. But eloquence has, in her turn,
nothing but derision for those that insult her thus,
and speakers who wish to seem learned to fools are
merely regarded as fools by the learned.
                    <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>
                    If, however, chance should impose the necessity upon us of
pleading a case at such short notice, we shall require
to develop special mental agility, to give all our
attention to the subject, and to make a temporary
sacrifice of our care for the niceties of language, if
we find it impossible to secure both. On such
occasions a slower delivery and a style of speaking suggestive of a certain indecision and doubt will
secure us time to think, but we must be careful to
do this in such a way as to give the impression of
thought, not of hesitation.
                    <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                    This precaution may be
employed while we are clearing harbour, if the wind
drive us forward before all our tackle is ready.
Afterwards, as we proceed upon our course, we shall
trim our sails, arrange our ropes, and pray that
the breeze may fill our sails. Such a procedure is

                    But it requires no less careful study to maintain
than to acquire this facility. Theory once mastered
is not forgotten, and the pen loses but little of its
speed by disuse: but this promptitude and readiness
for action can be maintained by practice only. The
best form of exercise is to speak daily before an
audience of several persons, who should, as far as
possible, be selected from those whose judgement
and good opinion we value, since it is rare for anyone to be sufficiently critical of himself. It is even
better to speak alone than not at all.
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    There is yet
another method of exercising this faculty: it consists
in going over our subjects in their entirety in silent
thought, although we must all the time formulate
the words to ourselves: such practice is possible at
any moment or place that finds us unoccupied, and
is, in some respects, more useful than that which I
have just mentioned;
                    <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>
                    for we are more careful about
our composition than when we are actually speaking
and in momentary fear of interrupting the continuous
flow of our language. On the other hand, the first
method is more valuable for certain purposes, as it
gives strength to our voice, fluency to our tongue
and vigour to our gesture; and the latter, as I have
already remarked,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Ch. iii. 21.</note>
                    in itself excites the orator and
spurs him on, as he waves his hand or stamps his
foot: he is, in fact, like the lion, that is said to lash
himself to fury with his tail. But we must study
always and everywhere.
                    <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>
                    For there is scarce a single
day in our lives that is so full of occupations that we
may not, at some moment or other, snatch a few
precious minutes, as Cicero
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">Or.</hi>

                    records that Brutus was
                    <pb id="p.149"/>
                    wont to do, either for writing or reading or speaking;
Gaius Carbo,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        A supporter of Tib. Graccllus, who went over to the
senatorial party and was consul 120 B.C. Committed suicide
in the following year. Cicero praises his eloquence and
industry; p.
                        <hi rend="italics">Brut.</hi>
                        103–5,
                        <hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi>
                        I. § 154.

                    for example, was in the habit of indulging in such exercises even in his tent.
                    <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>
                    I must also
mention the precept (which again has the approval
of Cicero
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">There is no trace of this.</note>
                    ) that we should never be careless about
our language. Whatever we say, under whatever
circumstances, should be perfect in its way. As regards writing, this is certainly never more necessary
than when we have frequently to speak extempore.
For it maintains the solidity of our speech and gives
depth to superficial facility. We may compare the
practice of husbandmen who cut away the uppermost
roots of their vines, which run close to the surface of
the soil, that the taproots may strike deeper and gain
in strength.
                    <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>
                    Indeed I am not sure that, if we practise both with care and assiduity, mutual profit will
not result, and writing will give us greater precision
of speech, while speaking will make us write with
greater facility. We must write, therefore, whenever possible; if we cannot write, we must meditate:
if both are out of the question, we must still speak in
such a manner that we shall not seem to be taken
unawares nor our client to be left in the lurch.

                    It is, however, a common practice with those who
have many cases to plead to write out the most
necessary portions, more especially the beginnings of
their speeches, to cover the remainder of that which
they are able to prepare by careful premeditation
and to trust to improvisation in emergency, a practice regularly adopted by Cicero, as is clear from his
note-books. But the notes of other orators are also
in circulation; some have been discovered by
chance, just as they were jotted down previous to a
speech, while others have been edited in book form,
                    <pb id="p.151"/>
                    as in the case of the speeches delivered in the courts
by Servius Sulpicius, of whose works only three
speeches survive. These memoranda, however, of
which I am speaking are so carefully drawn up that
they seem to me to have been composed by himself
for the benefit of posterity.
                    <milestone n="31" unit="section"/>
                    But Cicero's notes were
originally intended merely to meet the requirements
of the moment, and were afterwards collected
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        Or perhaps
                        <quote>abbreviated.</quote>
                        Tiro was Cicero's friend,
freedman and secretary.
                    </note>
                    by
Tiro. In making this apology I do not mean to
imply that I disapprove of them, but merely wish
to make them more worthy of admiration. And in
this connexion I must state that I admit the use of
brief memoranda and note-books, which may even be
held in the hand and referred to from time to time.
                    <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>
                    But I disapprove of the advice given by Laenas, that
we should set down in our note-books, duly tabulated under the appropriate headings, summaries of
what we propose to say, even in cases where we
have already written it out in full. For reliance on
such notes as these makes us careless in learning
what we have written and mutilates and deforms our
style. For my own part I think that we should
never write out anything which we do not intend to
commit to memory. For if we do, our thoughts will
run back to what we have elaborated in writing and
will not permit us to try the fortune of the moment.
                    <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently, the mind will waver in doubt between
the two alternatives, having forgotten what was
committed to writing and being unable to think of
anything fresh to say. However, as the topic of
memory will be discussed in the next book, I will
not introduce it here, as there are other points
which require to be dealt with first.
