                    THE observations contained in the preceding five
books approximately cover the method of invention
and the arrangement of the material thus provided.
It is absolutely necessary to acquire a thorough
knowledge of this method in all its details, if we
desire to become accomplished orators, but a simpler
and briefer course of instruction is more suitable for
beginners.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    For they tend either to be deterred from
study by the difficulties of so detailed and complicated
a course, or lose heart at having to attempt tasks of
such difficulty just at the very period when their
minds need special nourishment and a more attractive form of diet, or think that when they have
learned this much and no more, they are fully
equipped for the tasks of eloquence, or finally, regarding themselves as fettered by certain fixed laws
of oratory, shrink from making any effort on their
own initiative.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently, it has been held that
those who have exercised the greatest care in
writing text-books of rhetoric have been the furthest
removed from genuine eloquence. Still, it is absolutely necessary to point out to beginners the road
which they should follow, though this road must be
smooth and easy not merely to enter, but to indicate.
Consequently, our skilful instructor should select all
                    <pb id="p.179"/>
                    that is best in the various writers on the subject
and content himself for the moment with imparting
those precepts of which he approves, without wasting
time over the refutation of those which he does not
approve. For thus your pupils will follow where you
lead.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Later, as they acquire strength in speaking,
their learning will grow in proportion. To begin
with, they may be allowed to think that there is no
other road than that on which we have set their
feet, and it may be left to time to teach them what
is actually the best. It is true that writers on
rhetoric have, by the pertinacity with which they
have defended their opinions, made the principles
of the science which they profess somewhat complicated; but these principles are in reality neither
obscure nor hard to understand.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently, if
we regard the treatment of the art as a whole, it is
harder to decide what we should teach than to teach
it, once the decision has been made. Above all, in
the two departments which I have mentioned, the
necessary rules are but few in number, and if the
pupil gives them ready acceptance, he will find that
the path to further accomplishment presents no
difficulty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    I have, it is true, already expended much labour
on this portion of my task; for I desired to make
it clear that rhetoric is the science of speaking well,
that it is useful, and further, that it is an art and a
virtue. I wished also to show that its subject matter
consists of everything on which an orator may be
called to speak, and is, as a rule, to be found in three
classes of oratory, demonstrative, deliberative, and
forensic; that every speech is composed of matter
and words, and that as regards matter we must
                    <pb id="p.181"/>
                    study invention, as regards words, style, and as
regards both, arrangement, all of which it is the
task of memory to retain and delivery to render
attractive.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    I attempted to show that the duty of
the orator is composed of instructing, moving and
delighting his hearers, statement of facts and argument falling under the head of instruction, while
emotional appeals are concerned with moving the
audience and, although they may be employed
throughout the case, are most effective at the beginning and end. As to the element of charm, I
pointed out that, though it may reside both in facts
and words, its special sphere is that of style.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    I
observed that there are two kinds of questions, the
one indefinite, the other definite, and involving the
consideration of persons and circumstances of time
and place; further, that whatever our subject matter, there are three questions which we must ask,
                    <hi rend="italics">is it? what is it?</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">of what kind is it?</hi>
                    To this I
added that demonstrative oratory consists of praise
and denunciation, and that in this connexion we
must consider not merely the acts actually performed by the person of whom we were speaking,
but what happened after his death. This task I
showed to be concerned solely with what is honourable or expedient.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    I remarked that in deliberative
oratory there is a third department as well which
depends on conjecture, for we have to consider
whether the subject of deliberation is possible or
likely to happen. At this point I emphasised the
importance of considering who it is that is speaking,
before whom he is speaking, and what he says. As
regards forensic cases, I demonstrated that some
turn on one point of dispute, others on several, and
                    <pb id="p.183"/>
                    that whereas in some cases it is the attack, in others
in is the defence that determines the
                    <hi rend="italics">basis;</hi>
                    that
every defence rests on denial, which is of two kinds,
since we may either deny that the act was committed or that its nature was that alleged, while it
further consists of justification and technical pleas
to show that the action cannot stand.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    I proceeded
to show that questions must turn either on something written or something done: in the latter
case we have to consider the truth of the facts
together with their special character and quality;
in the former we consider the meaning or the
intention of the words, with reference to which we
usually examine the nature of all cases, criminal or
civil, which fall under the heads of the
                    <hi rend="italics">letter</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">intention,</hi>
                    the
                    <hi rend="italics">syllogism, ambiguity</hi>
                    or
                    <hi rend="italics">contrary lairs.</hi>
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    I went on to point out that in all forensic cases the
speech consists of five parts, the
                    <hi rend="italics">exordium</hi>
                    designed
to conciliate the audience, the
                    <hi rend="italics">statement of facts</hi>
                    designed to instruct him, the
                    <hi rend="italics">proof</hi>
                    which confirms
our own propositions, the
                    <hi rend="italics">refutation</hi>
                    which overthrows
the arguments of our opponents, and the
                    <hi rend="italics">peroration</hi>
                    which either refreshes the memory of our hearers
or plays upon their emotions.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    I then dealt with the
sources of arguments and emotion, and indicated
the means by which the judges should be excited,
placated, or amused. Finally I demonstrated the
method of division. But I would ask that the
student who is really desirous of learning should
believe that there are also a variety of subjects with
regard to which nature itself should provide much
of the requisite knowledge without any assistance
from formal teaching, so that the precepts of which
I have spoken may be regarded not so much as
                    <pb id="p.185"/>
                    having been discovered by the professors of rhetoric
as having been noted by them when they presented
themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    The points which follow require greater care and
industry. For I have now to discuss the theory of
style, a subject which, as all orators agree, presents
the greatest difficulty. For Marcus Antonius, whom
I mentioned above, states that lie has seen many
good, but no really eloquent speakers, and holds
that, while to be a good speaker it is sufficient to
say what is necessary, only the really eloquent
speaker can do this in ornate and appropriate language.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/>
                        xxi. 94.

                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    And if this excellence was to be found in
no orator up to his own day, and not even in himself
or Lucius Crassus, we may regard it as certain that
the reason why they and their predecessors lacked
this gift was its extreme difficulty of acquisition.
Again, Cicero
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        Cic.
                        <hi rend="italics">Or.</hi>
                        xiv. 44;
                    </note>
                    holds that, while invention and
arrangement are within the reach of any man of
good sense, eloquence belongs to the orator alone,
and consequently it was on the rules for the cultivation of eloquence that he expended the greatest
care.
                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    That he was justified in so doing is shown
clearly by the actual name of the art of which I am
speaking. For the verb
                    <hi rend="italics">eloqui</hi>
                    means the production
and communication to the audience of all that the
speaker has conceived in his mind, and without this
power all the preliminary accomplishments of oratory
are as useless as a sword that is kept permanently
concealed within its sheath.
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    Therefore it is on this
that teachers of rhetoric concentrate their attention, since it cannot possibly be acquired without
the assistance of the rules of artit is this which
is the chief object of our study, the goal of all
                    <pb id="p.187"/>
                    our exercises and all our efforts at imitation, and it
is to this that we devote the energies of a lifetime;
it is this that makes one orator surpass his rivals,
this that makes one style of speaking preferable to
another.
                    <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    The failure of the orators of the Asiatic
and other decadent schools did not lie in their
inability to grasp or arrange the facts on which
they had to speak, nor, on the other hand, were
those who professed what we call the dry style of
oratory either fools or incapable of understanding
the cases in which they were engaged. No, the
fault of the former was that they lacked taste and
restraint in speaking, while the latter lacked power,
whence it is clear that it is here that the real faults
and virtues of oratory are to be found.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    This does not, however, mean that we should
devote ourselves to the study of words alone. For
I am compelled to offer the most prompt and determined resistance to those who would at the very
portals of this enquiry lay hold of the admissions
I have just made and, disregarding the subject
matter which, after all, is the backbone of any
speech, devote themselves to the futile and crippling
study of words in a vain desire to acquire the gift of
elegance, a gift which I myself regard as the fairest
of all the glories of oratory, but only when it is
natural and unaffected.
                    <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    Healthy bodies, enjoying
a good circulation and strengthened by exercise,
acquire grace from the same source that gives them
strength, for they have a healthy complexion, firm
flesh and shapely thews. But, on the other hand,
the man who attempts to enhance these physical
graces by the effeminate use of depilatories and cosmetics, succeeds merely in defacing them by the
                    <pb id="p.189"/>
                    very care which he bestows on them.
                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    Again, a
tasteful and magnificent dress, as the Greek poet
tells us, lends added dignity to its wearer: but
effeminate and luxurious apparel fails to adorn the
body and merely reveals the foulness of the mind.
Similarly, a translucent and iridescent style merely
serves to emasculate the subject which it arrays with
such pomp of words. Therefore I would have the
orator, while careful in his choice of words, be even
more concerned about his subject matter.
                    <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                    For, as a
rule, the best words are essentially suggested by the
subject matter and are discovered by their own
intrinsic light. But to-day we hunt for these words
as though they were always hiding themselves and
striving to elude our grasp. And thus we fail to
realise that they are to be found in the subject of
our speech, and seek them elsewhere, and, when we
have found them, force them to suit their context.
                    <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>
                    It is with a more virile spirit that we should pursue
eloquence, who, if only her whole body be sound,
will never think it her duty to polish her nails and
tire her hair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The usual result of over-attention to the niceties
of style is the deterioration of our eloquence.
                    <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                    The
main reason for this is that those words are best
which are least far-fetched and give the impression
of simplicity and reality. For those words which are
obviously the result of careful search and even seem to
parade their self-conscious art, fail to attain the grace
at which they aim and lose all appearance of sincerity
because they darken the sense and choke the good
seed by their own luxuriant overgrowth.
                    <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>
                    For in
our passion for words we paraphrase what might be
said in plain language, repeat what we have already
                    <pb id="p.191"/>
                    said at sufficient length, pile up a number of words
where one would suffice, and regard allusion as
better than directness of speech. So, too, all
directness of speech is at a discount, and we think no
phrase eloquent that another could conceivably have
used.
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    We borrow figures and metaphors from the
most decadent poets, and regard it as a real sign
of genius that it should require a genius to understand our meaning. And yet Cicero
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">de Or.</hi>
                        I. iii. 12.
                    </note>
                    long since
laid down this rule in the clearest of language, that
the worst fault in speaking is to adopt a style inconsistent with the idiom of ordinary speech and
contrary to the common feeling of mankind.
                    <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>
                    But
nowadays our rhetoricians regard Cicero as lacking
both polish and learning; we are far superior, for
we look upon everything that is dictated by nature
as beneath our notice, and seek not for the true
ornaments of speech, but for meretricious finery, as
though there were any real virtue in words save in
their power to represent facts. And if we have to
spend all our life in the laborious effort to discover
words which will at once be brilliant, appropriate
and lucid, and to arrange them with exact precision,
we lose all the fruit of our studies.
                    <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>
                    And yet we see
the majority of modern speakers wasting their time
over the discovery of single words and over the
elaborate weighing and measurement of such words
when once discovered. Even if the special aim of
such a practice were always to secure the best words,
such an ill-starred form of industry would be much
to be deprecated, since it checks tile natural current
of our speech and extinguishes the warmth of
imagination by the delay and loss of self-confidence
which it occasions.
                    <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>
                    For the orator who cannot

only first form a true conception of the principles of
eloquence, accumulate a copious supply of words by
wide and suitable reading, apply the art of arrangement to the words thus acquired, and finally, by
continual exercise, develop strength to use his
acquisitions so that every word is ready at hand
and lies under his very eyes, he will never lose a
single word.

                    For the man who follows these instructions will find that facts and words appropriate
to their expression will present themselves spontaneously. But it must be remembered that a long
course of preliminary study is necessary and that
the requisite ability must not merely be acquired,
but carefully stored for use; for the anxiety devoted
to the search for words, to the exercise of the
critical faculty and the power of comparison is in its
place while we are learning, but not when we are
speaking. Otherwise, the orator who has not given
sufficient attention to preliminary study will be like
a man who, having no fortune, lives from hand to
mouth.

                    If, on the other hand, the powers of speech
have been carefully cultivated beforehand, words
will yield us ready service, not merely turning up
when we search for them, but dwelling in our
thoughts and following them as the shadow follows
the body.

                    There are, however, limits even to this
form of study; for when our words are good Latin,
full of meaning, elegant and aptly arranged, why
should we labour further? And yet there are some
who are never weary of morbid self-criticism, who
throw themselves into an agony of mind almost
over separate syllables, and even when they have

obvious, since they cannot bring themselves to
realise that when a speech is praised for its words,
it implies that its sense is inadequate.

                    While, then,
style calls for the utmost attention, we must always
bear in mind that nothing should be done for the
sake of words only, since words were invented
merely to give expression to things: and those
words are the most satisfactory which give the best
expression to the thoughts of our mind and produce
the effect which we desire upon the minds of the
judges.

                    Such words will assuredly be productive
of a style that will both give pleasure and awaken
admiration; and the admiration will be of a kind
far other than that which we bestow on portents,
while the pleasure evoked by the charm will have
nothing morbid about it, but will be praiseworthy
and dignified.

                    I have already,
in the portions of the first book dealing with the
subject of grammar, said all that is necessary on
the way to acquire idiomatic and correct speech.
But there my remarks were restricted to the prevention of positive faults, and it is well that I should
now point out that our words should have nothing
provincial or foreign about them. For you will find
                    <pb id="p.197"/>
                    that there are a number of writers by no means
deficient in style whose language is precious rather
than idiomatic. As an illustration of my meaning
I would remind you of the story of the old woman
at Athens, who, when Theophrastus, a man of no
mean eloquence, used one solitary word in an
affected way, immediately said that he was a
foreigner, and on being asked how she detected it,
replied that his language was too Attic for Athens.
Again Asinius Pollio held that Livy,

astounding eloquence, showed traces of the idiom
of Padua. Therefore, if possible, our voice and all
our words should be such as to reveal the native of
this city, so that our speech may seem to be of
genuine Roman origin, and not merely to have
been presented with Roman citizenship.

than one interpretation. In its primary sense it

                    Language may be described as mean when it is
beneath the dignity of the subject or the rank of
the speaker. Some orators fall into serious error
in their eagerness to avoid this fault, and are afraid
of all words that are in ordinary use, even although
they may be absolutely necessary for their purpose.
There was, for example, the man who in the course
of a speech spoke of
                    <quote>Iberian grass,</quote>
                    a meaningless

that he meant Spanish broom.

the fault of positive

                    because there are, in

term either in Greek or Latin.

                    For example, the
verb

                    is specially used in the sense of

                    whereas there is no special verb
appropriated to the throwing of a ball or a stake.
So, too, while

                    has the obvious meaning of

                    of words becomes necessary, while metaphor, also, which is the supreme ornament of oratory,
applies words to things with which they have
strictly no connexion. Consequently
                    <hi rend="italics">propriety</hi>
                    turns
not on the actual term, but on the meaning of the

understanding, not of the ear.

                    The second sense
in which the word
                    <hi rend="italics">propriety</hi>
                    is used occurs when
there are a number of things all called by the same
name: in this case the original term from which
the others are derived is styled the
                    <hi rend="italics">proper</hi>
                    term.
                    <pb id="p.201"/>
                    For example, the word
                    <hi rend="italics">vertex</hi>
                    means a whirl of
water, or of anything else that is whirled in a like
manner: then, owing to the fashion of coiling the
hair, it comes to mean the top of the head, while
finally, from this sense it derives the meaning of
the highest point of a mountain. All these things
may correctly be called

the case where a thing which serves a number

                    in the special sense of Rome,
                    <hi rend="italics">venales</hi>
                    in the
special sense of newly-purchased slaves, and
                    <hi rend="italics">Corinthia</hi>
                    in the special sense of bronzes, although
there are other cities besides Rome, and many
other things which may be styled

                    besides
slaves, and gold and silver are found at Corinth

essential of a good style: there must be propriety
in our words, their order must be straightforward,
the conclusion of the period must not be long postponed, there must be nothing lacking and nothing
superfluous. Thus our language will be approved

                    I now come to the subject of ornament, in
which, more than in any other department, the orator
undoubtedly allows himself the greatest indulgence.
For a speaker wins but trifling praise if he does no
more than speak with correctness and lucidity; in
fact his speech seems rather to be free from blemish
than to have any positive merit.

great learning need be assumed for the satisfactory
arrangement of our matter, while if any more
recondite art is required, it is generally concealed,
since unconcealed it would cease to be an art, while
all these qualities are employed solely to serve the
interests of the actual case. On the other hand, by
the employment of skilful ornament the orator
                    <pb id="p.213"/>
                    commends himself at the same time, and whereas his
other accomplishments appeal to the considered
judgment of the learned, this gift appeals to the
enthusiastic approval of the world at large, and the
speaker who possesses it fights not merely with
effective, but with flashing weapons.

instructing the judge and speaking in clear and idiomatic Latin without a thought beyond the interests

people to proclaim their admiration not merely by
acclamation, but by thunders of applause? No, it
was the sublimity and splendour, the brilliance and
the weight of his eloquence that evoked such clamorous enthusiasm.

been greeted with such extraordinary approbation if
his speech had been like the ordinary speeches of
every day. In my opinion the audience did not know
what they were doing, their applause sprang neither
from their judgment nor their will; they were seized
with a kind of frenzy and, unconscious of the place in
which they stood, burst forth spontaneously into a
perfect ecstasy of delight.

the furtherance of our case as well. For when our
audience find it a pleasure to listen, their attention

both alike increased, while they are generally filled
with delight, and sometimes even transported by
admiration. The flash of the sword in itself strikes
something of terror to the eye, and we should be
less alarmed by the thunderbolt if we feared its
violence alone, and not its flash as well.

                    It does not, however, require any special ability to
discern the truth of this. It is more important to
note that such seemly ornament must be varied to
suit the nature of the material to which it is applied.
To begin with the primary classification of oratory,
the same form of ornament will not suit demonstrative, deliberative and forensic speeches. For the
oratory of display aims solely at delighting the
audience, and therefore develops all the resources of
eloquence and deploys all its ornament, since it seeks
not to steal its way into the mind nor to wrest the
victory from its opponent, but aims solely at honour
and glory.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently the orator, like the hawker
who displays his wares, will set forth before his
audience for their inspection, nay, almost for their
handling, all his most attractive reflexions, all the
brilliance that language and the charm that figures
can supply, together with all the magnificence of
metaphor and the elaborate art of composition that
is at his disposal. For his success concerns himself,
and not his cause.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    But when it is a question of facts,
and he is confronted by the hard realities of battle,
his last thought will be for his personal glory. Nay,
it is even unseemly to trouble overmuch about words
when the greatest interests are at stake. I would
                    <pb id="p.219"/>
                    not assert that such themes afford no scope for
ornament, but such ornament as is employed must
be of a more severe, restrained and less obvious
character; above all, it must be adapted to the
matter in hand.
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    For whereas in deliberative oratory
the senate demand a certain loftiness and the people
a certain impetuosity of eloquence, the public cases
of the courts and those involving capital punishment
demand a more exact style. On the other hand, in
private deliberations and lawsuits about trifling sums
of money (and there are not a few of these) it is more
appropriate to employ simple and apparently unstudied language. For we should be ashamed to
demand the repayment of a loan in rolling periods, or
to display poignant emotion in a case concerned with
water-droppings, or to work ourselves into a perspiration over the return of a slave to the vendor.
But I am wandering from the point.

                    Since rhetorical ornament, like clearness, may
reside either in individual words or groups of words,
we must consider the requirements of both cases.
For although tile canon, that clearness mainly
requires propriety of language and ornament the
skilful use of metaphor, is perfectly sound, it is
desirable that we should realise that without propriety ornament is impossible.

                    But as several words
may often have the same meaning (they are called
synonyms), some will be more distinguished, sublime, brilliant, attractive or euphonious than others.
For as those syllables are the most pleasing to the
ear which are composed of the more euphonious
letters, thus words composed of such syllables will
sound better than others, and the more vowel sounds
they contain the more attractive they will be to hear.
                    <pb id="p.221"/>
                    The same principle governs the linking of word with

others.

                    But words require to be used in different
ways. For example, horrible things are best described by words that are actually harsh to the
ear. But as a general rule it may be laid down
that the best words, considered individually, are
those which are fullest or most agreeable in sound.
Again, elegant words are always to be preferred
to those which are coarse, and there is no room
for low words in the speech of a cultivated man.
                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    The choice of striking or sublime words will be
determined by the matter in hand; for a word that
in one context is magnificent may be turgid in
another, and words which are all too mean to
describe great things may be suitable enough when
applied to subjects of less importance. And just as
a mean word embedded in a brilliant passage
attracts special attention, like a spot on a bright
surface, so if our style be of a plain character,
sublime and brilliant words will seem incongruous
and tasteless excrescences on a flat surface.

                    For here the epithet is appropriate and prevents

                    Again, our style need not always dwell on the
heights: at times it is desirable that it should sink.
For there are occasions when the very meanness of
the words employed adds force to what we say.
When Cicero, in his denunciation of Piso,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    says,
                    <quote>When your whole family rolls up in a dray,</quote>
                    do
you think that his use of the word
                    <hi rend="italics">dray</hi>
                    was accidental,
and was not designedly used to increase his audience's
contempt for the man he wished to bring to ruin?
The same is true when he says elsewhere,

                    This device may also
serve to carry off a jest, as in the passage of Cicero
where he talks of the

                    On the other hand, this
practice becomes more obtrusive when employed in
the schools, like the phrase that was so much
praised in my boyhood,

first forbidden to form derivatives and to modify
and compound words, processes which were undoubtedly permitted to later generations of mankind.

                    one of our inventions seems a little
risky, we must take certain measures in advance to
save it from censure, prefacing it by phrases such as

                    The same practice may be followed in the
case of bold metaphors, and it is not too much to
say that almost anything can be said with safety
provided we show by the very fact of our anxiety
that the word or phrase in question is not due to an
error of judgment. The Greeks have a neat saying
on this subject, advising us to be the first to blame
our own hyperbole.

as I have pointed out elsewhere,

                    have no intrinsic

the dignity of the subject on which we have to

obscene.

                    I would commend this remark to those
who do not think it necessary to avoid obscenity on
the ground that no word is indecent in itself and
that, if a thing
                    <hi rend="italics">is</hi>
                    revolting, its unpleasantness will

as I have already replied to such persons, shall
vindicate the cause of decency by saying no more on
this unpleasant subject.

                    Let us now pass to consider connected discourse.
Its adornment may be effected, primarily, in two
ways; that is to say, we must consider first our ideal
of style, and secondly how we shall express this ideal
in actual words. The first essential is to realise
clearly what we wish to enhance or attenuate, to
express with vigour or calm, in luxuriant or austere
language, at length or with conciseness, with gentleness or asperity, magnificence or subtlety, gravity or
wit.
                    <milestone n="41" unit="section"/>
                    The next essential is to decide by what kind of
metaphor, figures, reflexions, methods and arrangement we may best produce the effect which we
desire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, before I discuss ornament, I must first touch
upon its opposite, since the first of all virtues is the
avoidance of faults.
                    <milestone n="42" unit="section"/>
                    Therefore we must not expect
any speech to be ornate that is not, in the first place,
                    <pb id="p.235"/>
                    acceptable. An acceptable style is defined by
Cicero
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">Part. Or.,</hi>

                    </note>
                    as one which is not over-elegant: not that
our style does not require elegance and polish,
which are essential parts of ornament, but that excess
is always a vice.
                    <milestone n="43" unit="section"/>
                    He desires, therefore, that our
words should have a certain weight about them, and
that our thoughts should be of a serious cast or, at
any rate, adapted to the opinions and character of
mankind. These points once secured, we may
proceed to employ those expressions which he
regards as conferring distinction on style, that is to
say, specially selected words and phrases, metaphor,
hyperbole, appropriate epithets, repetitions, synonyms and all such language as may suit our case and
provide an adequate representation of the facts.

                    But since my first task is to point out the faults to
be avoided, I will begin by calling attention to the
fault known as
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">kake/mfaton,</foreign>
                    a term applied to the
employment of language to which perverted usage
has given an obscene meaning: take, for example,
phrases such as
                    <hi rend="italics">ductare exercitus and patrare bellum,</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">ductare</hi>
                        might mean
                        <hi rend="italics">ad libidinem abducere. patrare bellum</hi>
                        might mean
                        <hi rend="italics">paedicare formosum.</hi>
                    </note>
                    which were employed by Sallust in their old and
irreproachable sense, but, I regret to say, cause
amusement in certain quarters to-day. This, however, is not, in my opinion, the fault of the writer, but
of his readers;
                    <milestone n="45" unit="section"/>
                    still it is one to be avoided, for we
have perverted the purity of language by our own
corruption, and there is no course left to us but to
give ground before the victorious advance of vice.
The same term is also applied in the cases where an
unfortunate collocation of words produces an obscene
suggestion. For example, in the phrase
                    <hi rend="italics">cum hominibus notis loqui,</hi>
                    unless
                    <hi rend="italics">hominibus</hi>
                    is placed between
                    <hi rend="italics">cum</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">notis,</hi>
                    we shall commit ourselves to a phrase
                    <pb id="p.237"/>
                    which will require some apology, since the final letter
of the first syllable, which cannot be pronounced
without closing the lips, will force us either to pause
in a most unbecoming manner, or by assimilation to
the
                    <hi rend="italics">n</hi>
                    which follows
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi>
                        pronouncing
                        <hi rend="italics">cunnotis.</hi>
                    </note>
                    will produce a most objectionable suggestion.
                    <milestone n="46" unit="section"/>
                    I might quote other collocations
of words which are liable to the same objection, but
to discuss them in detail would be to fall into that
very fault which I have just said should be avoided.
A similar offence against modesty may be caused by
the division of words, as, for example, by the use of
the nominative of
                    <hi rend="italics">intercapedinis.</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">interccapedo,</hi>
                        of which the last two syllables might give
rise to unseemly laughter;
                        <hi rend="italics">pedo =</hi>
                        <quote>break wind.</quote>

                    <milestone n="47" unit="section"/>
                    And it is not
merely in writing that this may occur, but you will
find, unless you exercise the greatest care, that there
are a number of persons who take pleasure in putting
an indecent interpretation on words, thinking, as
Ovid
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">Met.</hi>

                    </quote>
                    Nay, an obscene meaning may be extracted even
from words which are as far removed from indecency
as possible. Celsus, for example, detects an instance
of
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">kake/mfaton</foreign>
                    in the Virgilian

                    </quote>
                    but if this point of view be accepted, it will be risky
to say anything at all.

                    Next to indecency of expression comes meanness,
styled
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">tapei/nwsis,</foreign>
                    when the grandeur or dignity of
anything is diminished by the words used, as in the

                    The opposite fault, which is no less serious, consists
                    <pb id="p.239"/>
                    in calling small things by extravagant names, though
such a practice is permissible when deliberately
designed to raise a laugh. Consequently we must
not call a parricide a scamp, nor a man who keeps a
harlot a villain, since the first epithet is too weak
and the second too strong.
                    <milestone n="49" unit="section"/>
                    This fault will result in
making our language dull, or coarse, jejune, heavy,
unpleasing or slovenly, all of which faults are best
realised by reference to the virtues which are their
opposites, that is, point, polish, richness, liveliness,
charm, and finish.

                    The latter, though not avoided
with special care even by the best authors, may
sometimes be regarded as a fault: it is, in fact, a
blemish into which Cicero not infrequently falls
through indifference to such minor details: take, for
example, the following passage,

                    or perverse affectation, is a fault in every
kind of style: for it includes all that is turgid,
trivial, luscious, redundant, far-fetched or extravagant, while the same name is also applied to virtues

                    carried to excess, when the mind loses its critical

other faults are due to carelessness, but this is
deliberate.

                    This form of affectation, however, affects
style alone. For the employment of arguments which
might equally well be advanced by the other side,
or are foolish, inconsistent or superfluous, are all
faults of matter, whereas corruption of style is
revealed in the employment of improper or redundant
words, in obscurity of meaning, effeminacy of rhythm,
or in the childish search for similar or ambiguous
expressions.

                    Further, it always involves insincerity,
even though all insincerity does not imply affectation.
For it consists in saying something in an unnatural
or unbecoming or superfluous manner. Style may,
however, be corrupted in precisely the same number
of ways that it may be adorned. But I have discussed this subject at greater length in another

this, while I shall have occasion to mention it continually in the remaining books. For in dealing with

                    The ornate is something that goes beyond what
is merely lucid and acceptable. It consists firstly
in forming a clear conception of what we wish to
say, secondly in giving this adequate expression,
and thirdly in lending it additional brilliance, a
process which may correctly be termed embellishment. Consequently we must place among ornaments
that
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)na/rgeia</foreign>

                    because vivid
illustration, or, as some prefer to call it, representation, is something more than mere clearness, since
the latter merely lets itself be seen, whereas the
former thrusts itself upon our notice.

                    It is a great
gift to be able to set forth the facts on which
we are speaking clearly and vividly. For oratory
fails of its full effect, and does not assert itself
as it should, if its appeal is merely to the hearing,
and if the judge merely feels that the facts
on which he has to give his decision are being
narrated to him, and not displayed in their living
truth to the eyes of the mind.
                    <milestone n="63" unit="section"/>
                    But since different
views have been held with regard to this art of
representation, I shall not attempt to divide it into
                    <pb id="p.247"/>
                    all its different departments, whose number is
ostentatiously multiplied by certain writers, but
shall content myself with touching on those which
appear to me to be absolutely necessary. There is,
then, to begin with, one form of vividness which consists in giving an actual word-picture of a scene, as
in the passage beginning,

                    Other details follow which give us such a picture
of the two boxers confronting each other for the
fight, that it could not have been clearer had we
been actual spectators.

                    Cicero is supreme in this
department, as in others. Is there anybody so incapable of forming a mental picture of a scene that,
when he reads the following passage from the
Verrines,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">v. xxxiii. 86.</note>
                    he does not seem not merely to see the
actors in the scene, the place itself and their very
dress, but even to imagine to himself other details
that the orator does not describe?
                    <quote>
                        There on the

those who viewed the scene.

                    At times, again, the
picture which we endeavour to present is fuller in
detail, as, for example, in the following description
of a luxurious banquet, which is also from Cicero,

                    What more
would any man have seen who had actually entered
the room? So, too, we may move our hearers to
tears by the picture of a captured town. For the
mere statement that the town was stormed, while
no doubt it embraces all that such a calamity involves, has all the curtness of a dispatch, and fails
to penetrate to the emotions of the hearer.

                    includes,
we shall see the flames pouring from house and

confused clamour blent of many cries: we shall
behold some in doubt whither to fly, others clinging
to their nearest and dearest in one last embrace,
while the wailing of women and children and the

                    Then will come the pillage of treasure
sacred and profane, the hurrying to and fro of the
plunderers as they carry off their booty or return to
seek for more, the prisoners driven each before his
own inhuman captor, the mother struggling to keep
her child, and the victors fighting over the richest
of the spoil. For though, as I have already said,
the sack of a city includes all these things, it is less
effective to tell the whole news at once than to
recount it detail by detail.

the vividness we seek, if only our descriptions give

occur. The same vivid impression may be produced

                    in my
opinion, the highest of all oratorical gifts, it is far
from difficult of attainment. Fix your eyes on nature
and follow her. All eloquence is concerned with
the activities of life, while every man applies to
himself what he hears from others, and the mind
is always readiest to accept what it recognises to
be true to nature.

                    has also provided an
admirable means of illuminating our descriptions.
Some of these are designed for insertion among
our arguments to help our proof, while others are
devised to make our pictures yet more vivid; it is
with this latter class of simile that I am now specially
concerned. The following are good examples:—

                    In employing this form of ornament we must be
especially careful that the subject chosen for our
simile is neither obscure nor unfamiliar: for anything that is selected for the purpose of illuminating

                    something else must itself be clearer than that which

and serves to make it sublime, rich, attractive or
striking, as the case may be. For the more remote
the simile is from the subject to which it is applied,
the greater will be the impression of novelty and the
unexpected which it produces.

                    This type
of simile has, however, sadly degenerated in the
hands of some of our declaimers owing to the license
of the schools. For they adopt false comparisons,
and even then do not apply them as they should
to the subjects to which they wish them to provide
a parallel. Both these faults are exemplified in
two similes which were on the lips of everyone

                    In every
comparison the simile either precedes or follows the
subject which it illustrates. But sometimes it is
free and detached, and sometimes, a far better
arrangement, is attached to the subject which it
illustrates, the correspondence between the resemblances being exact, an effect produced by

comparison before our very eyes, displaying them

oratory. In the

                        As among

their origin, and yet, on the other hand, it is frequently so obscure that the storm seems to have
burst without any apparent cause.

Sallust's description of Mithridates as

                    But unsuccessful

                    in revealing a deeper meaning than is actually

                    into the Wooden Horse, indicating

following example by Virgil:

                    is to be found in the actual word employed to
describe a thing. For example, we may say that
a man who was
                    <hi rend="italics">beaten</hi>
                    was

                    another merely

                        if being by nature bold she throws restraint
to the winds, makes wealth an excuse for luxury,
and strong passions for playing the harlot, would
this be a reason for my regarding a man who was
somewhat free in his method of saluting her to be
an adulterer?

This sort of

                    may be strengthened
and made more striking by pointing the comparison between words of stronger meaning and
those for which we propose to substitute them, as

However, that there are four principal methods of

                    is most impressive when it
ends grandeur even to comparative insignificance.
This may be effected either by one step or by

highest degree, but sometimes even beyond it.

                    If he had
merely been scourged, we should have had but one
tep, indicated by the description even of the lesser
offence as a

                    and mentioning the worst of crimes, he adds,

                    Consequently, since he had

                    There is a second method of passing beond the highest degree, exemplified in Virgil's

degree.

                    There is also a third sort, which is not
attained by gradation, a height which is not a
degree beyond the superlative, but such that
nothing greater can be conceived.
                    <quote>You beat your mother. What more need I say? You beat your mother.</quote>
                    For to make a thing so great as
to be incapable of augmentation is in itself a kind
of augmentation.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    It is also possible to heighten
our style less obviously, but perhaps yet more effectively, by introducing a continuous and unbroken
series in which each word is stronger than the last,
as Cicero
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">Phil.</hi>

vomited

                    </quote>
                    Each phrase is more forcible than that
which went before. Vomiting is an ugly thing in
itself, even when there is no assembly to witness
it; it is ugly when there is such an assembly, even
though it be not an assembly of the people; ugly
even though it be an assembly of the people and
not the Roman people; ugly even though he were
engaged on no business at the time, even if his
business were not public business, even if lie were
not Master of the Horse.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    Another might have
broken up the series and lingered over each step
in the ascending scale, but Cicero hastens to his
climax and reaches the height not by laborious
effort, but by the impetus of his speed.

                    I would not, however,

not to show that his action was a crime, but that
it was even worse than another crime. There is,

exact terminology, provided the sense is clear to
any serious student. My motive in using this term
was, however, this, that this form of amplification
produces its effect at a point other than that where
it is actually introduced. One thing is magnified
in order to effect a corresponding augmentation elsewhere, and it is by reasoning that our hearers are
then led on from the first point to the second which
we desire to emplasise.

                    the wine which he drank at Hippias' wedding, and
was unable to carry or digest in spite of the fact
that his bodily strength was worthy of a prizefighter. Accordingly if, in such a case, one thing is

                    amplification results from subsequent
events, since the violence with which the wine
burst from him was such that the vomiting was
not accidental nor voluntary, but a matter of
necessity, at a moment when it was specially unseemly, while the food was not recently swallowed,
as is sometimes the case, but the residue of the revel
of the preceding day.

circumstance in such colours as to raise the detestation of our audience to its height, we then proceed
to make light of them in order that what is to follow
may seem still more horrible: consider the following

enable the audience to infer how great the implied
crime must be when such actions were but humane
and ordinary in comparison? So, again, one thing
may be magnified by allusion to another: the valour
of Scipio is magnified by extolling the fame of
Hannibal as a general, and we are asked to marvel
at the courage of the Germans and the Gauls in
order to enhance the glory of Gaius Caesar.

                    they meant a feeling, or opinion. The word is
frequently used in this sense by orators, and traces
of this meaning are still found even in the speech
of every day. For when we are going to take an

so

                    (with all our heart). The ancients, indeed, often expressed the same meaning by saying
that they uttered their

                    by the Greeks. Both
the Greek and the Latin names are derived from
the fact that such utterances resemble the decrees
or resolutions of public bodies. The term, however,
is of wide application (indeed, such reflexions may
be deserving of praise even when they have no
reference to any special context), and is used in
various ways. Sometimes it refers merely to things,
as in the sentence:

                    but is employed by them in the special
sense of things which they wish to be understood,
though they are not actually said, as in the declamation where the sister defends herself against the
brother whom she had often bought out from the
gladiatorial school, when he brought an action
against her demanding the infliction of a similar
mutilation because she had cut off his thumb while
he slept:

                    If this merely means a

                    it is a perfectly correct and sometimes a

                    But to-day
something more is meant, for our rhetoricians want

an impressive close.

                    In fact, they think it a disgrace, nay, almost a crime, to pause to breathe
except at the end of a passage that is designed to
call forth applause. The result is a number of tiny
epigrams, affected, irrelevant and disjointed. For
there are not enough striking reflexions in the world
to provide a close to every period.

                    </quote>
                    Another
instance is the striking remark made by Africanus
to Nero with reference to the death of Agrippina:
                    <quote>Caesar, your provinces of Gaul entreat you to bear your good fortune with courage.</quote>
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    Others are of
an allusive type: for example, Domitius Afer, in his
defence of Cloatilla, whom Claudius had pardoned
when she was accused of having buried her husband,
who had been one of the rebels, addressed her sons
in his peroration with the words:
                    <quote>Nonetheless, it is your duty, boys, to give your mother burial.</quote>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        The point is uncertain. Possibly, as Gesner suggests,
the sons were accusing their mother.

                    <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    depend on the fact that they are
transferred from one context to another Crispus,
in his defence of Spatale, whose lover had made her
his heir and then proceeded to die at the age
of eighteen, remarked:
                    <quote>What a marvellous fellow to gratify his passion thus!</quote>

                        would seen to mean his appointing S. his
heir and then being kind enough to die so soon! But the
point is uncertain.

                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    Another type of reflexion may be produced by the doubling of a phrase,
as in the letter written by Seneca for Nero to be sent
to the senate on the occasion of his mother's death,
with a view to creating the impression that he had
been in serious danger:—
                    <quote>As yet I cannot believe or rejoice that I am safe.</quote>
                    Better, however, is the
type which relies for its effect on contrast of opposites,
as

                        since St. Jerome in a

obscure.
                    </note>
                    But to produce the most striking effect
this type should be given point by the introduction
of a comparison, such as is made by Trachalus in his
speech against Spatale, where he says:
                    <quote>
                        Is it your

                    In these instances, however, the reflexion may
equally well be good or bad.
                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    On the other hand,
there are some which will always be bad, such as
those which turn on play upon words, as in the
following case:
                    <quote>
                        Conscript fathers, for I must
address you thus that you may remember the duty
owed to fathers.
                    </quote>
                    Worse still, as being more unreal
and far-fetched, is the remark made by the gladiator
mentioned above in his prosecution of his sister:
                    <quote>I have fought to the last finger.</quote>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        The exact meaning is uncertain. The allusion may be to
the turning up of the thumb as a sign of defeat. See sect. 12.

                    <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                    There is
another similar type, which is perhaps the worst of
all, where the play upon words is combined with a
false comparison. When I was a young man I heard
a distinguished pleader, after handing a mother some
splinters of bone taken from the head of her son
(which he did merely to provide an occasion for his
epigram), cry:
                    <quote>Unhappiest of women, your son is not yet dead and yet you have gathered up his bones!</quote>
                    <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>
                    Moreover, most of our orators delight in
devices of the pettiest kind, which seriously considered are merely ludicrous, but at the moment of
their production flatter their authors by a superficial
semblance of wit. Take, for instance, the exclamation
from the scholastic theme, where a man, after being
ruined by the barrenness of his land, is shipwrecked and hangs himself:
                    <quote>Let him whom neither earth nor sea receives, hang in mid air.</quote>
                    <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                    A
similar absurdity is to be found in the declamation,
to which I have already referred, in which a father
poisons his son who insists on tearing his flesh with
his teeth:
                    <quote>The man who eats such flesh, deserves such drink.</quote>
                    Or again, take this passage from the
theme of the luxurious man who is alleged to have
pretended to starve himself to death:
                    <quote>
                        Tie a noose

                        for yourself: you have good reason to be angry with
your throat. 'rake poison: it is fit that a luxurious
man should die of drink!
                    </quote>
                    <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>
                    Others are merely
fatuous, such as the remark of the declaimer who
urges the courtiers of Alexander to provide him with
a tomb by burning down Babylon.
                    <quote>I am burying Alexander. Shall any man watch such a burial from his housetop?</quote>
                    As if this were the climax of
indignities! Others fail from sheer extravagance.
For example, I once heard a rhetorician who was
declaiming about the Germans, say:
                    <quote>I know not where they carry their heads,</quote>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        Is this a suggestion that the Germans are monsters
                        <quote>whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders</quote>
                        or that
they are so tall that their heads are lost in the clouds?
                    </note>
                    and again when
belauding a hero,
                    <quote>He beats back whole wars with the boss of his shield.</quote>
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    However, I shall never
come to an end if I try to describe every possible
form of this kind of absurdity. I will therefore turn
to discuss a point of more importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rhetoricians are divided in opinion on this subject:
some devote practically all their efforts to the
elaboration of
                    <hi rend="italics">reflexions,</hi>
                    while others condemn their
employment altogether. I cannot agree entirely
with either view.
                    <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>
                    If they are crowded too thick
together, such
                    <hi rend="italics">reflexions</hi>
                    merely stand in each other's
way, just as in the case of crops and the fruits of
trees lack of room to grow results in a stunted
development. Again in pictures a definite outline
is required to throw objects into relief, and consequently artists who include a number of objects in
the same design separate them by intervals sufficient
to prevent one casting a shadow on the other.
Further,
                    <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>
                    this form of display breaks up our speeches
into a number of detached sentences; every
                    <hi rend="italics">reflexion</hi>
                    is isolated, and consequently a fresh start is necessary
after each. This produces a discontinuous style, since
                    <pb id="p.297"/>
                    our language is composed not of a system of limbs,
but of a series of fragments: for your nicely rounded
and polished phrases are incapable of cohesion.
Further, the colour,
                    <milestone n="28" unit="section"/>
                    though bright enough, has no
unity, but consists of a number of variegated splashes.
A purple stripe appropriately applied lends brilliance
to a dress, but a dress decorated with a quantity of
patches can never be becoming to anybody.
                    <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>
                    Wherefore, although these ornaments may seem to stand
out with a certain glitter of their own, they are
rather to be compared to sparks flashing through
the smoke than to the actual brilliance of flame:
they are, in fact, invisible when the language is of
uniform splendour, just as the stars are invisible in
the light of day. And where eloquence seeks to
secure elevation by frequent small efforts, it merely
produces an uneven and broken surface which fails
to win the admiration due to outstanding objects
and lacks the charm that may be found in a smooth
surface.
                    <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>
                    To this must be added the fact that those
who devote themselves solely to the production of
                    <hi rend="italics">reflexions</hi>
                    cannot avoid giving utterance to many that
are trivial, flat or foolish. For their mere number
will so embarrass their author that selection will be
impossible. Consequently you will often find that
such persons will produce a
                    <hi rend="italics">division</hi>
                    or an
                    <hi rend="italics">argument</hi>
                    as
if it were an epigram, the only qualification necessary
being that it should come toward the close of the
period and be impressively delivered.

                    This is an
                    <pb id="p.299"/>
                    argument. There are, moreover, a number of speakers
who not merely deliver many such epigrams, but
utter everything as if it were an epigram.
                    <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>
                    Against
these persons, on the other hand, must be set those
who shun and dread all ornament of this kind, approving nothing that is not plain, humble and effortless,
with the result that by their reluctance to climb for
fear of falling they succeed merely in maintaining a
perpetual flatness. What sin is there in a good
epigram? Does it not help our case, or move the
judge, or commend the speaker to his audience?
It may be urged, perhaps,
                    <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>
                    that it is a form of
ornament eschewed by the ancients. What do you
mean by antiquity? If you go back to the earliest
periods you will find that Demosthenes frequently
employed methods that were known to none before
him. How can we give our approval to Cicero, if we
think that no change should be made from the
methods of Cato and the Gracchi? And yet before
the Gracchi and Cato the style of oratory was simpler
still.
                    <milestone n="34" unit="section"/>
                    For my own part I regard these particular
ornaments of oratory to be, as it were, the eyes of
eloquence. On the other hand, I should not like to
see the whole body full of eyes, for fear that it might
cripple the functions of the other members, and, if I
had no alternative, I should prefer the rudeness of
ancient eloquence to the license of the moderns.
But a middle course is open to us here no less than
in the refinements of dress and mode of life, where
there is a certain tasteful elegance that offends no
one. Therefore let us as far as possible seek to increase the number of our virtues, although our first
care must always be to keep ourselves free from
vices, lest in seeking to make ourselves better than
                    <pb id="p.301"/>
                    the ancients we succeed merely in making ourselves

                    I will now proceed to the next subject for discussion, which is, as I have said, that of

                    or
                    <hi rend="italics">modes,</hi>
                    as the most distinguished Roman rhetoricians call
them. Rules for their use are given by the teachers
of literature as well. But I postponed the discussion
of the subject when I was dealing with literary
education, because it seemed to me that the theme
would have greater importance if handled in connexion with the ornaments of oratory, and that it
ought to be reserved for treatment on a larger scale.

a word or phrase from its proper meaning to another.
This is a subject which has given rise to interminable disputes among the teachers of literature, who
have quarrelled no less violently with the philosophers than among themselves over the problem of
the

                    may be
divided, their number and their correct classification.

                    I propose to disregard such quibbles as in no wise
concern the training of an orator, and to proceed
to discuss those
                    <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi>
                    which are most necessary and
meet with most general acceptance, contenting
myself merely with noting the fact that some
                    <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi>
                    are employed to help out our meaning and others to
adorn our style, that some arise from words used
                    <hi rend="italics">properly</hi>
                    and others from words used
                    <hi rend="italics">metaphorically,</hi>
                    and that the changes involved concern not merely
individual words, but also our thoughts and the
structure of our sentences.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    In view of these facts
I regard those writers as mistaken who have held
that
                    <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi>
                    necessarily involved the substitution of
word for word. And I do not ignore the fact that
                    <pb id="p.303"/>
                    as a rule the
                    <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi>
                    employed to express our meaning
involve ornament as well, though the converse is not
the case, since there are some which are intended
solely for the purpose of embellishment.

                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Let us begin, then, with the commonest and by far
the most beautiful of
                    <hi rend="italics">tropes,</hi>
                    namely,
                    <hi rend="italics">metaphor,</hi>
                    the
Greek term for our
                    <hi rend="italics">translatio.</hi>
                    It is not merely so
natural a turn of speech that it is often employed unconsciously or by uneducated persons, but it is in itself
so attractive and elegant that however distinguished
the language in which it is embedded it shines forth
with a light that is all its own.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    For if it be correctly
and appropriately applied, it is quite impossible
for its effect to be commonplace, mean or unpleasing. It adds to the copiousness of language by the
interchange of words and by borrowing, and finally
succeeds in accomplishing the supremely difficult
task of providing a name for everything. A noun
or a verb is transferred from the place to which it
properly belongs to another where there is either no
                    <hi rend="italics">literal</hi>
                    term or the
                    <hi rend="italics">transferred</hi>
                    is better than the
                    <hi rend="italics">literal.</hi>
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    We do this either because it is necessary or to make
our meaning clearer or, as I have already said, to produce a decorative effect. When it secures none of
these results, our metaphor will be out of place. As
an example of a necessary metaphor I may quote the
following usages in vogue with peasants when they
call a vinebud
                    <hi rend="italics">gemma,</hi>

allegorical and enigmatic. There are also certain
metaphors which fail from meanness, such as that

                    himself has demonstrated in the most admirable manner how important it is to avoid grossness in metaphor, such
as is revealed by the following examples, which he
quotes:—

                    or

                    He also points out that a metaphor
must not be too great for its subject or, as is more
frequently the case, too little, and that it must not
be inappropriate. Anyone who realises that these
are faults, will be able to detect instances of them
only too frequently. But excess in the use of metaphor is also a fault, more especially if they are of the
same species.

                    The worst errors of all, however, originate in the
fact that some authors regard it as permissible to
use even in prose any metaphors that are allowed to
poets, in spite of the fact that tile latter aim solely
at pleasing their readers and are compelled in many
cases to employ metaphor by sheer metrical necessity.

                    despite the fact that this
metaphor has been most effectively employed by
Virgil to describe the flight of bees and of Daedalus.1 For metaphor should always either occupy
a place already vacant, or if it fills the room of something else, should be more impressive than that
which it displaces.

                    were victorious; on the other hand, Cicero

                    the inventor, or a possession by substituting the

                    But it is important to enquire to what
extent
                    <hi rend="italics">tropes</hi>
                    of this kind should be employed by
the orator. For though we often hear
                    <quote>Vulcan</quote>
                    used for fire and to say
                    <hi rend="italics">vario Marte pugnatum est</hi>
                    for
                    <quote>they fought with varying success</quote>
                    is elegant and
idiomatic, while
                    <hi rend="italics">Venus</hi>
                    is a more decent expression
than
                    <hi rend="italics">coitus,</hi>
                    it would be too bold for the severe style
demanded in the courts to speak of
                    <hi rend="italics">Liber</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italics">Ceres</hi>
                    when we mean bread and wine. Again, while usage
permits us to substitute that which contains for that
which is contained, as in phrases such as
                    <quote>civilised cities,</quote>
                    or
                    <quote>a cup was drunk to the lees,</quote>

                    the converse procedure would rarely be
ventured on by any save a poet: take, for example,
the phrase:

                    It is, however, perhaps more permissible to describe
what is possessed by reference to its possessor, as,
for example, to say of a man whose estate is being
squandered,
                    <quote>the man is being eaten up.</quote>

                    that is to say, the
creation of a word, although regarded with the
highest approbation by the Greeks, is scarcely permissible to a Roman. It is true that many words
were created in this way by the original founders of
the language, who adapted them to suit the sensation
which they expressed. For instance,
                    <hi rend="italics">mugitus,</hi>
                    lowing,
                    <hi rend="italics">sibilus,</hi>

                    owe their origin to this
practice.

                    But to-day we consider that all has been
done that can be done in this line, and do not venture
on fresh creations, in spite of the fact that many
of the words thus formed in antiquity are daily
becoming obsolete. Indeed, we scarcely permit ourselves to use new derivatives, so they are called,
which are formed in various ways from words in
common use, such as

                    But the nature
of this form of embellishment is such that, while
style is bare and inelegant without any epithets
at all, it is overloaded when a large number are
employed.

                    For then it becomes long-winded and
cumbrous, in fact you might compare it to an army
with as many camp-followers as soldiers, an army, that
is to say, which has doubled its numbers without
doubling its strength. None the less, not merely
single epithets are employed, but we may find a
number of them together, as in the following passage
from Virgil:
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    Be this as it may, two epithets directly attached
to one noun are unbecoming even in verse. There

                    but if separated from the word to

the state under the semblance of a ship, the civil
wars as tempests, and peace and good-will as the
haven.

an allegory without any metaphor:

                    For in this passage, with the exception of the
proper name, the words bear no more than their
literal meaning. But the name does not simply denote the shepherd Menalcas, but is a pseudonym for
Virgil himself. Oratory makes frequent use of such
allegory, but generally with this modification, that
there is an admixture of plain speaking. We get
allegory pure and unadulterated in the following
passage of Cicero:
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">From an unknown speech.</note>
                    <quote>

                    The following is an example
of the commonest type, namely, the mixed allegory:
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">Pro Mil.</hi>

the words
                    <quote>at least in the troubled waters of political meetings,</quote>
                    we should have had pure allegory:
their addition, however, converted it into a mixed
allegory. In this type of allegory the ornamental
element is provided by the metaphorical words and
the meaning is indicated by those which are used
literally.

                    But far the most ornamental effect is produced by the artistic admixture of simile, metaphor
and allegory, as in the following example:

eddies, waves and fluctuations, as confuse our popular
elections with their wild ebb and flow? The passing
of one day, or the interval of a single night, will
often throw everything into confusion, and one little
breath of rumour will sometimes turn the whole
trend of opinion.

                    mix your metaphors. But there are many who, after
beginning with a tempest, will end with a fire or a
falling house, with the result that they produce a
hideously incongruous effect.

                    For the rest, allegory
is often used by men of little ability and in the
conversation of everyday life. For those hackneyed
phrases of forensic pleading,
                    <quote>to fight hand to hand,</quote>
                    <quote>to attack the throat,</quote>

                    <quote>to let blood</quote>
                    are all of
them allegorical, although they do not strike the
attention: for it is novelty and change that please
in oratory, and what is unexpected always gives special
delight. Consequently we have thrown all restraint
to the wind in such matters, and have destroyed the
charm of language by the extravagant efforts which
we have made to attain it.
                    <milestone n="52" unit="section"/>
                    Illustrative examples also
involve allegory if not preceded by an explanation;
for there are numbers of sayings available for use like
the
                    <quote>Dionysius is at Corinth,</quote>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        The allusion must be to the fact that Dionysius II,
tyrant of Syracuse, on his expulsion from the throne,
migrated to Corinth and set up as a schoolmaster. Its
application is uncertain, but it would obviously be a way of
saying
                        <quote>How are the mighty fallen I</quote>
                    </note>
                    which is such a
favourite with the Greeks. When, however, an allegory
is too obscure, we call it a riddle: such riddles are,
in my opinion, to be regarded as blemishes, in view of
the fact that lucidity is a virtue; nevertheless they
are used by poets, as, for example, by Virgil

the understanding either by the delivery, the character of the speaker or the nature of the subject.
For if any one of these three is out of keeping with
the words, it at once becomes clear that the intention of the speaker is other than what he actually

                    There are, however, some
writers who deny that these are species of

                    in themselves:
for they argue shrewdly that allegory involves an
element of obscurity, whereas in all these cases our
meaning is perfectly obvious. To this may be added
the fact that when a
                    <hi rend="italics">genus</hi>
                    is divided into
                    <hi rend="italics">species,</hi>
                    it
ceases to have any peculiar properties of its own: for
example, we may divide tree into its species, pine,
olive, cypress, etc., leaving it no properties of its own,
whereas allegory always has some property peculiar
to itself. The only explanation of this fact is that
it is itself a species. But this, of course, is a matter
of indifference to those that use it.

word, is often demanded by the structure of the
sentence and the claims of elegance, and is consequently counted among the ornaments of style.
For our language would often be harsh, rough, limp
or disjointed, if the words were always arranged in
their natural order and attached each to each just
as they occur, despite the fact that there is no real
bond of union. Consequently some words require
to be postponed, others to be anticipated, each
being set in its appropriate place.

years the Sicilians saw dwelling in their midst, not
a second Dionysius or Phalaris (for that island has
produced many a cruel tyrant in years gone by), but
a new monster with all the old ferocity once familiar
to those regions. For, to my thinking, neither Scylla
nor Charybdis were ever such foes as he to the ships
that sailed those same narrow seas.

                    The methods
of hyperbole by attenuation are the same in number.
Compare the Virgilian

                            Vetto gives the name of farm to an estate which
might easily be hurled from a sling, though it
might well fall through the hole in the hollow
sling, so small is it.

                    But even here a certain proportion must be observed.
For although every
                    <hi rend="italics">hyperbole</hi>
                    involves the incredible,
it must not go too far in this direction, which
provides the easiest road to extravagant affectation.

                    I shrink from recording the faults to which the lack
of this sense of proportion has given rise, more
especially as they are so well known and obvious.
It is enough to say that
                    <hi rend="italics">hyperbole</hi>
                    lies, though
without any intention to deceive. We must therefore be all the more careful to consider how far we
may go in exaggerating facts which our audience
may refuse to believe. Again,
                    <hi rend="italics">hyperbole</hi>
                    will often
cause a laugh. If that was what the orator desired,

                    we may give him credit for wit; otherwise we can
only call him a fool.

                    <hi rend="italics">Hyperbole</hi>
                    is employed even
by peasants and uneducated persons, for the good
reason that everybody has an innate passion for
exaggeration or attenuation of actual facts, and no
one is ever contented with the simple truth. But
such disregard of truth is pardonable, for it does not
involve the definite assertion of the thing that is not.
                    <hi rend="italics">Hyperbole</hi>
                    is, moreover, a virtue,
                    <milestone n="76" unit="section"/>
                    when the subject
on which we have to speak is abnormal. For we are
allowed to amplify, when the magnitude of the facts
passes all words, and in such circumstances our
language will be more effective if it goes beyond
the truth than if it falls short of it. However, I
have said enough on this topic, since I have already
dealt with it in my work on the causes of the decline
of oratory.
