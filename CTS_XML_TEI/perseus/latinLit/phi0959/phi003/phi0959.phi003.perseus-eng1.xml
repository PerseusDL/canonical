				<l>Once more, ye fair, attend your master's song,</l>
				<l>And learn what method will your charms prolong;</l>
				<l>What happy heart best recommends a face;</l>
				<l>What heightens beauty; what preserves a grace.</l>
				<l>Art improves nature; 'twas by art we found</l>
				<l>The vast advantages of furrow'd ground:</l>
				<l>The soil manur'd, a fruitful harvest bore,</l>
				<l>Where thorns and hungry brambles grew before.</l>
				<l>By art the gard'ner grafts his trees, to bear</l>
				<l>A kinder fruit, and recompense his care.</l>
				<l>A gilded roof delights our captive eyes,</l>
				<l>And stately monuments the sight surprise,</l>
				<l>Tho' sordid earth beneath the polish'd marble lies.</l>
				<l>The fleece may be with royal purple died,</l>
				<l>And <placeName key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> precious ivory provide,</l>
				<l>To please your fancies and supply your pride.</l>
				<l>When Tatius rul'd the ancient <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName>
					race,</l>
				<l>Then, rough and careless of a handsome face,</l>
				<l>The women took more pains to earn their bread</l>
				<l>At plough and cart, than how to dress the head;</l>
				<l>All day their task the busy matrons plied,</l>
				<l>Or spinning sat, as to their distaffs tied.</l>
				<l>The mother then at night would fold the sheep</l>
				<l>Her little daughter us'd by day to keep;</l>
				<l>And when at home, would cleave out logs of wood,</l>
				<l>Or kindle up a fire to boil their food.</l>
				<l>But you, by nature form'd in finer moulds,</l>
				<l>Must wrap your tender limbs in silken folds;</l>
				<l>Wear lawns and tissue, sleep in damask beds,</l>
				<l>And with gay knots and wires adorn your heads:</l>
				<l>Your ears with pendants, lockets on your arms,</l>
				<l>Besides a thousand other nameless charms.</l>
				<l>Nor needs this care to please a blush create;</l>
				<l>The men themselves have learned to dress of late.</l>
				<l>You are not now particular in clothes,</l>
				<l>The husband and the bridegroom both are beaux;</l>
				<l>Dress then, and 'tis no sin to dress with art,</l>
				<l>For that's the way to wound the lover's heart.</l>
				<l>E'en those that live remote in country towns,</l>
				<l>Will dress their hair with flowers and daisy crowns,</l>
				<l>And deck and prank themselves, to please the clowns.</l>
				<l>Besides, all women take a secret pride</l>
				<l>In being fine, or else they are belied;</l>
				<l>For when the conscious maid her glass explores,</l>
				<l>And finds she's handsome, she herself adores.</l>
				<l>Thus Juno's bird with silent pride will raise</l>
				<l>And spread his starry plumes, whene'er he meets with praise.</l>
				<l>This method will oblige our sex to love,</l>
				<l>And more than magic herbs their passions move.</l>
				<l>Trust not to philtres; all such stuff forbear;</l>
				<l>Nor try the venom of the lustful mare.</l>
				<l>'Tis all a jest; no snakes by such a force</l>
				<l>Enchanted burst, no rivers change their course;</l>
				<l>Nor can they make the moon from heaven descent</l>
				<l>Whate'er some superstitious fools pretend.</l>
				<l>First learn good breeding; that I first advise;</l>
				<l>Good carriage oft the other wants supplies.</l>
				<l>For when ill-natur'd age shall rudely plough</l>
				<l>Injurious furrows on your wrinkled brow,</l>
				<l>You then perhaps may chide the tell-tale glass,</l>
				<l>That shews the frightful ruins of your face;</l>
				<l>But if good humour to the last remain,</l>
				<l>E'en age may please, and love his force retain. <milestone ed="p" n="50"
						unit="carte"/></l>
				<l>Now on, my muse, and tell 'em, when they rise,</l>
				<l>When downy sleep forsakes their tender eyes,</l>
				<l>How they may look as fair as morning skies.</l>
				<l>Vetches, and beaten barley, let 'em take,</l>
				<l>And with the whites of eggs a mixture make;</l>
				<l>Then dry the precious paste with sun and wind</l>
				<l>And into powder very gently grind.</l>
				<l>Get hart's-horn next (but let it be the first</l>
				<l>That creature sheds), and beat it well to dust.</l>
				<l>Six pound in all; then mix and sift 'em well,</l>
				<l>And think the while how fond Narcissus fell;</l>
				<l>Six roots to you that pensive flower must yield</l>
				<l>To mingle with the rest, well bruis'd and cleanly pill'd.</l>
				<l>Two ounces next of gum, and thural seed,</l>
				<l>That for the gracious gods does incense breed,</l>
				<l>And let a double share of honey last succeed.</l>
				<l>With this whatever damsel paints her face,</l>
				<l>Will need no flattering glass to show a grace.</l>
