<l>Of shapes transformde to bodies straunge, I purpose to entreate,</l>
<l>Ye gods vouchsafe (for you are they ywrought this wondrous feate)</l>
<l>To further this mine enterprise. And from the world begunne,</l>
<l>Graunt that my verse may to my time, his course directly runne.

</l>
</div2>

<div2 type="card" n="5">

<l>Before the Sea and Lande were made, and Heaven that all doth hide, </l>
<l>In all the worlde one onely face of nature did abide,</l>
<l>Which Chaos hight, a huge rude heape, and nothing else but even</l>
<l>A heavie lump and clottred clod of seedes togither driven,</l>
<l>Of things at strife among themselves, for want of order due.</l>
<l>No sunne as yet with lightsome beames the shapelesse world did vew. </l>
<l>No Moone in growing did repayre hir hornes with borowed light.</l>
<l>Nor yet the earth amiddes the ayre did hang by wondrous slight</l>
<l>Just peysed by hir proper weight. Nor winding in and out</l>
<l>Did Amphitrytee with hir armes embrace the earth about.</l>
<l>For where was earth, was sea and ayre, so was the earth unstable.   </l>
<l>The ayre all darke, the sea likewise to beare a ship unable.</l>
<l>No kinde of thing had proper shape, but ech confounded other.</l>
<l>For in one selfesame bodie strove the hote and colde togither,</l>
<l>The moist with drie, the soft with hard, the light with things of weight.</l>
<l>This strife did God and Nature breake, and set in order streight.   </l>
<l>The earth from heaven, the sea from earth, he parted orderly,</l>
<l>And from the thicke and foggie ayre, he tooke the lightsome skie.</l>
<l>Which when he once unfolded had, and severed from the blinde</l>
<l>And clodded heape, he setting eche from other did them binde</l>
<l>In endlesse friendship to agree. The fire most pure and bright,  </l>
<l>The substance of the heaven it selfe, bicause it was so light</l>
<l>Did mount aloft, and set it selfe in highest place of all.</l>
<l>The second roume of right to ayre, for lightnesse did befall.</l>
<l>The earth more grosse drew down with it eche weighty kinde of matter,</l>
<l>And set it selfe in lowest place. Againe, the waving water  </l>
<l>Did lastly chalenge for his place, the utmost coast and bound,</l>
<l>Of all the compasse of the earth, to close the stedfast ground.</l>
<l>Now when he in this foresaid wise (what God so ere he was)</l>
<l>Had broke and into members put this rude confused masse,</l>
<l>Then first bicause in every part, the earth should equall bee,  </l>
<l>He made it like a mighty ball, in compasse as we see.</l>
<l>And here and there he cast in seas, to whome he gave a lawe:</l>
<l>To swell with every blast of winde, and every stormie flawe.</l>
<l>And with their waves continually to beate upon the shore,</l>
<l>Of all the earth within their boundes enclosde by them afore.</l>
<l>Moreover, Springs and mighty Meeres and Lakes he did augment,</l>
<l>And flowing streames of crooked brookes in winding bankes he pent.</l>
<l>Of which the earth doth drinke up some, and some with restlesse race</l>
<l>Do seeke the sea: where finding scope of larger roume and space,</l>
<l>In steade of bankes, they beate on shores. He did commaund the plaine  </l>
<l>And champion groundes to stretch out wide: and valleys to remaine</l>
<l>Aye underneath: and eke the woods to hide them decently</l>
<l>With tender leaves: and stonie hilles to lift themselves on hie.</l>
<l>And as two Zones doe cut the Heaven upon the righter side,</l>
<l>And other twaine upon the left likewise the same devide,    </l>
<l>The middle in outragious heat exceeding all the rest:</l>
<l>Even so likewise through great foresight to God it seemed best,</l>
<l>The earth encluded in the same should so devided bee,</l>
<l>As with the number of the Heaven, hir Zones might full agree.</l>
<l>Of which the middle Zone in heate, the utmost twaine in colde    </l>
<l>Exceede so farre, that there to dwell no creature dare be bolde.</l>
<l>Betweene these two so great extremes, two other Zones are fixt,</l>
<l>Where temprature of heate and colde indifferently is mixt.</l>
<l>Now over this doth hang the Ayre, which as it is more fleightie</l>
<l>Than earth or water: so againe than fire it is more weightie.  </l>
<l>There hath he placed mist and cloudes, and for to feare mens mindes,</l>
<l>The thunder and the lightning eke, with colde and blustring windes.</l>
<l>But yet the maker of the worlde permitteth not alway</l>
<l>The windes to use the ayre at will. For at this present day,</l>
<l>Though ech from other placed be in sundry coasts aside,       </l>
<l>The violence of their boystrous blasts, things scarsly can abide.</l>
<l>They so turmoyle as though they would the world in pieces rende,</l>
<l>So cruell is those brothers wrath when that they doe contende.</l>
<l>And therefore to the morning graye, the Realme of Nabathie,</l>
<l>To <placeName key="tgn,7001282">Persis</placeName> and to other lands and countries that doe lie</l>
<l>Farre underneath the Morning starre, did Eurus take his flight.</l>
<l>Likewise the setting of the Sunne, and shutting in of night</l>
<l>Belong to Zephyr. And the blasts of blustring Boreas raigne,</l>
<l>in <placeName key="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName> and in other landes set under Charles his waine.</l>
<l>And unto Auster doth belong the coast of all the South,       </l>
<l>Who beareth shoures and rotten mistes, continuall in his mouth.</l>
<l>Above all these he set aloft the cleare and lightsome skie,</l>
<l>Without all dregs of earthly filth or grossenesse utterlie.</l>
<l>The boundes of things were scarsly yet by him thus pointed out,</l>
<l>But that appeared in the heaven, starres glistring all about,  </l>
<l>Which in the said confused heape had hidden bene before,</l>
<l>And to th'intent with lively things eche Region for to store,</l>
<l>The heavenly soyle, to Gods and Starres and Planets first he gave.</l>
<l>The waters next both fresh and salt he let the fishes have.</l>
<l>The suttle ayre to flickring fowles and birdes he hath assignde.  </l>
<l>The earth to beasts both wilde and tame of sundrie sort and kinde.</l>
<l>Howbeit yet of all this while, the creature wanting was,</l>
<l>Farre more devine, of nobler minde, which should the residue passe</l>
<l>In depth of knowledge, reason, wit, and high capacitie,</l>
<l>And which of all the residue should the Lord and ruler bee.   </l>
<l>Then eyther he that made the worlde, and things in order set,</l>
<l>Of heavenly seede engendred Man: or else the earth as yet</l>
<l>Yong, lustie, fresh, and in hir floures, and parted from the skie,</l>
<l>But late before, the seede thereof as yet held inwardlie.</l>
<l>The which Prometheus tempring straight with water of the spring, </l>
<l>Did make in likenesse to the Gods that governe everie thing.</l>
<l>And where all other beasts behold the ground with groveling eie,</l>
<l>He gave to Man a stately looke replete with majestie.</l>
<l>And willde him to behold the Heaven wyth countnance cast on hie,</l>
<l>To marke and understand what things were in the starrie skie.   </l>
<l>And thus the earth which late before had neyther shape nor hew,</l>
<l>Did take the noble shape of man, and was transformed new.

</l>
</div2>

<div2 type="card" n="89">

<l>Then sprang up first the golden age, which of it selfe maintainde</l>
<l>The truth and right of every thing unforct and unconstrainde.</l>
<l>There was no feare of punishment, there was no threatning lawe </l>
<l>In brazen tables nayled up, to keepe the folke in awe.</l>
<l>There was no man would crouch or creepe to Judge with cap in hand,</l>
<l>They lived safe without a Judge, in everie Realme and lande.</l>
<l>The loftie Pynetree was not hewen from mountaines where it stood,</l>
<l>In seeking straunge and forren landes, to rove upon the flood.  </l>
<l>Men knew none other countries yet, than where themselves did keepe:</l>
<l>There was no towne enclosed yet, with walles and diches deepe.</l>
<l>No horne nor trumpet was in use, no sword nor helmet worne,</l>
<l>The worlde was such, that souldiers helpe might easly be forborne.</l>
<l>The fertile earth as yet was free, untoucht of spade or plough,  </l>
<l>And yet it yeelded of it selfe of every things inough.</l>
<l>And men themselves contented well with plaine and simple foode,</l>
<l>That on the earth of natures gift without their travail stoode,</l>
<l>Did live by Raspis, heppes and hawes, by cornelles, plummes and cherries,</l>
<l>By sloes and apples, nuttes and peares, and lothsome bramble berries, </l>
<l>And by the acornes dropt on ground, from Joves brode tree in fielde.</l>
<l>The Springtime lasted all the yeare, and Zephyr with his milde</l>
<l>And gentle blast did cherish things that grew of owne accorde,</l>
<l>The ground untilde, all kinde of fruits did plenteously afforde.</l>
<l>No mucke nor tillage was bestowde on leane and barren land,    </l>
<l>To make the corne of better head, and ranker for to stand.</l>
<l>Then streames ran milke, then streames ran wine, and yellow honny flowde</l>
<l>From ech greene tree whereon the rayes of firie Phebus glowde.</l>
<l>But when that into Lymbo once Saturnus being thrust,</l>
<l>The rule and charge of all the worlde was under Jove unjust,  </l>
<l>And that the silver age came in, more somewhat base than golde,</l>
<l>More precious yet than freckled brasse, immediatly the olde</l>
<l>And auncient Spring did Jove abridge, and made therof anon,</l>
<l>Foure seasons: Winter, Sommer, Spring, and Autumne off and on:</l>
<l>Then first of all began the ayre with fervent heate to swelt.    </l>
<l>Then Isycles hung roping downe: then for the colde was felt</l>
<l>Men gan to shroud themselves in house. Their houses were the thickes,</l>
<l>And bushie queaches, hollow caves, or hardels made of stickes.</l>
<l>Then first of all were furrowes drawne, and corne was cast in ground.</l>
<l>The simple Oxe with sorie sighes, to heavie yoke was bound.       </l>
<l>Next after this succeded streight, the third and brazen age:</l>
<l>More hard of nature, somewhat bent to cruell warres and rage.</l>
<l>But yet not wholy past all grace. Of yron is the last</l>
<l>In no part good and tractable as former ages past.</l>
<l>For when that of this wicked Age once opened was the veyne       </l>
<l>Therein all mischief rushed forth: then Fayth and Truth were faine</l>
<l>And honest shame to hide their heades: for whom crept stoutly in,</l>
<l>Craft, Treason, Violence, Envie, Pride and wicked Lust to win.</l>
<l>The shipman hoyst his sailes to wind, whose names he did not knowe:</l>
<l>And shippes that erst in toppes of hilles and mountaines had ygrowe,  </l>
<l>Did leape and daunce on uncouth waves: and men began to bound</l>
<l>With dowles and diches drawen in length the free and fertile ground,</l>
<l>Which was as common as the Ayre and light of Sunne before.</l>
<l>Not onely corne and other fruites, for sustnance and for store,</l>
<l>Were now exacted of the Earth: but eft they gan to digge,         </l>
<l>And in the bowels of the ground unsaciably to rigge,</l>
<l>For Riches coucht and hidden deepe, in places nere to Hell,</l>
<l>The spurres and stirrers unto vice, and foes to doing well.</l>
<l>Then hurtfull yron came abrode, then came forth yellow golde,</l>
<l>More hurtfull than the yron farre, then came forth battle bolde,   </l>
<l>That feightes with bothe, and shakes his sword in cruell bloudy hand.</l>
<l>Men live by ravine and by stelth: the wandring guest doth stand</l>
<l>In daunger of his host: the host in daunger of his guest:</l>
<l>And fathers of their sonne in lawes: yea seldome time doth rest,</l>
<l>Betweene borne brothers such accord and love as ought to bee.    </l>
<l>The goodman seekes the goodwifes death, and his againe seeks shee.</l>
<l>The stepdames fell their husbandes sonnes with poyson do assayle.</l>
<l>To see their fathers live so long the children doe bewayle.</l>
<l>All godlynesse lies under foote. And Ladie Astrey, last</l>
<l>Of heavenly vertues, from this earth in slaughter drowned past.    </l>
<l>And to th'intent the earth alone thus should not be opprest,</l>
<l>And heaven above in slouthfull ease and carelesse quiet rest,</l>
<l>Men say that Giantes went about the Realme of Heaven to win</l>
<l>To place themselves to raigne as Gods and lawlesse Lordes therein.</l>
<l>And hill on hill they heaped up aloft into the skie,               </l>
<l>Till God almighty from the Heaven did let his thunder flie,</l>
<l>The dint whereof the ayrie tops of high <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> brake,</l>
<l>And pressed Pelion violently from under <placeName key="tgn,2095742">Ossa</placeName> strake.</l>
<l>When whelmed in their wicked worke those cursed Caitives lay,</l>
<l>The Earth their mother tooke their bloud yet warme and (as they say) </l>
<l>Did give it life. And for bicause some ympes should still remaine</l>
<l>Of that same stocke, she gave it shape and limmes of men againe.</l>
<l>This offspring eke against the Gods did beare a native spight,</l>
<l>In slaughter and in doing wrong was all their whole delight.</l>
<l>Their deedes declared them of bloud engendred for to bee.         

</l>
</div2>

<div2 type="card" n="163">

<l>The which as soone as Saturns sonne from Heaven aloft did see,</l>
<l>He fetcht a sigh, and therwithall revolving in his thought</l>
<l>The shamefull act which at a feast Lycaon late had wrought,</l>
<l>As yet unknowne or blowne abrode: He gan thereat to storme</l>
<l>And stomacke like an angry Jove. And therfore to reforme          </l>
<l>Such haynous actes, he sommonde streight his Court of Parliament,</l>
<l>Whereto resorted all the Gods that had their sommons sent.</l>
<l>Highe in the Welkin is a way apparant to the sight</l>
<l>In starrie nights, which of his passing whitenesse Milkie hight:</l>
<l>It is the streete that to the Court and Princely Pallace leades,  </l>
<l>Of mightie Jove whose thunderclaps eche living creature dreades.</l>
<l>On both the sides of this same waye do stand in stately port</l>
<l>The sumptuous houses of the Peeres. For all the common sort</l>
<l>Dwell scattring here and there abrode: the face of all the skie</l>
<l>The houses of the chiefe estates and Princes doe supplie.    </l>
<l>And sure and if I may be bolde to speake my fancie free</l>
<l>I take this place of all the Heaven the Pallace for to bee.</l>
<l>Now when the Goddes assembled were, and eche had tane his place,</l>
<l>Jove standing up aloft and leaning on his yvorie Mace,</l>
<l>Right dreadfully his bushie lockes did thrise or four times shake,    </l>
<l>Wherewith he made both Sea and Land and Heaven it self to quake,</l>
<l>And afterward in wrathfull wordes his angrie minde thus brake:</l>
<l>I never was in greater care nor more perplexitie,</l>
<l>How to maintaine my soveraigne state and Princelie royaltie,</l>
<l>When with their hundreth handes apiece the Adderfooted rout,   </l>
<l>Did practise for to conquere Heaven and for to cast us out.</l>
<l>For though it were a cruell foe: yet did that warre depende</l>
<l>Upon one ground, and in one stocke it had his finall ende.</l>
<l>But now as farre as any sea about the worlde doth winde,</l>
<l>I must destroy both man and beast and all the mortall kinde.  </l>
<l>I sweare by Styxes hideous streames that run within the ground,</l>
<l>All other meanes must first be sought: but when there can be found</l>
<l>No helpe to heale a festred sore, it must away be cut,</l>
<l>Lest that the partes that yet are sound, in daunger should be put.</l>
<l>We have a number in the worlde that mans estate surmount,    </l>
<l>Of such whom for their private Gods the countrie folkes account,</l>
<l>As Satyres, Faunes, and sundry Nymphes, with Silvanes eke beside,</l>
<l>That in the woods and hillie grounds continually abide.</l>
<l>Whome into Heaven since that as yet we vouch not safe to take,</l>
<l>And of the honour of this place copartners for to make,      </l>
<l>Such landes as to inhabite in, we erst to them assignde,</l>
<l>That they should still enjoye the same, it is my will and minde.</l>
<l>But can you thinke that they in rest and safetie shall remaine</l>
<l>When proud Lycaon laye in waite by secret meanes and traine</l>
<l>To have confounded me your Lorde, who in my hand doe beare    </l>
<l>The dreadfull thunder, and of whom even you doe stand in feare?</l>
<l>The house was moved at his words and earnestly requirde,</l>
<l>The man that had so traiterously against their Lord conspirde.</l>
<l>Even so when Rebels did arise to stroy the Romane name,</l>
<l>By shedding of our Cesars bloud, the horror of the same      </l>
<l>Did pierce the heartes of all mankinde, and made the world to quake.</l>
<l>Whose fervent zeale in thy behalfe (O August) thou did take,</l>
<l>As thankfully as Jove doth heare the loving care of his,</l>
<l>Who beckning to them with his hand, forbiddeth them to hisse.</l>
<l>And therewithall through all the house attentive silence is.   </l>
<l>As soone as that his majestie all muttring had alayde,</l>
<l>He brake the silence once againe, and thus unto them sayde:</l>
<l>Let passe this carefull thought of yours: for he that did offende,</l>
<l>Hath dearely bought the wicked Act, the which he did entende.</l>
<l>Yet shall you heare what was his fault and vengeance for the same.  </l>
<l>A foule report and infamie unto our hearing came</l>
<l>Of mischiefe used in those times: which wishing all untrew</l>
<l>I did descend in shape of man, th'infamed Earth to vew.</l>
<l>It were a processe overlong to tell you of the sinne,</l>
<l>That did abound in every place where as I entred in.           </l>
<l>The bruit was lesser than the truth, and partiall in report.</l>
<l>The dreadfull dennes of Menalus where savage beastes resort</l>
<l>And Cyllen had I overpast, with all the Pynetrees hie</l>
<l>Of cold Lyceus, and from thence I entred by and by</l>
<l>The herbroughlesse and cruell house of late th'Arcadian King,  </l>
<l>Such time as twilight on the Earth dim darknesse gan to bring.</l>
<l>I gave a signe that God was come, and streight the common sort</l>
<l>Devoutly prayde, whereat Lycaon first did make a sport</l>
<l>And after said: By open proufe, ere long I minde to see,</l>
<l>If that this wight a mighty God or mortall creature bee.       </l>
<l>The truth shall trie it selfe: he ment (the sequele did declare)</l>
<l>To steale upon me in the night, and kyll me unbeware.</l>
<l>And yet he was not so content: but went and cut the throte,</l>
<l>Of one that laye in hostage there, which was an Epyrote:</l>
<l>And part of him he did to rost, and part he did to stewe.      </l>
<l>Which when it came upon the borde, forthwith I overthrew</l>
<l>The house with just revenging fire upon the owners hed,</l>
<l>Who seeing that, slipt out of doores amazde for feare, and fled</l>
<l>Into the wilde and desert woods, where being all alone,</l>
<l>As he endevorde (but in vaine) to speake and make his mone,    </l>
<l>He fell a howling: wherewithall for verie rage and moode</l>
<l>He ran me quite out of his wits and waxed furious woode.</l>
<l>Still practising his wonted lust of slaughter on the poore</l>
<l>And sielie cattle, thirsting still for bloud as heretofore,</l>
<l>His garments turnde to shackie haire, his armes to rugged pawes:   </l>
<l>So is he made a ravening Wolfe: whose shape expressely drawes</l>
<l>To that the which he was before: his skinne is horie graye,</l>
<l>His looke still grim with glaring eyes, and every kinde of waye</l>
<l>His cruell heart in outward shape doth well it selfe bewraye.</l>
<l>Thus was one house destroyed quite, but that one house alone  </l>
<l>Deserveth not to be destroyde: in all the Earth is none,</l>
<l>But that such vice doth raigne therein, as that ye would beleve,</l>
<l>That all had sworne and solde themselves to mischiefe us to greve.</l>
<l>And therefore as they all offende: so am I fully bent,</l>
<l>That all forthwith (as they deserve) shall have due punishment.   </l>
<l>These wordes of Jove some of the Gods did openly approve,</l>
<l>And with their sayings more to wrath his angry courage move.</l>
<l>And some did give assent by signes. Yet did it grieve them all</l>
<l>That such destruction utterly on all mankinde should fall,</l>
<l>Demaunding what he purposed with all the Earth to doe,      </l>
<l>When that he had all mortall men so cleane destroyde, and whoe</l>
<l>On holie Altars afterward should offer frankinsence,</l>
<l>And whother that he were in minde to leave the Earth fro thence</l>
<l>To savage beastes to wast and spoyle, bicause of mans offence.</l>
<l>The king of Gods bade cease their thought and questions in that case, </l>
<l>And cast the care thereof on him. Within a little space</l>
<l>He promist for to frame a newe, an other kinde of men</l>
<l>By wondrous meanes, unlike the first to fill the world agen.

<l>He called Tryton to him straight, his trumpetter, who stoode</l>
<l>In purple robe on shoulder cast, aloft upon the floode,    </l>
<l>And bade him take his sounding Trumpe and out of hand to blow</l>
<l>Retreat, that all the streames might heare, and cease from thence to flow.</l>
<l>He tooke his Trumpet in his hand, hys Trumpet was a shell</l>
<l>Of some great Whelke or other fishe, in facion like a Bell</l>
<l>That gathered narrow to the mouth, and as it did descende   </l>
<l>Did waxe more wide and writhen still, downe to the nether ende:</l>
<l>When that this Trumpe amid the Sea was set to Trytons mouth,</l>
<l>He blew so loude that all the streames both East, West, North and South,</l>
<l>Might easly heare him blow retreate, and all that heard the sounde</l>
<l>Immediatly began to ebbe and draw within their bounde.      </l>
<l>Then gan the Sea to have a shore, and brookes to finde a banke,</l>

<l>O sister, O my loving spouse, O sielie woman left,</l>
<l>As onely remnant of thy sexe that water hath bereft,</l>
<l>Whome Nature first by right of birth hath linked to me fast</l>
<l>In that we brothers children bene: and secondly the chast</l>
<l>And stedfast bond of lawfull bed: and lastly now of all,    </l>
<l>The present perils of the time that latelye did befall.</l>
<l>On all the Earth from East to West where Phebus shewes his face</l>
<l>There is no moe but thou and I of all the mortall race.</l>
<l>The Sea hath swallowed all the rest: and scarsly are we sure,</l>
<l>That our two lives from dreadfull death in safetie shall endure.    </l>
<l>For even as yet the duskie cloudes doe make my heart adrad.</l>
<l>Alas poore wretched sielie soule, what heart wouldst thou have had</l>
<l>To beare these heavie happes, if chaunce had let thee scape alone?</l>
<l>Who should have bene thy consort then: who should have rewd thy mone?</l>
<l>Now trust me truly, loving wife, had thou as now bene drownde,  </l>
<l>I would have followde after thee and in the sea bene fownde.</l>
<l>Would God I could my fathers Arte, of claye to facion men</l>
<l>And give them life that people might frequent the world agen.</l>
<l>Mankinde (alas) doth onely now wythin us two consist,</l>
<l>As mouldes whereby to facion men. For so the Gods doe lyst.  </l>
<l>And with these words the bitter teares did trickle down their cheeke,</l>
<l>Untill at length betweene themselves they did agree to seeke</l>
<l>To God by prayer for his grace, and to demaund his ayde</l>
<l>By aunswere of his Oracle. Wherein they nothing stayde,</l>
<l>But to Cephisus sadly went, whose streame as at that time  </l>
<l>Began to run within his bankes though thicke with muddie slime,</l>
<l>Whose sacred liquor straight they tooke and sprinkled with the same</l>
<l>Their heads and clothes: and afterward to Themis chappell came,</l>
<l>The roofe whereof with cindrie mosse was almost overgrowne.</l>
<l>For since the time the raging floud the worlde had overflowne,    </l>
<l>No creature came within the Churche: so that the Altars stood</l>
<l>Without one sparke of holie fyre or any sticke of wood.</l>
<l>As soon as that this couple came within the chappell doore,</l>
<l>They fell downe flat upon the ground, and trembling kist the floore.</l>
<l>And sayde: If prayer that proceedes from humble heart and minde </l>
<l>May in the presence of the Gods, such grace and favor finde</l>
<l>As to appease their worthie wrath, then vouch thou safe to tell</l>
<l>(O gentle Themis) how the losse that on our kinde befell,</l>
<l>May now eftsoones recovered be, and helpe us to repaire</l>
<l>The world, which drowned under waves doth lie in great dispaire. </l>
<l>The Goddesse moved with their sute, this answere did them make:</l>
<l>Depart you hence: Go hille your heads, and let your garmentes slake,</l>
<l>And both of you your Graundames bones behind your shoulders cast.</l>
<l>They stoode amazed at these wordes, tyll Pyrrha at the last,</l>
<l>Refusing to obey the hest the which the Goddesse gave,         </l>
<l>Brake silence, and with trembling cheere did meekely pardon crave.</l>
<l>For sure she saide she was afraide hir Graundames ghost to hurt</l>
<l>By taking up hir buried bones to throw them in the durt.</l>
<l>And with the aunswere here upon eftsoones in hand they go,</l>
<l>The doubtfull wordes wherof they scan and canvas to and fro.</l>
<l>Which done, Prometheus sonne began by counsell wise and sage</l>
<l>His cousin germanes fearfulnesse thus gently to asswage:</l>
<l>Well, eyther in these doubtfull words is hid some misterie,</l>
<l>Whereof the Gods permit us not the meaning to espie,</l>
<l>Or questionlesse and if the sence of inward sentence deeme     </l>
<l>Like as the tenour of the words apparantly doe seeme,</l>
<l>It is no breach of godlynesse to doe as God doth bid.</l>
<l>I take our Graundame for the earth, the stones within hir hid</l>
<l>I take for bones, these are the bones the which are meaned here.</l>
<l>Though Titans daughter at this wise conjecture of hir fere     </l>
<l>Were somewhat movde, yet none of both did stedfast credit geve,</l>
<l>So hardly could they in their heartes the heavenly hestes beleve.</l>
<l>But what and if they made a proufe? what harme could come thereby?</l>
<l>They went their wayes and heild their heades, and did their cotes untie.</l>
<l>And at their backes did throw the stones by name of bones foretolde.  </l>
<l>The stones (who would beleve the thing, but that the time of olde</l>
<l>Reportes it for a stedfast truth?) of nature tough and harde,</l>
<l>Began to warre both soft and smothe: and shortly afterwarde</l>
<l>To winne therwith a better shape: and as they did encrease,</l>
<l>A mylder nature in them grew, and rudenesse gan to cease.      </l>
<l>For at the first their shape was such, as in a certaine sort</l>
<l>Resembled man, but of the right and perfect shape came short.</l>
<l>Even like to Marble ymages new drawne and roughly wrought,</l>
<l>Before the Carver by his Arte to purpose hath them brought.</l>
<l>Such partes of them where any juice or moysture did abound,    </l>
<l>Or else were earthie, turned to flesh: and such as were so sound,</l>
<l>And harde as would not bow nor bende did turne to bones: againe</l>
<l>The part that was a veyne before, doth still his name retaine.</l>
<l>Thus by the mightie powre of God ere lenger time was past,</l>
<l>The mankinde was restorde by stones, the which a man did cast.    </l>
<l>And likewise also by the stones the which a woman threw,</l>
<l>The womankinde repayred was and made againe of new.</l>
<l>Of these are we the crooked ympes, and stonie race in deede,</l>
<l>Bewraying by our toyling life, from whence we doe proceede.

<l>With fearefull steppes, and left him in the midst of all his tale. </l>
<l>And as she ran the meeting windes hir garments backewarde blue,</l>
<l>So that hir naked skinne apearde behinde hir as she flue,</l>
<l>Hir goodly yellowe golden haire that hanged loose and slacke,</l>
<l>With every puffe of ayre did wave and tosse behinde hir backe.</l>
<l>Hir running made hir seeme more fayre, the youthfull God therefore </l>
<l>Coulde not abyde to waste his wordes in dalyance any more.</l>
<l>But as his love advysed him he gan to mende his pace,</l>
<l>And with the better foote before, the fleeing Nymph to chace.</l>
<l>And even as when the greedie Grewnde doth course the sielie Hare,</l>
<l>Amiddes the plaine and champion fielde without all covert bare,   </l>
<l>Both twaine of them doe straine themselves and lay on footemanship,</l>
<l>Who may best runne with all his force the tother to outstrip,</l>
<l>The t'one for safetie of his lyfe, the tother for his pray,</l>
<l>The Grewnde aye prest with open mouth to beare the Hare away,</l>
<l>Thrusts forth his snoute and gyrdeth out and at hir loynes doth snatch, </l>
<l>As though he would at everie stride betweene his teeth hir latch:</l>
<l>Againe in doubt of being caught the Hare aye shrinking slips</l>
<l>Upon the sodaine from his Jawes, and from betweene his lips:</l>
<l>So farde Apollo and the Mayde: hope made Apollo swift,</l>
<l>And feare did make the Mayden fleete devising how to shift.   </l>
<l>Howebeit he that did pursue of both the swifter went,</l>
<l>As furthred by the feathred wings that Cupid had him lent,</l>
<l>So that he would not let hir rest, but preased at hir heele</l>
<l>So neere that through hir scattred haire she might his breathing feele.</l>
<l>But when she sawe hir breath was gone and strength began to fayle  </l>
<l>The colour faded in hir cheekes, and ginning for to quayle,</l>
<l>Shee looked to Penaeus streame and sayde: Nowe Father dere,</l>
<l>And if yon streames have powre of Gods then help your daughter here.</l>
<l>O let the earth devour me quicke, on which I seeme too fayre,</l>
<l>Or else this shape which is my harme by chaunging straight appayre. </l>
<l>This piteous prayer scarsly sed: hir sinewes waxed starke,</l>
<l>And therewithall about hir breast did grow a tender barke.</l>
<l>Hir haire was turned into leaves, hir armes in boughes did growe,</l>
<l>Hir feete that were ere while so swift, now rooted were as slowe.</l>
<l>Hir crowne became the toppe, and thus of that she earst had beene, </l>
<l>Remayned nothing in the worlde, but beautie fresh and greene.</l>
<l>Which when that Phoebus did beholde (affection did so move)</l>
<l>The tree to which his love was turnde he coulde no lesse but love,</l>
<l>And as he softly layde his hande upon the tender plant,</l>
<l>Within the barke newe overgrowne he felt hir heart yet pant.  </l>
<l>And in his armes embracing fast hir boughes and braunches lythe,</l>
<l>He proferde kisses to the tree, the tree did from him writhe.</l>
<l>Well (quoth Apollo) though my Feere and spouse thou can not bee,</l>
<l>Assuredly from this tyme forth yet shalt thou be my tree.</l>
<l>Thou shalt adorne my golden lockes, and eke my pleasant Harpe, </l>
<l>Thou shalt adorne my Quyver full of shaftes and arrowes sharpe.</l>
<l>Thou shalt adorne the valiant knyghts and royall Emperours:</l>
<l>When for their noble feates of armes like mightie conquerours,</l>
<l>Triumphantly with stately pompe up to the Capitoll,</l>

<l>Even so this honour give I thee continually to have         </l>
<l>Thy braunches clad from time to tyme with leaves both fresh and brave.</l>
<l>Now when that Pean of this talke had fully made an ende,</l>

<l>That may be heard a great way off. This is the fixed seate,</l>
<l>This is the house and dwelling place and chamber of the greate</l>

<l>Augments the waters of his streame, bewayling piteously</l>

<l>And not a God of meaner sort, but even the same that hath</l>
<l>The heavenly scepter in his hande, who in my dreadfull wrath,</l>
<l>Do dart downe thunder wandringly: and therefore make no hast</l>

<l>When Jove intending now in vaine no lenger tyme to leese,</l>
<l>Upon the Countrie all about did bring a foggie mist,</l>
<l>And caught the Mayden whome poore foole he used as he list.</l>
<l>Queene Juno looking downe that while upon the open field,  </l>
<l>When in so fayre a day such mistes and darkenesse she behelde,</l>
<l>Dyd marvell much, for well she knewe those mistes ascended not</l>

<l>She lookt about hir for hir Jove as one that was acquainted</l>
<l>With such escapes and with the deede had often him attainted.   </l>
<l>Whome when she founde not in the heaven: Onlesse I gesse amisse,</l>
<l>Some wrong agaynst me (quoth she) now my husbande working is.</l>
<l>And with that worde she left the Heaven, and downe to earth shee came,</l>
<l>Commaunding all the mistes away. But Jove foresees the same,</l>
<l>And to a Cow as white as milke his <placeName key="tgn,7003763">Leman</placeName> he convayes.       </l>
<l>She was a goodly Heifer sure: and Juno did hir prayse,</l>
<l>Although (God wot) she thought it not, and curiously she sought,</l>
<l>Where she was bred, whose Cow she was, who had hir thither broughte</l>
<l>As though she had not knowne the truth. Hir husband by and by</l>
<l>(Bycause she should not search too neare) devisde a cleanly lie,  </l>
<l>And tolde hir that the Cow was bred even nowe out of the grounde.</l>
<l>Then Juno who hir husbands shift at fingers endes had founde,</l>
<l>Desirde to have the Cow of gift. What should he doe as tho?</l>
<l>Great cruelnesse it were to yeelde his Lover to hir so.</l>
<l>And not to give would breede mistrust. As fast as shame provoked, </l>
<l>So fast agayne a tother side his Love his minde revoked.</l>
<l>So much that Love was at the poynt to put all shame to flight.</l>
<l>But that he feared if he should denie a gift so light</l>
<l>As was a Cowe to hir that was his sister and his wyfe,</l>
<l>Might make hir thinke it was no Cow, and breede perchaunce some strife. </l>
<l>Now when that Juno had by gift hir husbands <placeName key="tgn,7003763">Leman</placeName> got,</l>

<l>For doubt he should invent some meanes to steale hir from hir: till</l>
<l>To Argus, olde Aristors sonne, she put hir for to keepe.    </l>
<l>This Argus had an hundreth eyes: of which by turne did sleepe</l>
<l>Alwayes a couple, and the rest did duely watch and warde,</l>
<l>And of the charge they tooke in hande had ever good regarde,</l>
<l>What way so ever Argus stood with face, with backe, or side,</l>
<l>To Io warde, before his eyes did lo still abide.            </l>
<l>All day he let hir graze abroade, the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> once under ground</l>
<l>He shut hir up and by the necke with wrythen Withe hir bound.</l>
<l>With croppes of trees and bitter weedes now was she dayly fed,</l>
<l>And in the stead of costly couch and good soft featherbed,</l>
<l>She sate a nightes upon the ground, and on such ground whereas  </l>
<l>Was not sometime so much as grasse: and oftentymes she was</l>
<l>Compeld to drinke of muddie pittes: and when she did devise</l>
<l>To Argus for to lift hir handes in meeke and humble wise,</l>
<l>She sawe she had no handes at all: and when she did assay</l>
<l>To make complaint, she lowed out, which did hir so affray,  </l>
<l>That oft she started at the noyse, and would have runne away.</l>
<l>Unto hir father Inachs banckes she also did resorte,</l>
<l>Where many a tyme and oft before she had beene wont to sporte.</l>
<l>Now when she looked in the streame, and sawe hir horned hed,</l>
<l>She was agast and from hir selfe would all in hast have fled.  </l>
<l>The Nymphes hir sisters knewe hir not nor yet hir owne deare father,</l>
<l>Yet followed she both him and them, and suffred them the rather</l>
<l>To touch and stroke hir where they list, as one that preaced still</l>
<l>To set hir selfe to wonder at and gaze upon their fill.</l>
<l>The good old Inach puls up grasse and to hir straight it beares.</l>
<l>She as she kyst and lickt his handes did shed forth dreerie teares.</l>
<l>And had she had hir speach at will to utter forth hir thought,</l>
<l>She would have tolde hir name and chaunce and him of helpe besought.</l>

<l>He shrieked out full piteously: Now wo is me, again.</l>
<l>Alas art thou my daughter deare, whome through the worlde I sought </l>
<l>And could not finde, and now by chaunce art to my presence brought?</l>
<l>My sorrow certesse lesser farre a thousande folde had beene</l>
<l>If never had I seene thee more, than thus to have thee seene.</l>
<l>Thou standst as dombe and to my wordes no answere can thou give,</l>
<l>But from the bottom of thy heart full sorie sighes dost drive  </l>
<l>As tokens of thine inwarde griefe, and doolefully dost mooe</l>
<l>Unto my talke, the onely thing leaft in thy powre to dooe.</l>
<l>But I mistrusting nothing lesse than this so great mischaunce,</l>
<l>By some great mariage earnestly did seeke thee to advaunce,</l>
<l>In hope some yssue to have seene betweene my sonne and thee.   </l>
<l>But now thou must a husband have among the Heirds I see,</l>
<l>And eke thine issue must be such as other cattels bee.</l>
<l>Oh that I were a mortall wight as other creatures are,</l>
<l>For then might death in length of time quite rid mee of this care,</l>
<l>But now bycause I am a God, and fate doth death denie,    </l>
<l>There is no helpe but that my griefe must last eternallie.</l>
<l>As Inach made this piteous mone quicke sighted Argus drave</l>
<l>His daughter into further fieldes to which he could not have</l>
<l>Accesse, and he himselfe aloof did get him to a hill,</l>
<l>From whence he sitting at his ease viewd everie way at will.  </l>
<l>Now could no lenger Jove abide his Lover so forlorne,</l>
<l>And thereupon he cald his sonne that <placeName key="tgn,1049816">Maia</placeName> had him borne,</l>
<l>Commaunding Argus should be kild. He made no long abod,</l>
<l>But tyde his feathers to his feete, and tooke his charmed rod.</l>
<l>(With which he bringeth things asleepe, and fetcheth soules from Hell) </l>
<l>And put his Hat upon his head: and when that all was well</l>
<l>He leaped from his fathers towres, and downe to earth he flue</l>
<l>And there both Hat and winges also he lightly from him thrue,</l>
<l>Retayning nothing but his staffe, the which he closely helde</l>
<l>Betweene his elbowe and his side, and through the common fielde </l>
<l>Went plodding lyke some good plaine soule that had some flocke to feede.</l>
<l>And as he went he pyped still upon an Oten Reede.</l>
<l>Queene Junos Heirdman farre in love with this straunge melodie</l>
<l>Bespake him thus: Good fellow mine, I pray thee heartely</l>
<l>Come sitte downe by me on this hill, for better feede I knowe  </l>
<l>Thou shalt not finde in all these fieldes, and (as the thing doth showe)</l>
<l>It is a coole and shadowie plot, for sheepeheirds verie fitte.</l>
<l>Downe by his elbow by and by did Atlas nephew sit.</l>
<l>And for to passe the tyme withall for seeming overlong,</l>
<l>He helde him talke of this and that, and now and than among  </l>
<l>He playd upon his merrie Pipe to cause his watching eyes</l>
<l>To fall asleepe. Poore Argus did the best he could devise</l>
<l>To overcome the pleasant nappes: and though that some did sleepe,</l>
<l>Yet of his eyes the greater part he made their watch to keepe.</l>
<l>And after other talke he askt (for lately was it founde)  </l>
<l>Who was the founder of that Pype that did so sweetely sounde.</l>
<l>Then sayde the God: There dwelt sometime a Nymph of noble fame</l>
<l>Among the hilles of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadie</placeName>, that Syrinx had to name.</l>
<l>Of all the Nymphes of Nonacris and Fairie farre and neere,</l>
<l>In beautie and in personage thys Ladie had no peere.               </l>
<l>Full often had she given the slippe both to the Satyrs quicke</l>
<l>And other Gods that dwell in Woods, and in the Forrests thicke,</l>
<l>Or in the fruitfull fieldes abrode: It was hir whole desire</l>
<l>To follow chaste Dianas guise in Maydenhead and attire,</l>
<l>Whome she did counterfaite so nighe, that such as did hir see    </l>
<l>Might at a blush have taken hir Diana for to bee,</l>
<l>But that the Nymph did in hir hande a bowe of Cornell holde,</l>
<l>Whereas Diana evermore did beare a bowe of golde.</l>
<l>And yet she did deceyve folke so. Upon a certaine day</l>
<l>God Pan with garland on his heade of Pinetree, sawe hir stray    </l>
<l>From Mount Lyceus all alone, and thus to hir did say:</l>
<l>Unto a Gods request, O Nymph, voucesafe thou to agree</l>
<l>That doth desire thy wedded spouse and husband for to bee.</l>
<l>There was yet more behinde to tell: as how that Syrinx fled,</l>
<l>Through waylesse woods and gave no eare to that that Pan had sed, </l>
<l>Untill she to the gentle streame of sandie Ladon came,</l>
<l>Where, for bicause it was so deepe, she could not passe the same,</l>
<l>She piteously to chaunge hir shape the water Nymphes besought:</l>
<l>And how when Pan betweene his armes, to catch the Nymph had thought,</l>
<l>In steade of hir he caught the Reedes newe growne upon the brooke, </l>
<l>And as he sighed, with his breath the Reedes he softly shooke</l>
<l>Which made a still and mourning noyse, with straungnesse of the which</l>

<l>Of this same <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> that cheares the world with light indifferently</l>
<l>Wert thou begot: and if I fayne, then with my heart I pray,</l>
<l>That never may I see him more unto my dying day.</l>
<l>But if thou have so great desire thy father for to knowe,</l>
<l>Thou shalt not neede in that behalfe much labour to bestowe.       </l>
<l>The place from whence he doth arise adjoyneth to our lande.</l>
<l>And if thou thinke thy heart will serve, then go and understande</l>
<l>The truth of him. When Phaeton heard his mother saying so,</l>
<l>He gan to leape and skip for joye. He fed his fansie tho,</l>
<l>Upon the Heaven and heavenly things: and so with willing minde, </l>
<l>From Aethiop first his native home, and afterwarde through <placeName key="tgn,7000198">Inde</placeName></l>
<l>Set underneath the morning starre he went so long, till as</l>
<l>He founde me where his fathers house and dayly rising was.</l>

<l>The Princely Pallace of the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> stood gorgeous to beholde</l>
<l>On stately Pillars builded high of yellow burnisht golde,</l>
<l>Beset with sparckling Carbuncles that like to fire did shine.</l>
<l>The roofe was framed curiously of Ivorie pure and fine.</l>
<l>The two doore leaves of silver cleare a radiant light did cast:  </l>
<l>But yet the cunning workemanship of things therein farre past</l>
<l>The stuffe wherof the doores were made. For there a perfect plat</l>
<l>Had Vulcane drawne of all the worlde: Both of the sourges that</l>
<l>Embrace the earth with winding waves, and of the stedfast ground,</l>
<l>And of the heaven it selfe also that both encloseth round.    </l>
<l>And first and formest in the Sea the Gods thereof did stande:</l>
<l>Loude sounding Tryton with his shirle and writhen Trumpe in hande:</l>
<l>Unstable Protew chaunging aye his figure and his hue,</l>
<l>From shape to shape a thousande sithes as list him to renue:</l>
<l>Aegeon leaning boystrously on backes of mightie Whales        </l>
<l>And Doris with hir daughters all: of which some cut the wales</l>
<l>With splaied armes, some sate on rockes and dride their goodly haire,</l>
<l>And some did ryde uppon the backes of fishes here and theare.</l>
<l>Not one in all poyntes fully lyke an other coulde ye see,</l>
<l>Nor verie farre unlike, but such as sisters ought to bee.     </l>
<l>The Earth had townes, men, beasts and Woods with sundrie trees and rods,</l>
<l>And running Ryvers with their Nymphes and other countrie Gods.</l>
<l>Directly over all these same the plat of heaven was pight,</l>
<l>Upon the two doore leaves, the signes of all the Zodiak bright,</l>
<l>Indifferently six on the left and six upon the right.       </l>
<l>When Clymens sonne had climbed up at length with weerie pace,</l>
<l>And set his foote within his doubted fathers dwelling place,</l>
<l>Immediately he preaced forth to put him selfe in sight,</l>
<l>And stoode aloofe. For neere at hande he could not bide the light.</l>
<l>In purple Robe and royall Throne of Emeraudes freshe and greene  </l>
<l>Did Phoebus sitte, and on eche hande stoode wayting well beseene,</l>
<l>Dayes, Monthes, yeares, ages, seasons, times, and eke the equall houres.</l>
<l>There stoode the springtime with a crowne of fresh and fragrant floures.</l>
<l>There wayted Sommer naked starke all save a wheaten Hat:</l>
<l>And Autumne smerde with treading grapes late at the pressing Vat. </l>
<l>And lastly quaking for the colde, stood Winter all forlorne,</l>
<l>With rugged heade as white as Dove, and garments all to torne,</l>
<l>Forladen with the Isycles that dangled up and downe</l>
<l>Uppon his gray and hoarie bearde and snowie frozen crowne.</l>
<l>The <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> thus sitting in the middes did cast his piercing eye,  </l>
<l>(With which full lightly when he list he all thinges doth espye)</l>
<l>Upon his childe that stood aloofe, agast and trembling sore</l>
<l>At sight of such unwonted things, and thus bespake him thore:</l>
<l>O noble ympe, O Phaeton which art not such (I see)</l>
<l>Of whome thy father should have cause ashamed for to bee:    </l>
<l>Why hast thou traveld to my court? what is thy will with mee?</l>
<l>Then answerde he: Of all the worlde O onely perfect light,</l>
<l>O Father Phoebus, (if I may usurpe that name of right,</l>
<l>And that my mother for to save hir selfe from worldely shame,</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,1029651">Hyde</placeName> not hir fault with false pretence and colour of thy name)  </l>
<l>Some signe apparant graunt whereby I may be knowne thy Sonne,</l>
<l>And let mee hang no more in doubt. He had no sooner donne,</l>
<l>But that his father putting off the bright and fierie beames</l>
<l>That glistred rounde about his heade like cleare and golden streames,</l>
<l>Commaunded him to draw him neere, and him embracing sayde:   </l>
<l>To take mee for thy rightfull Sire thou neede not be afrayde.</l>
<l>Thy mother Clymen of a truth from falshood standeth free.</l>
<l>And for to put thee out of doubt aske what thou wilt of mee,</l>
<l>And I will give thee thy desire, the Lake whereby of olde</l>
<l>We Gods do sweare (the which mine eyes did never yet beeholde)  </l>
<l>Beare witnesse with thee of my graunt. He scarce this tale had tolde,</l>
<l>But that the foolish Phaeton straight for a day did crave</l>
<l>The guyding of his winged Steedes, and Chariot for to have.</l>
<l>Then did his Father by and by forethinke him of his oth.</l>
<l>And shaking twentie tymes his heade, as one that was full wroth,    </l>
<l>Bespake him thus: Thy wordes have made me rashly to consent</l>
<l>To that which shortly both of us (I feare mee) shall repent.</l>
<l>Oh that I might retract my graunt, my sonne I doe protest</l>
<l>I would denie thee nothing else save this thy fond request.</l>
<l>I may disswade, there lyes herein more perill than thou weene:  </l>
<l>The things the which thou doest desire of great importance beene:</l>
<l>More than thy weakenesse well can wielde, a charge (as well appeares)</l>
<l>Of greater weight, than may agree with these thy tender yeares.</l>
<l>Thy state is mortall, weake and frayle, the thing thou doest desire</l>
<l>Is such, whereto no mortall man is able to aspire.              </l>
<l>Yea, foolish boy, thou doest desire (and all for want of wit)</l>
<l>A greater charge than any God coulde ever have as yet.</l>
<l>For were there any of them all so overseene and blinde,</l>
<l>To take upon him this my charge, full quickly should he finde</l>
<l>That none but I could sit upon the fierie Axeltree.             </l>
<l>No not even he that rules this wast and endlesse space we see,</l>
<l>Not he that darts with dreadfull hande the thunder from the Skie,</l>
<l>Shall drive this chare. And yet what thing in all the world perdie</l>
<l>Is able to compare with Jove? Now first the morning way</l>
<l>Lyes steepe upright, so that the steedes in coolest of the day  </l>
<l>And beeing fresh have much adoe to climbe against the Hyll.</l>
<l>Amiddes the heaven the gastly heigth augmenteth terror still.</l>
<l>My heart doth waxe as colde as yse full many a tyme and oft</l>
<l>For feare to see the Sea and land from that same place aloft.</l>
<l>The Evening way doth fall plump downe requiring strength to guide, </l>
<l>That Tethis who doth harbrowgh mee within hir sourges wide</l>
<l>Doth stand in feare lest from the heaven I headlong down should slide.</l>
<l>Besides all this the Heaven aye swimmes and wheeles about full swift</l>
<l>And with his rolling dryves the starres their proper course to shift.</l>
<l>Yet doe I keepe my native course against this brunt so stout,  </l>
<l>Not giving place as others doe: but boldely bearing out</l>
<l>The force and swiftnesse of that heaven that whyrleth so about.</l>
<l>Admit thou had my winged Steedes and Chariot in thine hande:</l>
<l>What couldste thou doe? dost thinke thy selfe well able to withstande</l>
<l>The swiftnesse of the whyrled Poles, but that their brunt and sway </l>
<l>(Yea doe the best and worst thou can) shall beare thee quite away?</l>
<l>Perchaunce thou dost imagine there some townes of Gods to finde,</l>
<l>With groves and Temples richt with giftes as is among mankinde.</l>
<l>Thou art deceyved utterly: thou shalt not finde it so.</l>
<l>By blinde bywayes and ugly shapes of monsters must thou go.  </l>
<l>And though thou knewe the way so well as that thou could not stray,</l>
<l>Betweene the dreadful bulles sharp hornes yet must thou make thy way.</l>
<l>Agaynst the cruell Bowe the which the Aemonian archer drawes:</l>
<l>Against the ramping <placeName key="tgn,7008772">Lyon</placeName> armde with greedie teeth and pawes:</l>
<l>Against the Scorpion stretching farre his fell and venymd clawes:  </l>
<l>And eke the Crab that casteth forth his crooked clees awrie</l>
<l>Not in such sort as th'other doth, and yet as dreadfully.</l>
<l>Againe thou neyther hast the powre nor yet the skill I knowe</l>
<l>My lustie coursers for to guide that from their nostrilles throwe</l>
<l>And from their mouthes the fierie breath that breedeth in their brest. </l>
<l>For scarcely will they suffer mee who knowes their nature best</l>
<l>When that their cruell courages begin to catch a heate,</l>
<l>That hardely should I deale with them, but that I know the feate.</l>
<l>But lest my gift should to thy griefe and utter perill tend</l>
<l>My Sonne beware and (whyle thou mayst) thy fonde request amend. </l>
<l>Bycause thou woulde be knowne to bee my childe thou seemst to crave</l>
<l>A certaine signe: what surer signe I pray thee canst thou have</l>
<l>Than this my feare so fatherly the which I have of thee</l>
<l>Which proveth me most certainly thy father for to bee?</l>
<l>Beholde and marke my countenaunce.  would to God thy sight</l>
<l>Could pierce within my wofull brest, to see the heavie plight,</l>
<l>And heapes of cares within my heart. Looke through the worlde so round</l>
<l>Of all the wealth and goodes therein: if ought there may be found</l>
<l>In Heaven or Earth or in the Sea, aske what thou lykest best,</l>
<l>And sure it shall not be denide. This onely one request   </l>
<l>That thou hast made I heartely beseech thee to relent,</l>
<l>Which for to tearme the thing aright is even a punishment,</l>
<l>And not an honour as thou thinkest: my Phaeton thou dost crave</l>
<l>In stead of honour even a scourge and punishment for to have.</l>
<l>Thou fondling thou, what dost thou meane with fawning armes about </l>
<l>My necke thus flattringly to hang? Thou needest not to dout.</l>
<l>I have alreadie sworne by Styx, aske what thou wilt of mee</l>
<l>And thou shalt have. Yet let thy next wish somewhat wiser bee

<l>Thus ended his advertisment: and yet the wilfull Lad</l>
<l>Withstood his counsell urging still the promisse that he had,  </l>
<l>Desiring for to have the chare as if he had been mad.</l>
<l>His father having made delay as long as he could shift,</l>
<l>Did lead him where his Chariot stood, which was of Vulcans gift.</l>
<l>The Axeltree was massie golde, the Bucke was massie golde,</l>
<l>The utmost fellies of the wheeles, and where the tree was rolde.    </l>
<l>The spokes were all of sylver bright, the Chrysolites and Gemmes</l>
<l>That stood uppon the Collars, Trace, and hounces in their hemmes</l>
<l>Did cast a sheere and glimmering light, as Phoebus shone thereon.</l>
<l>Now while the lustie Phaeton stood gazing here upon,</l>
<l>And wondered at the workemanship of everie thing: beeholde          </l>
<l>The earely morning in the East beegan mee to unfolde</l>
<l>Hir purple Gates, and shewde hir house bedeckt with Roses red.</l>
<l>The twinckling starres withdrew which by the morning star are led:</l>
<l>Who as the Captaine of that Host that hath no peere nor match,</l>
<l>Dooth leave his standing last of all within that heavenly watch.   </l>
<l>Now when his Father sawe the worlde thus glister red and trim,</l>
<l>And that his waning sisters hornes began to waxen dim,</l>
<l>He had the fetherfooted howres go harnesse in his horse.</l>
<l>The Goddesses with might and mayne themselves thereto enforce.</l>
<l>His fierifoming Steedes full fed with juice of Ambrosie            </l>
<l>They take from Maunger trimly dight: and to their heades doe tie</l>
<l>Strong reyned bits: and to the Charyot doe them well appoint.</l>
<l>Then Phoebus did with heavenly salve his Phaetons heade annoint,</l>
<l>That scorching fire coulde nothing hurt: which done, upon his haire</l>
<l>He put the fresh and golden rayes himselfe was wont to weare.      </l>
<l>And then as one whose heart misgave the sorrowes drawing fast,</l>
<l>With sorie sighes he thus bespake his retchlesse sonne at last:</l>
<l>(And if thou canst) at least yet this thy fathers lore obay:</l>
<l>Sonne, spare the whip, and reyne them hard, they run so swift away</l>
<l>As that thou shalt have much adoe their fleeing course to stay.    </l>
<l>Directly through the Zones all five beware thou doe not ride,</l>
<l>A brode byway cut out askew that bendeth on the side</l>
<l>Contaynde within the bondes of three the midmost Zones doth lie:</l>
<l>Which from the grisely Northren beare, and Southren Pole doth flie.</l>
<l>Keepe on this way: my Charyot rakes thou plainely shalt espie  </l>
<l>And to th'intent that heaven and earth may well the heate endure,</l>
<l>Drive neyther over high nor yet too lowe. For be thou sure,</l>
<l>And if thou mount above thy boundes, the starres thou burnest cleane.</l>
<l>Againe beneath thou burnst the Earth: most safetie is the meane.</l>
<l>And least perchaunce thou overmuch the right hand way should take, </l>
<l>And so misfortune should thee drive upon the writhen Snake,</l>
<l>Or else by taking overmuche upon the lefter hand</l>
<l>Unto the Aultar thou be driven that doth against it stand:</l>
<l>Indifferently betweene them both I wish thee for to ride.</l>
<l>The rest I put to fortunes will, who be thy friendly guide,  </l>
<l>And better for thee than thy selfe as in this case provide.</l>
<l>Whiles that I prattle here with thee, behold the dankish night</l>
<l>Beyond all Spaine hir utmost bound is passed out of sight.</l>
<l>We may no lenger tariance make: my wonted light is cald,</l>
<l>The Morning with hir countnance cleare the darknesse hath appald. </l>
<l>Take raine in hand, or if thy minde by counsell altred bee,</l>
<l>Refuse to meddle with my Wayne: and while thou yet art free,</l>
<l>And doste at ease within my house in safegarde well remaine,</l>
<l>Of this thine unadvised wish not feeling yet the paine,</l>
<l>Let me alone with giving still the world his wonted light,  </l>
<l>And thou thereof as heretofore enjoy the harmelesse sight.</l>
<l>Thus much in vaine: for Phaeton both yong in yeares and wit,</l>
<l>Into the Chariot lightly lept, and vauncing him in it</l>
<l>Was not a little proud that he the brydle gotten had.</l>
<l>He thankt his father whom it grievde to see his childe so mad.    </l>
<l>While Phebus and his rechelesse sonne were entertalking this,</l>
<l>Aeous, Aethon, Phlegon, and the firie Pyrois,</l>
<l>The restlesse horses of the Sunne, began to ney so hie</l>
<l>Wyth flaming breath, that all the heaven might heare them perfectly.</l>
<l>And with their hoves they mainly beate upon the lattisde grate.    </l>
<l>The which when Tethis (knowing nought of this hir cousins fate)</l>
<l>Had put aside, and given the steedes the free and open scope</l>
<l>Of all the compasse of the Skie within the heavenly Cope:</l>
<l>They girded forth, and cutting through the Cloudes that let their race,</l>
<l>With splayed wings they overflew the Easterne winde apace.        </l>
<l>The burthen was so lyght as that the Genets felt it not.</l>
<l>The wonted weight was from the Waine, the which they well did wot.</l>
<l>For like as ships amids the Seas that scant of ballace have,</l>
<l>Doe reele and totter with the wynde, and yeeld to every wave:</l>
<l>Even so the Waine for want of weight it erst was wont to beare,   </l>
<l>Did hoyse aloft and scayle and reele, as though it empty were.</l>
<l>Which when the Cartware did perceyve, they left the beaten way</l>
<l>And taking bridle in the teeth began to run astray.</l>
<l>The rider was so sore agast, he knew no use of <placeName key="tgn,2043832">Rayne</placeName>,</l>
<l>Nor yet his way: and though he had, yet had it ben in vayne,     </l>
<l>Because he wanted powre to rule the horses and the <placeName key="tgn,2001162">Wayne</placeName>.</l>
<l>Then first did sweat cold Charles his Wain through force of <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> rayes</l>
<l>And in the Sea forbidden him, to dive in vaine assayes.</l>
<l>The Serpent at the frozen Pole both colde and slow by kinde,</l>
<l>Through heat waxt wroth, and stird about a cooler place to finde.  </l>
<l>And thou Bootes though thou be but slow of footemanship,</l>
<l>Yet wert thou faine (as Fame reports) about thy Waine to skip.</l>
<l>Now when unhappy Phaeton from top of all the Skie</l>
<l>Behelde the Earth that underneath a great way off did lie,</l>
<l>He waxed pale for sodaine feare, his joynts and sinewes quooke,   </l>
<l>The greatnesse of the glistring light his eyesight from him tooke.</l>
<l>Now wisht he that he never had his fathers horses see:</l>
<l>It yrkt him that he thus had sought to learne his piedegre.</l>
<l>It grievde him that he had prevailde in gaining his request.</l>
<l>To have bene counted Merops sonne he thought it now the best.  </l>
<l>Thus thinking was he headlong driven, as when a ship is borne</l>
<l>By blustring windes, hir saileclothes rent, hir sterne in pieces torne,</l>
<l>And tacling brust, the which the Pilote trusting all to prayre</l>
<l>Abandons wholy to the Sea and fortune of the ayre.</l>
<l>What should he doe? much of the heaven he passed had behinde   </l>
<l>And more he saw before: both whiche he measurde in his minde,</l>
<l>Eft looking forward to the West which to approch as then</l>
<l>Might not betide, and to the East eft looking backe agen.</l>
<l>He wist not what was best to doe, his wittes were ravisht so.</l>
<l>For neither could he hold the Reynes, nor yet durst let them go.  </l>
<l>And of his horses names was none that he remembred tho.</l>
<l>Straunge uncoth Monsters did he see dispersed here and there</l>
<l>And dreadfull shapes of ugly beasts that in the Welkin were.

<l>Whome when the Lad beheld all moyst with blacke and lothly swet,</l>

<l>The golde that <placeName key="tgn,7016546">Tagus</placeName> streame did beare did in the chanell melt.</l>
<l>Amid Cayster of this fire the raging heat was felt</l>
<l>Among the quieres of singing Swannes that with their pleasant lay</l>
<l>Along the bankes of Lidian brakes from place to place did stray.</l>
<l>And Nyle for feare did run away into the furthest Clyme     </l>
<l>Of all the world, and hid his heade, which to this present tyme</l>
<l>Is yet unfound: his mouthes all seven cleane voyde of water beene,</l>
<l>Like seven great valleys where (save dust) could nothing else be seene.</l>
<l>By like misfortune <placeName key="tgn,7002660">Hebrus</placeName> dride and Strymon, both of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>.</l>

<l>And Tyber unto whome the Goddes a faithfull promise gave</l>
<l>Of all the world the Monarchie and soveraigne state to have.</l>
<l>The ground did cranie everie where and light did pierce to hell</l>
<l>And made afraide the King and Queene that in that Realme doe dwell.</l>
<l>The Sea did shrinke and where as waves did late before remaine,  </l>
<l>Became a Champion field of dust and even a sandy plaine.</l>
<l>The hilles erst hid farre under waves like Ilelandes did appeare</l>
<l>So that the scattred <placeName key="tgn,7011270">Cyclades</placeName> for the time augmented were.</l>
<l>The fishes drew them to the deepes: the Dolphines durst not play</l>
<l>Above the water as before, the Seales and Porkpis lay       </l>
<l>With bellies upward on the waves starke dead: and fame doth go</l>
<l>That Nereus with his wife and daughters all were faine as tho</l>
<l>To dive within the scalding waves. Thrise Neptune did advaunce</l>
<l>His armes above the scalding Sea with sturdy countenaunce:</l>
<l>And thrise for hotenesse of the Ayre, was faine himselfe to hide.   </l>
<l>But yet the Earth the Nurce of things enclosde on every side</l>
<l>(Betweene the waters of the Sea and Springs that now had hidden</l>
<l>Themselves within their Mothers wombe) for all the paine abidden,</l>
<l>Up to the necke put forth hir head and casting up hir hand,</l>
<l>Betweene hir forehead and the sunne as panting she did stand  </l>
<l>With dreadfull quaking, all that was she fearfully did shake,</l>
<l>And shrinking somewhat lower downe with sacred voyce thus spake:</l>
<l>O king of Gods and if this be thy will and my desart,</l>
<l>Why doste thou stay with deadly dint thy thunder downe to dart?</l>
<l>And if that needes I perish must through force of firie flame,    </l>
<l>Let thy celestiall fire O God I pray thee doe the same.</l>
<l>A comfort shall it be to have thee Author of my death.</l>
<l>I scarce have powre to speak these words (the smoke had stopt hir breath).</l>
<l>Behold my singed haire: behold my dim and bleared eye,</l>
<l>See how about my scorched face the scalding embers flie.          </l>
<l>Is this the guerdon wherewithall ye quite my fruitfulnesse?</l>
<l>Is this the honor that ye gave me for my plenteousnesse</l>
<l>And dutie done with true intent? for suffring of the plough</l>
<l>To draw deepe woundes upon my backe and rakes to rend me through?</l>
<l>For that I over all the yeare continually am wrought?             </l>

<l>When ended was this piteous plaint, the Earth did hold hir peace.</l>
<l>She could no lenger dure the heate but was compelde to cease.</l>
<l>Into hir bosome by and by she shrunke hir cinged heade            </l>
<l>More nearer to the Stygian caves, and ghostes of persones deade.</l>
<l>The Sire of Heaven protesting all the Gods and him also</l>
<l>That lent the Chariot to his child, that all of force must go</l>
<l>To havocke if he helped not, went to the highest part</l>
<l>And top of all the Heaven from whence his custome was to dart    </l>
<l>His thunder and his lightning downe. But neyther did remaine</l>
<l>A Cloude wherewith to shade the Earth, nor yet a showre of raine.</l>
<l>Then with a dreadfull thunderclap up to his eare he bent</l>
<l>His fist, and at the Wagoner a flash of lightning sent,</l>
<l>Which strake his bodie from the life and threw it over wheele</l>
<l>And so with fire he quenched fire. The Steedes did also reele</l>
<l>Upon their knees, and starting up sprang violently, one here,</l>
<l>And there another, that they brast in pieces all their gere.</l>
<l>They threw the Collars from their neckes, and breaking quite asunder</l>
<l>The Trace and Harnesse flang away: here lay the bridles: yonder   </l>
<l>The Extree plucked from the Naves: and in another place</l>
<l>The shevered spokes of broken wheeles: and so at every pace</l>
<l>The pieces of the Chariot torne lay strowed here and there.</l>
<l>But Phaeton (fire yet blasing stil among his yellow haire)</l>
<l>Shot headlong downe, and glid along the Region of the Ayre  </l>
<l>Like to a starre in Winter nights (the wether cleare and fayre)</l>
<l>Which though it doe not fall in deede, yet falleth to our sight,</l>
<l>Whome almost in another world and from his countrie quite</l>
<l>The River Padus did receyve, and quencht his burning head.</l>
<l>The water Nymphes of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italie</placeName> did take his carkasse dead      </l>
<l>And buried it yet smoking still, with Joves threeforked flame,</l>
<l>And wrate this Epitaph in the stone that lay upon the same:</l>
<l>Here lies the lusty Phaeton which tooke in hand to guide</l>
<l>His fathers Chariot, from the which although he chaunst to slide:</l>
<l>Yet that he gave a proud attempt it cannot be denide.       </l>
<l>Wyth ruthfull cheere and heavie heart his father made great mone</l>
<l>And would not shew himselfe abrode, but mournd at home alone.</l>
<l>And if it be to be beleved, as bruited is by fame</l>
<l>A day did passe without the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName>. The brightnesse of the flame</l>
<l>Gave light: and so unto some kinde of use that mischiefe came.    </l>
<l>But Clymen having spoke, as much as mothers usually</l>
<l>Are wonted in such wretched case, discomfortablely,</l>
<l>And halfe beside hir selfe for wo, with torne and scratched brest,</l>
<l>Sercht through the universall world, from East to furthest West,</l>
<l>First seeking for hir sonnes dead coarse, and after for his bones.    </l>
<l>She found them by a forren streame, entumbled under stones.</l>
<l>There fell she groveling on his grave, and reading there his name,</l>
<l>Shed teares thereon, and layd hir breast all bare upon the same.</l>
<l>The daughters also of the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> no lesse than did their mother,</l>
<l>Bewaild in vaine with flouds of teares, the fortune of their brother: </l>
<l>And beating piteously their breasts, incessantly did call</l>
<l>The buried Phaeton day and night, who heard them not at all,</l>
<l>About whose tumbe they prostrate lay. Foure times the Moone had filde</l>
<l>The Circle of hir joyned hornes, and yet the sisters hilde</l>
<l>Their custome of lamenting still: (for now continuall use   </l>
<l>Had made it custome.) Of the which the eldest, Phaetuse,</l>
<l>About to kneele upon the ground, complaynde hir feete were nom.</l>
<l>To whome as fayre Lampetie was rising for to com,</l>
<l>Hir feete were held with sodaine rootes. The third about to teare</l>
<l>Hir ruffled lockes, filde both hir handes with leaves in steade of heare. </l>
<l>One wept to see hir legges made wood: another did repine</l>
<l>To see hir armes become long boughes. And shortly to define,</l>
<l>While thus they wondred at themselves, a tender barke began</l>
<l>To grow about their thighes and loynes, which shortly overran</l>
<l>Their bellies, brestes, and shoulders eke, and hands successively,    </l>
<l>That nothing (save their mouthes) remainde, aye calling piteously</l>
<l>Upon the wofull mothers helpe. What could the mother doe</l>
<l>But runne now here now there, as force of nature drue hir to</l>
<l>And deale hir kisses while she might? She was not so content:</l>
<l>But tare their tender braunches downe: and from the slivers went  </l>
<l>Red drops of bloud as from a wound. The daughter that was rent</l>
<l>Cride: Spare us mother spare I pray, for in the shape of tree</l>
<l>The bodies and the flesh of us your daughters wounded bee.</l>
<l>And now farewell. That word once said, the barke grew over all.</l>
<l>Now from these trees flow gummy teares that Amber men doe call,  </l>
<l>Which hardened with the heate of sunne as from the boughs they fal</l>
<l>The trickling River doth receyve, and sendes as things of price</l>
<l>To decke the daintie Dames of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> and make them fine and nice.</l>
<l>Now present at this monstruous hap was Cygnus, Stenels son,</l>
<l>Who being by the mothers side akinne to Phaeton         </l>
<l>Was in condicion more akinne. He leaving up his charge</l>
<l>(For in the land of Ligurie his Kingdome stretched large)</l>
<l>Went mourning all along the bankes and pleasant streame of Po</l>
<l>Among the trees encreased by the sisters late ago.</l>
<l>Annon his voyce became more small and shrill than for a man.  </l>
<l>Gray fethers muffled in his face: his necke in length began</l>
<l>Far from his shoulders for to stretche: and furthermore there goes</l>
<l>A fine red string acrosse the joyntes in knitting of his toes:</l>
<l>With fethers closed are his sides: and on his mouth there grew</l>
<l>A brode blunt byll: and finally was Cygnus made a new         </l>
<l>And uncoth fowle that hight a Swan, who neither to the winde,</l>
<l>The Ayre, nor Jove betakes himselfe, as one that bare in minde</l>
<l>The wrongfull fire sent late against his cousin Phaeton.</l>
<l>In Lakes and Rivers is his joy: the fire he aye doth shon,</l>
<l>And chooseth him the contrary continually to won. </l>
<l>Forlorne and altogether voyde of that same bodie shene</l>
<l>Was Phaetons father in that while which erst had in him bene,</l>
<l>Like as he looketh in Th'eclypse. He hates the yrkesome light,</l>
<l>He hates him selfe, he hates the day, and settes his whole delight</l>
<l>In making sorrow for his sonne, and in his griefe doth storme  -</l>
<l>And chaufe denying to the worlde his dutie to performe.</l>
<l>My lot (quoth he) hath had inough of this unquiet state</l>
<l>From first beginning of the worlde. It yrkes me (though too late)</l>
<l>Of restlesse toyles and thankelesse paines. Let who so will for me</l>
<l>Go drive the Chariot in the which the light should caried be.  </l>
<l>If none dare take the charge in hand, and all the Gods persist</l>
<l>As insufficient, he himselfe go drive it if he list,</l>
<l>That at the least by venturing our bridles for to guide</l>
<l>His lightning making childlesse Sires he once may lay aside.</l>
<l>By that time that he hath assayde the unappalled force         </l>
<l>That doth remaine and rest within my firiefooted horse,</l>
<l>I trow he shall by tried proufe be able for to tell</l>
<l>How that he did not merit death that could not rule them well.</l>
<l>The Goddes stoode all about the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> thus storming in his rage</l>
<l>Beseching him in humble wise his sorrow to asswage.            </l>
<l>And that he would not on the world continuall darkenesse bring,</l>
<l>Jove eke excusde him of the fire the which he chaunst to sling,</l>
<l>And with entreatance mingled threates as did become a King.</l>
<l>Then Phebus gathered up his steedes that yet for feare did run</l>
<l>Like flaighted fiendes, and in his moode without respect begun</l>
<l>To beate his whipstocke on their pates and lash them on the sides.</l>
<l>It was no neede to bid him chaufe; for ever as he rides</l>
<l>He still upbraides them with his sonne, and layes them on the hides.

<l>And Jove almighty went about the walles of heaven to trie</l>
<l>If ought were perisht with the fire, which when he did espie   </l>
<l>Continuing in their former state, all strong and safe and sound,</l>
<l>He went to vew the workes of men, and things upon the ground.</l>
<l>Yet for his land of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadie</placeName> he tooke most care and charge.</l>
<l>The Springs and streames that durst not run he set againe at large.</l>
<l>He clad the earth with grasse, the trees with leaves both fresh and greene </l>
<l>Commaunding woods to spring againe that erst had burned bene.</l>
<l>Now as he often went and came it was his chaunce to light</l>
<l>Upon a Nymph of Nonacris whose forme and beautie bright</l>
<l>Did set his heart on flaming fire. She used not to spinne</l>
<l>Nor yet to curle hir frisled haire with bodkin or with pinne.</l>
<l>A garment with a buckled belt fast girded did she weare</l>
<l>And in a white and slender Call slight trussed was hir heare.</l>
<l>Sometimes a dart sometime a bow she used for to beare.</l>
<l>She was a knight of Phebes troope. There came not at the mount</l>
<l>Of Menalus of whome Diana made so great account.            </l>
<l>But favor never lasteth long. The <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> had gone that day</l>
<l>A good way past the poynt of Noone: when werie of hir way</l>
<l>She drue to shadowe in a wood that never had bene cut.</l>
<l>Here off hir shoulder by and by hir quiver did she put,</l>
<l>And hung hir bow unbent aside, and coucht hir on the ground,    </l>
<l>Hir quiver underneth hir head. Whom when that Jove had found</l>
<l>Alone and wearie: Sure (he said) my wife shall never know</l>
<l>Of this escape, and if she do, I know the worst I trow.</l>
<l>She can but chide, shall feare of chiding make me to forslow?</l>
<l>He counterfeiteth Phebe streight in countnance and aray.    </l>
<l>And says: O virgine of my troope, where didst thou hunt to day?</l>
<l>The Damsell started from the ground and said: Hayle Goddesse deare,</l>
<l>Of greater worth than Jove (I thinke) though Jove himselfe did heare.</l>
<l>Jove heard hir well and smylde thereat, it made his heart rejoyce</l>
<l>To heare the Nymph preferre him thus before himselfe in choyce.  </l>
<l>He fell to kissing: which was such as out of square might seeme,</l>
<l>And in such sort as that a mayde coulde nothing lesse beseeme.</l>
<l>And as she would have told what woods she ranged had for game,</l>
<l>He tooke hir fast betweene his armes, and not without his shame,</l>
<l>Bewrayed plainly what he was and wherefore that he came.    </l>
<l>The wench against him strove as much as any woman could:</l>
<l>I would that Juno had it seene. For then I know thou would</l>
<l>Not take the deede so heynously: with all hir might she strove.</l>
<l>But what poore wench or who alive could vanquish mighty Jove?</l>
<l>Jove having sped flue straight to heaven. She hateth in hir hart   </l>
<l>The guiltlesse fields and wood where Jove had playd that naughty part,</l>
<l>Alwaye she goes in such a griefe as that she had welnie</l>
<l>Forgot hir quiver with hir shaftes and bow that hanged by.</l>
<l>Dictynna, garded with hir traine and proude of killing Deere,</l>
<l>In raunging over Menalus, espying, cald hir neere.          </l>
<l>The Damsell hearing Phebe call did run away amaine,</l>
<l>She feared lest in Phebes shape that Jove had come againe,</l>
<l>But when she saw the troope of Nymphes that garded hir about,</l>
<l>She thought there was no more deceyt, and came among the rout.</l>
<l>Oh Lord how hard a matter ist for guiltie hearts to shift  </l>
<l>And kepe their countnance? from the ground hir eyes scarce durst she lift.</l>
<l>She prankes not by hir mistresse side, she preases not to bee</l>
<l>The foremost of the companie, as when she erst was free.</l>
<l>She standeth muet: and by chaunging of hir colour ay</l>
<l>The treading of hir shooe awrie she plainely doth bewray,  </l>
<l>Diana might have founde the fault but that she was a May.</l>
<l>A thousand tokens did appeare apparant to the eye,</l>
<l>By which the Nymphes themselves (they say) hir fault did well espie.</l>
<l>Nine times the Moone full to the worlde had shewde hir horned face</l>
<l>When fainting through hir brothers flames and hunting in the chace. </l>
<l>She found a coole and shadie lawnde through midst whereof she spide</l>
<l>A shallow brooke with trickling streame on gravell bottom glide.</l>
<l>And liking well the pleasant place, upon the upper brim</l>
<l>She dipt hir foote, and finding there the water coole and trim,</l>
<l>Away (she sayd) with standers by: and let us bath us here.  </l>
<l>Then Parrhasis cast downe hir head with sad and bashfull chere.</l>
<l>The rest did strip them to their skinnes. She only sought delay,</l>
<l>Untill that would or would she not hir clothes were pluckt away.</l>
<l>Then with hir naked body straight hir crime was brought to light.</l>
<l>Which yll ashamde as with hir hands she would have hid from sight, </l>

<l>I will bereve thee of thy shape through pride whereof thou were</l>
<l>So hardy to entyce my Feere. Immediatly with that</l>
<l>She raught hir by the foretop fast and fiercely threw hir flat</l>
<l>Against the grounde. The wretched wench hir armes up mekely cast, </l>
<l>Hir armes began with griesly haire to waxe all rugged fast.</l>
<l>Hir handes gan warpe and into pawes ylfavordly to grow,</l>

<l>Became a wide deformed mouth. And further lest perhaps          </l>
<l>Hir prayers and hir humble wordes might cause hir to relent:</l>
<l>She did bereve hir of hir speach. In steade whereof there went</l>
<l>An yreful, horce, and dreadfull voyce out from a threatning throte:</l>
<l>But yet the selfesame minde that was before she turnde hir cote,</l>
<l>Was in hir still in shape of Beare. The griefe whereof she showes   </l>
<l>By thrusting forth continuall sighes, and up she gastly throwes</l>
<l>Such kinde of handes as then remainde unto the starrie Skie.</l>
<l>And forbicause she could not speake she thought Jove inwardly</l>
<l>To be unthankfull. Oh how oft she daring not abide</l>

<l>Now flie hirselfe to save hir life when hunters sought the same?</l>
<l>Full oft at sight of other beastes she hid hir head for feare,   </l>
<l>Forgetting what she was hir selfe. For though she were a Beare,</l>

<l>In full intent hir through the heart with deadly wound to strike.   </l>
<l>But God almighty held his hand, and lifting both away</l>
<l>Did disapoint the wicked Act. For straight he did convay</l>

<l>The Gods did graunt hir hir request: and straight to heaven she flue,</l>
<l>In handsome Chariot through the Ayre, which painted peacocks drue   </l>
<l>As well beset with blasing eyes late tane from <placeName key="tgn,2086061">Argus</placeName> hed,</l>
<l>As thou thou prating Raven white by nature being bred,</l>
<l>Hadst on thy fethers justly late a coly colour spred.</l>
<l>For this same birde in auncient time had fethers faire and whight</l>
<l>As ever was the driven snow, or silver cleare and bright.   </l>
<l>He might have well comparde himself in beautie with the Doves</l>
<l>That have no blemish, or the Swan that running water loves:</l>
<l>Or with the Geese that afterward should with their gagling out</l>
<l>Preserve the Romaine Capitoll beset with foes about.</l>
<l>His tongue was cause of all his harme, his tatling tongue did make  </l>
<l>His colour which before was white, become so foule and blake.</l>
<l>Coronis of Larissa was the fairest maide of face,</l>
<l>In all the land of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessalie</placeName>. Shee stoode in <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> grace</l>
<l>As long as that she kept hir chast, or at the least as long</l>
<l>As that she scaped unespide in doing <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> wrong.          </l>
<l>But at the last Apollos birde hir privie packing spide,</l>
<l>Whome no entreatance could persuade but that he swiftly hide</l>
<l>Him to his maister, to bewray the doings of his love.</l>
<l>Now as he flue, the pratling Crow hir wings apace did move:</l>
<l>And overtaking fell in talke and was inquisitive            </l>
<l>For what intent and to what place he did so swiftly drive.</l>
<l>And when she heard the cause thereof, she said: Now trust me sure,</l>
<l>This message on the whiche thou goste no goodnesse will procure.</l>
<l>And therefore hearken what I say: disdaine thou not at all,</l>
<l>To take some warning by thy friende in things that may befall.    </l>
<l>Consider what I erst have bene and what thou seest me now:</l>
<l>And what hath bene the ground hereof. I boldly dare avow,</l>
<l>That thou shalt finde my faithfulnesse imputed for a crime.</l>
<l>For <placeName key="tgn,2565867">Pallas</placeName> in a wicker chest had hid upon a time</l>
<l>A childe calde Ericthonius, whome never woman bare,          </l>
<l>And tooke it unto Maidens three that Cecrops daughters were,</l>
<l>Not telling them what was within, but gave them charge to keepe</l>
<l>The Casket shut, and for no cause within the same to peepe.</l>
<l>I standing close among the leaves upon an Elme on hie,</l>
<l>Did marke their doings and their wordes, and there I did espie  </l>
<l>How Pandrosos and Herse kept their promise faithfully.</l>
<l>Aglauros calles them Cowardes both, and makes no more adoe,</l>
<l>But takes the Casket in hir hand and doth the knots undooe.</l>
<l>And there they saw a childe whose partes beneath were like a snake.</l>
<l>Straight to the Goddesse of this deede a just report I make.  </l>
<l>For which she gave me this reward that never might I more</l>
<l>Accompt hir for my Lady and my Mistresse as before.</l>
<l>And in my roume she put the fowle that flies not but by night,</l>
<l>A warning unto other birdes my lucke should be of right</l>
<l>To holde their tongues for being shent. But you will say perchaunce </l>
<l>I came unsentfor of my selfe, she did me not advaunce.</l>
<l>I dare well say though <placeName key="tgn,2565867">Pallas</placeName> now my heavie Mistresse stand</l>
<l>Yet if perhaps ye should demaund the question at hir hand,</l>
<l>As sore displeased as she is, she would not this denie:</l>
<l>But that she chose me first hir selfe to beare hir companie.  </l>
<l>For (well I know) my father was a Prince of noble fame,</l>
<l>Of Phocis King by long discent, Coronew was his name:</l>
<l>I was his darling and his joy, and many a welthie Piere</l>
<l>(I would not have you thinke disdaine) did seeke me for their Fere.</l>
<l>My forme and beautie did me hurt. For as I leysurely         </l>
<l>Went jetting up and downe the shore upon the gravell drie,</l>
<l>As yet I customably doe, the God that rules the Seas</l>
<l>Espying me fell straight in love. And when he saw none ease</l>
<l>In sute, but losse of wordes and time, he offred violence,</l>
<l>And after me he runnes apace. I skudde as fast fro thence,   </l>
<l>From sand to shore from shore to sand, still playing Foxe to hole,</l>
<l>Untill I was so tirde that he had almost got the gole.</l>
<l>Then cald I out on God and man. But (as it did appeare)</l>
<l>There was no man so neare at hand that could my crying heare.</l>
<l>A Virgin Goddesse pitied me bicause I was a mayde:            </l>
<l>And at the utter plunge and pinche did send me present ayde.</l>
<l>I cast mine armes to heaven, mine armes waxt light with fethers black,</l>
<l>I went about to cast in hast my garments from my back,</l>
<l>And all was fethers. In my skinne the rooted fethers stack.</l>
<l>I was about with violent hand to strike my naked breast,      </l>
<l>But nether had I hand nor breast that naked more did reast.</l>
<l>I ran, but of my feete as erst remained not the print.</l>
<l>Me thought I glided on the ground. Anon with sodaine dint,</l>
<l>I rose and hovered in the Ayre. And from that instant time</l>
<l>Did wait on <placeName key="tgn,2565867">Pallas</placeName> faithfully without offence or crime.        </l>
<l>But what availes all this to me, and if that in my place</l>
<l>The wicked wretch Nyctyminee (who late for lacke of grace</l>
<l>Was turned to an odious birde) to honor called bee?</l>
<l>I pray thee didst thou never heare how false Nyctyminee</l>
<l>(A thing all over <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName> knowne) defilde hir fathers couch?   </l>
<l>The beast is now become a birde, whose lewdnesse doth so touch</l>
<l>And pricke hir guiltie conscience that she dares not come in sight,</l>
<l>Nor shewe hirselfe abrode a dayes, but fleeteth in the night</l>
<l>For shame lest folke should see hir fault: and every other birde</l>
<l>Doth in the Ayre and Ivie toddes with wondring at hir girde.   </l>
<l>A mischiefe take thy tatling tongue, the Raven answerde tho.</l>
<l>Thy vaine forspeaking moves me not. And so he forth did go</l>
<l>And tels his Lorde Apollo how he saw Coronis lie</l>
<l>Wyth Isthyis, a Gentleman that dwelt in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessalie</placeName>.</l>
<l>When <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> heard his lovers fault, he fiersly gan to frowne,  </l>
<l>And cast his garlond from his head, and threw his violl downe.</l>
<l>His colour chaungde, his face lookt pale, and as the rage of yre</l>
<l>That boyled in his belking breast had set his heart on fyre,</l>
<l>He caught me up his wonted tooles, and bent his golden bow</l>
<l>And by and by with deadly stripe of unavoyded blow             </l>
<l>Strake through the breast the which his owne had toucht so oft afore.</l>
<l>She wounded gave a piteous shrike, and (drawing from the sore</l>

<l>The bodie being voyde of soule became as colde as clay.</l>
<l>Than all too late, alas too late gan <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> to repent     </l>

<l>He blames himselfe for giving eare so unadvisedly.</l>
<l>He blames himselfe in that he tooke it so outragiously.</l>
<l>He hates and bannes his faithfull birde bicause he did enforme</l>
<l>Him of his lovers naughtinesse that made him so to storme.  </l>
<l>He hates his bow, he hates his shaft that rashly from it went:</l>
<l>And eke he hates his hasty hands by whom the bow was bent.</l>
<l>He takes hir up betweene his armes endevoring all too late</l>
<l>By plaister made of precious herbes to stay hir helplesse fate.</l>
<l>But when he saw there was no shift: but that she needes must burne, </l>
<l>And that the solemne sacred fire was prest to serve the turne,</l>
<l>Then from the bottome of his heart full sorie sighes he fet,</l>
<l>(For heavenly powres with watrie teares their cheekes may never wet)</l>
<l>In case as when a Cow beholdes the cruell butcher stand</l>
<l>With launching Axe embrewd with bloud and lifting up his hand  </l>
<l>Aloft to snatch hir sucking Calfe that hangeth by the heeles</l>
<l>And of the Axe the deadly dint upon his forehead feeles.</l>
<l>Howbeit after sweete perfumes bestowde upon hir corse</l>
<l>And much embracing, having sore bewailde hir wrong divorse,</l>
<l>He followed to the place assignde hir bodie for to burne.</l>
<l>There coulde he not abide to see his seede to ashes turne.</l>
<l>But tooke the baby from hir wombe and from the firie flame,</l>
<l>And unto double Chyrons den conveyed straight the same.</l>
<l>The Raven hoping for his truth to be rewarded well,</l>
<l>He maketh blacke, forbidding him with whiter birdes to dwell.

<l>The Centaure Chyron in the while was glad of Phebus boy,</l>
<l>And as the burthen brought some care the honor brought him joy.</l>
<l>Upon a time with golden lockes about hir shoulders spread,</l>
<l>A daughter of the Centaurs (whome a certaine Nymph had bred</l>
<l>About the brooke Caycus bankes) that hight Ocyroe         </l>
<l>Came thither. This same fayre yong Nymph could not contented be</l>
<l>To learne the craft of Surgerie as perfect as hir Sire,</l>

<l>And therfore when the furious rage of frenzie had hir cought,</l>
<l>And that the spright of Prophecie enflamed had hir thought,  </l>
<l>She lookt upon the childe and saide: Sweete babe the Gods thee make</l>
<l>A man. For all the world shall fare the better for thy sake.</l>
<l>All sores and sicknesse shalt thou cure: thy powre shall eke be syche,</l>
<l>To make the dead alive again. For doing of the whiche</l>
<l>Against the pleasure of the Gods, thy Graundsire shall thee strike   </l>
<l>So with his fire, that never more thou shalt performe the like.</l>
<l>And of a God a bludlesse corse, and of a corse (full straunge)</l>
<l>Thou shalt become a God againe, and twice thy nature chaunge.</l>
<l>And thou my father liefe and deare, who now by destinie,</l>
<l>Art borne to live for evermore and never for to die,         </l>
<l>Shalt suffer such outragious paine throughout thy members all,</l>
<l>By wounding of a venimde dart that on thy foote shall fall,</l>
<l>That oft thou shalt desire to die, and in the latter end</l>
<l>The fatall dames shall breake thy threede and thy desire thee send.</l>
<l>There was yet more behinde to tell, when sodenly she fet     </l>
<l>A sore deepe sigh, and downe hir cheekes the teares did trickle wet.</l>
<l>Mine owne misfortune (quoth she) now hath overtake me sure.</l>
<l>I cannot utter any more, for words waxe out of ure.</l>
<l>My cunning was not worth so much as that it should procure</l>
<l>The wrath of God. I feele by proufe far better had it bene:   </l>
<l>If that the chaunce of things to come I never had foreseene.</l>
<l>For now my native shape withdrawes. Me thinkes I have delight</l>
<l>To feede on grasse and fling in fieldes: I feele my selfe so light.</l>
<l>I am transformed to a Mare like other of my kinne.</l>
<l>But wherfore should this brutish shape all over wholy winne?  </l>
<l>Considering that although both horse and man my father bee:</l>
<l>Yet is his better part a man as plainly is to see.</l>
<l>The latter ende of this complaint was fumbled in such wise,</l>
<l>As what she meant the standers by could scarcely well devise.</l>
<l>Anon she neyther semde to speake nor fully for to ney,       </l>
<l>But like to one that counterfeites in sport the Mare to play.</l>
<l>Within a while she neyed plaine, and downe hir armes were pight</l>

<l>Hir fingers joyned all in one, at ende wherof did grow</l>
<l>In stede of nayles a round tough hoofe of welked horne bylow.  </l>
<l>Hir head and necke shot forth in length, hir kirtle trayne became</l>
<l>A faire long taile. Hir flaring haire was made a hanging Mane.</l>

<l>The warlike Goddesse cast on hir a sterne and cruell looke,</l>
<l>And fetched such a cutting sigh that forcibly it shooke    </l>

<l>And worke distresse to other folke, hir selfe she doth destroy.</l>
<l>Thus is she torment to hir selfe. Though <placeName key="tgn,2565867">Pallas</placeName> did hir hate,</l>

<l>This said, she pight hir speare in ground, and tooke hir rise thereon.</l>

<l>The Caitife cast hir eye aside, and seeing Pallas gon,</l>
<l>Began to mumble with hir selfe the Divels Paternoster,</l>
<l>And fretting at hir good successe, began to blow and bluster. </l>
<l>She takes a crooked staffe in hand bewreathde with knubbed prickes,</l>
<l>And covered with a coly cloude, where ever that she stickes</l>
<l>Hir filthie feete, she tramples downe and seares both grasse and corne:</l>
<l>That all the fresh and fragrant fieldes seeme utterly forlorne.</l>
<l>And with hir staffe she tippeth off the highest poppie heades.    </l>
<l>Such poyson also every where ungraciously she sheades,</l>
<l>That every Cottage where she comes and every Towne and Citie</l>
<l>Doe take infection at hir breath. At length (the more is pitie)</l>
<l>She found the faire Athenian towne that flowed freshly then</l>
<l>In feastfull peace and joyfull welth and learned witts of men.  </l>
<l>And forbicause she nothing saw that might provoke to weepe,</l>
<l>It was a corsie to hir heart hir hatefull teares to keepe.</l>
<l>Now when she came within the Court, she went without delay</l>
<l>Directly to the lodgings where King Cecrops daughters lay,</l>
<l>There did she as <placeName key="tgn,2070580">Minerva</placeName> bad. She laide hir scurvie fist    </l>
<l>Besmerde with venim and with filth upon Aglauros brist,</l>
<l>The whiche she filde with hooked thornes: and breathing on hir face</l>
<l>Did shead the poyson in hir bones: which spred it selfe apace,</l>
<l>As blacke as ever virgin pitch through Lungs and Lights and all.</l>
<l>And to th'intent that cause of griefe abundantly should fall, </l>
<l>She placed ay before hir eyes hir sisters happie chaunce</l>
<l>In being wedded to the God, and made the God to glaunce</l>
<l>Continually in heavenly shape before hir wounded thought.</l>
<l>And all these things she painted out, which in conclusion wrought</l>
<l>Such corsies in Aglauros brest that sighing day and night   </l>
<l>She gnawde and fretted in hir selfe for very cancred spight.</l>
<l>And like a wretche she wastes hir selfe with restlesse care and pine</l>
<l>Like as the yse whereon the Sunne with glimering light doth shine.</l>
<l>Hir sister Herses good successe doth make hir heart to yerne,</l>
<l>In case as when that fire is put to greenefeld wood or fearne  </l>
<l>Whych giveth neyther light nor heate, but smulders quite away:</l>
<l>Sometime she minded to hir Sire hir sister to bewray,</l>
<l>Who (well she knew) would yll abide so lewde a part to play.</l>
<l>And oft she thought with wilfull hande to brust hir fatall threede,</l>
<l>Bicause she woulde not see the thing that made hir heart to bleede. </l>
<l>At last she sate hir in the doore and leaned to a post</l>
<l>To let the God from entring in. To whome now having lost</l>
<l>Much talke and gentle wordes in vayne, she said: Sir, leave I pray</l>
<l>For hence I will not (be you sure) onlesse you go away.</l>
<l>I take thee at thy word (quoth he) and therewithall he pusht  </l>
<l>His rod against the barred doore, and wide it open rusht.</l>
<l>She making proffer for to rise, did feele so great a waight</l>
<l>Through all hir limmes, that for hir life she could not stretch hir straight.</l>
<l>She strove to set hirself upright: but striving booted not.</l>
<l>Hir hamstrings and hir knees were stiffe, a chilling colde had got  </l>
<l>In at hir nayles, through all hir limmes. And eke hir veynes began</l>
<l>For want of bloud and lively heate, to waxe both pale and wan.</l>
<l>And as the freting Fistula forgrowne and past all cure</l>
<l>Runnes in the flesh from place to place, and makes the sound and pure</l>
<l>As bad or worser than the rest, even so the cold of death    </l>
<l>Strake to hir heart, and closde hir veines, and lastly stopt hir breath:</l>
<l>She made no profer for to speake, and though she had done so</l>
<l>It had bene vaine. For way was none for language forth to go.</l>
<l>Hir throte congealed into stone: hir mouth became hard stone,</l>
<l>And like an image sate she still, hir bloud was clearely gone,</l>
<l>The which the venim of hir heart so fowly did infect,</l>
<l>That ever after all the stone with freckled spots was spect.

<l>Betweene the state of Majestie and love is set such oddes,</l>

<l>Whose hand is armd with triplefire, who only with his frowne</l>
<l>Makes Sea and Land and Heaven to quake, doth lay his scepter downe </l>
<l>With all the grave and stately port belonging thereunto:</l>
<l>And putting on the shape of Bull (as other cattell doe)</l>
<l>Goes lowing gently up and downe among them in the field</l>
<l>The fairest beast to looke upon that ever man beheld.</l>
<l>For why? his colour was as white as any winters snow         </l>
<l>Before that eyther trampling feete or Southerne winde it thow.</l>
<l>His necke was brawnd with rolles of flesh, and from his chest before</l>

<l>His hornes were small, but yet so fine as that ye would have thought</l>
<l>They had bene made by cunning hand or out of waxe bene wrought. </l>
<l>More cleare they were a hundreth fold than is the Christall stone,</l>
<l>In all his forehead fearfull frowne or wrinkle there was none.</l>
<l>No fierce, no grim, nor griesly looke as other cattle have,</l>
<l>But altogether so demure as friendship seemde to crave.</l>
<l>Agenors daughter marveld much so tame a beast to see,</l>
<l>But yet to touche him at the first too bolde she durst not bee.</l>
<l>Annon she reaches to his mouth hir hand with herbes and flowres.</l>

<l>Not knowing where she was become, sent after to enquire</l>
<l>Hir brother <placeName key="tgn,2078692">Cadmus</placeName>, charging him his sister home to bring,  </l>

<l>When <placeName key="tgn,2078692">Cadmus</placeName> over all the world had sought, (for who is hee</l>
<l>That can detect the thefts of Jove?) and no where could hir see,</l>
<l>Then as an outlaw (to avoyde his fathers wrongfull yre)    </l>
<l>He went to Phebus Oracle most humbly to desire</l>
<l>His heavenly counsell, where he would assigne him place to dwell.</l>
<l>An Heifer all alone in field (quoth Phebus) marke hir well,</l>

<l>There builde a towne, and let thereof Beotia be the name.</l>
<l>Downe from Parnasus stately top scarce fully <placeName key="tgn,2078692">Cadmus</placeName> came,</l>
<l>When royling softly in the vale before the herde alone</l>
<l>He saw an Heifer on whose necke of servage print was none.</l>
<l>He followde after leysurly as hir that was his guide,      </l>
<l>And thanked <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> in his heart that did so well provide.</l>
<l>Now had he past Cephisus forde, and eke the pleasant groundes</l>
<l>About the Citie Panope conteinde within those boundes.</l>
<l>The Heifer staide, and lifting up hir forehead to the skie</l>
<l>Full seemely for to looke upon with homes like braunches hie    </l>
<l>Did with hir lowing fill the Ayre: and casting backe hir eie</l>
<l>Upon the rest that came aloofe, as softly as she could</l>
<l>Kneelde downe and laide hir hairie side against the grassie mould.</l>
<l>Then <placeName key="tgn,2078692">Cadmus</placeName> gave Apollo thankes, and falling flat bylow</l>
<l>Did kisse the ground and haile the fields which yet he did not know. </l>
<l>He was about to sacrifice to Jove the Heavenly King,</l>
<l>And bad his servants goe and fetch him water of the spring.</l>
<l>An olde forgrowne unfelled wood stoode neare at hand thereby,</l>
<l>And in the middes a queachie plot with Sedge and Osiers hie,</l>
<l>Where courbde about with peble stone in likenesse of a bow     </l>
<l>There was a spring with silver streames that forth thereof did flow.</l>
<l>Here lurked in his lowring den God Mars his griesly Snake</l>
<l>With golden scales and firie eyes beswolne with poyson blake.</l>
<l>Three spirting tongues, three rowes of teeth within his head did sticke.</l>
<l>No sooner had the Tirian folke set foote within this thicke    </l>
<l>And queachie plot, and deped downe their bucket in the well,</l>
<l>But that to buscle in his den began this Serpent fell,</l>
<l>And peering with a marble head right horribly to hisse.</l>
<l>The Tirians let their pitchers slip for sodaine feare of this,</l>
<l>And waxing pale as any clay, like folke amazde and flaight,    </l>
<l>Stoode trembling like an Aspen leafe. The specled serpent straight</l>
<l>Commes trailing out in waving linkes, and knottie rolles of scales,</l>
<l>And bending into bunchie boughts his bodie forth he hales.</l>
<l>And lifting up above the wast himselfe unto the Skie,</l>
<l>He overlooketh all the wood, as huge and big welnie            </l>
<l>As is the Snake that in the Heaven about the Nordren Pole</l>
<l>Devides the Beares. He makes no stay but deales his dreadfull dole</l>
<l>Among the Tirians. Whether they did take them to their tooles,</l>
<l>Or to their heeles, or that their feare did make them stand like fooles,</l>
<l>And helpe themselves by none of both, he snapt up some alive,    </l>
<l>And swept in others with his taile, and some he did deprive</l>
<l>Of life with rankenesse of his breath, and other some againe</l>
<l>He stings and poysons unto death till all at last were slaine.</l>
<l>Now when the Sunne was at his heigth and shadowes waxed short,</l>
<l>And <placeName key="tgn,2078692">Cadmus</placeName> saw his companie make tarience in that sort,    </l>
<l>He marveld what should be their let, and went to seeke them out.</l>
<l>His harnesse was a Lions skin that wrapped him about.</l>
<l>His weapons were a long strong speare with head of yron tride,</l>
<l>And eke a light and piercing Dart. And thereunto beside</l>
<l>Worth all the weapons in the world a stout and valiant hart.       </l>
<l>When <placeName key="tgn,2078692">Cadmus</placeName> came within the wood and saw about that part</l>
<l>His men lie slaine upon the ground, and eke their cruell fo</l>
<l>Of bodie huge stand over them, and licking with his blo</l>
<l>And blasting tongue their sorie woundes: Well trustie friendes (quoth he)</l>
<l>I eyther of your piteous deathes will streight revenger be,</l>
<l>Or else will die my selfe therefore. With that he raughting fast</l>
<l>A mightie Milstone, at the Snake with all his might it cast.</l>
<l>The stone with such exceding force and violence forth was driven,</l>
<l>As of a fort the bulwarkes strong and walles it would have riven.</l>
<l>And yet it did the Snake no harme: his scales as hard and tough</l>
<l>As if they had bene plates of mayle did fence him well inough,</l>
<l>So that the stone rebounded backe against his freckled slough.</l>
<l>But yet his hardnesse savde him not against the piercing dart.</l>
<l>For hitting right betweene the scales that yeelded in that part</l>
<l>Whereas the joynts doe knit the backe, it thirled through the skin, </l>
<l>And pierced to his filthy mawe and greedy guts within.</l>
<l>He fierce with wrath wrings backe his head, and looking on the stripe,</l>
<l>The Javeling steale that sticked out, betwene his teeth doth gripe.</l>
<l>The which with wresting to and fro at length he forth did winde,</l>
<l>Save that he left the head therof among his bones behinde.          </l>
<l>When of his courage through the wound more kindled was the ire,</l>
<l>His throteboll swelde with puffed veines, his eyes gan sparkle fire.</l>
<l>There stoode about his smeared chaps a lothly foming froth.</l>
<l>His skaled brest ploughes up the ground, the stinking breath that goth</l>
<l>Out from his blacke and hellish mouth infectes the herbes full fowle. </l>
<l>Sometime he windes himselfe in knots as round as any Bowle.</l>
<l>Sometime he stretcheth out in length as straight as any beame.</l>
<l>Anon againe with violent brunt he rusheth like a streame</l>
<l>Encreast by rage of latefalne raine, and with his mightie sway</l>
<l>Beares downe the wood before his breast that standeth in his way.  </l>
<l>Agenors sonne retiring backe doth with his Lions spoyle</l>
<l>Defend him from his fierce assaults, and makes him to recoyle</l>
<l>Aye holding at the weapons point. The Serpent waxing wood</l>
<l>Doth crashe the steele betwene his teeth, and bites it till the blood,</l>
<l>Dropt mixt with poyson from his mouth, did die the greene grasse blacke,  </l>
<l>But yet the wound was verie light bicause he writhed backe</l>
<l>And puld his head still from the stroke: and made the stripe to die</l>
<l>By giving way, untill that <placeName key="tgn,2078692">Cadmus</placeName> following irefully</l>
<l>The stroke, with all his powre and might did through the throte him rive,</l>
<l>And naylde him to an Oke behind the which he eke did clive.    </l>
<l>The Serpents waight did make the tree to bend. It grievde the tree</l>
<l>His bodie of the Serpents taile thus scourged for to bee.

<l>What gazest thus upon this Snake? the time will one day come</l>
<l>That thou thy selfe shalt be a Snake. He pale and wan for feare,</l>
<l>Had lost his speach: and ruffled up stiffe staring stood his heare.</l>
<l>Behold (mans helper at his neede) Dame Pallas gliding through</l>
<l>The vacant Ayre was straight at hand, and bade him take a plough  </l>
<l>And cast the Serpents teeth in ground, as of the which should spring</l>
<l>Another people out of hand. He did in every thing</l>

<l>And from the furrow first of all the pikes appearde above,</l>
<l>Next rose up helmes with fethered crests, and then the Poldrens bright,</l>
<l>Successively the Curets whole, and all the armor right.</l>
<l>Thus grew up men like corne in field in rankes of battle ray</l>
<l>With shields and weapons in their hands to feight the field that day. </l>

<l>But if you sift the matter well, ye shall not finde desart</l>
<l>But cruell fortune to have bene the cause of this his smart.     </l>
<l>For who could doe with oversight? Great slaughter had bene made</l>
<l>Of sundrie sortes of savage beastes one morning: and the shade</l>
<l>Of things was waxed verie short. It was the time of day</l>
<l>That mid betweene the East and West the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> doth seeme to stay.</l>
<l>When as the Thebane stripling thus bespake his companie,     </l>
<l>Still raunging in the waylesse woods some further game to spie:</l>
<l>Our weapons and our toyles are moist and staind with bloud of Deere:</l>
<l>This day hath done inough as by our quarrie may appeare.</l>
<l>As soone as with hir scarlet wheeles next morning bringeth light,</l>
<l>We will about our worke againe. But now Hiperion bright</l>
<l>Is in the middes of Heaven, and seares the fieldes with firie rayes.</l>
<l>Take up your toyles, and cease your worke, and let us go our wayes.</l>
<l>They did even so, and ceast their worke. There was a valley thicke</l>
<l>With Pinaple and Cipresse trees that armed be with pricke.</l>
<l>Gargaphie hight this shadie plot, it was a sacred place</l>
<l>Tochast Diana and the Nymphes that wayted on hir grace.</l>
<l>Within the furthest en ereof there was a pleasant Bowre</l>
<l>So vaulted with the leavie trees the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> had there no powre:</l>
<l>Not made by hand nor mans devise: and yet no man alive,</l>
<l>A trimmer piece of worke than that could for his life contrive. </l>
<l>With flint and Pommy was it wallde by nature halfe about,</l>
<l>And on the right side of the same full freshly flowed out</l>
<l>A lively spring with Christall streame: whereof the upper brim</l>

<l>Whe   hebe )elt hir selfe waxe faint, of following of hir game,</l>
<l>It was oi-etrsfome for to come and bath hir in the same.</l>
<l>That day she, having timely left hir hunting in the chace,</l>

<l>Powrde water into vessels large to washe their Ladie with.</l>
<l>Now while she keepes this wont, behold, by wandring in the frith </l>

<l>That all the wood did ring thereof: and clinging to their dame</l>
<l>Did all they could to hide both hir and eke themselves fro shame.</l>
<l>But Phebe was of personage so comly and so tall, </l>
<l>That by the middle of hir necke she overpeerd them all.    </l>
<l>Such colour as appeares in Heaven by Phebus broken rayes</l>

<l>A payre of lively olde Harts homes upon his sprinckled head.  </l>
<l>She sharpes his eares, she makes his necke both slender, long and lanke.</l>
<l>She turnes his fingers into feete, his armes to spindle shanke.</l>
<l>She wrappes him in a hairie hyde beset with speckled spottes,</l>

<l>Full greatly wondring to him selfe what made him in that cace  </l>

<l>And horned temples in the brooke, he would have cryde Alas,</l>
<l>But as for then no kinde of speach out of his lippes could passe.</l>
<l>He sighde and brayde: for that was then the speach that did remaine,</l>
<l>And downe the eyes that were not his, his bitter teares did raine.   </l>
<l>No part remayned (save his minde) of that he earst had beene.</l>
<l>What should he doe? turne home againe to Cadmus and the Queene?</l>
<l>Or hyde himselfe among the Woods? Of this he was afrayd,</l>
<l>And of the tother ill ashamde. While doubting thus he stayd.</l>
<l>His houndes espyde him where he was, and Blackfoote first of all </l>

<l>But use of wordes and speach did want to utter forth his minde.</l>
<l>Their crie did ring through all the Wood redoubled with the winde,</l>

<l>They did gainecope him as he came, and helde their Master still</l>

<l>No part of him was free from wound. He could none other do   </l>
<l>But sigh, and in the shape of Hart with voyce as Hartes are woont,</l>

<l>With piteous looke in stead of handes his head about to wave.</l>
<l>Not knowing that it was their Lord, the huntsmen cheere their houndsi</l>
<l>With wonted noyse and for Acteon looke about the grounds.</l>
<l>They hallow who could lowdest crie still calling him by name,</l>
<l>As though he were not there, and much his absence they do blame  </l>
<l>In that he came not to the fall, but slackt to see the game.</l>
<l>As often as they named him he sadly shooke his head,</l>
<l>And faine he would have beene away thence in some other stead.</l>

<l>His dogges fell deedes, so that to feele in place he had not bee.   </l>
<l>They hem him in on everie side, and in the shape of Stagge,</l>

<l>Much muttring was upon this fact. Some thought there was extended  </l>

<l>Good reasons to defende their case. Alone the wife ofJe,</l>
<l>Of lyking or misliking it not all so greatly strove,         </l>
<l>As secretly rejoyst in heart that such a plague was light</l>
<l>On Cadmus linage: turning all the malice and the spight</l>
<l>Conceyved earst against the wench that Jove had fet fro <placeName key="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName>,</l>
<l>Upon the kinred of the wench, and for to fierce hir ire,</l>
<l>Another thing cleane overthwart there commeth in the nicke:       </l>
<l>The Ladie Semell great with childe by Jove as then was quicke.</l>
<l>Hereat she gan to fret and fume, and for to ease hir heart,</l>
<l>Which else would burst, she fell in hande with scolding out hir part:</l>
<l>And what a goodyeare have I woon by scolding erst? (she sed)</l>
<l>It is that arrant queane hir selfe, against whose wicked hed   </l>
<l>I must assay to give assault: and if (as men me call)</l>
<l>I be that Juno who in heaven beare greatest swing of all,</l>
<l>If in my hande I worthie bee to holde the royall Mace,</l>
<l>And if I be the Queene of heaven and soveraigne of this place,</l>
<l>Or wife and sister unto Jove, (his sister well I know:            </l>
<l>But as for wife that name is vayne, I serve but for a show,</l>
<l>To cover other privie skapes) I will confound that Whore.</l>
<l>Now (with a mischiefe) is she bagd and beareth out before</l>
<l>Hir open shame to all the world, and shortly hopes to bee</l>
<l>The mother of a sonne by Jove, the which hath hapt to mee         </l>
<l>Not passing once in all my time, so sore she doth presume</l>
<l>Upon hir beautie. But I trowe hir hope shall soone consume.</l>
<l>For never let me counted be for Saturns daughter more,</l>
<l>If by hir owne deare darling Jove on whome she trustes so sore,</l>
<l>I sende hir not to Styxes streame. This ended up she rose         </l>
<l>And covered in golden cloud to Semelles house she goes.</l>
<l>And ere she sent away the cloud, she takes an olde wyves shape</l>
<l>With hoarie haire and riveled skinne, with slow and crooked gate.</l>
<l>As though she had the Palsey had, hir feeble limmes did shake,</l>
<l>And eke she foltred in the mouth as often as she spake.            </l>
<l>She seemde olde Beldame Beroe of Epidaure to bee,</l>
<l>This Ladie Semelles Nourse as right as though it had beene shee.</l>
<l>So when that after mickle talke of purpose ministred</l>
<l>Joves name was upned: by and by she gave a sigh and sed:</l>
<l>I wish with all my heart that Jove bee cause to thee of this.     </l>
<l>But daughter deare I dreade the worst, I feare it be amisse.</l>
<l>For manie Varlets under name of Gods to serve their lust,</l>
<l>Have into undefiled beddes themselves full often thrust;</l>
<l>And though it bene the mightie Jove yet doth not that suffise,</l>
<l>Onlesse he also make the same apparant to our eyes.               </l>
<l>And if it be even verie hee, I say it doth behove,</l>
<l>He prove it by some open signe and token of his love.</l>
<l>And therefore pray him for to graunt that, looke, in what degree,</l>
<l>What order, fashion, sort and state he use to companie</l>
<l>With mightie Juno, in the same in everie poynt and cace,  </l>
<l>To all intents and purposes he thee likewise embrace,</l>
<l>And that he also bring with him his bright threeforked Mace.</l>
<l>With such instructions Juno had enformed Cadmus Neece:</l>
<l>And she poore sielie simple soule immediately on this</l>
<l>Requested Jove to graunt a boone the which she did not name.    </l>
<l>Aske what thou wilt sweete heart (quoth he) thou shalt not misse the same,</l>
<l>And for to make thee sure hereof, the grisely Stygian Lake,</l>
<l>Which is the feare and God of Gods beare witnesse for thy sake.</l>
<l>She joying in hir owne mischaunce, not having any powre</l>
<l>To rule hir selfe, but making speede to hast hir fatall howre,  </l>
<l>In which she through hir Lovers helpe should worke hir owne decay,</l>
<l>Sayd: Such as Juno findeth you when you and she doe play</l>
<l>The games of Venus, such I pray thee shew thy selfe to mee</l>
<l>In everie case. The God would faine have stopt hir mouth. But shee</l>
<l>Had made such hast that out it was. Which made him sigh full sore, </l>
<l>For neyther she could then unwish the thing she wisht before,</l>
<l>Nor he revoke his solemne oth. Wherefore with sorie heart</l>
<l>And heavie countnance by and by to Heaven he doth depart,</l>
<l>And makes to follow after him with looke full grim and stoure</l>
<l>The flakie clouds all grisly blacke, as when they threat a shoure.   </l>
<l>To which he added mixt with winde a fierce and flashing flame,</l>
<l>With drie and dreadfull thunderclaps and lightning to the same</l>
<l>Of deadly unavoyded dynt. And yet as much as may</l>
<l>He goes about his vehement force and fiercenesse to allay.</l>
<l>He doth not arme him with the fire with which he did remove   </l>
<l>The Giant with the hundreth handes, Typhoeus, from above:</l>
<l>It was too cruell and too sore to use against his Love.</l>
<l>The <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> made an other kinde of lightning farre more light,</l>
<l>Wherein they put much lesse of fire, lesse fierceness, lesser might.</l>
<l>It hight in Heaven the seconde Mace. Jove armes himselfe with this </l>
<l>And enters into Cadmus house where Semelles chamber is.</l>
<l>She being mortall was too weake and feeble to withstande</l>
<l>Such troublous tumultes of the Heavens: and therefore out of hande</l>
<l>Was burned in hir Lovers armes. But yet he tooke away</l>
<l>His infant from the mothers wombe unperfect as it lay,    </l>
<l>And (if a man may credit it) did in his thigh it sowe,</l>
<l>Where byding out the mothers tyme it did to ripenesse growe.</l>
<l>And when the time of birth was come his Aunt the Ladie Ine</l>
<l>Did nourse him for a while by stealth and kept him trym and fine.</l>
<l>The Nymphes of <placeName key="tgn,7002622">Nysa</placeName> afterwarde did in their bowres him hide,   </l>

<l>Now while these things were done on earth, and that by fatal doome</l>

<l>They say that Jove disposde to myrth as he and Juno sate</l>
<l>A drinking Nectar after meate in sport and pleasant rate, </l>
<l>Did fall a jeasting with his wife, and saide: A greater pleasure</l>
<l>In Venus games ye women have than men beyonde all measure.</l>
<l>She answerde no. To trie the truth, they both of them agree</l>
<l>The wise Tyresias in this case indifferent Judge to bee,</l>
<l>Who both the man and womans joyes by tryall understood. </l>
<l>For finding once two mightie Snakes engendring in a Wood,</l>
<l>He strake them overthwart the backs, by meanes whereof beholde</l>

<l>He being made a woman straight, seven winter lived so.</l>

<l>That are the givers of the stripe, before you hence escape,</l>
<l>One stripe now will I lende you more. He strake them as beforne</l>
<l>And straight returnd his former shape in which he first was borne.</l>
<l>Tyresias therefore being tane to judge this jesting strife,  </l>
<l>Gave sentence on the side of Jove. The which the Queene his wife</l>

<l>To wreake hir teene upon hir Judge, bereft him of his sight.</l>
<l>But Jove (for to the Gods it is unleefull to undoe</l>
<l>The things which other of the Gods by any meanes have doe)    </l>
<l>Did give him sight in things to come for losse of sight of eye,</l>

<l>By meanes whereof within a while in Citie, fielde, and towne</l>
<l>Through all the coast of Aony was bruited his renowne.</l>

<l>Were aunswerde so as none of them could give him misreporte.</l>
<l>The first that of his soothfast wordes had proufe in all the Realme</l>
<l>Was freckled Lyriop, whom sometime surprised in his streame</l>
<l>The floud Cephisus did enforce. This Lady bare a sonne</l>
<l>Whose beautie at his verie birth might justly love have wonne.    </l>
<l>-Narcissus did she call his name. Of whome the Prophet sage,</l>
<l>-Demaunded if the childe should live to many yeares of age,</l>
<l>Made aunswere: Yea full long, so that him selfe he doe not know.</l>
<l>The Soothsayers wordes seemde long but vaine, untill the end did show</l>
<l>His saying to be true in deede by straungenesse of the rage,  </l>
<l>And straungenesse of the kinde of death that did abridge his age.</l>
<l>For when yeares three times five and one he fully lyved had,</l>

<l>The hearts of dyvers trim yong men his beautie gan to move</l>
<l>And many a Ladie fresh and faire was taken in his love.    </l>
<l>But in that grace of Natures gift such passing pride did raigne,</l>
<l>That to be toucht of man or Mayde he wholy did disdaine.</l>
<l>A babling Nymph that Echo hight, who hearing others talke,</l>
<l>By no meanes can restraine hir tongue but that it needes must walke,</l>
<l>Nor of hir selfe hath powre to ginne to speake to any wight,  </l>
<l>Espyde him dryving into toyles the fearefull stagges of flight.</l>
<l>This Echo was a body then and not an onely voyce.</l>
<l>Yet of hir speach she had that time no more than now the choyce,</l>
<l>That is to say, of many wordes the latter to repeate.</l>
<l>The cause thereof was Junos wrath. For when that with the feate  </l>
<l>She might have often taken Jove in daliance with his Dames,</l>
<l>And that by stealth and unbewares in middes of all his games,</l>
<l>This elfe would with hir tatling talke deteine hir by the way,</l>
<l>Untill that Jove had wrought his will and they were fled away.</l>
<l>The which when Juno did perceyve, she said with wrathfull mood: </l>
<l>This tongue that hath deluded me shall doe thee little good,</l>
<l>For of thy speach but simple use hereafter shalt thou have.</l>
<l>The deede it selfe did straight confirme the threatnings that she gave.</l>
<l>Yet Echo of the former talke doth double oft the ende</l>
<l>And backe againe with just report the wordes earst spoken sende.  </l>
<l>Now when she sawe Narcissus stray about the Forrest wyde,</l>
<l>She waxed warme and step for step fast after him she hyde.</l>
<l>The more she followed after him and neerer that she came,</l>
<l>The hoter ever did she waxe as neerer to hir flame.</l>
<l>Lyke as the lively Brimstone doth which dipt about a match,    </l>
<l>And put but softly to the fire, the flame doth lightly catch.</l>
<l>O Lord how often woulde she faine (if nature would have let)</l>
<l>Entreated him with gentle wordes some favour for to get?</l>
<l>But nature would not suffer hir nor give hir leave to ginne.</l>
<l>Yet (so farre forth as she by graunt at natures hande could winne) </l>
<l>As readie with attentive eare she harkens for some sounde,</l>
<l>Whereto she might replie hir wordes, from which she is not bounde.</l>
<l>By chaunce the stripling being strayde from all his companie,</l>
<l>Sayde: Is there any body nie? Straight Echo answerde: I.</l>
<l>Amazde he castes his eye aside, and looketh round about,   </l>
<l>And Come (that all the Forrest roong) aloud he calleth out.</l>
<l>And Come (sayth she:) he looketh backe, and seeing no man followe,</l>
<l>Why fliste, he cryeth once againe: and she the same doth hallowe.</l>
<l>He still persistes and wondring much what kinde of thing it was</l>
<l>From which that answering voyce by turne so duely seemde to passe, </l>
<l>Said: Let us joyne. She (by hir will desirous to have said</l>
<l>In fayth with none more willingly at any time or stead)</l>
<l>Said: Let us joyne. And standing somewhat in hir owne conceit,</l>
<l>Upon these wordes she left the Wood, and forth she yeedeth streit,</l>
<l>To coll the lovely necke for which she longed had so much,  </l>
<l>He runnes his way and will not be imbraced of no such,</l>
<l>And sayth: I first will die ere thou shalt take of me thy pleasure.</l>
<l>She aunswerde nothing else thereto, but Take of me thy pleasure.</l>
<l>Now when she saw hir selfe thus mockt, she gate hir to the Woods,</l>
<l>And hid hir head for verie shame among the leaves and buddes. </l>
<l>And ever sence she lyves alone in dennes and hollow Caves,</l>
<l>Yet stacke hir love still to hir heart, through which she dayly raves</l>
<l>The more for sorrowe of repulse. Through restlesse carke and care</l>
<l>Hir bodie pynes to skinne and bone, and waxeth wonderous bare.</l>
<l>The bloud doth vanish into ayre from out of all hir veynes,  </l>
<l>And nought is left but voyce and bones: the voyce yet still remaynes:</l>
<l>Hir bones they say were turnde to stones. From thence she lurking still</l>
<l>In Woods, will never shewe hir head in field nor yet on hill.</l>
<l>Yet is she heard of every man: it is hir onely sound,</l>
<l>And nothing else that doth remayne alive above the ground.  </l>
<l>Thus had he mockt this wretched Nymph and many mo beside,</l>
<l>That in the waters, Woods and groves, or Mountaynes did abyde.</l>
<l>Thus had he mocked many men. Of which one miscontent</l>
<l>To see himselfe deluded so, his handes to Heaven up bent,</l>
<l>And sayd: I pray to God he may once feele fierce Cupids fire    </l>
<l>As I doe now, and yet not joy the things he doth desire.</l>
<l>The Goddesse Ramnuse (who doth wreake on wicked people take)</l>
<l>Assented to his just request for ruth and pities sake.</l>
<l>There was a spring withouten mudde as silver cleare and still,</l>
<l>Which neyther sheepeheirds, nor the Goates that fed upon the hill, </l>
<l>Nor other cattell troubled had, nor savage beast had styrd,</l>
<l>Nor braunch nor sticke, nor leafe of tree, nor any soule nor byrd.</l>
<l>The moysture fed and kept aye fresh the grasse that grew about,</l>
<l>And with their leaves the trees did keepe the heate of Phoebus out.</l>
<l>The stripling wearie with the heate and hunting in the chace,   </l>
<l>And much delighted with the spring and coolenesse of the place,</l>
<l>Did lay him downe upon the brim: and as he stooped lowe</l>
<l>To staunche his thurst, another thurst of worse effect did growe.</l>
<l>For as he dranke, he chaunst to spie the Image of his face,</l>
<l>The which he did immediately with fervent love embrace.          </l>
<l>He feedes a hope without cause why. For like a foolishe noddie</l>
<l>He thinkes the shadow that he sees, to be a lively boddie.</l>
<l>Astraughted like an ymage made of Marble stone he lyes,</l>
<l>There gazing on his shadowe still with fixed staring eyes.</l>
<l>Stretcht all along upon the ground, it doth him good to see      </l>
<l>His ardant eyes which like two starres full bright and shyning bee,</l>
<l>And eke his fingars, fingars such as Bacchus might beseeme,</l>
<l>And haire that one might worthely Apollos haire it deeme,</l>
<l>His beardlesse chinne and yvorie necke, and eke the perfect grace</l>
<l>Of white and red indifferently bepainted in his face.            </l>
<l>All these he woondreth to beholde, for which (as I doe gather)</l>
<l>Himselfe was to be woondred at, or to be pitied rather.</l>
<l>He is enamored of himselfe for want of taking heede,</l>
<l>And where he lykes another thing, he lykes himselfe in deede.</l>
<l>He is the partie whome he wooes, and suter that doth wooe,       </l>
<l>He is the flame that settes on fire, and thing that burneth tooe.</l>
<l>O Lord how often did he kisse that false deceitfull thing?</l>
<l>How often did he thrust his armes midway into the spring</l>
<l>To have embraste the necke he saw and could not catch himselfe?</l>
<l>He knowes not what it was he sawe. And yet the foolish elfe      </l>
<l>Doth burne in ardent love thereof. The verie selfsame thing</l>
<l>That doth bewitch and blinde his eyes, encreaseth all his sting.</l>
<l>Thou fondling thou, why doest thou raught the fickle image so?</l>
<l>The thing thou seekest is not there. And if aside thou go,</l>
<l>The thing thou lovest straight is gone. It is none other matter  </l>
<l>That thou doest see, than of thy selfe the shadow in the water.</l>
<l>The thing is nothing of it selfe: with thee it doth abide,</l>
<l>With thee it would departe if thou withdrew thy selfe aside.

<l>He turnes and settes himselfe upright, and holding up his hands</l>
<l>With piteous voyce unto the wood that round about him stands,</l>
<l>Cryes out and ses: Alas ye Woods, and was there ever any         </l>
<l>That loovde so cruelly as I? you know: for unto many</l>
<l>A place of harbrough have you beene, and fort of refuge strong.</l>
<l>Can you remember any one in all your tyme so long</l>
<l>That hath so pinde away as I? I see and am full faine,</l>
<l>Howbeit that I like and see I can not yet attaine:               </l>
<l>So great a blindnesse in my heart through doting love doth raigne.</l>
<l>And for to spight me more withall, it is no journey farre,</l>
<l>No drenching Sea, no Mountaine hie, no wall, no locke, no barre,</l>
<l>It is but even a little droppe that keepes us two asunder.</l>
<l>He would be had. For looke how oft I kisse the water under,      </l>
<l>So oft againe with upwarde mouth he riseth towarde mee.</l>
<l>A man would thinke to touch at least I should yet able bee.</l>
<l>It is a trifle in respect that lettes us of our love.</l>
<l>What wight soever that thou art come hither up above.</l>
<l>O pierlesse piece, why dost thou mee thy lover thus delude?      </l>
<l>Or whither fliste thou of thy friende thus earnestly pursude?</l>
<l>Iwis I neyther am so fowle nor yet so growne in yeares</l>
<l>That in this wise thou shouldst me shoon. To have me to their Feeres,</l>
<l>The Nymphes themselves have sude ere this. And yet (as should appeere)</l>
<l>Thou dost pretende some kinde of hope of friendship by thy cheere. </l>
<l>For when I stretch mine armes to thee, thou stretchest thine likewise.</l>
<l>And if I smile thou smilest too: and when that from mine eyes</l>
<l>The teares doe drop, I well perceyve the water stands in thine.</l>
<l>Like gesture also dost thou make to everie becke of mine.</l>
<l>And as by moving of thy sweete and lovely lippes I weene,   </l>
<l>Thou speakest words although mine eares conceive not what they beene,</l>
<l>It is my selfe I well perceyve, it is mine Image sure,</l>
<l>That in this sort deluding me, this furie doth procure.</l>
<l>I am inamored of my selfe, I doe both set on fire,</l>
<l>And am the same that swelteth too, through impotent desire.  </l>
<l>What shall I doe? be woode or woo? whome shall I woo therefore?</l>
<l>The thing I seeke is in my selfe, my plentie makes me poore.</l>
<l>I would to God I for a while might from my bodie part.</l>
<l>This wish is straunge to heare, a Lover wrapped all in smart</l>
<l>To wish away the thing the which he loveth as his heart.    </l>
<l>My sorrowe takes away my strength. I have not long to live,</l>
<l>But in the floure of youth must die. To die it doth not grieve.</l>
<l>For that by death shall come the ende of all my griefe and paine</l>
<l>I would this yongling whome I love might lenger life obtaine:</l>
<l>For in one soule shall now decay we stedfast Lovers twaine.  </l>
<l>This saide in rage he turnes againe unto the forsaide shade,</l>
<l>And rores the water with the teares and sloubring that he made,</l>
<l>That through his troubling of the Well his ymage gan to fade.</l>
<l>Which when he sawe to vanish so: Oh whither dost thou flie?</l>
<l>Abide I pray thee heartely, aloud he gan to crie.           </l>
<l>Forsake me not so cruelly that loveth thee so deere,</l>
<l>But give me leave a little while my dazled eyes to cheere</l>
<l>With sight of that which for to touch is utterly denide,</l>
<l>Thereby to feede my wretched rage and furie for a tide.</l>
<l>As in this wise he made his mone, he stripped off his cote </l>
<l>And with his fist outragiously his naked stomacke smote.</l>
<l>A ruddie colour where he smote rose on his stomacke sheere,</l>
<l>Lyke Apples which doe partly white and striped red appeere,</l>
<l>Or as the clusters ere the grapes to ripenesse fully come:</l>
<l>An <placeName key="tgn,2045333">Orient</placeName> purple here and there beginnes to grow on some.   </l>
<l>Which things as soon as in the spring he did beholde againe,</l>
<l>He could no longer beare it out. But fainting straight for paine,</l>
<l>As lith and supple waxe doth melt against the burning flame,</l>
<l>Or morning dewe against the Sunne that glareth on the same:</l>
<l>Even so by piecemale being spent and wasted through desire,  </l>
<l>Did he consume and melt away with Cupids secret fire.</l>
<l>His lively hue of white and red, his cheerefulnesse and strength</l>
<l>And all the things that lyked him did wanze away at length.</l>
<l>So that in fine remayned not the bodie which of late</l>
<l>The wretched Echo loved so. Who when she sawe his state,   </l>
<l>Although in heart she angrie were, and mindefull of his pride,</l>
<l>Yet ruing his unhappie case, as often as he cride</l>
<l>Alas, she cride, Alas likewise with shirle redoubled sound.</l>
<l>And when he beate his breast, or strake his feete against the ground,</l>
<l>She made like noyse of clapping too. These are the woordes that last </l>
<l>Out of his lippes beholding still his woonted ymage past:</l>
<l>Alas sweete boy belovde in vaine, farewell. And by and by</l>
<l>With sighing sound the selfesame wordes the Echo did reply.</l>
<l>With that he layde his wearie head against the grassie place</l>
<l>And death did doze his gazing eyes that woondred at the grace  </l>
<l>And beautie which did late adorne their Masters heavenly face.</l>
<l>And afterward when into Hell receyved was his spright</l>
<l>He goes me to the Well of <placeName key="tgn,1130355">Styx</placeName>, and there both day and night</l>
<l>Standes tooting on his shadow still as fondely as before.</l>
<l>The water Nymphes, his sisters, wept and wayled for him sore    </l>
<l>And on his bodie strowde their haire clipt off and shorne therefore.</l>
<l>The Wood nymphes also did lament. And Echo did rebound</l>
<l>To every sorrowfull noyse of theirs with like lamenting sound.</l>
<l>The fire was made to burne the corse, and waxen Tapers light.</l>
<l>A Herce to lay the bodie on with solemne pompe was dight.  </l>
<l>But as for bodie none remaind: in stead thereof they found</l>
<l>A yellow floure with milke white leaves new sprong upon the ground.

<l>This matter all Achaia through did spreade the Prophets fame:</l>
<l>That every where of just desert renowned was his name.</l>
<l>But Penthey, olde Echions sonne (who proudely did disdaine  </l>
<l>Both God and man) did laughe to scorne the Prophets words as vaine,</l>
<l>Upbrading him most spitefully with loosing of his sight,</l>
<l>And with the fact for which he lost fruition of this light.</l>
<l>The good olde father (for these wordes his pacience much did move)</l>
<l>Saide:  how happie shouldest thou be and blessed from above,</l>
<l>If thou wert blinde as well as I, so that thou might not see</l>
<l>The sacred rytes of <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> band. For sure the time will bee,</l>
<l>And that full shortely (as I gesse) that hither shall resort</l>
<l>Another <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName>, Semelles sonne, whome if thou not support</l>
<l>With pompe and honour like a God, thy carcasse shall be tattred,  </l>
<l>And in a thousand places eke about the Woods be scattred.</l>
<l>And for to reade thee what they are that shall perfourme the deede,</l>
<l>It is thy mother and thine Auntes that thus shall make thee bleede.</l>
<l>I know it shall so come to passe, for why thou shalt disdaine,</l>
<l>To honour <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> as a God: and then thou shalt with paine </l>
<l>Feele how that blinded as I am I sawe for thee too much.</l>
<l>As olde Tiresias did pronounce these wordes and other such,</l>
<l>Echions sonne did trouble him. His wordes prove true in deede,</l>
<l>For as the Prophet did forespeake so fell it out with speede.</l>
<l>Anon this newefound <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> commes: the woods and fieldes rebound </l>
<l>With noyse of shouts and howling out, and such confused sound.</l>
<l>The folke runne flocking out by heapes, men, Mayds and wives togither</l>
<l>The noble men and rascall sorte ran gadding also thither,</l>
<l>The Orgies of this unknowne God full fondely to performe,</l>
<l>The which when Penthey did perceyve, he gan to rage and storme. </l>
<l>And sayde unto them: O ye ympes of <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName> his snake by kinde</l>
<l>What ayleth you? what fiend of hell doth thus enrage your minde?</l>
<l>Hath tinking sound of pottes and pannes, hath noyse of crooked home,</l>
<l>Have fonde illusions such a force that them whome heretoforne</l>
<l>No arming sworde, no bloudie trumpe, no men in battail ray     </l>
<l>Could cause to shrinke, no sheepish shriekes of simple women fray,</l>
<l>And dronken woodnesse wrought by wine and roughts of filthie freakes</l>
<l>And sound of toying timpanes dauntes, and quite their courage breakes?</l>

<l>More neare in courage and in yeares? whome meete it were to see</l>
<l>With speare and not with thirse in hande, with glittring helme on hed,   </l>
<l>And not with leaves. Now call to minde of whome ye all are bred,</l>
<l>And take the stomackes of that Snake, which being one alone,</l>
<l>Right stoutly in his owne defence confounded many one.</l>
<l>He for his harbrough and his spring his lyfe did nobly spend.</l>
<l>Doe you no more but take a heart your Countrie to defende.      </l>
<l>He put to death right valeant knightes. Your battaile is with such</l>
<l>As are but Meicocks in effect: and yet ye doe so much</l>
<l>In conquering them, that by the deede the olde renowne ye save,</l>
<l>Which from your fathers by discent this present time ye have.</l>
<l>If fatall destnies doe forbid that <placeName key="tgn,7001297">Thebae</placeName> long shall stande,  </l>
<l>Would God that men with Canon shot might raze it out of hande.</l>
<l>Would God the noyse of fire and sworde did in our hearing sound.</l>
<l>For then in this our wretchednesse there could no fault be found.</l>
<l>Then might we justly waile our case that all the world might see</l>
<l>We should not neede of sheading teares ashamed for to bee.  </l>
<l>But now our towne is taken by a naked beardelesse boy,</l>
<l>Who doth not in the feates of armes nor horse nor armour joy,</l>
<l>But for to moyste his haire with Mirrhe, and put on garlands gay,</l>
<l>And in soft Purple silke and golde his bodie to aray.</l>
<l>But put to you your helping hand and straight without delay  </l>
<l>I will compell him poynt by poynt his lewdnesse to bewray,</l>
<l>Both in usurping Joves high name in making him his sonne</l>
<l>And forging of these Ceremonies lately now begonne.</l>
<l>Hath King Atrisius heart inough this fondling for to hate</l>
<l>That makes himselfe to be a God? and for to shut the gate  </l>
<l>Of Argus at his comming there? and shall this rover make</l>
<l>King Penthey and the noble towne of <placeName key="tgn,7001297">Thebae</placeName> thus to quake?</l>
<l>Go quickly sirs (these wordes he spake unto his servaunts) go</l>
<l>And bring the Captaine hither bound with speede. Why stay ye so?</l>
<l>His Grandsire Cadmus, Athamas and others of his kinne    </l>
<l>Reproved him by gentle meanes but nothing could they winne:</l>
<l>The more intreatance that they made the fiercer was he still:</l>
<l>The more his friendes did go about to breake him of his will,</l>
<l>The more they did provoke his wrath, and set his rage on fire:</l>
<l>They made him worse in that they sought to bridle his desire.    </l>
<l>So have I seene a brooke ere this, where nothing let the streame,</l>
<l>Runne smooth with little noyse or none, but where as any beame</l>
<l>Or cragged stones did let his course, and make him for to stay:</l>
<l>It went more fiercely from the stoppe with fomie wroth away.</l>
<l>Beholde all bloudie come his men, and straight he them demaunded </l>
<l>Where <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> was, and why they had not done as he commaunded.</l>
<l>Sir (aunswerde they) we saw him not, but this same fellow heere</l>
<l>A chiefe companion in his traine and worker in this geere,</l>
<l>Wee tooke by force: and therewithall presented to their Lord</l>
<l>A certaine man of Tirrhene lande, his handes fast bound with cord, </l>
<l>Whome they, frequenting Bacchus rites had found but late before.</l>
<l>A grim and cruell looke which yre did make to seeme more sore,</l>
<l>Did Penthey cast upon the man. And though he scarcely stayd</l>
<l>From putting him to tormentes strait, O wretched man (he sayde)</l>
<l>Who by thy worthie death shalt be a sample unto other, </l>
<l>Declare to me the names of thee, thy father and thy mother,</l>
<l>And in what Countrie thou wert borne, and what hath caused thee,</l>
<l>Of these straunge rites and sacrifice, a follower for to bee.

<l>He voyd of feare made aunswere thus: Acetis is my name:</l>
<l>Of Parentes but of lowe degree in Lidy land I came.      </l>
<l>No ground for painfull Oxe to till, no sheepe to beare me wooll</l>
<l>My father left me: no nor horse, nor Asse, nor Cow nor Booll.</l>
<l>God wote he was but poore himselfe. With line and bayted hooke</l>
<l>The frisking fishes in the pooles upon his Reede he tooke.</l>
<l>His handes did serve in steade of landes, his substance was his craft. </l>
<l>Nowe have I made you true accompt of all that he me laft,</l>
<l>As well of ryches as of trades, in which I was his heire</l>
<l>And successour. For when that death bereft him use of aire,</l>
<l>Save water he me nothing left. It is the thing alone</l>
<l>Which for my lawfull heritage I clayme, and other none. </l>
<l>Soone after I (bicause that loth I was to ay abide</l>
<l>In that poore state) did learne a ship by cunning hande to guide,</l>
<l>And for to know the raynie signe, that hight th'Olenien Gote</l>
<l>Which with hir milke did nourish Jove. And also I did note</l>
<l>The Pleiads and the Hiads moyst, and eke the siely Plough    </l>
<l>With all the dwellings of the winds that make the Seas so rough.</l>
<l>And eke such Havens as are meete to harbrough vessels in:</l>
<l>With everie starre and heavenly signe that guides to shipmen bin.</l>
<l>Now as by chaunce I late ago did toward Dilos sayle,</l>
<l>I came on coast of Scios Ile, and seeing day to fayle, </l>
<l>Tooke harbrough there and went alande. As soone as that the night</l>
<l>Was spent, and morning gan to peere with ruddie glaring light,</l>
<l>I rose and bad my companie fresh water fetch aboord.</l>
<l>And pointing them the way that led directly to the foorde,</l>
<l>I went me to a little hill, and viewed round about           </l>
<l>To see what weather we were lyke to have ere setting out.</l>
<l>Which done, I cald my watermen and all my Mates togither,</l>
<l>And willde them all to go aboord my selfe first going thither.</l>
<l>Loe here we are (Opheltes sayd) (he was the Maysters Mate)</l>
<l>And (as he thought) a bootie found in desert fields alate,  </l>
<l>He dragd a boy upon his hande that for his beautie sheene</l>
<l>A mayden rather than a boy appeared for to beene.</l>
<l>This childe, as one forelade with wine, and dreint with drousie sleepe</l>
<l>Did reele, as though he scarcely coulde himselfe from falling keepe.</l>
<l>I markt his countnance, weede and pace, no inckling could I see,   </l>
<l>By which I might conjecture him a mortall wight to bee.</l>
<l>I thought, and to my fellowes sayd: What God I can not tell</l>
<l>But in this bodie that we see some Godhead sure doth dwell.</l>
<l>What God so ever that thou art, thy favour to us showe,</l>
<l>And in our labours us assist, and pardone these also.      </l>
<l>Pray for thy selfe and not for us (quoth Dictys by and by).</l>
<l>A nimbler fellow for to climbe upon the Mast on hie</l>
<l>And by the Cable downe to slide, there was not in our keele.</l>
<l>Swart Melanth patrone of the shippe did like his saying weele.</l>
<l>So also did Alcimedon: and so did Libys too,                </l>
<l>And blacke Epopeus eke whose charge it did belong unto</l>
<l>To see the Rowers at their tymes their dueties duely do.</l>
<l>And so did all the rest of them: so sore mennes eyes were blinded</l>
<l>Where covetousenesse of filthie gaine is more than reason minded.</l>
<l>Well sirs (quoth I) but by your leave ye shall not have it so,  </l>
<l>I will not suffer sacriledge within this shippe to go.</l>
<l>For I have here the most to doe. And with that worde I stept</l>
<l>Uppon the Hatches, all the rest from entrance to have kept.</l>
<l>The rankest Ruffian of the rout that Lycab had to name,</l>
<l>(Who for a murder being late driven out of Tuscane came</l>
<l>To me for succor) waxed woode, and with his sturdie fist</l>
<l>Did give me such a churlish blow bycause I did resist,</l>
<l>That over boord he had me sent, but that with much ado</l>
<l>I caught the tackling in my hand and helde me fast thereto:</l>
<l>The wicked Varlets had a sport to see me handled so.        </l>
<l>Then Bacchus (for it Bacchus was) as though he had but tho</l>
<l>Bene waked with their noyse from sleepe, and that his drousie braine</l>
<l>Discharged of the wine, begon to gather sence againe,</l>
<l>Said: What adoe? what noyse is this? how came I here I pray?</l>
<l>Sirs tell me whether you doe meane to carie me away.        </l>
<l>Feare not my boy (the Patrone sayd) no more but tell me where</l>
<l>Thou doest desire to go alande, and we will set thee there.</l>
<l>To Naxus ward (quoth Bacchus tho) set ship upon the fome.</l>
<l>There would I have yow harbrough take, for Naxus is my home.</l>
<l>Like perjurde Caitifs by the Sea and all the Gods thereof,       </l>
<l>They falsly sware it should be so, and therewithall in scoffe</l>
<l>They bade me hoyse up saile and go. Upon the righter hand</l>
<l>I cast about to fetch the winde, for so did Naxus stand.</l>
<l>What meanst? art mad? Opheltes cride, and therewithall begun</l>
<l>A feare of loosing of their pray through every man to run.       </l>
<l>The greater part with head and hand a signe did to me make,</l>
<l>And some did whisper in mine eare the left hand way to take.</l>
<l>I was amazde and said: Take charge henceforth who will for me:</l>
<l>For of your craft and wickednesse I will no furthrer be.</l>
<l>Then fell they to reviling me, and all the rout gan grudge:      </l>
<l>Of which Ethalion said in scorne: By like in you Sir snudge</l>
<l>Consistes the savegard of us all. And wyth that word he takes</l>
<l>My roume, and leaving Naxus quite to other countries makes.</l>
<l>The God then dalying with these mates, as though he had at last</l>
<l>Begon to smell their suttle craft, out of the foredecke cast     </l>
<l>His eye upon the Sea: and then as though he seemde to weepe,</l>
<l>Sayd: Sirs, to bring me on this coast ye doe not promise keepe.</l>
<l>I see that this is not the land the which I did request.</l>
<l>For what occasion in this sort deserve I to be drest?</l>
<l>What commendation can you win, or praise thereby receyve,        </l>
<l>If men a Lad, if many one ye compasse to deceyve?</l>
<l>I wept and sobbed all this while, the wicked villaines laught,</l>
<l>And rowed forth with might and maine, as though they had bene straught.</l>
<l>Now even by him (for sure than he in all the worlde so wide</l>
<l>There is no God more neare at hand at every time and tide)        </l>
<l>I sweare unto you that the things the which I shall declare,</l>
<l>Like as they seeme incredible, even so most true they are.</l>
<l>The ship stoode still amid the Sea as in a dustie docke.</l>
<l>They wondring at this miracle, and making but a mocke,</l>
<l>Persist in beating with their Ores, and on with all their sayles.  </l>
<l>To make their Galley to remove, no Art nor labor fayles.</l>
<l>But Ivie troubled so their Ores that forth they could not row:</l>
<l>And both with Beries and with leaves their sailes did overgrow.</l>
<l>And he himselfe with clustred grapes about his temples round,</l>
<l>Did shake a Javeling in his hand that round about was bound</l>
<l>With leaves of Vines: and at his feete there seemed for to couch</l>
<l>Of Tygers, Lynx, and Panthers shapes most ougly for to touch.</l>
<l>I cannot tell you whether feare or woodnesse were the cause,</l>
<l>But every person leapeth up and from his labor drawes.</l>
<l>And there one <placeName key="tgn,2100309">Medon</placeName> first of all began to waxen blacke, </l>
<l>And having lost his former shape did take a courbed backe.</l>
<l>What Monster shall we have of thee (quoth Licab) and with that</l>
<l>This Licabs chappes did waxen wide, his nosetrils waxed flat,</l>
<l>His skin waxt tough, and scales thereon began anon to grow.</l>
<l>And Libis as he went about the Ores away to throw, </l>
<l>Perceived how his hands did shrinke and were become so short,</l>
<l>That now for finnes and not for hands he might them well report.</l>
<l>Another as he would have claspt his arme about the corde:</l>
<l>Had nere an arme, and so bemaimd in bodie, over boord</l>
<l>He leapeth downe among the waves, and forked is his tayle </l>
<l>As are the homes of Phebes face when halfe hir light doth fayle.</l>
<l>They leape about and sprinkle up much water on the ship,</l>
<l>One while they swim above, and downe againe anon they slip. </l>
<l>They fetch their friskes as in a daunce, and wantonly they writhe</l>
<l>Now here now there among the waves their bodies bane and lithe. </l>
<l>And with their wide and hollow nose the water in they snuffe,</l>
<l>And by their noses out againe as fast they doe it puffe. </l>
<l>Of twentie persons (for our ship so many men did beare)</l>
<l>I only did remaine nigh straught and trembling still for feare.</l>
<l>The God could scarce recomfort me, and yet he said: Go too, </l>
<l>Feare not but saile to Dia ward. His will I gladly doe.</l>
<l>And so as soone as I came there with right devout intent,</l>
<l>His Chaplaine I became. And thus his Orgies I frequent.

<l>And other loud confused sounds of <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> drunken throngs.</l>
<l>And even as when the bloudie Trumpe doth to the battell sound,</l>
<l>The lustie horse streight neying out bestirres him on the ground,</l>
<l>And taketh courage thereupon t'assaile his emnie proud:   </l>
<l>Even so when Penthey heard afarre the noyse and howling loud</l>
<l>That <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> franticke folke did make, it set his heart on fire,</l>
<l>And kindled fiercer than before the sparks of settled ire.</l>
<l>There is a goodly plaine about the middle of the hill,</l>
<l>Environd in with Woods, where men may view eche way at will. </l>
<l>Here looking on these holie rites with lewde prophaned eyes</l>
<l>King Pentheys mother first of all hir foresaid sonne espies,</l>
<l>And like a Bedlem first of all she doth upon him runne,</l>
<l>And with hir Javeling furiously she first doth wound hir sonne.</l>
<l>Come hither sisters come, she cries, here is that mighty Bore,  </l>
<l>Here is the Bore that stroyes our fieldes, him will I strike therefore.</l>
<l>With that they fall upon him all as though they had bene mad,</l>
<l>And clustring all upon a heape fast after him they gad.</l>
<l>He quakes and shakes: his words are now become more meeke and colde:</l>
<l>He now condemnes his owne default, and sayes he was too bolde.   </l>
<l>And wounded as he was he cries: Helpe, Aunt Autonoe,</l>
<l>Now for Acteons blessed soule some mercie show to me.</l>
<l>She wist not who Acteon was, but rent without delay</l>
<l>His right hand off: and Ino tare his tother hand away.</l>
<l>To lift unto his mother tho the wretch had nere an arme:  </l>
<l>But shewing hir his maimed corse, and woundes yet bleeding warme,</l>
<l>O mother see, he sayes: with that Agaue howleth out:</l>
<l>And writhed with hir necke awrie, and shooke hir haire about.</l>
<l>And holding from his bodie tome his head in bloudie hands,</l>
<l>She cries:  fellowes in this deede our noble conquest stands.</l>
<l>No sooner could the winde have blowen the rotten leaves from trees,</l>
<l>When Winters frost hath bitten them, then did the hands of these</l>
<l>Most wicked women Pentheys limmes from one another teare.</l>
<l>The Thebanes being now by this example brought in feare,</l>
<l>Frequent this newfound sacrifice, and with sweete frankinsence   </l>
<l>God <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> Altars lode with gifts in every place doe cense.</l>

<l>Within the towne (of whose huge walles so monstrous high and thicke</l>
<l>The fame is given Semyramis for making them of bricke)</l>
<l>Dwelt hard together two yong folke in houses joynde so nere</l>
<l>That under all one roofe well nie both twaine conveyed were. </l>
<l>The name of him was Pyramus, and <placeName key="perseus,Thisbe">Thisbe</placeName> calde was she.</l>
<l>So faire a man in all the East was none alive as he,</l>
<l>Nor nere a woman, maide nor wife in beautie like to hir.</l>
<l>This neighbrod bred acquaintance first, this neyghbrod first did stirre</l>
<l>The secret sparkes, this neighbrod first an entrance in did showe, </l>
<l>For love to come to that to which it afterward did growe.</l>
<l>And if that right had taken place they had bene man and wife,</l>
<l>But still their Parents went about to let which (for their life)</l>
<l>They could not let. For both their heartes with equall flame did burne.</l>
<l>No man was privie to their thoughts. And for to serve their turne    </l>
<l>In steade of talke they used signes. The closelier they supprest -</l>
<l>The fire of love, the fiercer still it raged in their brest.</l>
<l>The wall that parted house from house had riven therein a crany</l>
<l>Which shronke at making of the wall. This fault not markt of any</l>
<l>Of many hundred yeares before (what doth not love espie)    </l>
<l>These lovers first of all found out, and made a way whereby</l>
<l>To talke togither secretly, and through the same did goe</l>
<l>Their loving whisprings verie light and safely to and fro.</l>
<l>Now as at one side <placeName key="tgn,1122641">Pyramus</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Thisbe">Thisbe</placeName> on the tother</l>
<l>Stoode often drawing one of them the pleasant breath from other: </l>
<l>O thou envious wall (they sayd) why letst thou lovers thus?</l>
<l>What matter were it if that thou permitted both of us</l>
<l>In armes eche other to embrace? Or if thou thinke that this</l>
<l>Were overmuch, yet mightest thou at least make roume to kisse.</l>
<l>And yet thou shalt not finde us churles: we thinke our selves in det </l>
<l>For this same piece of courtesie, in vouching safe to let</l>
<l>Our sayings to our friendly eares thus freely come and goe.</l>
<l>Thus having where they stoode in vaine complayned of their woe,</l>
<l>When night drew nere, they bade adew and eche gave kisses sweete</l>
<l>Unto the parget on their side, the which did never meete.</l>
<l>Next morning with hir cherefull light had driven the starres aside</l>
<l>And Phebus with his burning beames the dewie grasse had dride.</l>
<l>These lovers at their wonted place by foreappointment met.</l>
<l>Where after much complaint and mone they covenanted to get</l>
<l>Away from such as watched them and in the Evening late     </l>
<l>To steale out of their fathers house and eke the Citie gate.</l>
<l>And to th'intent that in the fieldes they strayde not up and downe</l>
<l>They did agree at Ninus Tumb to meete without the towne,</l>
<l>And tarie underneath a tree that by the same did grow</l>
<l>Which was a faire high Mulberie with fruite as white as snow,  </l>
<l>Hard by a coole and trickling spring. This bargaine pleasde them both</l>
<l>And so daylight (which to their thought away but slowly goth)</l>
<l>Did in the Ocean fall to rest, and night from thence doth rise.</l>
<l>As soone as darkenesse once was come, straight <placeName key="perseus,Thisbe">Thisbe</placeName> did devise</l>
<l>A shift to wind hir out of doores, that none that were within </l>
<l>Perceyved hir: and muffling hir with clothes about hir chin,</l>
<l>That no man might discerne hir face, to Ninus Tumb she came</l>
<l>Unto the tree, and sat hir downe there underneath the same.</l>
<l>Love made hir bold. But see the chaunce, there comes besmerde with blood</l>
<l>About the chappes a Lionesse all foming from the wood       </l>
<l>From slaughter lately made of kine to staunch hir bloudie thurst</l>
<l>With water of the foresaid spring. Whome <placeName key="perseus,Thisbe">Thisbe</placeName> spying furst,</l>
<l>Afarre by moonelight, thereupon with fearfull steppes gan flie,</l>
<l>And in a darke and yrkesome cave did hide hirselfe thereby.</l>
<l>And as she fled away for hast she let hir mantle fall       </l>
<l>The whych for feare she left behind not looking backe at all.</l>
<l>Now when the cruell Lionesse hir thurst had stanched well,</l>
<l>In going to the Wood she found the slender weede that fell</l>
<l>From Thisbe, which with bloudie teeth in pieces she did teare.</l>
<l>The night was somewhat further spent ere <placeName key="tgn,1122641">Pyramus</placeName> came there   </l>
<l>Who seeing in the suttle sande the print of Lions paw,</l>
<l>Waxt pale for feare. But when also the bloudie cloke he saw</l>
<l>All rent and tome: One night (he sayd) shall lovers two confounde,</l>
<l>Of which long life deserved she of all that live on ground.</l>
<l>My soule deserves of this mischaunce the perill for to beare.  </l>
<l>I, wretch, have bene the death of thee, which to this place of feare</l>
<l>Did cause thee in the night to come, and came not here before.</l>
<l>My wicked limmes and wretched guttes with cruell teeth therfore</l>
<l>Devour ye, O ye Lions all that in this rocke doe dwell.</l>
<l>But Cowardes use to wish for death. The slender weede that fell</l>
<l>From <placeName key="perseus,Thisbe">Thisbe</placeName> up he takes, and streight doth beare it to the tree,</l>
<l>Which was appointed erst the place of meeting for to bee.</l>
<l>And when he had bewept and kist the garment which he knew,</l>
<l>Receyve thou my bloud too (quoth he) and therewithall he drew</l>
<l>His sworde, the which among his guttes he thrust, and by and by   </l>
<l>Did draw it from the bleeding wound beginning for to die,</l>
<l>And cast himselfe upon his backe, the bloud did spin on hie</l>
<l>As when a Conduite pipe is crackt, the water bursting out</l>
<l>Doth shote it selfe a great way off and pierce the Ayre about.</l>
<l>The leaves that were upon the tree besprincled with his blood  </l>
<l>Were died blacke. The roote also bestained as it stoode,</l>
<l>A deepe darke purple colour straight upon the Berries cast.</l>
<l>Anon scarce ridded of hir feare with which she was agast,</l>
<l>For doubt of disapointing him commes <placeName key="perseus,Thisbe">Thisbe</placeName> forth in hast,</l>
<l>And for hir lover lookes about, rejoycing for to tell      </l>
<l>How hardly she had scapt that night the daunger that befell.</l>
<l>And as she knew right well the place and facion of the tree</l>
<l>(As whych she saw so late before): even so when she did see</l>
<l>The colour of the Berries turnde, she was uncertaine whither</l>
<l>It were the tree at which they both agreed to meete togither. </l>
<l>While in this doubtfull stounde she stoode, she cast hir eye aside</l>
<l>And there beweltred in his bloud hir lover she espide</l>
<l>Lie sprawling with his dying limmes: at which she started backe,</l>
<l>And looked pale as any Box, a shuddring through hir stracke,</l>
<l>Even like the Sea which sodenly with whissing noyse doth move,  </l>
<l>When with a little blast of winde it is but toucht above.</l>
<l>But when approching nearer him she knew it was hir love,</l>
<l>She beate hir brest, she shricked out, she tare hir golden heares,</l>
<l>And taking him betweene hir armes did wash his wounds with teares,</l>
<l>She meynt hir weeping with his bloud, and kissing all his face    </l>
<l>(Which now became as colde as yse) she cride in wofull case:</l>
<l>Alas what chaunce, my <placeName key="tgn,1122641">Pyramus</placeName>, hath parted thee and mee?</l>
<l>Make aunswere O my <placeName key="tgn,1122641">Pyramus</placeName>: it is thy Thisb', even shee</l>
<l>Whome thou doste love most heartely, that speaketh unto thee.</l>
<l>Give eare and rayse thy heavie heade. He hearing Thisbes name,  </l>
<l>Lift up his dying eyes and having seene hir closde the same.</l>
<l>But when she knew hir mantle there and saw his scabberd lie</l>
<l>Without the swoorde: Unhappy man thy love hath made thee die:</l>
<l>Thy love (she said) hath made thee sley thy selfe. This hand of mine</l>
<l>Is strong inough to doe the like. My love no lesse than thine  </l>
<l>Shall give me force to worke my wound. I will pursue the dead.</l>
<l>And wretched woman as I am, it shall of me be sed</l>
<l>That like as of thy death I was the only cause and blame,</l>
<l>So am I thy companion eke and partner in the same,</l>
<l>For death which only coulde alas asunder part us twaine,       </l>
<l>Shall never so dissever us but we will meete againe.</l>
<l>And you the Parentes of us both, most wretched folke alyve,</l>
<l>Let this request that I shall make in both our names bylive</l>
<l>Entreate you to permit that we whome chaste and stedfast love</l>
<l>And whome even death hath joynde in one, may as it doth behove </l>
<l>In one grave be together layd. And thou unhappie tree</l>
<l>Which shroudest now the corse of one, and shalt anon through mee</l>
<l>Shroude two, of this same slaughter holde the sicker signes for ay,</l>
<l>Blacke be the colour of thy fruite and mourning like alway,</l>
<l>Such as the murder of us twaine may evermore bewray.           </l>
<l>This said, she tooke the sword yet warme with slaughter of hir love</l>
<l>And setting it beneath hir brest, did to hir heart it shove.</l>
<l>Hir prayer with the Gods and with their Parentes tooke effect.</l>
<l>For when the frute is throughly ripe, the Berrie is bespect</l>
<l>With colour tending to a blacke. And that which after fire</l>
<l>Remained, rested in one Tumbe as <placeName key="perseus,Thisbe">Thisbe</placeName> did desire.

<l>Was tane in love. Of Phebus loves now list and you shall heare.    </l>

<l>(For everie thing in Heaven and Earth is open to his eie)</l>
<l>How Venus with the warlike <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName> advoutrie did commit.</l>
<l>It grieved him to see the fact and so discovered it,</l>

<l>In which this privie scape was done. Who was in such a case</l>
<l>That heart and hand and all did faile in working for a space.</l>
<l>Anon he featly forgde a net of Wire so fine and slight,</l>
<l>That neyther knot nor nooze therein apparant was to sight.</l>
<l>This piece of worke was much more fine than any handwarpe oofe </l>
<l>Or that whereby the Spider hanges in sliding from the roofe.</l>
<l>And furthermore the suttlenesse and slight thereof was such,</l>
<l>It followed every little pull and closde with every touch,</l>
<l>And so he set it handsomly about the haunted couch.</l>
<l>Now when that <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName> and hir mate were met in bed togither      </l>
<l>Hir husband by his newfound snare before convayed thither</l>
<l>Did snarle them both togither fast in middes of all theyr play</l>
<l>And setting ope the Ivorie doores, callde all the Gods streight way</l>
<l>To see them: they with shame inough fast lockt togither lay.</l>
<l>A certaine God among the rest disposed for to sport            </l>

<l>Dame Venus highly stomacking this great displeasure, thought</l>
<l>To be revenged on the part by whome the spight was wrought. </l>
<l>And like as he hir secret loves and meetings had bewrayd,</l>
<l>So she with wound of raging love his guerdon to him payd.</l>
<l>What now avayles (Hyperions sonne) thy forme and beautie bright?</l>
<l>What now avayle thy glistring eyes with cleare and piercing sight?</l>
<l>For thou that with thy gleames art wont all countries for to burne, </l>

<l>And thou that oughtst thy cherefull looke on all things for to shew</l>
<l>Alonly on Leucothoe doste now the same bestow.</l>
<l>Thou fastnest on that Maide alone the eyes that thou doste owe</l>

<l>Thou mindest hir so much that all the rest forgotten are.</l>
<l>Hir mother was Eurynome of all the fragrant clime</l>
<l>Of Arabie esteemde the flowre of beautie in hir time.         </l>
<l>But when hir daughter came to age the daughter past the mother</l>
<l>As far in beautie, as before the mother past all other.</l>
<l>Hir father was king Orchamus and rulde the publike weale</l>
<l>Of Persey, counted by descent the seventh from auncient Bele.</l>
<l>Far underneath the Westerne clyme of Hesperus doe runne       </l>
<l>The pastures of the firie steedes that draw the golden <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName>.</l>
<l>There are they fed with Ambrosie in stead of grasse all night</l>

<l>Their heavenly foode and night by turne his timely course doth make,</l>
<l>The God disguised in the shape of Queene Eurynome</l>
<l>Doth prease within the chamber doore of faire Leucothoe</l>
<l>His lover, whome amid twelve Maides he found by candlelight</l>
<l>Yet spinning on hir little Rocke, and went me to hir right.</l>
<l>And kissing hir as mothers use to kisse their daughters deare,</l>
<l>Saide: Maydes, withdraw your selves a while and sit not listning here.</l>
<l>I have a secret thing to talke. The Maides avoyde eche one,</l>
<l>The God then being with his love in chamber all alone,</l>
<l>Said: I am he that metes the yeare, that all things doe beholde,</l>
<l>By whome the Earth doth all things see, the Eye of all the worlde.</l>
<l>Trust me I am in love with thee. The Ladie was so nipt</l>
<l>With sodaine feare that from hir hands both rocke and spindle slipt.</l>
<l>Hir feare became hir wondrous well. He made no mo delayes,</l>

<l>Did make no outcrie nor no noyse, but helde hir pacience still,</l>
<l>And suffred him by forced powre his pleasure to fulfill.</l>
<l>Hereat did Clytie sore repine. For she beyond all measure</l>
<l>Was then enamoured of the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName>: and stung with this displeasure </l>
<l>That he another <placeName key="tgn,7003763">Leman</placeName> had, for verie spight and yre</l>
<l>She playes the blab, and doth defame Leucothoe to hir <placeName key="tgn,1130482">Syre</placeName>.</l>
<l>He cruell and unmercifull would no excuse accept,</l>
<l>But holding up hir handes to heaven when tenderly she wept,</l>
<l>And said it was the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> that did the deede against hir will:  </l>
<l>Yet like a savage beast full bent his daughter for to spill,</l>

<l>A huge great heape of heavie sand. The <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> full yll appaide</l>
<l>Did with his beames disperse the sand and made an open way</l>
<l>To bring thy buried face to light, but such a weight there lay  </l>
<l>Upon thee, that thou couldst not raise thine hand aloft againe,</l>
<l>And so a corse both voide of bloud and life thou didst remaine.</l>
<l>There never chaunst since Phaetons fire a thing that grievde so sore</l>
<l>The ruler of the winged steedes as this did. And therfore</l>
<l>He did attempt if by the force and vertue of his ray           </l>
<l>He might againe to lively heate hir frozen limmes convay.</l>
<l>But forasmuch as destenie so great attempts denies,</l>
<l>He sprincles both the corse it selfe and place wherein it lyes</l>
<l>With fragrant Nectar. And therewith bewayling much his chaunce</l>
<l>Sayd: Yet above the starrie skie thou shalt thy selfe advaunce. </l>
<l>Anon the body in this heavenly liquor steeped well</l>
<l>Did melt, and moisted all the earth with sweete and pleasant smell.</l>
<l>And by and by first taking roote among the cloddes within</l>
<l>By little and by little did with growing top begin</l>
<l>A pretie spirke of Frankinsence above the Tumbe to win.        </l>
<l>Although that Clytie might excuse hir sorrow by hir love</l>
<l>And seeme that so to play the blab hir sorrow did hir move,</l>
<l>Yet would the Author of the light resort to hir no more</l>
<l>But did withholde the pleasant sportes of Venus usde before.</l>
<l>The Nymph not able of hir selfe the franticke fume to stay,   </l>
<l>With restlesse care and pensivenesse did pine hir selfe away.</l>
<l>Bareheaded on the bare cold ground with flaring haire unkempt</l>
<l>She sate abrode both night and day: and clearly did exempt</l>
<l>Hirselfe by space of thrise three dayes from sustnance and repast</l>
<l>Save only dewe and save hir teares with which she brake hir fast.  </l>
<l>And in that while she never rose but stared on the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName></l>
<l>And ever turnde hir face to his as he his corse did runne.</l>
<l>Hir limmes stacke fast within the ground, and all hir upper part</l>
<l>Did to a pale ashcolourd herbe cleane voyde of bloud convart.</l>
<l>The floure whereof part red part white beshadowed with a blew   </l>
<l>Most like a Violet in the shape hir countnance overgrew.</l>
<l>And now (though fastned with a roote) she turnes hir to the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName></l>
<l>And keepes (in shape of herbe) the love with which she first begunne.

<l>But Bacchus is not any such. Thys arguing once made still,</l>
<l>To tell hir tale as others had Alcithoes turne was come.</l>
<l>Who with hir shettle shooting through hir web within the Loome,</l>

<l>Is now become an Adamant. So will I passe this howre</l>
<l>To shew you how the Curets were engendred of a showre:</l>
<l>Or how that Crocus and his love faire Smylax turned were     </l>
<l>To little flowres. With pleasant newes your mindes now will I chere.</l>
<l>Learne why the fountaine Salmacis diffamed is of yore,</l>
<l>Why with his waters overstrong it weakeneth men so sore</l>
<l>That whoso bathes him there commes thence a perfect man no more.</l>
<l>The operation of this Well is knowne to every wight.         </l>
<l>But few can tell the cause thereof, the which I will recite.</l>
<l>The waternymphes did nurce a sonne of Mercuries in Ide</l>
<l>Begot on Venus, in whose face such beautie did abide,</l>
<l>As well therein his father both and mother might be knowne,</l>
<l>Of whome he also tooke his name. As soone as he was growne   </l>
<l>To fiftene yeares of age, he left the Countrie where he dwelt</l>
<l>And Ida that had fostered him. The pleasure that he felt</l>
<l>To travell Countries, and to see straunge rivers with the state</l>
<l>Of forren landes, all painfulnesse of travell did abate.</l>
<l>He travelde through the lande of <placeName key="tgn,7001294">Lycie</placeName> to Carie that doth bound </l>
<l>Next unto <placeName key="tgn,7001294">Lycia</placeName>. There he saw a Poole which to the ground</l>
<l>Was Christall cleare. No fennie sedge, no barren reeke, no reede</l>
<l>Nor rush with pricking poynt was there, nor other moorish weede.</l>
<l>The water was so pure and shere a man might well have seene</l>
<l>And numbred all the gravell stones that in the bottome beene.  </l>
<l>The utmost borders from the brim environd were with clowres</l>
<l>Beclad with herbes ay fresh and greene and pleasant smelling flowres.</l>
<l>A Nymph did haunt this goodly Poole: but such a Nymph as neyther</l>
<l>To hunt, to run, nor yet to shoote, had any kinde of pleasure.</l>
<l>Of all the Waterfairies she alonly was unknowne               </l>
<l>To swift Diana. As the bruit of fame abrode hath blowne,</l>
<l>Hir sisters oftentimes would say: take lightsome Dart or bow,</l>
<l>And in some painefull exercise thine ydle time bestow.</l>
<l>But never could they hir persuade to runne, to shoote or hunt,</l>
<l>Or any other exercise as Phebes knightes are wont.            </l>
<l>Sometime hir faire welformed limbes she batheth in hir spring:</l>
<l>Sometime she downe hir golden haire with Boxen combe doth bring.</l>
<l>And at the water as a glasse she taketh counsell ay</l>
<l>How every thing becommeth hir. Erewhile in fine aray</l>
<l>On soft sweete hearbes or soft greene leaves hir selfe she nicely layes: </l>
<l>Erewhile againe a gathering flowres from place to place she strayes.</l>
<l>And (as it chaunst) the selfesame time she was a sorting gayes</l>
<l>To make a Poisie, when she first the yongman did espie,</l>
<l>And in beholding him desirde to have his companie.</l>
<l>But though she thought she stoode on thornes untill she went to him: </l>
<l>Yet went she not before she had bedect hir neat and trim,</l>
<l>And pride and peerd upon hir clothes that nothing sat awrie,</l>
<l>And framde hir countnance as might seeme most amrous to the eie.</l>
<l>Which done she thus begon: O childe most worthie for to bee</l>
<l>Estemde and taken for a God, if (as thou seemste to mee)    </l>
<l>Thou be a God, to Cupids name thy beautie doth agree.</l>
<l>Or if thou be a mortall wight, right happie folke are they,</l>
<l>By whome thou camste into this worlde, right happy is (I say)</l>
<l>Thy mother and thy sister too (if any bee): good hap</l>
<l>That woman had that was thy Nurce and gave thy mouth hir pap. </l>
<l>But farre above all other, far more blist than these is shee</l>
<l>Whome thou vouchsafest for thy wife and bedfellow for to bee.</l>
<l>Now if thou have alredy one, let me by stelth obtaine</l>
<l>That which shall pleasure both of us. Or if thou doe remaine</l>
<l>A Maiden free from wedlocke bonde, let me then be thy spouse,  </l>
<l>And let us in the bridelie bed our selves togither rouse.</l>
<l>This sed, the Nymph did hold hir peace, and therewithall the boy</l>
<l>Waxt red: he wist not what love was: and sure it was a joy</l>
<l>To see it how exceeding well his blushing him became.</l>
<l>For in his face the colour fresh appeared like the same          </l>
<l>That is in Apples which doe hang upon the Sunnie side:</l>
<l>Or Ivorie shadowed with a red: or such as is espide</l>
<l>Of white and scarlet colours mixt appearing in the Moone</l>
<l>When folke in vaine with sounding brasse would ease unto hir done.</l>
<l>When at the last the Nymph desirde most instantly but this,      </l>
<l>As to his sister brotherly to give hir there a kisse,</l>
<l>And therewithall was clasping him about the Ivorie necke:</l>
<l>Leave off (quoth he) or I am gone and leave thee at a becke</l>
<l>With all thy trickes. Then Salmacis began to be afraide,</l>
<l>And, To your pleasure leave I free this place, my friend, she sayde. </l>
<l>Wyth that she turnes hir backe as though she would have gone hir way:</l>
<l>But evermore she looketh backe, and (closely as she may)</l>
<l>She hides hir in a bushie queach, where kneeling on hir knee</l>
<l>She alwayes hath hir eye on him. He as a childe and free,</l>
<l>And thinking not that any wight had watched what he did          </l>
<l>Romes up and downe the pleasant Mede: and by and by amid</l>
<l>The flattring waves he dippes his feete, no more but first the sole</l>
<l>And to the ancles afterward both feete he plungeth whole.</l>
<l>And for to make the matter short, he tooke so great delight</l>
<l>In coolenesse of the pleasant spring, that streight he stripped quight </l>
<l>His garments from his tender skin. When Salmacis behilde</l>
<l>His naked beautie, such strong pangs so ardently hir hilde,</l>
<l>That utterly she was astraught. And even as Phebus beames</l>
<l>Against a myrrour pure and clere rebound with broken gleames:</l>
<l>Even so hir eys did sparcle fire. Scarce could she tarience make:  </l>
<l>Scarce could she any time delay hir pleasure for to take:</l>
<l>She wolde have run, and in hir armes embraced him streight way:</l>
<l>She was so far beside hir selfe, that scarsly could she stay.</l>
<l>He clapping with his hollow hands against his naked sides,</l>
<l>Into the water lithe and baine with armes displayed glydes.      </l>
<l>And rowing with his hands and legges swimmes in the water cleare:</l>
<l>Through which his bodie faire and white doth glistringly appeare,</l>
<l>As if a man an Ivorie Image or a Lillie white</l>
<l>Should overlay or close with glasse that were most pure and bright.</l>
<l>The prize is won (cride Salmacis aloud) he is mine owne.   </l>
<l>And therewithall in all post hast she having lightly throwne</l>
<l>Hir garments off, flew to the Poole and cast hir thereinto</l>
<l>And caught him fast between hir armes, for ought that he could doe:</l>
<l>Yea maugre all his wrestling and his struggling to and fro,</l>
<l>She held him still, and kissed him a hundred times and mo.  </l>
<l>And willde he nillde he with hir handes she toucht his naked brest:</l>
<l>And now on this side now on that (for all he did resist</l>
<l>And strive to wrest him from hir gripes) she clung unto him fast:</l>
<l>And wound about him like a Snake which snatched up in hast</l>
<l>And being by the Prince of Birdes borne lightly up aloft, </l>
<l>Doth writhe hir selfe about his necke and griping talants oft:</l>
<l>And cast hir taile about his wings displayed in the winde:</l>
<l>Or like as Ivie runnes on trees about the utter rinde:</l>
<l>Or as the Crabfish having caught his enmy in the Seas,</l>
<l>Doth claspe him in on every side with all his crooked cleas.</l>
<l>But Atlas Nephew still persistes, and utterly denies</l>
<l>The Nymph to have hir hoped sport: she urges him likewise.</l>
<l>And pressing him with all hir weight, fast cleaving to him still,</l>
<l>Strive, struggle, wrest and writhe (she said) thou froward boy thy fill:</l>
<l>Doe what thou canst thou shalt not scape. Ye Goddes of Heaven agree </l>
<l>That this same wilfull boy and I may never parted bee.

<l>The Gods were pliant to hir boone. The bodies of them twaine</l>
<l>Were mixt and joyned both in one. To both them did remaine</l>
<l>One countnance: like as if a man should in one barke beholde</l>
<l>Two twigges both growing into one and still togither holde.  </l>
<l>Even so when through hir hugging and hir grasping of the tother</l>
<l>The members of them mingled were and fastned both togither,</l>
<l>They were not any lenger two: but (as it were) a toy</l>
<l>Of double shape. Ye could not say it was a perfect boy</l>
<l>Nor perfect wench: it seemed both and none of both to beene.</l>
<l>Now when Hermaphroditus saw how in the water sheene</l>
<l>To which he entred in a man, his limmes were weakened so</l>
<l>That out fro thence but halfe a man he was compelde to go,</l>
<l>He lifteth up his hands and said (but not with manly reere):</l>
<l>O noble father Mercurie, and Venus mother deere,            </l>
<l>This one petition graunt your son which both your names doth beare,</l>
<l>That whoso commes within this Well may so be weakened there,</l>
<l>That of a man but halfe a man he may fro thence retire.</l>
<l>Both Parentes moved with the chaunce did stablish this desire</l>
<l>The which their doubleshaped sonne had made: and thereupon    </l>
<l>Infected with an unknowne strength the sacred spring anon.</l>
<l>Their tales did ende and Mineus daughters still their businesse plie</l>
<l>In spight of Bacchus whose high feast they breake contemptuously.</l>
<l>When on the sodaine (seeing nought) they heard about them round</l>
<l>Of tubbish Timbrels perfectly a hoarse and jarring sound,     </l>
<l>With shraming shalmes and gingling belles, and furthermore they felt</l>
<l>A cent of Saffron and of Myrrhe that verie hotly smelt.</l>
<l>And (which a man would ill beleve) the web they had begun</l>
<l>Immediatly waxt fresh and greene, the flaxe the which they spun</l>
<l>Did flourish full of Ivie leaves. And part thereof did run     </l>
<l>Abrode in Vines. The threede it selfe in braunches forth did spring.</l>
<l>Yong burgeons full of clustred grapes their Distaves forth did bring.</l>
<l>And as the web they wrought was dide a deepe darke purple hew,</l>
<l>Even so upon the painted grapes the selfesame colour grew.</l>
<l>The day was spent, and now was come the time which neyther night </l>
<l>Nor day, but even the bound of both a man may terme of right.</l>
<l>The house at sodaine seemde to shake, and all about it shine</l>
<l>With burning lampes, and glittering fires to flash before their eyen,</l>
<l>And Likenesses of ougly beastes with gastfull noyses yeld.</l>
<l>For feare whereof in smokie holes the sisters were compeld     </l>
<l>To hide their heades, one here and there another, for to shun</l>
<l>The glistring light. And while they thus in corners blindly run,</l>
<l>Upon their little pretie limmes a fine crispe filme there goes,</l>
<l>And slender finnes in stead of handes their shortned armes enclose.</l>
<l>But how they lost their former shape of certaintie to know     </l>
<l>The darknesse would not suffer them. No feathers on them grow,</l>
<l>And yet with shere and velume wings they hover from the ground</l>
<l>And when they goe about to speake they make but little sound,</l>
<l>According as their bodies give, bewayling their despight</l>
<l>By chirping shirlly to themselves. In houses they delight      </l>
<l>And not in woods: detesting day they flitter towards night:</l>
<l>Wherethrough they of the Evening late in Latin take their name,</l>
<l>And we in English language Backes or Reermice call the same.

<l>There Titius stretched out (at least) nine acres full in length,  </l>
<l>Did with his bowels feede a Grype that tare them out by strength.</l>
<l>The water fled from Tantalus that toucht his neather lip,</l>
<l>And Apples hanging over him did ever from him slip.</l>
<l>There also laborde Sisyphus that drave against the hill</l>
<l>A rolling stone that from the top came tumbling downeward still.  </l>
<l>Ixion on his restlesse wheele to which his limmes were bound</l>

<l>That like a house it keepeth off the moysting showers of rayne.  </l>

<l>Dame Ino (madnesse made hir strong) did climb this cliffe anon</l>

<l>At least wise if amid the Sea engendred erst I were</l>

<l>Neptunus graunted hir request, and by and by bereft them</l>
<l>Of all that ever mortall was. Insted wherof he left them</l>
<l>A hault and stately majestie: and altring them in hew</l>
<l>With shape and names most meete for Goddes he did them both endew.</l>
<l>Leucothoe was the mothers name, Palemon was the sonne.        </l>
<l>The Thebane Ladies following hir as fast as they could runne,</l>
<l>Did of hir feete perceive the print upon the utter stone.</l>
<l>And taking it for certaine signe that both were dead and gone,</l>
<l>In making mone for <placeName key="tgn,2078692">Cadmus</placeName> house, they wrang their hands and tare</l>
<l>Their haire, and rent their clothes, and railde on Juno out of square, </l>
<l>As nothing just, but more outragious farre than did behove</l>
<l>In so revenging of hir selfe upon hir husbands love.</l>
<l>The Goddesse Juno could not beare their railing. And in faith:</l>
<l>You also will I make to be as witnesses (she sayth)</l>
<l>Of my outragious crueltie. And so shee did in deede.  </l>
<l>For shee that loved Ino best was following hir with speede</l>
<l>Into the Sea. But as shee would hir selfe have downeward cast,</l>
<l>She could not stirre, but to the rock as nailed sticked fast.</l>
<l>The second as shee knockt hir breast, did feele hir armes wax stiffe.</l>
<l>Another as shee stretched out hir hands upon the cliffe,        </l>
<l>Was made a stone, and there stoode still ay stretching forth hir hands</l>
<l>Into the water as before. And as an other standes</l>

<l>And looke what gesture eche of them was taken in that tide,</l>

<l>He falleth groveling on his breast, and both his shankes doe growe</l>
<l>In one round spindle Bodkinwise with sharpned point below.</l>

<l>Engendred sundrie Snakes and wormes: by meanes wherof that clyme</l>

<l>Requesting that a little space of rest enjoy he might,</l>
<l>Untill such tyme as Lucifer should bring the morning gray,</l>
<l>And morning bring the lightsome Sunne that guides the cherefull day. </l>
<l>This Atlas, Japets Nephewe, was a man that did excell</l>

<l>I pray thee of thy courtesie receive mee as thy guest,</l>

<l>King Atlas called straight to minde an auncient prophesie    </l>

<l>Shall of hir fayre and precious fruite dispoyld and robbed bee.</l>
<l>And he shall be the sonne of Jove that shall enjoy the pray.</l>
<l>For feare hereof he did enclose his Orchard everie way       </l>
<l>With mightie hilles, and put an ougly Dragon in the same</l>

<l>That all thy glorious actes whereof thou doest so loudly lie </l>
<l>And Jove thy father be too farre to helpe thee at thy neede.</l>
<l>To these his wordes he added force, and went about in deede</l>

<l>Well then (quoth <placeName key="tgn,2576579">Persey</placeName>) sith thou doest mine honour set so light, </l>

<l>As huge and big as Atlas was he tourned in that stead</l>
<l>Into a mountaine: into trees his beard and locks did passe:</l>
<l>His hands and shoulders made the ridge: that part which lately was </l>
<l>His head, became the highest top of all the hill: his bones</l>

<l>And trickling teares warme from hir eyes adowne hir cheeks did flow,</l>
<l>Unwares hereat gan secret sparkes within his breast to glow.</l>
<l>His wits were straught at sight thereof and ravisht in such wise,</l>
<l>That how to hover with his wings he scarsly could devise.   </l>
<l>As soone as he had stayd himselfe: O Ladie faire (quoth hee)</l>

<l>Togither knit in lawfull bed the earnest lovers bee,</l>
<l>I pray thee tell mee what thy selfe and what this lande is named</l>
<l>And wherefore thou dost weare these Chains. The Ladie ill ashamed</l>

<l>Shee durst not speake unto a man. Had not hir handes beene staid</l>
<l>She would have hid hir bashfull face. Howbeit as she might</l>
<l>With great abundance of hir teares shee stopped up hir sight</l>

<l>To learne this matter, for bicause shee would not seeme to stand</l>
<l>In stubborne silence of hir faultes, shee tolde him what the land</l>
<l>And what she hight: and how hir mother for hir beauties sake</l>

<l>They brought not with them any help: but (as the time and cace</l>

<l>Now while that Danaes noble sonne was telling of these things</l>
<l>Amid a throng of Cepheys Lordes, through al the Pallace rings</l>
<l>A noyse of people nothing like the sound of such as sing</l>
<l>At wedding feastes, but like the rore of such as tidings bring</l>
<l>Of cruell warre. This sodaine chaunge from feasting unto fray </l>
<l>Might well be likened to the Sea: whych standing at a stay</l>
<l>The woodnesse of the windes makes rough by raising of the wave.</l>
<l>King Cepheys brother Phyney was the man that rashly gave</l>
<l>The first occasion of this fray. Who shaking in hys hand</l>
<l>A Dart of Ash with head of steele, sayd: Loe: loe here I stand  </l>
<l>To chalenge thee that wrongfully my ravisht spouse doste holde.</l>
<l>Thy wings nor yet thy forged Dad in shape of feyned golde</l>
<l>Shall now not save thee from my handes. As with that word he bent</l>
<l>His arme aloft, the foresaid Dart at <placeName key="tgn,2576579">Persey</placeName> to have sent,</l>
<l>What doste thou brother (Cephey cride) what madnesse moves thy minde </l>
<l>To doe so foule a deede? is this the friendship he shall finde</l>
<l>Among us for his good deserts? And wilt thou needes requite</l>
<l>The saving of thy Neeces life with such a foule despight?</l>
<l>Whome Persey hath not from thee tane: but (if thou be advisde)</l>
<l>But Neptunes heavie wrath bicause his Sea nymphes were despisde: </l>
<l>But horned <placeName key="tgn,2083320">Hammon</placeName>: but the beast which from the Sea arrived</l>
<l>On my deare bowels for to feede. That time wert thou deprived</l>
<l>Of thy betroothed, when hir life upon the losing stoode:</l>
<l>Onlesse perchaunce to see hir lost it woulde have done thee good,</l>
<l>And easde thy heart to see me sad. And may it not suffice</l>
<l>That thou didst see hir to the rocke fast bound before thine eyes</l>
<l>And didst not helpe hir beyng both hir husband and hir Eame?</l>
<l>Onlesse thou grudge that any man should come within my Realme</l>
<l>To save hir life, and seeke to rob him of his just rewarde?</l>
<l>Which if thou thinke to be so great, thou shouldst have had regarde  </l>
<l>Before, to fetch it from the rocke to which thou sawste it bound.</l>
<l>I pray thee, brother, seeing that by him the meanes is found</l>
<l>That in mine age without my childe I go not to the grounde,</l>
<l>Permit him to enjoy the price for which we did compounde,</l>
<l>And which he hath by due desert of purchace deerely bought.  </l>
<l>For brother, let it never sinke nor enter in thy thought</l>
<l>That I set more by him than thee: but this may well be sed</l>
<l>I rather had to give hir him than see my daughter dead.</l>
<l>He gave him not a worde againe: but looked eft on him,</l>
<l>And eft on <placeName key="tgn,2576579">Persey</placeName> irefully with countnance stoure and grim, </l>
<l>Not knowing which were best to hit: and after little stay</l>
<l>He shooke his Dart, and flung it forth with all the powre and sway</l>
<l>That Anger gave at Perseys head. But harme it did him none,</l>
<l>It sticked in the Bedsteddes head that <placeName key="tgn,2576579">Persey</placeName> sate upon.</l>
<l>Then <placeName key="tgn,2576579">Persey</placeName> sternely starting up and pulling out the Dart</l>
<l>Did throw it at his foe agayne, and therewithall his hart</l>
<l>Had cliven asunder, had he not behinde an Altar start.</l>
<l>The Altar (more the pitie was) did save the wicked wight.</l>
<l>Yet threw he not the Dart in vaine: it hit one Rhetus right</l>
<l>Amid the foreheade: who therewith sanke downe, and when the steele </l>
<l>Was plucked out, he sprawlde about and spurned with his heele,</l>
<l>And all berayd the boorde with bloud. Then all the other rout</l>
<l>As fierce as fire flang Dartes: and some there were that cried out</l>
<l>That Cephey with his sonne in lawe was worthy for to die.</l>
<l>But he had wound him out of doores protesting solemly         </l>
<l>As he was just and faithfull Prince, and swearing eke by all</l>
<l>The Gods of Hospitalitie, that that same broyle did fall</l>
<l>Full sore against his will. At hand was warlie Pallas streight</l>
<l>And shadowed <placeName key="tgn,2576579">Persey</placeName> with hir shielde, and gave him heart in feight.</l>
<l>There was one Atys borne in <placeName key="tgn,7000198">Inde</placeName>, (of faire Lymniace          </l>
<l>The River Ganges daughter thought the issue for to be),</l>
<l>Of passing beautie which with rich aray he did augment.</l>
<l>He ware that day a scarlet Cloke, about the which there went</l>
<l>A garde of golde: a cheyne of golde he ware about his necke:</l>
<l>And eke his haire perfumde with Myrrhe a costly crowne did decke. </l>
<l>Full sixtene yeares he was of age: such cunning skill he coulde</l>
<l>In darting, as to hit his marke farre distant when he would.</l>
<l>Yet how to handle Bow and shaftes much better did he know.</l>
<l>Now as he was about that time to bende his horned Bowe,</l>
<l>A firebrand Persey raught that did upon the Aultar smoke,    </l>
<l>And dasht him overtwhart the face with such a violent stroke,</l>
<l>That all bebattred was his head, the bones asunder broke.</l>
<l>When Lycabas of <placeName key="tgn,6000442">Assur</placeName> lande, his moste assured friend</l>
<l>And deare companion, being no dissembler of his miend,</l>
<l>Which most entierly did him love, behelde him on the ground   </l>
<l>Lie weltring with disfigurde face, and through that grievous wound</l>
<l>Now gasping out his parting ghost, his death he did lament,</l>
<l>And taking hastly up the Bow that Atys erst had bent:</l>
<l>Encounter thou with me (he saide) thou shalt not long enjoy</l>
<l>Thy triumphing in braverie thus, for killing of this boy,     </l>
<l>By which thou getst more spight than praise. All this was scarsly sed,</l>
<l>But that the arrow from the string went streyned to the head.</l>
<l>Howbeit Persey (as it hapt) so warely did it shunne,</l>
<l>As that it in his coteplights hung. Then to him did he runne</l>
<l>With Harpe in his hand bestaind with grim Medusas blood,      </l>
<l>And thrust him through the brest therwith. He quothing as he stood</l>
<l>Did looke about where Atys lay with dim and dazeling eyes,</l>
<l>Now waving under endlesse night: and downe by him he lies,</l>
<l>And for to comfort him withall togither with him dies.

<l>Behold through gredie haste to feight one Phorbas, Methions son,   </l>
<l>A Swevite: and of Lybie lande one callde Amphimedon</l>
<l>By fortune sliding in the blood with which the ground was wet,</l>
<l>Fell downe: and as they woulde have rose, Perseus fauchon met</l>
<l>With both of them. Amphimedon upon the ribbes he smote,</l>
<l>And with the like celeritie he cut me Phorbas throte.         </l>
<l>But unto <placeName key="tgn,1004440">Erith</placeName>, Actors sonne, that in his hand did holde</l>
<l>A brode browne Bill, with his short sword he durst not be too bolde</l>
<l>To make approch. With both his handes a great and massie cup</l>
<l>Embost with cunning portrayture aloft he taketh up,</l>
<l>And sendes it at him. He spewes up red bloud: and falling downe o </l>
<l>Upon his backe, against the ground doth knocke his dying crowne.</l>
<l>Then downe he Polydemon throwes, extract of royall race,</l>
<l>And Abaris the Scithian, and Clytus in like case,</l>
<l>And Elice with his unshorne lockes, and also Phlegias,</l>
<l>And Lycet, olde Sperchesies sonne, with divers other mo,     </l>
<l>That on the heapes of corses slaine he treades as he doth go.</l>
<l>And Phyney daring not presume to meet his foe at hand,</l>
<l>Did cast a Dart: which hapt to light on Idas who did stand</l>
<l>Aloofe as neuter (though in vaine) not medling with the Fray.</l>
<l>Who casting backe a frowning looke at Phyney, thus did say:  </l>
<l>Sith whether that I will or no compeld I am perforce</l>
<l>To take a part, have Phyney here him whome thou doste enforce</l>
<l>To be thy foe, and with this wound my wrongfull wound requite.</l>
<l>But as he from his body pullde the Dart, with all his might</l>
<l>To throw it at his foe againe, his limmes so feebled were</l>
<l>With losse of bloud, that downe he fell and could not after steare.</l>
<l>There also lay Odites slaine the chiefe in all the land</l>
<l>Next to King Cephey, put to death by force of Clymens hand.</l>
<l>Protenor was by Hypsey killde, and Lyncide did as much</l>
<l>For Hypsey. In the throng there was an auncient man and such    </l>
<l>A one as loved righteousnesse and greatly feared God:</l>
<l>Emathion called was his name: whome sith his yeares forbad </l>
<l>To put on armes, he feights with tongue, inveying earnestly</l>
<l>Against that wicked war the which he banned bitterly.</l>
<l>As on the Altar he himselfe with quivering handes did stay,  </l>
<l>One Cromis tipped off his head: his head cut off streight way</l>
<l>Upon the Altar fell, and there his tongue not fully dead</l>
<l>Did bable still the banning wordes the which it erst had sed,</l>
<l>And breathed forth his fainting ghost among the burning brandes.</l>
<l>Then Brote and Hammon brothers, twins, stout champions of their hands  </l>
<l>In wrestling Pierlesse (if so be that wrestling could sustaine</l>
<l>The furious force of slicing swordes) were both by Phyney slaine.</l>
<l>And so was Alphit, Ceres Priest, that ware upon his crowne</l>
<l>A stately Miter faire and white with Tables hanging downe.</l>
<l>Thou also Japets sonne for such affaires as these unmeete          </l>
<l>But meete to tune thine instrument with voyce and Ditie sweete,</l>
<l>The worke of peace, wert thither callde th'assemblie to rejoyce</l>
<l>And for to set the mariage forth with pleasant singing voyce.</l>
<l>As with his Violl in his hand he stoode a good way off,</l>
<l>There commeth to him Petalus and sayes in way of scoffe:           </l>
<l>Go sing the resdue to the ghostes about the Stygian Lake,</l>
<l>And in the left side of his heade his dagger poynt he strake.</l>
<l>He sanke downe deade with fingers still yet warbling on the string</l>
<l>And so mischaunce knit up with wo the song that he did sing.</l>
<l>But fierce Lycormas could not beare to see him murdred so          </l>
<l>Without revengement. Up he caught a mightie Leaver tho</l>
<l>That wonted was to barre the doore a right side of the house</l>
<l>And therewithall to Petalus he lendeth such a souse</l>
<l>Full in the noddle of the necke, that like a snetched Oxe</l>
<l>Streight tumbling downe, against the ground his groveling face he knox. </l>
<l>And Pelates, a Garamant, attempted to have caught</l>
<l>The left doore barre: but as thereat with stretched hand he raught,</l>
<l>One Coryt, sonne of Marmarus did with a Javelin stricke</l>
<l>Him through the hand, that to the wood fast nayled did it sticke.</l>
<l>As Pelates stoode fastned thus, one Abas goard his side:           </l>
<l>He could not fall, but hanging still upon the poste there dide</l>
<l>Fast nayled by the hand. And there was overthrowne a Knight</l>
<l>Of Perseyes band callde Melaney, and one that Dorill hight,</l>
<l>A man of greatest landes in all the Realme of Nasamone.</l>
<l>That occupide so large a grounde as Dorill was there none,         </l>
<l>' Nor none that had such store of come. There came a Dart askew</l>
<l>And lighted in his Coddes, the place where present death doth sew.</l>
<l>When Alcion of Barcey, he that gave this deadly wound,</l>
<l>Beheld him yesking forth his ghost and falling to the ground</l>
<l>With watrie eyes the white turnde up: Content thy selfe, he said,  </l>
<l>With that same litle plot of grounde whereon thy corse is layde,</l>
<l>In steade of all the large fat fieldes which late thou didst possesse.</l>
<l>And with that word he left him dead. Perseus to redresse</l>
<l>This slaughter and this spightfull taunt, streight snatched out the Dart</l>
<l>That sticked in the fresh warme wound, and with an angrie hart  </l>
<l>Did send it at the throwers head: the Dart did split his nose</l>
<l>Even in the middes, and at his necke againe the head out goes:</l>
<l>So that it peered both the wayes. Whiles fortune doth support</l>
<l>And further Persey thus, he killes (but yet in sundrie sort)</l>
<l>Two brothers by the mother: t'one callde Clytie, tother <placeName key="tgn,1002316">Dane</placeName>.  </l>
<l>For on a Dart through both his thighes did Clytie take his bane:</l>
<l>And Danus with another Dart was striken in the mouth.</l>
<l>There died also Celadon, a Gypsie of the South:</l>
<l>And so did bastard Astrey too, whose mother was a Jew:</l>
<l>And sage Ethion well foreseene in things that should ensew,  </l>
<l>But utterly beguilde as then by Birdes that aukly flew.</l>
<l>King Cepheyes harnessebearer callde Thoactes lost his life,</l>
<l>And Agyrt whom for murdring late his father with a knife</l>
<l>The worlde spake shame of. Nathelesse much more remainde behinde</l>
<l>Than was dispatched out of hand: for all were full in minde  </l>
<l>To murder one. The wicked throng had sworne to spend their blood</l>
<l>Against the right, and such a man as had deserved good.</l>
<l>A tother side (although in vaine) of mere affection stood</l>
<l>The Father and the Motherinlaw, and eke the heavie bride,</l>
<l>Who filled with their piteous playnt the Court on everie side.  </l>
<l>But now the clattring of the swordes and harnesse at that tide</l>
<l>With grievous grones and sighes of such as wounded were or dide,</l>
<l>Did raise up such a cruell rore that nothing could be heard.</l>
<l>For fierce <placeName key="tgn,7016338">Bellona</placeName> so renewde the battell afterward,</l>
<l>That all the house did swim in blood. Duke Phyney with a rout  </l>
<l>Of moe than of a thousand men environd round about</l>
<l>The valiant <placeName key="tgn,2576579">Persey</placeName> all alone. The Dartes of Phyneys bande</l>
<l>Came thicker than the Winters hayle doth fall upon the lande,</l>
<l>By both his sides, his eyes and eares. He warely thereupon</l>
<l>Withdrawes, and leanes his backe against a huge great arche of stone: </l>
<l>And being safe behind, he settes his face against his foe</l>
<l>Withstanding all their fierce assaultes. There did assaile him thoe</l>
<l>Upon the left side Molpheus, a Prince of Choanie.</l>
<l>And on the right Ethemon, borne hard by in Arabie.</l>
<l>Like as the <placeName key="tgn,7023806">Tyger</placeName> when he heares the lowing out of Neate     </l>
<l>In sundrie Medes, enforced sore through abstinence from meate,</l>
<l>Would faine be doing with them both, and can not tell at which</l>
<l>Were best to give adventure first: so <placeName key="tgn,2576579">Persey</placeName> who did itch</l>
<l>To be at host with both of them, and doubtfull whether side</l>
<l>To turne him on, the right or left, upon advantage spide     </l>
<l>Did wound me Molphey on the leg, and from him quight him drave.</l>
<l>He was contented with his flight: for why Ethemon gave</l>
<l>No respite to him to pursue: but like a franticke man</l>
<l>Through egernesse to wounde his necke, without regarding whan</l>
<l>Or how to strike for haste, he burst his brittle sworde in twaine  </l>
<l>Against the Arche: the poynt whereof rebounding backe againe,</l>
<l>Did hit himselfe upon the throte. Howbeit that same wound</l>
<l>Was unsufficient for to sende Ethemon to the ground.</l>
<l>He trembled holding up his handes for mercie, but in vaine,</l>
<l>For Persey thrust him through the heart with Hermes hooked skaine.

<l>But when he saw that valiantnesse no lenger could avayle,</l>
<l>By reason of the multitude that did him still assayle:</l>
<l>Sith you your selves me force to call mine enmie to mine ayde,</l>
<l>I will do so: if any friend of mine be here (he sayd)</l>
<l>Sirs, turne your faces all away: and therewithall he drew    </l>

<l>And sayd: Go seeke some other man whome thou mayst make abasht</l>
<l>With these thy foolish juggling toyes. And as he would have dasht</l>
<l>His Javeling in him with that worde to kill him out of hand,</l>
<l>With gesture throwing forth his Dart all Marble did he stand.  </l>
<l>His sworde through Lyncids noble heart had Amphix thought to shove:</l>
<l>His hand was stone, and neyther one nor other way could move:</l>
<l>But Niley who did vaunt himselfe to be the Rivers sonne</l>

<l>Ye would have thought him speaking still with open mouth: but sound  </l>
<l>Did none forth passe: there was for speache no passage to be found.</l>
<l>Rebuking them cries <placeName key="tgn,7003948">Eryx</placeName>: Sirs, it is not Gorgons face,</l>

<l>While all amazde Astyages stoode wondring at the thing,</l>
<l>The selfesame nature on himselfe the Gorgons head did bring.   </l>
<l>And in his visage which was stone a countnance did remaine</l>
<l>Of wondring still. A wearie worke it were to tell you plaine</l>

<l>Did scape unslaine: but none of them did go alive away.</l>

<l>But now (alas) what remedie? he saw there stand before</l>
<l>His face, his men like Images in sundrie shapes all stone.</l>
<l>He knew them well, and by their names did call them everychone:  </l>
<l>Desiring them to succor him: and trusting not his sight</l>
<l>He feeles the bodies that were next, and all were Marble quight.</l>
<l>He turnes himselfe from <placeName key="tgn,2576579">Persey</placeName> ward and humbly as he standes</l>

<l>Put up that monstruous shield of thine: put up that Gorgons head</l>
<l>That into stones transformeth men: put up, I thee desire.</l>
<l>Not hatred, nor bicause to reigne as King I did aspire,</l>

<l>The better title seemeth thine bicause of thy desert:</l>

<l>Hir brother <placeName key="tgn,2576579">Persey</placeName> companie, till now that she did stie</l>
<l>From Seriph in a hollow cloud, and leaving on the right      </l>
<l>The Iles of Scyre and Gyaros, she made from thence hir flight</l>
<l>Directly over that same Sea as neare as eye could ame</l>
<l>To Thebe and <placeName key="tgn,2060629">Mount Helicon</placeName>, and when she thither came,</l>
<l>She stayde hir selfe, and thus bespake the learned sisters nine:</l>
<l>A rumor of an uncouth spring did pierce these eares of mine   </l>
<l>The which the winged stede shouldmake by stamping with his hoofe.</l>
<l>This is the cause of my repaire: I would for certaine proofe</l>
<l>Be glad to see the wondrous thing. For present there I stoode</l>
<l>And saw the selfesame Pegasus spring of his mothers blood.</l>
<l>Dame Uranie did entertaine and aunswere Pallas thus:</l>
<l>What cause so ever moves your grace to come and visit us,</l>
<l>Most heartely you welcome are: and certaine is the fame</l>
<l>Of this our Spring, that Pegasus was causer of the same.</l>
<l>And with that worde she led hir forth to see the sacred spring.</l>
<l>Who musing greatly with hir selfe at straungenesse of the thing,    </l>
<l>Surveyde the Woodes and groves about of auncient stately port.</l>
<l>And when she saw the Bowres to which the Muses did resort,</l>
<l>And pleasant fields beclad with herbes of sundrie hew and sort,</l>
<l>She said that for their studies sake they were in happie cace</l>
<l>And also that to serve their turne they had so trim a place.  </l>
<l>Then one of them replied thus: O noble Ladie who</l>
<l>(But that your vertue greater workes than these are calles you to)</l>
<l>Should else have bene of this our troupe, your saying is full true.</l>
<l>To this our trade of life and place is commendation due.</l>
<l>And sure we have a luckie lot and if the world were such </l>
<l>As that we might in safetie live, but lewdnesse reignes so much</l>
<l>That all things make us Maides afraide. Me thinkes I yet do see</l>
<l>The wicked Tyran Pyren still: my heart is yet scarce free</l>
<l>From that same feare with which it hapt us flighted for to bee.</l>
<l>This cruell Pyren was of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> and with his men of war       </l>
<l>The land of Phocis had subdude, and from this place not far</l>
<l>Within the Citie Dawlis reignde by force of wrongfull hand,</l>
<l>One day to Phebus Temples warde that on Parnasus stand</l>
<l>As we were going, in our way he met us courteously,</l>
<l>And by the name of Goddesses saluting reverently              </l>
<l>Said: O ye Dames of Meonie (for why he knew us well)</l>
<l>I pray you stay and take my hou.e untill this storme (there fell</l>
<l>That time a tempest and a showre) be past: the Gods aloft</l>
<l>Have entred smaller sheddes than mine full many a time and oft.</l>
<l>The rainie wether and hys wordes so moved us, that wee       </l>
<l>To go into an outer house of his did all agree.</l>
<l>As soone as that the showre was past and heaven was voyded cleare</l>
<l>Of all the Cloudes which late before did every where appeare,</l>
<l>Until that Boreas had subdude the rainie Southerne winde,</l>
<l>We woulde have by and by bene gone. He shet the doores in minde </l>
<l>To ravish us: but we with wings escaped from his hands.</l>
<l>He purposing to follow us, upon a Turret stands,</l>
<l>And sayth he needes will after us the same way we did flie.</l>
<l>And with that worde full frantickly he leapeth downe from hie,</l>
<l>And pitching evelong on his face the bones asunder crasht,  </l>
<l>And dying, all abrode the ground his wicked bloud bedasht.</l>
<l>Now as the Muse was telling this, they heard a noyse of wings</l>
<l>And from the leavie boughes aloft a sound of greeting rings.</l>
<l>Minerva looking up thereat demaunded whence the sounde</l>
<l>Of tongues that so distinctly spake did come so plaine and rounde? </l>
<l>She thought some woman or some man had greeted hir that stounde.</l>
<l>It was a flight of Birdes. Nyne Pies bewailing their mischaunce</l>
<l>In counterfetting everie thing from bough to bough did daunce.</l>
<l>As Pallas wondred at the sight, the Muse spake thus in summe:</l>
<l>These also being late ago in chalenge overcome,</l>
<l>Made one kinde more of Birdes than was of auncient time beforne.</l>
<l>In Macedone they were about the Citie Pella borne</l>
<l>Of Pierus, a great riche Chuffe, and Euip, who by ayde</l>
<l>Of strong Lucina travailing nine times, nine times was laide</l>
<l>Of daughters in hir childbed safe. This fond and foolish rout</l>
<l>Of doltish sisters taking pride and waxing verie stout,</l>
<l>Bicause they were in number nine came flocking all togither</l>
<l>Through all the townes of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessalie</placeName> and all Achaia hither,</l>
<l>And us with these or such like wordes to combate did provoke.</l>
<l>Cease off, ye Thespian Goddesses, to mocke the simple folke  </l>
<l>With fondnesse of your Melodie. And if ye thinke in deede</l>
<l>Ye can doe ought, contend with us and see how you shall speede.</l>
<l>I warrant you ye passe us not in cunning nor in voyce.</l>
<l>Ye are here nine, and so are we. We put you to the choyce,</l>
<l>That eyther we will vanquish you and set you quight beside   </l>
<l>Your fountaine made by Pegasus which is your chiefest pride,</l>
<l>And Aganippe too: or else confounde you us, and we</l>
<l>Of all the woods of Macedone will dispossessed be</l>
<l>As farre as snowie Peonie: and let the Nymphes be Judges.</l>
<l>Now in good sooth it was a shame to cope with suchie Drudges, </l>
<l>But yet more shame it was to yeeld. The chosen Nymphes did sweare</l>
<l>By <placeName key="tgn,1130355">Styx</placeName>, and sate them downe on seates of stone that growed there.</l>
<l>Then streight without commission or election of the rest,</l>
<l>The formost of them preasing forth undecently, profest</l>
<l>The chalenge to performe: and song the battels of the Goddes.    </l>
<l>She gave the Giants all the praise, the honor and the oddes,</l>
<l>Abasing sore the worthie deedes of all the Gods. She telles</l>
<l>How Typhon issuing from the earth and from the deepest helles,</l>
<l>Made all the Gods above afraide, so greatly that they fled</l>
<l>And never staide till Aegypt land and <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> whose streame is shed   </l>
<l>In channels seven, received them forwearied all togither:</l>
<l>And how the Helhound Typhon did pursue them also thither.</l>
<l>By meanes wherof the Gods eche one were faine themselves to hide</l>
<l>In forged shapes. She saide that Jove the Prince of Gods was wride</l>
<l>In shape of Ram: which is the cause that at this present tide  </l>
<l>Joves ymage which the Lybian folke by name of Hammon serve,</l>
<l>Is made with crooked welked homes that inward still doe terve:</l>
<l>That <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> in a Raven lurkt, and <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> in a Geate,</l>
<l>And Phebus sister in a Cat, and <placeName key="tgn,2075297">Juno</placeName> in a Neate,</l>
<l>And Venus in the shape of Fish, and how that last of all      </l>
<l>Mercurius hid him in a Bird which Ibis men doe call.</l>
<l>This was the summe of all the tale which she with rolling tung</l>
<l>And yelling throteboll to hir harpe before us rudely sung.</l>
<l>Our turne is also come to speake, but that perchaunce your grace</l>
<l>To give the hearing to our song hath now no time nor space.   </l>
<l>Yes yes (quoth Pallas) tell on forth in order all your tale:</l>
<l>And downe she sate among the trees which gave a pleasant swale.</l>
<l>The Muse made aunswere thus: To one Calliope here by name</l>
<l>This chalenge we committed have and ordring of the same.</l>
<l>Then rose up faire Calliope with goodly bush of heare</l>
<l>Trim wreathed up with yvie leaves, and with hir thumbe gan steare</l>
<l>The quivering strings, to trie them if they were in tune or no.</l>
<l>Which done, she playde upon hir Lute and song hir Ditie so:

<l>Dame Ceres first to breake the Earth with plough the maner found,</l>
<l>She first made come and stover soft to grow upon the ground, </l>
<l>She first made lawes: for all these things we are to Ceres bound.</l>
<l>Of hir must I as now intreate: would God I could resound</l>
<l>Hir worthie laude: she doubtlesse is a Goddesse worthie praise.</l>
<l>Bicause the Giant Typhon gave presumptuously assayes</l>
<l>To conquer Heaven, the howgie Ile of Trinacris is layd      </l>
<l>Upon his limmes, by weight whereof perforce he downe is weyde.</l>

<l>But on his right hand toward Rome Pelorus standes aloft:</l>
<l>Pachynnus standes upon his left: his legs with Lilybie</l>
<l>Are pressed downe: his monstrous head doth under <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName> lie.  </l>
<l>From whence he lying bolt upright with wrathfull mouth doth spit</l>
<l>Out flames of fire. He wrestleth oft and walloweth for to wit</l>
<l>And if he can remove the weight of all that mightie land</l>

<l>By meanes whereof it commes to passe that oft the Earth doth shake: </l>
<l>And even the King of Ghostes himselfe for verie feare doth quake,</l>
<l>Misdoubting lest the Earth should clive so wide that light of day</l>
<l>Might by the same pierce downe to Hell and there the Ghostes affray.</l>
<l>Forecasting this, the Prince of Fiendes forsooke his darksome hole,</l>
<l>And in a Chariot drawen with Steedes as blacke as any cole  </l>
<l>The whole foundation of the Ile of Sicill warely vewde.</l>
<l>When throughly he had sercht eche place that harme had none ensewde,</l>
<l>As carelessly he raungde abrode, he chaunced to be seene</l>
<l>Of Venus sitting on hir hill: who taking streight betweene</l>
<l>Hir armes hir winged Cupid, said: My sonne, mine only stay,  </l>
<l>My hand, mine honor and my might, go take without delay</l>
<l>Those tooles which all wightes do subdue, and strike them in the hart</l>
<l>Of that same God that of the world enjoyes the lowest part.</l>
<l>The Gods of Heaven, and Jove himselfe, the powre of Sea and Land</l>
<l>And he that rules the powres on Earth obey thy mightie hand:  </l>
<l>And wherefore then should only Hell still unsubdued stand?</l>
<l>Thy mothers Empire and thine own why doste thou not advaunce?</l>
<l>The third part of al the world now hangs in doubtful chaunce.</l>
<l>And yet in heaven too now, their deedes thou seest me faine to beare.</l>

<l>For that is all hir hope, and marke whereat she mindes to shoote.   </l>
<l>But thou (if ought this gracious turne our honor may promote,</l>

<l>This Damsell to hir uncle joyne. No sooner had she tolde</l>
<l>These wordes, but Cupid opening streight his quiver chose therefro</l>
<l>One arrow (as his mother bade) among a thousand mo.         </l>
<l>But such a one it was, as none more sharper was than it,</l>
<l>Nor none went streighter from the Bow the amed marke to hit.</l>
<l>He set his knee against his Bow and bent it out of hande,</l>
<l>And made his forked arrowes steale in Plutos heart to stande.</l>

<l>A wood environs everie side the water round about,</l>
<l>And with his leaves as with a veyle doth keepe the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> heate out.</l>
<l>The boughes doe yeelde a coole fresh Ayre: the moystnesse of the grounde</l>

<l>The Ladie with a wailing voyce afright did often call</l>
<l>Hir Mother and hir waiting Maides, but Mother most of all.</l>
<l>And as she from the upper part hir garment would have rent,</l>
<l>By chaunce she let hir lap slip downe, and out hir flowres went.  </l>

<l>Betweene the fountaines of Cyane and <placeName key="tgn,5004303">Arethuse</placeName> of Pise</l>
<l>An arme of Sea that meetes enclosde with narrow homes there lies.</l>
<l>Of this the Poole callde Cyane which beareth greatest fame</l>
<l>Among the Nymphes of Sicilie did algates take the name.</l>
<l>Who vauncing hir unto the waste amid hir Poole did know      </l>
<l>Dame Proserpine, and said to Dis: Ye shall no further go:</l>
<l>You cannot Ceres sonneinlawe be, will she so or no.</l>
<l>You should have sought hir courteously and not enforst hir so.</l>
<l>And if I may with great estates my simple things compare,</l>
<l>Anapus was in love with me: but yet he did not fare</l>
<l>As you doe now with Proserpine. He was content to woo</l>
<l>And I unforst and unconstreind consented him untoo.</l>
<l>This said, she spreaded forth hir armes and stopt him of his way.</l>
<l>His hastie wrath Saturnus sonne no lenger then could stay.</l>
<l>But chearing up his dreadfull Steedes did smight his royall mace   </l>
<l>With violence in the bottome of the Poole in that same place.</l>
<l>The ground streight yeelded to his stroke and made him way to Hell,</l>
<l>And downe the open gap both horse and Chariot headlong fell.</l>
<l>Dame Cyan taking sore to heart as well the ravishment</l>
<l>Of Proserpine against hir will, as also the contempt </l>
<l>Against hir fountaines priviledge, did shrowde in secret hart</l>
<l>An inward corsie comfortlesse, which never did depart</l>
<l>Untill she melting into teares consumde away with smart.</l>
<l>The selfesame waters of the which she was but late ago</l>
<l>The mighty Goddesse, now she pines and wastes hirselfe into.  </l>
<l>Ye might have seene hir limmes wex lithe, ye might have bent hir bones.</l>
<l>Hir nayles wext soft: and first of all did melt the smallest ones:</l>
<l>As haire and fingars, legges and feete: for these same slender parts</l>
<l>Doe quickly into water turne, and afterward converts</l>
<l>To water, shoulder, backe, brest, side: and finally in stead  </l>
<l>Of lively bloud, within hir veynes corrupted there was spred</l>
<l>Thinne water: so that nothing now remained whereupon</l>
<l>Ye might take holde, to water all consumed was anon.</l>
<l>The carefull mother in the while did seeke hir daughter deare</l>
<l>Through all the world both Sea and Land, and yet was nere the neare.  </l>
<l>The Morning with hir deawy haire hir slugging never found,</l>
<l>Nor yet the Evening star that brings the night upon the ground.</l>
<l>Two seasoned Pynetrees at the mount of <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName> did she light</l>
<l>And bare them restlesse in hir handes through all the dankish night.</l>
<l>Againe as soone as chierfull day did dim the starres, she sought     </l>
<l>Hir daughter still from East to West. And being overwrought</l>
<l>She caught a thirst: no liquor yet had come within hir throte.</l>
<l>By chaunce she spied nere at hand a pelting thatched Cote</l>
<l>Wyth peevish doores: she knockt thereat, and out there commes a trot.</l>
<l>The Goddesse asked hir some drinke and she denide it not:            </l>
<l>But out she brought hir by and by a draught of merrie go downe</l>
<l>And therewithall a Hotchpotch made of steeped Barlie browne</l>
<l>And Flaxe and Coriander seede and other simples more</l>
<l>The which she in an Earthen pot together sod before.</l>
<l>While Ceres was a eating this, before hir gazing stood </l>
<l>A hard faaste boy, a shrewde pert wag, that could no maners good:</l>
<l>He laughed at hir and in scorne did call hir greedie gut.</l>
<l>The Goddesse being wroth therewith, did on the Hotchpotch put</l>
<l>The liquor ere that all was eate, and in his face it threw.</l>
<l>Immediatly the skinne thereof became of speckled hew,                </l>
<l>And into legs his armes did turne: and in his altred hide</l>
<l>A wrigling tayle streight to his limmes was added more beside.</l>
<l>And to th'intent he should not have much powre to worken scathe,</l>
<l>His bodie in a little roume togither knit she hathe.</l>
<l>For as with pretie Lucerts he in facion doth agree:                  </l>
<l>So than the Lucert somewhat lesse in every poynt is he.</l>
<l>The poore old woman was amazde: and bitterly she wept:</l>
<l>She durst not touche the uncouth worme, who into corners crept.</l>
<l>And of the flecked spottes like starres that on his hide are set</l>
<l>A name agreeing thereunto in Latine doth he get.                     </l>
<l>It is our Swift whose skinne with gray and yellow specks is fret.</l>
<l>What Lands and Seas the Goddesse sought it were too long to saine.</l>
<l>The worlde did want. And so she went to Sicill backe againe.</l>
<l>And as in going every where she serched busily,</l>
<l>She also came to Cyane: who would assuredly                </l>
<l>Have tolde hir all things, had she not transformed bene before.</l>
<l>But mouth and tongue for uttrance now would serve hir turne no more.</l>
<l>Howbeit a token manifest she gave hir for to know</l>
<l>What was become of Proserpine. Her girdle she did show</l>
<l>Still hovering on hir holie poole, which slightly from hir fell  </l>
<l>As she that way did passe: and that hir mother knew too well.</l>
<l>For when she saw it, by and by as though she had but than</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,1052372">Bene</placeName> new advertisde of hir chaunce, she piteously began</l>
<l>To rend hir ruffled haire, and beate hir handes against hir brest.</l>
<l>As yet she knew not where she was. But yet with rage opprest, </l>
<l>She curst all landes, and said they were unthankfull everychone,</l>
<l>Yea and unworthy of the fruites bestowed them upon.</l>
<l>But bitterly above the rest she banned Sicilie,</l>
<l>In which the mention of hir losse she plainely did espie.</l>
<l>And therefore there with cruell hand the earing ploughes she brake, </l>
<l>And man and beast that tilde the grounde to death in anger strake.</l>
<l>She marrde the seede, and eke forbade the fieldes to yeelde their frute.</l>
<l>The plenteousnesse of that same lie of which there went suche bruit</l>
<l>Through all the world, lay dead: the come was killed in the blade:</l>
<l>Now too much drought, now too much wet did make it for to fade.  </l>
<l>The starres and blasting windes did hurt, the hungry foules did eate</l>
<l>The come in ground: the Tines and Briars did overgow the Wheate.</l>
<l>And other wicked weedes the corne continually annoy,</l>
<l>Which neyther tylth nor toyle of man was able to destroy.

<l>No cause of such a sonne in law ashamed for to bee,</l>
<l>So you contented were therewith. For put the case that hee  </l>
<l>Were destitute of all things else, how greate a matter ist</l>
<l>Joves brother for to be? but sure in him is nothing mist.</l>
<l>Nor he inferior is to me save only that by lot</l>
<l>The Heavens to me, the Helles to him the destnies did allot.</l>
<l>But if you have so sore desire your daughter to divorce,    </l>
<l>Though she againe to Heaven repayre I doe not greatly force.</l>
<l>But yet conditionly that she have tasted there no foode:</l>
<l>For so the destnies have decreed. He ceaste: and Ceres stoode</l>
<l>Full bent to fetch hir daughter out: but destnies hir withstoode,</l>
<l>Bicause the Maide had broke hir fast. For as she hapt one day  </l>
<l>In Plutos Ortyard rechlessely from place to place to stray,</l>
<l>She gathering from a bowing tree a ripe Pownegarnet, tooke</l>
<l>Seven kernels out and sucked them. None chaunst hereon to looke,</l>
<l>Save onely one Ascalaphus whome Orphne, erst a Dame</l>
<l>Among the other Elves of Hell not of the basest fame,       </l>
<l>Bare to hir husbande <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName> within hir duskie den.</l>
<l>He sawe it, and by blabbing it ungraciously as then,</l>
<l>Did let hir from returning thence. A grievous sigh the Queene</l>
<l>Of Hell did fetch, and of that wight that had a witnesse beene</l>
<l>Against hir made a cursed Birde. Upon his face she shead    </l>
<l>The water of the Phlegeton: and by and by his head</l>
<l>Was nothing else but Beake and Downe, and mightie glaring eyes.</l>
<l>Quight altred from himselfe betweene two yellow wings he flies.</l>
<l>He groweth chiefly into head and hooked talants long</l>
<l>And much adoe he hath to flaske his lazie wings among.      </l>
<l>The messenger of Morning was he made, a filthie fowle,</l>
<l>A signe of mischiefe unto men, the sluggish skreching Owle.</l>
<l>This person for his lavish tongue and telling tales might seeme</l>
<l>To have deserved punishment. But what should men esteeme</l>
<l>To be the verie cause why you, Acheloes daughters, weare    </l>
<l>Both feete and feathers like to Birdes, considering that you beare</l>
<l>The upper partes of Maidens still? And commes it so to passe</l>
<l>Bicause when Ladie Proserpine a gathering flowers was,</l>
<l>Ye Meremaides kept hir companie? Whome after you had sought</l>
<l>Through all the Earth in vaine, anon of purpose that your thought  </l>
<l>Might also to the Seas be knowen, ye wished that ye might</l>
<l>Upon the waves with hovering wings at pleasure rule your flight,</l>
<l>And had the Goddes to your request so pliant, that ye found</l>
<l>With yellow feathers out of hand your bodies clothed round:</l>
<l>Yet lest that pleasant tune of yours ordeyned to delight  </l>
<l>The hearing, and so high a gift of Musicke perish might</l>
<l>For want of uttrance, humaine voyce to utter things at will </l>
<l>And countnance of virginitie remained to you still.</l>
<l>But meane betweene his brother and his heavie sister goth</l>
<l>God Jove, and parteth equally the yeare betweene them both.  </l>
<l>And now the Goddesse Proserpine indifferently doth reigne</l>
<l>Above and underneath the Earth, and so doth she remaine</l>
<l>One halfe yeare with hir mother and the resdue with hir Feere.  </l>
<l>Immediatly she altred is as well in outwarde cheere</l>
<l>As inwarde minde. For where hir looke might late before appeere  </l>
<l>Sad even to Dis, hir countnance now is full of mirth and grace</l>
<l>Even like as Phebus having put the watrie cloudes to chace,</l>
<l>Doth shew himselfe a Conqueror with bright and shining face.

<l>Then fruitfull Ceres voide of care in that she did recover</l>
<l>Hir daughter, prayde thee, <placeName key="tgn,5004303">Arethuse</placeName>, the storie to discover,   </l>
<l>What caused thee to fleete so farre and wherefore thou became</l>
<l>A sacred spring? The waters whist. The Goddesse of the same</l>
<l>Did from the bottome of the Well hir goodly head up reare.</l>
<l>And having dried with hir hand hir faire greene hanging heare,</l>
<l>The River Alpheys auncient loves she thus began to tell.  </l>
<l>I was (quoth she) a Nymph of them that in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName> dwell.</l>
<l>There was not one that earnester the Lawndes and forests sought</l>
<l>Or pitcht hir toyles more handsomly. And though that of my thought</l>
<l>It was no part, to seeke the fame of beautie: though I were</l>
<l>All courage: yet the pricke and prise of beautie I did beare.  </l>
<l>My overmuch commended face was unto me a spight.</l>
<l>This gift of bodie in the which another would delight,</l>
<l>I, rudesbye, was ashamed of: me thought it was a crime</l>
<l>To be belikte. I beare it well in minde that on a time</l>
<l>In comming wearie from the chase of Stymphalus, the heate  </l>
<l>Was fervent, and my traveling had made it twice as great.</l>
<l>I founde a water neyther deepe nor shallow which did glide</l>
<l>Without all noyse, so calme that scarce the moving might be spide.</l>
<l>And throughly to the very ground it was so crispe and cleare,</l>
<l>That every little stone therein did plaine aloft appeare.  </l>
<l>The horie Sallowes and the Poplars growing on the brim</l>
<l>Unset, upon the shoring bankes did cast a shadow trim.</l>
<l>I entred in, and first of all I deeped but my feete:</l>
<l>And after to my knees. And not content to wade so fleete,</l>
<l>I put off all my clothes, and hung them on a Sallow by       </l>
<l>And threw my selfe amid the streame, which as I dallyingly</l>
<l>Did beate and draw, and with my selfe a thousand maistries trie,</l>
<l>In casting of mine armes abrode and swimming wantonly:</l>
<l>I felt a bubling in the streame I wist not how nor what,</l>
<l>And on the Rivers nearest brim I stept for feare. With that,  </l>
<l>O Arethusa, whither runst? and whither runst thou, cride</l>
<l>Floud Alphey from his waves againe with hollow voyce. I hide</l>
<l>Away unclothed as I was. For on the further side</l>
<l>My clothes hung still. So much more hote and eger then was he,</l>
<l>And for I naked was, I seemde the readier for to be.         </l>
<l>My running and his fierce pursuite was like as when ye se</l>
<l>The sillie Doves with quivering wings before the Gossehauke stie,</l>
<l>The Gossehauke sweeping after them as fast as he can flie.</l>
<l>To Orchomen, and Psophy land, and Cyllen I did holde</l>
<l>Out well, and thence to Menalus and Erymanth the colde,      </l>
<l>And so to Ely. All this way no ground of me he wonne.</l>
<l>But being not so strong as he, this restlesse race to runne</l>
<l>I could not long endure, and he could hold it out at length.</l>
<l>Yet over plaines and wooddie hilles (as long as lasted strength)</l>
<l>And stones, and rockes, and desert groundes I still maintaind my race. </l>
<l>The <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> was full upon my backe. I saw before my face</l>
<l>A lazie shadow: were it not that feare did make me see't.</l>
<l>But certenly he feared me with trampling of his feete:</l>
<l>And of his mouth the boystous breath upon my hairlace blew.</l>
<l>Forwearied with the toyle of flight: Helpe, Diane, I thy true  </l>
<l>And trustie Squire (I said) who oft have caried after thee</l>
<l>Thy bow and arrowes, now am like attached for to bee.</l>
<l>The Goddesse moved, tooke a cloude of such as scattred were</l>
<l>And cast upon me. Hidden thus in mistie darkenesse there</l>
<l>The River poard upon me still and hunted round about         </l>
<l>The hollow cloude, for feare perchaunce I should have scaped out.</l>
<l>And twice not knowing what to doe he stalkt about the cloude</l>
<l>Where Diane had me hid, and twice he called out aloude:</l>
<l>Hoe <placeName key="tgn,5004303">Arethuse</placeName>, hoe <placeName key="tgn,5004303">Arethuse</placeName>. What heart had I poore wretch then?</l>
<l>Even such as hath the sillie Lambe that dares not stirre nor quetch when </l>
<l>He heares the howling of the Wolfe about or neare the foldes,</l>
<l>Or such as hath the squatted Hare that in hir foorme beholdes</l>
<l>The hunting houndes on every side, and dares not move a whit,</l>
<l>He would not thence, for why he saw no footing out as yit.</l>
<l>And therefore watcht he narrowly the cloud and eke the place.    </l>
<l>A chill colde sweat my sieged limmes opprest, and downe apace</l>
<l>From all my bodie steaming drops did fall of watrie hew.</l>
<l>Which way so ere I stird my foote the place was like a stew.</l>
<l>The deaw ran trickling from my haire. In halfe the while I then</l>
<l>Was turnde to water, that I now have tolde the tale agen.  </l>
<l>His loved waters Alphey knew, and putting off the shape</l>
<l>Of man the which he tooke before bicause I should not scape,</l>
<l>Returned to his proper shape of water by and by</l>
<l>Of purpose for to joyne with me and have my companie.</l>
<l>But <placeName key="tgn,7003804">Delia</placeName> brake the ground, at which I sinking into blinde  </l>
<l>Bycorners, up againe my selfe at Ortigie doe winde,</l>
<l>Right deare to me bicause it doth Dianas surname beare,</l>
<l>And for bicause to light againe I first was raysed there.</l>
<l>Thus far did Arethusa speake: and then the fruitfull Dame</l>
<l>Two Dragons to hir Chariot put, and reyning hard the same, </l>
<l>Midway beweene the Heaven and Earth she in the <placeName key="tgn,1063915">Ayer</placeName> went,</l>
<l>And unto Prince Triptolemus hir lightsome Chariot sent</l>
<l>To Pallas Citie lode with come, commaunding him to sowe</l>
<l>Some part in ground new broken up, and some thereof to strow</l>
<l>In ground long tillde before. Anon the yong man up did stie</l>
<l>And flying over <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> and the Realme of Asias hie,</l>
<l>Alighted in the Scithian land. There reyned in that coast</l>
<l>A King callde Lyncus, to whose house he entred for to host.</l>
<l>And being there demaunded how and why he thither came,</l>
<l>And also of his native soyle and of his proper name,</l>
<l>I hight (quoth he) Triptolemus and borne was in the towne</l>
<l>Of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> in the land of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, that place of high renowne.</l>
<l>I neyther came by Sea nor Lande, but through the open Aire</l>
<l>I bring with me Dame Ceres giftes which being sowne in faire</l>
<l>And fertile fields may fruitfull Harvests yeelde and finer fare.  </l>
<l>The savage King had spight, and to th'intent that of so rare</l>
<l>And gracious gifts himselfe might seeme first founder for to be,</l>
<l>He entertainde him in his house, and when asleepe was he,</l>
<l>He came upon him with a sword: but as he would have killde him,</l>
<l>Dame Ceres turnde him to a Lynx, and waking tother willde him   </l>
<l>His sacred Teemeware through the Ayre to drive abrode agen.</l>
<l>The chiefe of us had ended this hir learned song, and then</l>
<l>The Nymphes with one consent did judge that we the Goddesses</l>
<l>Of Helicon had wonne the day. But when I sawe that these</l>
<l>Unnurtred Damsels overcome began to fall a scolding,         </l>
<l>I sayd: so little sith to us you thinke your selves beholding,</l>
<l>For bearing with your malapertnesse in making chalenge, that</l>
<l>Besides your former fault, ye eke doe fall to rayling flat,</l>
<l>Abusing thus our gentlenesse: we will from hence proceede</l>
<l>The punishment, and of our wrath the rightfull humor feede.   </l>
<l>Euippyes daughters grinnd and jeerde and set our threatnings light.</l>
<l>But as they were about to prate, and bent their fistes to smight</l>
<l>Theyr wicked handes with hideous noyse, they saw the stumps of quilles</l>
<l>New budding at their nayles, and how their armes soft feather hilles.</l>
<l>Eche saw how others mouth did purse and harden into Bill,    </l>
<l>And so becomming uncouth Birdes to haunt the woods at will.</l>
<l>For as they would have clapt their handes their wings did up them heave,</l>
<l>And hanging in the Ayre the scoldes of woods did Pies them leave.</l>
<l>Now also being turnde to Birdes they are as eloquent</l>
<l>As ere they were, as chattring still, as much to babling bent.  </l>
</div2></div1>

<div1 type="Book" n="6">
<div2 type="card" n="1">
<l>Tritonia unto all these wordes attentive hearing bendes,</l>
<l>And both the Muses learned song and rightfull wrath commendes.</l>
<l>And thereupon within hir selfe this fancie did arise:</l>
<l>It is no matter for to prayse: but let our selfe devise</l>
<l>Some thing to be commended for: and let us not permit           </l>
<l>Our Majestie to be despisde without revenging it.</l>
<l>And therewithall she purposed to put the Lydian Maide</l>
<l>Arachne to hir neckeverse who (as had to hir bene saide)</l>
<l>Presumed to prefer hir selfe before hir noble grace</l>
<l>In making cloth. This Damsell was not famous for the place     </l>
<l>In which she dwelt, nor for hir stocke, but for hir Arte. Hir Sier</l>
<l>Was Idmon, one of <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName>, a pelting Purple Dier.</l>
<l>Hir mother was deceast: but she was of the baser sort,</l>
<l>And egall to hir Make in birth, in living, and in port.</l>
<l>But though this Maide were meanly borne, and dwelt but in a shed </l>
<l>At little Hypep: yet hir trade hir fame abrode did spred</l>
<l>Even all the Lydian Cities through. To see hir wondrous worke</l>
<l>The Nymphes that underneath the Vines of shadie Tmolus lurke</l>
<l>Their Vineyards oftentimes forsooke. So did the Nymphes also</l>
<l>About Pactolus oftentimes their golden streames forgo.         </l>
<l>And evermore it did them good not only for to see</l>
<l>Hir clothes already made, but while they eke a making bee</l>
<l>Such grace was in hir workmanship. For were it so that shee</l>
<l>The newshorne fleeces from the sheepe in bundels deftly makes,</l>
<l>Or afterward doth kemb the same, and drawes it out in flakes    </l>
<l>Along like cloudes, or on the Rocke doth spinne the handwarpe woofe,</l>
<l>Or else embroydreth, certenly ye might perceive by proofe</l>
<l>She was of Pallas bringing up, which thing she nathelesse</l>
<l>Denyeth, and disdaining such a Mistresse to confesse,</l>
<l>Let hir contend with me, she saide: and if she me amend         </l>
<l>I will refuse no punishment the which she shall extend.</l>
<l>Minerva tooke an olde wives shape and made hir haire seeme gray,</l>
<l>And with a staffe hir febled limmes pretended for to stay.</l>
<l>Which done, she thus began to speake: Not all that age doth bring</l>
<l>We ought to shonne. Experience doth of long continuance spring.   </l>
<l>Despise not mine admonishment. Seeke fame and chiefe report</l>
<l>For making cloth, and <placeName key="tgn,7008468">Arras</placeName> worke, among the mortall sort.</l>
<l>But humbly give the Goddesse place: and pardon of hir crave</l>
<l>For these thine unadvised wordes. I warrant thou shalt have</l>
<l>Forgivenesse, if thou aske it hir. Arachne bent hir brewes      </l>
<l>And lowring on hir, left hir worke: and hardly she eschewes</l>
<l>From flying in the Ladies face. Hir countnance did bewray</l>
<l>Hir moodie minde: which bursting forth in words she thus did say:</l>
<l>Thou commest like a doting foole: thy wit is spent with yeares:</l>
<l>Thy life hath lasted over long as by thy talke appeares.         </l>
<l>And if thou any daughter have, or any daughtrinlawe,</l>
<l>I would she heard these wordes of mine: I am not such a Daw,</l>
<l>But that without thy teaching I can well ynough advise</l>
<l>My selfe. And lest thou shouldest thinke thy words in any wise</l>
<l>Availe, the selfesame minde I keepe with which I first begonne.  </l>
<l>Why commes she not hirselfe I say? this matche why doth she shonne?</l>
<l>Then said the Goddesse: Here she is. And therewithall she cast</l>
<l>Hir oldewives riveled shape away, and shewde hir selfe at last</l>
<l>Minerva like. The Nymphes did streight adore hir Majestie.</l>
<l>So did the yong newmaried wives that were of Migdonie.          </l>
<l>The Maiden only unabasht woulde nought at all relent.</l>
<l>But yet she blusht and sodenly a ruddynesse besprent</l>
<l>Hir cheekes which wanzd away againe, even like as doth the Skie</l>
<l>Looke sanguine at the breake of day, and turneth by and by</l>
<l>To white at rising of the Sunne. As hote as any fire           </l>
<l>She sticketh to hir tackling still. And through a fond desire</l>
<l>Of glorie, to hir owne decay all headlong forth she runnes.</l>
<l>For Pallas now no lenger warnes, ne now no lenger shunnes</l>
<l>Ne seekes the chalenge to delay. Immediatly they came</l>
<l>And tooke their places severally, and in a severall frame      </l>
<l>Eche streynde a web, the warpe whereof was fine. The web was tide</l>
<l>Upon a Beame. Betweene the warpe a stay of reede did slide.</l>
<l>The woofe on sharpened pinnes was put betwixt the warp, and wrought</l>
<l>With fingars. And as oft as they had through the warpe it brought,</l>
<l>They strake it with a Boxen combe. Both twayne of them made hast: </l>
<l>And girding close for handsomnesse their garments to their wast</l>
<l>Bestirde their cunning handes apace. Their earnestnesse was such</l>
<l>As made them never thinke of paine. They weaved verie much</l>
<l>Fine Purple that was dide in <placeName key="tgn,7002862">Tyre</placeName>, and colours set so trim</l>
<l>That eche in shadowing other seemde the very same with him. </l>
<l>Even like as after showres of raine when Phebus broken beames</l>
<l>Doe strike upon the Cloudes, appeares a compast bow of gleames</l>
<l>Which bendeth over all the Heaven: wherein although there shine</l>
<l>A thousand sundry colours, yet the shadowing is so fine,</l>
<l>That looke men nere so wistly, yet beguileth it their eyes:     </l>
<l>So like and even the selfsame thing eche colour seemes to rise</l>
<l>Whereas they meete, which further off doe differ more and more.</l>
<l>Of glittring golde with silken threede was weaved there good store.</l>
<l>And stories put in portrayture of things done long afore.</l>
<l>Minerva painted <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> towne and Marsis rocke therein,      </l>
<l>And all the strife betweene hirselfe and Neptune, who should win</l>
<l>The honor for to give the name to that same noble towne.</l>
<l>In loftie thrones on eyther side of Jove were settled downe</l>
<l>Six Peeres of Heaven with countnance grave and full of Majestie,</l>
<l>And every of them by his face discerned well might be.          </l>
<l>The Image of the mightie Jove was Kinglike. She had made</l>
<l>Neptunus standing striking with his long thre tyned blade</l>
<l>Upon the ragged Rocke: and from the middle of the clift</l>
<l>She portrayd issuing out a horse, which was the noble gift</l>
<l>For which he chalengde to himselfe the naming of the towne.     </l>
<l>She picturde out hirselfe with shielde and Morion on hir crowne</l>
<l>With Curet on hir brest, and Speare in hand with sharpened ende.</l>
<l>She makes the Earth (the which hir Speare doth seeme to strike) to sende</l>
<l>An Olyf tree with fruite thereon: and that the Gods thereat</l>
<l>Did wonder: and with victorie she finisht up that plat.      </l>
<l>Yet to th'intent examples olde might make it to be knowne</l>
<l>To hir that for desire of praise so stoutly helde hir owne,</l>
<l>What guerdon she shoulde hope to have for hir attempt so madde,</l>
<l>Foure like contentions in the foure last corners she did adde.

<l>The Thracians Heme and Rodope the formost corner hadde:       </l>

<l>A Pigmie womans piteous chaunce the second corner shewde,</l>
<l>Whome Juno turned to a Crane (bicause she was so lewde</l>
<l>As for to stand at strife with hir for beautie) charging hir</l>

<l>The thirde had proude Antigone, who durst of pride contende</l>

<l>Of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, or that Laomedon hir father ware a crowne,           </l>
<l>But that she, clad in feathers white, hir lazie wings must flap.</l>
<l>And with a bobbed Bill bewayle the cause of hir missehap.</l>
<l>The last had chyldelesse Cinyras: who being turnde to stone,</l>
<l>Was picturde prostrate on the grounde, and weeping all alone,</l>
<l>And culling fast betweene his armes a Temples greeces fine    </l>
<l>To which his daughters bodies were transformde by wrath divine.</l>
<l>The utmost borders had a wreath of Olyf round about,</l>
<l>And this is all the worke the which Minerva portrayd out.</l>
<l>For with the tree that she hirselfe had made but late afore</l>
<l>She bounded in hir <placeName key="tgn,7008468">Arras</placeName> cloth, and then did worke no more.   </l>
<l>The Lydian maiden in hir web did portray to the full</l>
<l>How <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> was by royall Jove beguilde in shape of Bull.</l>
<l>A swimming Bull, a swelling Sea, so lively had she wrought,</l>
<l>That Bull and Sea in very deede ye might them well have thought.</l>
<l>The Ladie seemed looking backe to landwarde and to crie      </l>
<l>Upon hir women, and to feare the water sprinkling hie,</l>
<l>And shrinking up hir fearfull feete. She portrayd also there</l>
<l>Asteriee struggling with an Erne which did away hir beare.</l>
<l>And over Leda she had made a Swan his wings to splay.</l>
<l>She added also how by Jove in shape of Satyr gaye           </l>
<l>The faire Antiope with a paire of children was besped:</l>
<l>And how he tooke Amphitrios shape when in Alcmenas bed</l>

<l>To Danae like a shoure of golde, to Aegine like a flame,</l>
<l>A sheepeherd to Mnemosyne, and like a Serpent sly           </l>
<l>To Proserpine. She also made Neptunus leaping by</l>
<l>Upon a Maide of Aeolus race in likenesse of a Bull,</l>
<l>And in the streame Enipeus shape begetting on a trull</l>
<l>The Giants Othe and Ephialt, and in the shape of Ram</l>
<l>Begetting one Theophane Bisalties ympe with Lam,            </l>
<l>And in a lustie Stalions shape she made him covering there</l>
<l>Dame Ceres with the yellow lockes, and hir whose golden heare</l>

<l>And how he in a shepeherdes shape was practising a wile</l>

<l>And how the faire Erygone by chaunce did suffer rape</l>
<l>By Bacchus who deceyved hir in likenesse of a grape.</l>
<l>And how that Saturne in the shape of Genet did beget</l>
<l>The double Chiron. Round about the utmost Verdge was set</l>
<l>A narrow Traile of pretie floures with leaves of Ivie fret.  </l>
<l>Not Pallas, no, nor spight it selfe could any quarrell picke</l>
<l>To this hir worke: and that did touch Minerva to the quicke.</l>
<l>Who thereupon did rende the cloth in pieces every whit,</l>
<l>Bicause the lewdnesse of the Gods was biased so in it.</l>
<l>And with an <placeName key="tgn,7008468">Arras</placeName> weavers combe of Box she fiercely smit    </l>
<l>Arachne on the forehead full a dozen times and more.</l>
<l>The Maide impacient in hir heart, did stomacke this so sore,</l>
<l>That by and by she hung hirselfe. Howbeit as she hing,</l>
<l>Dame Pallas pitying hir estate, did stay hir in the string</l>
<l>From death, and said: Lewde Callet live: but hang thou still for mee. </l>
<l>And lest hereafter from this curse that time may set thee free,</l>
<l>I will that this same punishment enacted firmely bee,</l>
<l>As well on thy posteritie for ever as on thee.</l>
<l>And after when she should depart, with juice of Hecats flowre</l>
<l>She sprinkled hir: and by and by the poyson had such powre,  </l>
<l>That with the touch thereof hir haire, hir eares, and nose did fade:</l>
<l>And verie small it both hir heade and all hir bodie made.</l>
<l>In steade of legs, to both hir sides sticke fingars long and fine:</l>
<l>The rest is bellie. From the which she nerethelesse doth twine</l>
<l>A slender threede, and practiseth in shape of Spider still</l>
<l>The Spinners and the Websters crafts of which she erst had skill.

<l>And if you helpe not, children mine, the case now standeth so  </l>
<l>That I the honor must from hence of Altars quight forgo.</l>
<l>But this is not mine only griefe. Besides hir wicked fact</l>
<l>Most railing words hath Niobe to my defacing rackt.</l>

<l>And by and by they through the Ayre both gliding swiftly downe,  </l>
<l>On <placeName key="tgn,2078692">Cadmus</placeName> pallace hid in cloudes did light in Thebe towne.</l>
<l>A fielde was underneath the wall both levell, large and wide,</l>
<l>Betrampled every day with horse that men therin did ride,</l>
<l>Where store of Carres and Horses hoves the cloddes to dust had trode.</l>
<l>A couple of Amphions sonnes on lustie coursers rode           </l>
<l>In this same place. Their horses faire Coperisons did weare</l>
<l>Of scarlet: and their bridles brave with golde bedecked were.</l>
<l>Of whome as Niobs eldest sonne Ismenos hapt to bring</l>
<l>His horse about, and reynde him in to make him keepe the ring,</l>
<l>He cride alas: and in his brest with that an arrow stacke    </l>
<l>And by and by hys dying hand did let the bridle slacke.</l>
<l>And on the right side of the horse he slipped to the ground.</l>
<l>The second brother Sipylus did chaunce to heare the sound</l>
<l>Of Quivers clattring in the Ayre, and giving streight the reyne</l>
<l>And spur togither to his horse, began to flie amayne: </l>
<l>As doth the master of a ship: who when he sees a shoure</l>
<l>Approching, by some mistie cloud that ginnes to gloume and loure</l>
<l>Doth clap on all his sayles bicause no winde should scape him by</l>
<l>Though nere so small. Howbeit as he turned for to flie,</l>
<l>He was not able for to scape the Arrow which did stricke     </l>
<l>Him through the necke. The nocke thereof did shaking upward sticke,</l>
<l>The head appeared at his throte. And as he forward gave</l>
<l>Himselfe in flying: so to ground he groveling also drave,</l>
<l>And toppled by the horses mane and feete amid his race,</l>
<l>And with his warme newshedded bloud berayed all the place. </l>
<l>But Phedimus, and Tantalus, the heir of the name</l>
<l>Of Tantalus, his Graundfather, who customably came</l>
<l>From other dailie exercise to wrestling, had begun</l>
<l>To close, and eache at other now with brest to brest to run,</l>
<l>When <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> Arrow being sent with force from streyned string   </l>
<l>Did strike through both of them as they did fast togither cling.</l>
<l>And so they sighed both at once, and both at once for paine</l>
<l>Fell downe to ground, and both of them at once their eyes did streine</l>
<l>To see their latest light, and both at once their ghostes did yeelde.</l>
<l>Alphenor this mischaunce of theirs with heavie heart behelde,  </l>
<l>And scratcht and beate his wofull brest: and therewith flying out</l>
<l>To take them up betweene his armes, was as he went about</l>
<l>This worke of kindly pitie, killde. For Phebus with a Dart</l>
<l>Of deadly dint did rive him through the Bulke and brake his hart.</l>
<l>And when the steale was plucked out, a percell of his liver  </l>
<l>Did hang upon the hooked heade: and so he did deliver</l>
<l>His life and bloud into the Ayre departing both togither.</l>
<l>But Damasicthon (on whose heade came never scissor) felt</l>
<l>Mo woundes than one. It was his chaunce to have a grievous pelt</l>
<l>Upon the verie place at which the leg is first begun         </l>
<l>And where the hamstrings by the joynt with supple sinewes run</l>
<l>And while to draw this arrow out he with his hand assaide,</l>
<l>Another through his wezant went, and at the feathers staide.</l>
<l>The bloud did drive out this againe, and spinning high did spout</l>
<l>A great way off, and pierst the Ayre with sprinkling all about.   </l>
<l>The last of all Ilionie with streched handes, and speche</l>
<l>Most humble (but in vaine) did say: O Gods I you beseche</l>
<l>Of mercie all in generall. He wist not what he saide</l>
<l>Ne how that unto all of them he ought not to have praide.</l>
<l>The God that helde the Bow in hande was moved: but as then        </l>
<l>The Arrow was alredie gone so farre, that backe agen</l>
<l>He could not call it. Neerthelesse the wound was verie small</l>
<l>Of which he dide, for why his heart it did but lightly gall.</l>
<l>The rumor of the mischiefe selfe, and mone of people, and</l>
<l>The weeping of hir servants gave the mother t'understand     </l>
<l>The sodaine stroke of this mischaunce. She wondred verie much</l>
<l>And stormed also that the Gods were able to doe such</l>
<l>A deede, or durst attempt it, yea she thought it more than right</l>
<l>That any of them over hir should have so mickle might.</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,2132474">Amphion</placeName> had fordone himselfe alreadie with a knife,               </l>
<l>And ended all his sorrowes quite togither with his life.</l>
<l>Alas, alas how greatly doth this Niobe differ here</l>
<l>From tother Niobe who alate disdaining any Pere</l>
<l>Did from Latonas Altars drive hir folke, and through the towne</l>
<l>With haultie looke and stately gate went pranking up and downe, </l>
<l>Then spighted at among hir owne, but piteous now to those:</l>
<l>That heretofore for hir deserts had bene hir greatest foes.</l>
<l>She falleth on the corses colde, and taking no regard,</l>
<l>Bestowde hir kysses on hir sonnes as whome she afterwarde</l>
<l>Did know she never more shoulde kisse. From whome she lifting thoe </l>
<l>Hir blew and broosed armes to heaven sayd: O thou cruell foe</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,2013536">Latona</placeName>, feede, yea feede thy selfe I say upon my woe</l>
<l>And overgorge thy stomacke, yea and glut thy cruell hart</l>
<l>With these my present painefull pangs of bitter griping smart.</l>
<l>In corses seven I seven times deade am caried to my grave. </l>
<l>Rejoyce thou foe and triumph now in that thou seemste to have</l>
<l>The upper hande. What? upper hand? no no it is not so.</l>
<l>As wretched as my case doth seeme, yet have I left me mo</l>
<l>Than thou for all thy happinesse canst of thine owne account.</l>
<l>Even after all these corses yet I still doe thee surmount.   </l>
<l>Upon the ende of these same wordes the twanging of the string</l>
<l>In letting of the Arrow flie was clearly heard: which thing</l>
<l>Made every one save Niobe afraide. Hir heart was so</l>
<l>With sorrowe hardned, that she grew more bolde. Hir daughters tho</l>
<l>Were standing all with mourning weede and hanging haire before </l>
<l>Their brothers coffins. One of them in pulling from the sore</l>
<l>An Arrow sticking in his heart, sanke downe upon hir brother</l>
<l>With mouth to mouth, and so did yeelde hir fleeting ghost. Another</l>
<l>In comforting the wretched case and sorrow of hir mother</l>
<l>Upon the sodaine helde hir peace. She stricken was within    </l>
<l>With double wound: which caused hir hir talking for to blin</l>
<l>And shut hir mouth: but first hir ghost was gone. One all in vaine</l>
<l>Attempting for to scape by flight was in hir flying slaine.</l>
<l>Another on hir sisters corse doth tumble downe starke dead.</l>
<l>This quakes and trembles piteously, and she doth hide hir head.    </l>
<l>And when that sixe with sundrye woundes dispatched were and gone,</l>
<l>At last as yet remained one: and for to save that one,</l>
<l>Hir mother with hir bodie whole did cling about hir fast,</l>
<l>And wrying hir did over hir hir garments wholy cast:</l>
<l>And cried out: O leave me one: this little one yet save:      </l>
<l>Of many but this only one the least of all I crave.</l>
<l>But while she prayd, for whome she prayd was kild. Then down she sate</l>
<l>Bereft of all hir children quite, and drawing to hir fate,</l>
<l>Among hir daughters and hir sonnes and husband newly dead.</l>
<l>Hir cheekes waxt hard, the Ayre could stirre no haire upon hir head. </l>
<l>The colour of hir face was dim and clearly voide of blood,</l>
<l>And sadly under open lids hir eyes unmoved stood.</l>
<l>In all hir bodie was no life. For even hir verie tung</l>
<l>And palat of hir mouth was hard, and eche to other clung.</l>
<l>Hir Pulses ceased for to beate, hir necke did cease to bow,   </l>
<l>Hir armes to stir, hir feete to go, all powre forwent as now.</l>
<l>And into stone hir verie wombe and bowels also bind.</l>
<l>But yet she wept: and being hoyst by force of whirling wind</l>
<l>Was caried into Phrygie. There upon a mountaines top</l>
<l>She weepeth still in stone. From stone the drerie teares do drop.

<l>Then all both men and women fearde Latonas open ire I</l>
<l>And far with greater sumptuousnesse and earnester desire</l>
<l>Did worship the great majestie of this their Goddesse who</l>
<l>Did beare at once both <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> and his sister Phebe too.</l>
<l>And through occasion of this chaunce, (as men are wont to do  </l>
<l>In cases like) the people fell to telling things of old</l>
<l>Of whome a man among the rest this tale ensuing told.</l>
<l>The auncient folke that in the fieldes of fruitfull <placeName key="tgn,7001294">Lycia</placeName> dwelt</l>
<l>Due penance also for their spight to this same Goddesse felt.</l>
<l>The basenesse of the parties makes the thing it selfe obscure.  </l>
<l>Yet is the matter wonderfull. My selfe I you assure</l>
<l>Did presently beholde the Pond, and saw the very place</l>
<l>In which this wondrous thing was done. My father then in case,</l>
<l>Not able for to travell well by reason of his age,</l>
<l>To fetch home certaine Oxen thence made me to be his page,    </l>
<l>Appointing me a countryman of <placeName key="tgn,7001294">Lycia</placeName> to my guide.</l>
<l>With whome as I went plodding in the pasture groundes, I spide</l>
<l>Amids a certaine Pond an olde square Aultar colourd blacke</l>
<l>With cinder of the sacrifice that still upon it stacke.</l>
<l>About it round grew wavering Reedes. My guide anon did stay:    </l>
<l>And softly, O be good to me, he in himselfe did say.</l>
<l>And I with like soft whispering did say, Be good to mee.</l>
<l>And then I askt him whether that the Altar wee did see</l>
<l>Belonged to the Waternymphes, or Faunes or other God</l>
<l>Peculiar to the place it selfe upon the which we yod.         </l>
<l>He made me aunswere thus: My guest, no God of countrie race</l>
<l>Is in this Altar worshipped. That Goddesse claymes this place,</l>
<l>From whome the wife of mightie Jove did all the world forfend:</l>
<l>When wandring restlesse here and there full hardly in the end</l>
<l>Unsetled Delos did receyve then floting on the wave,          </l>
<l>As tide and weather to and fro the swimming Iland drave.</l>

<l>And after hir delivrance folke report that she for feare     </l>

<l>By chaunce she spide this little Pond of water here bylow.</l>
<l>And countrie Carles were gathering there these Osier twigs that grow</l>
<l>So thicke upon a shrubbie stalke: and of these rushes greene:  </l>
<l>And flags that in these moorish plots so rife of growing beene.</l>
<l>She comming hither kneeled downe the water up to take</l>
<l>To coole hir thirst. The churlish cloynes forfended hir the Lake.</l>
<l>Then gently said the Goddesse: Sirs, why doe you me forfend</l>
<l>The water? Nature doth to all in common water send.          </l>
<l>For neither <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName>, nor Ayre, nor yet the Water private bee,</l>

<l>And yet I humbly crave of you to graunt it unto mee.</l>
<l>I did not go about to wash my werie limmes and skin,</l>
<l>I would but only quench my thirst. My throte is scalt within  </l>
<l>For want of moysture: and my chappes and lippes are parching drie:</l>

<l>To this the gentle Goddesses entreatance meeke and meeld?     </l>
<l>Yet they for all the humble wordes she could devise to say,</l>
<l>Continued in their willfull moode of churlish saying nay,</l>
<l>And threatned for to sende hir thence onlesse she went away,</l>
<l>Reviling hir most spightfully. And not contented so,</l>
<l>With handes and feete the standing Poole they troubled to and fro, </l>
<l>Until with trampling up and downe maliciously, the soft</l>
<l>And slimie mud that lay beneath was raised up aloft.</l>
<l>With that the Goddesse was so wroth that thirst was quight forgot.</l>
<l>And unto such unworthie Carles hirselfe she humbleth not:</l>
<l>Ne speaketh meaner wordes than might beseeme a Goddesse well. </l>
<l>But holding up hir handes to heaven: For ever mought you dwell</l>
<l>In this same Pond, she said: hir wish did take effect with speede.</l>
<l>For underneath the water they delight to be in deede.</l>
<l>Now dive they to the bottome downe, now up their heades they pop,</l>
<l>Another while with sprawling legs they swim upon the top. </l>
<l>And oftentimes upon the bankes they have a minde to stond,</l>
<l>And oftentimes from thence againe to leape into the Pond.</l>
<l>And there they now doe practise still their filthy tongues to scold</l>
<l>And shamelessely (though underneath the water) they doe hold</l>
<l>Their former wont of brawling still amid the water cold.    </l>
<l>Their voices stil are hoarse and harsh, their throtes have puffed goles,</l>
<l>Their chappes with brawling widened are, their hammer headed Jowls</l>
<l>Are joyned to their shoulders just, the neckes of them doe seeme</l>
<l>Cut off, the ridgebone of their backe stickes up of colour greene.</l>

<l>In siege before their famous waHes and curstly did them fray.</l>

<l>Did vanquish him, and with renowne was for his labor payde.</l>
<l>And sith he was so puissant in men and ready coyne,</l>
<l>And came of mightie Marsis race, Pandion sought to joyne  </l>
<l>Aliance with him by and by, and gave him to his Feere</l>
<l>His daughter Progne. At this match (as after will appeare)</l>

<l>Unhappie handsell entred with their talking first togither.</l>
<l>The errandes of his wife, the cause of his then comming thither,    </l>
<l>He had but new begon to tell, and promised that when</l>
<l>She had hir sister seene, she should with speede be sent agen:</l>
<l>When (see the chaunce) came Philomele in raiment very rich,</l>
<l>And yet in beautie farre more rich, even like the Fairies which</l>
<l>Reported are the pleasant woods and water springs to haunt,  </l>
<l>So that the like apparell and attire to them you graunt.</l>
<l>King Tereus at the sight of hir did burne in his desire,</l>
<l>As if a man should chaunce to set a gulfe of come on fire,</l>
<l>Or burne a stacke of hay. Hir face in deede deserved love.</l>
<l>But as for him, to fleshly lust even nature did him move.    </l>
<l>For of those countries commonly the people are above</l>
<l>All measure prone to lecherie. And therefore both by kinde</l>
<l>His flame encreast, and by his owne default of vicious minde.</l>
<l>He purposde fully to corrupt hir servants with reward:</l>
<l>Or for to bribe hir Nurce, that she should slenderly regarde   </l>
<l>Hir dutie to hir mistresseward. And rather than to fayle,</l>
<l>The Ladie even hirselfe with gifts he minded to assayle,</l>
<l>And all his kingdome for to spend, or else by force of hand</l>
<l>To take hir, and in maintenance thereof by sword to stand.</l>
<l>There was not under heaven the thing but that he durst it prove,   </l>
<l>So far unable was he now to stay his lawlesse love.</l>
<l>Delay was deadly. Backe againe with greedie minde he came</l>
<l>Of Prognes errands for to talke: and underneath the same</l>
<l>He workes his owne ungraciousnesse. Love gave him power to frame</l>
<l>His talke at will. As oft as he demaunded out of square, </l>
<l>Upon his wives importunate desire himselfe he bare.</l>
<l>He also wept: as though his wife had willed that likewise.</l>
<l>O God, what blindnesse doth the heartes of mortall men disguise?</l>
<l>By working mischiefe Tereus gets him credit for to seeme</l>
<l>A loving man, and winneth praise by wickednesse extreeme. </l>
<l>Yea and the foolish Philomele the selfesame thing desires.</l>
<l>Who hanging on hir fathers necke with flattring armes, requires</l>
<l>Against hir life and for hir life his licence for to go</l>
<l>To see hir sister. Tereus beholdes hir wistly tho,</l>
<l>And in beholding handles hir with heart. For when he saw       </l>
<l>Hir kisse hir father, and about his necke hir armes to draw,</l>
<l>They all were spurres to pricke him forth, and wood to feede his fire,</l>
<l>And foode of forcing nourishment to further his desire.</l>
<l>As oft as she hir father did betweene hir armes embrace,</l>
<l>So often wished he himselfe hir father in that case.          </l>
<l>For nought at all should that in him have wrought the greater grace.</l>
<l>Hir father could not say them nay, they lay at him so sore.</l>
<l>Right glad thereof was Philomele and thanked him therefore.</l>
<l>And wretched wench she thinkes she had obtained such a thing,</l>
<l>As both to Progne and hir selfe should joy and comfort bring,  </l>
<l>When both of them in verie deede should afterward it rew.</l>
<l>To endward of his daily race and travell Phebus drew,</l>
<l>And on the shoring side of Heaven his horses downeward flew.</l>
<l>A princely supper was prepaarde, and wine in golde was set:</l>
<l>And after meate to take their rest the Princes did them get.   </l>
<l>But though the King of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> that while were absent from hir sight,</l>
<l>Yet swelted he: and in his minde revolving all the night</l>
<l>Hir face, hir gesture, and hir hands, imaginde all the rest</l>
<l>(The which as yet he had not seene) as likte his fancie best.</l>
<l>He feedes his flames himselfe. No winke could come within his eyes, </l>
<l>For thinking ay on hir. As soone as day was in the skies,</l>
<l>Pandion holding in his hand the hand of Tereus prest</l>
<l>To go his way, and sheading teares betooke him thus his guest:</l>
<l>Deare sonneinlaw I give thee here (sith godly cause constraines)</l>
<l>This Damsell. By the faith that in thy Princely heart remaines,  </l>
<l>And for our late aliance sake, and by the Gods above,</l>
<l>I humbly thee beseche that as a Father thou doe love</l>
<l>And maintaine hir, and that as soone as may be (all delay</l>
<l>Will unto me seeme over long) thou let hir come away,</l>

<l>That from hir father set so farre thy sister Progne is)</l>
<l>If any sparke of nature doe within thy heart remayne,</l>

<l>In giving charge he kissed hir: and downe his cheekes did raine</l>

<l>Desiring them to beare in minde his commendations to</l>
<l>His daughter and hir little sonne. And then with much adoe</l>

<l>The foremisgiving of his minde did make him sore afraid.</l>
<l>As soone as Tereus and the Maide togither were aboord,</l>
<l>And that their ship from land with Ores was haled on the foord,</l>
<l>The fielde is ours, he cride aloude, I have the thing I sought</l>
<l>And up he skipt, so barbrous and so beastly was his thought,   </l>
<l>That scarce even there he could forbeare his pleasure to have wrought.</l>
<l>His eye went never off of hir: as when the scarefull Erne</l>
<l>With hooked talants trussing up a Hare among the Ferne,</l>
<l>Hath laid hir in his nest, from whence the prisoner can not scape,</l>

<l>In <placeName key="tgn,7001303">Thracia</placeName>, when that Tereus tooke the Ladie by the hand,</l>
<l>And led hir to a pelting graunge that peakishly did stand</l>
<l>In woods forgrowen. There waxing pale and trembling sore for feare,</l>
<l>And dreading all things, and with teares demaunding sadly where   </l>
<l>Hir sister was, he shet hir up: and therewithall bewraide</l>
<l>His wicked lust, and so by force bicause she was a Maide</l>
<l>And all alone he vanquisht hir. It booted nought at all</l>
<l>That she on sister, or on Sire, or on the Gods did call.</l>
<l>She quaketh like the wounded Lambe which from the Wolves hore teeth  </l>
<l>New shaken thinkes hir selfe not safe: or as the Dove that seeth</l>
<l>Hir fethers with hir owne bloud staynde, who shuddring still doth feare</l>
<l>The greedie Hauke that did hir late with griping talants teare.</l>
<l>Anon when that this mazednesse was somewhat overpast,</l>
<l>She rent hir haire, and beate hir brest, and up to heavenward cast </l>
<l>Hir hands in mourningwise, and said: O cankerd Carle, O fell</l>
<l>And cruell Tyrant, neyther could the godly teares that fell</l>
<l>Adowne my fathers cheekes when he did give thee charge of mee,</l>
<l>Ne of my sister that regarde that ought to be in thee,</l>
<l>Nor yet my chaaste virginitie, nor conscience of the lawe       </l>
<l>Of wedlocke, from this villanie thy barbrous heart withdraw?</l>
<l>Is made a Cucqueane: and thy selfe through this offence of thee</l>
<l>Art made a husband to us both, and unto me a foe,</l>
<l>Behold thou hast confounded all. My sister thorough mee</l>
<l>A just deserved punishment for lewdly doing so.</l>
<l>But to th'intent, O perjurde wretch, no mischiefe may remaine</l>
<l>Unwrought by thee, why doest thou from murdring me refraine?</l>
<l>Would God thou had it done before this wicked rape. From hence</l>
<l>Then should my soule most blessedly have gone without offence.</l>
<l>But if the Gods doe see this deede, and if the Gods, I say,     </l>
<l>Be ought, and in this wicked worlde beare any kinde of sway</l>
<l>And if with me all other things decay not, sure the day</l>
<l>Will come that for this wickednesse full dearly thou shalt pay.</l>
<l>Yea I my selfe rejecting shame thy doings will bewray.</l>
<l>And if I may have power to come abrode, them blase I will       </l>
<l>In open face of all the world. Or if thou keepe me still</l>
<l>As prisoner in these woods, my voyce the verie woods shall fill,</l>
<l>And make the stones to understand. Let Heaven to this give care</l>
<l>And all the Gods and powers therein if any God be there.</l>
<l>The cruell tyrant being chaaft and also put in feare        </l>
<l>With these and other such hir wordes, both causes so him stung,</l>
<l>That drawing out his naked sworde that at his girdle hung,</l>
<l>He tooke hir rudely by the haire, and wrung hir hands behind hir,</l>
<l>Compelling hir to holde them there while he himselfe did bind hir.</l>
<l>When Philomela sawe the sworde, she hoapt she should have dide, </l>
<l>And for the same hir naked throte she gladly did provide.</l>
<l>But as she yirnde and called ay upon hir fathers name,</l>
<l>And strived to have spoken still, the cruell tyrant came</l>
<l>And with a paire of pinsons fast did catch hir by the tung,</l>
<l>And with his sword did cut it off. The stumpe whereon it hung     </l>
<l>Did patter still. The tip fell downe and quivering on the ground</l>
<l>As though that it had murmured it made a certaine sound.</l>
<l>And as an Adders tayle cut off doth skip a while: even so</l>
<l>The tip of Philomelaas tongue did wriggle to and fro,</l>
<l>And nearer to hir mistresseward in dying still did go.           </l>
<l>And after this most cruell act, for certaine men report</l>
<l>That he (I scarcely dare beleve) did oftentimes resort</l>
<l>To maymed Philomela and abusde hir at his will:</l>
<l>Yet after all this wickednesse he keeping countnance still,</l>
<l>Durst unto Progne home repaire. And she immediatly</l>
<l>Demaunded where hir sister was. He sighing feynedly</l>
<l>Did tell hir falsly she was dead: and with his suttle teares</l>
<l>He maketh all his tale to seeme of credit in hir eares.</l>
<l>Hir garments glittring all with golde she from hir shoulders teares</l>
<l>And puts on blacke, and setteth up an emptie Herce, and keepes    </l>
<l>A solemne obite for hir soule, and piteously she weepes</l>
<l>And waileth for hir sisters fate who was not in such wise</l>
<l>As that was, for to be bewailde. The <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> had in the Skies</l>
<l>Past through the twelve celestiall signes, and finisht full a yeare.</l>
<l>But what should Philomela doe? She watched was so neare           </l>
<l>That start she could not for hir life. The walles of that same graunge</l>
<l>Were made so high of maine hard stone, that out she could not raunge.</l>
<l>Againe hir tunglesse mouth did want the utterance of the fact.</l>
<l>Great is the wit of pensivenesse, and when the head is rakt</l>
<l>With hard misfortune, sharpe forecast of practise entereth in.    </l>
<l>A warpe of white upon a frame of <placeName key="tgn,7001303">Thracia</placeName> she did pin,</l>
<l>And weaved purple letters in betweene it, which bewraide</l>
<l>The wicked deede of Tereus. And having done, she praide</l>
<l>A certaine woman by hir signes to beare them to hir mistresse.</l>
<l>She bare them and deliverde them not knowing nerethelesse  </l>
<l>What was in them. The Tyrants wife unfolded all the clout,</l>
<l>And of hir wretched fortune red the processe whole throughout.</l>
<l>She held hir peace (a wondrous thing it is she should so doe)</l>
<l>But sorrow tide hir tongue, and wordes agreeable unto</l>
<l>Hir great displeasure were not at commaundment at that stound.   </l>
<l>And weepe she could not. Ryght and wrong she reckeneth to confound,</l>
<l>And on revengement of the deede hir heart doth wholy ground.

<l>It was the time that wives of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> were wont to celebrate</l>
<l>The three yeare rites of Bacchus which were done a nighttimes late.</l>
<l>A nighttimes soundeth <placeName key="tgn,7002754">Rhodope</placeName> of tincling pannes and pots:  </l>
<l>A nighttimes giving up hir house abrode Queene Progne trots</l>
<l>Disguisde like Bacchus other froes and armed to the proofe</l>
<l>With all the frenticke furniture that serves for that behoofe.</l>
<l>Hir head was covered with a vine. About hir loose was tuckt</l>
<l>A Reddeeres skin, a lightsome Launce upon hir shoulder ruckt.  </l>
<l>In post gaddes terrible Progne through the woods, and at hir heeles</l>
<l>A flocke of froes. And where the sting of sorrow which she feeles</l>
<l>Enforceth hir to furiousnesse, she feynes it to proceede</l>
<l>Of Bacchus motion. At the length she finding out in deede</l>
<l>The outset Graunge howlde out, and cride, Now well, and open brake </l>
<l>The gates, and streight hir sister thence by force of hand did take,</l>
<l>And veyling hir in like attire of Bacchus, hid hir head</l>
<l>With Ivie leaves, and home to Court hir sore amazed led.</l>
<l>As soone as Philomela wist she set hir foote within</l>
<l>That cursed house, the wretched soule to shudther did begin,</l>
<l>And all hir face waxt pale. Anon hir sister getting place</l>
<l>Did pull off Bacchus mad attire, and making bare hir face</l>
<l>Embraced hir betweene hir armes. But she considering that</l>
<l>Queene Progne was a Cucqueane made by meanes of hir, durst nat</l>
<l>Once raise hir eyes: but on the ground fast fixed helde the same.  </l>
<l>And where she woulde have taken God to witnesse that the shame</l>
<l>And villanie was wrought to hir by violence, she was fayne</l>
<l>To use hir hand in stead of speache. Then Progne chaaft amaine,</l>
<l>And was not able in hir selfe hir choler to restraine.</l>
<l>But blaming Philomela for hir weeping, said these wordes:</l>
<l>Thou must not deale in this behalfe with weeping, but with swordes:</l>
<l>Or with some thing of greater force than swords. For my part, I</l>
<l>Am readie, yea and fully bent all mischiefe for to trie.</l>
<l>This pallace will I eyther set on fire, and in the same</l>
<l>Bestow the cursed Tereus the worker of our shame:           </l>
<l>Or pull away his tongue: or put out both his eyes: or cut</l>
<l>Away those members which have thee to such dishonor put:</l>
<l>Or with a thousand woundes expulse that sinfull soule of his.</l>
<l>The thing that I doe purpose on is great, what ere it is.</l>
<l>I know not what it may be yet. While Progne hereunto</l>
<l>Did set hir minde, came Itys in, who taught hir what to doe.</l>
<l>She staring on him cruelly, said: Ah, how like thou art</l>
<l>Thy wicked father, and without moe wordes a sorowfull part</l>
<l>She purposed, such inward ire was boyling in hir heart.</l>
<l>But notwithstanding when hir sonne approched to hir neare,  </l>
<l>And lovingly had greeted hir by name of mother deare,</l>
<l>And with his pretie armes about the necke had hugde hir fast,</l>
<l>And flattring wordes with childish toyes in kissing forth had cast,</l>
<l>The mothers heart of hirs was then constreyned to relent,</l>
<l>Asswaged wholy was the rage to which she erst was bent,     </l>
<l>And from hir eyes against hir will the teares enforced went.</l>
<l>But when she saw how pitie did compell hir heart to yeelde,</l>
<l>She turned to hir sisters face from Itys, and behelde</l>
<l>Now t'one, now tother earnestly and said: Why tattles he</l>
<l>And she sittes dumbe bereft of tongue? as well why calles not she    </l>
<l>Me sister, as this boy doth call me mother? Seest thou not,</l>
<l>Thou daughter of Pandion, what a husband thou hast got?</l>
<l>Thou growest wholy out of kinde. To such a husband as</l>
<l>Is Tereus, pitie is a sinne. No more delay there was.</l>
<l>She dragged Itys after hir, as when it happes in <placeName key="tgn,7000198">Inde</placeName> </l>
<l>A Tyger gets a little Calfe that suckes upon a Hynde</l>
<l>And drags him through the shadie woods. And when that they had found</l>
<l>A place within the house far off and far above the ground,</l>
<l>Then Progne strake him with a sword now plainly seeing whother</l>
<l>He should, and holding up his handes, and crying mother, mother,  </l>
<l>And flying to hir necke: even where the brest and side doe bounde,</l>
<l>And never turnde away hir face. Inough had bene that wound</l>
<l>Alone to bring him to his ende. The tother sister slit</l>
<l>His throte. And while some life and soule was in his members yit,</l>
<l>In gobbits they them rent: whereof were some in Pipkins boyld,    </l>
<l>And other some on hissing spits against the fire were broyld,</l>
<l>And with the gellied bloud of him was all the chamber foyld.</l>
<l>To this same banquet Progne bade hir husband knowing nought</l>
<l>Nor nought mistrusting of the harme and lewdnesse she had wrought.</l>

<l>King Tereus sitting in the throne of his forefathers, fed</l>
<l>And swallowed downe the selfesame flesh that of his bowels bred.   </l>
<l>And he (so blinded was his heart) Fetch Itys hither, sed.</l>
<l>No lenger hir most cruell joy dissemble could the Queene.</l>
<l>But of hir murther coveting the messenger to beene,</l>
<l>She said: The thing thou askest for, thou hast within. About</l>
<l>He looked round, and asked where? To put him out of dout,    </l>
<l>As he was yet demaunding where, and calling for him: out</l>
<l>Lept Philomele with scattred haire aflaight like one that fled</l>
<l>Had from some fray where slaughter was, and threw the bloudy head</l>
<l>Of Itys in his fathers face. And never more was shee</l>
<l>Desirous to have had hir speache, that able she might be</l>
<l>Hir inward joy with worthie wordes to witnesse franke and free.</l>
<l>The tyrant with a hideous noyse away the table shoves:</l>
<l>And reeres the fiends from Hell. One while with yawning mouth he proves</l>
<l>To perbrake up his meate againe, and cast his bowels out.</l>
<l>Another while with wringing handes he weeping goes about.    </l>
<l>And of his sonne he termes himselfe the wretched grave. Anon</l>
<l>With naked sword and furious heart he followeth fierce upon</l>
<l>Pandions daughters. He that had bene present would have deemde</l>
<l>Their bodies to have hovered up with fethers. As they seemde,</l>
<l>So hovered they with wings in deede. Of whome the one away    </l>
<l>To woodward flies, the other still about the house doth stay.</l>
<l>And of their murther from their brestes not yet the token goth,</l>
<l>For even still yet are stainde with bloud the fethers of them both.</l>
<l>And he through sorrow and desire of vengeance waxing wight,</l>
<l>Became a Bird upon whose top a tuft of feathers light          </l>
<l>In likenesse of a Helmets crest doth trimly stand upright.</l>
<l>In stead of his long sword, his bill shootes out a passing space:</l>
<l>A Lapwing named is this Bird, all armed seemes his face.

<div2 type="card" n="675">

<l>The sorrow of this great mischaunce did stop Pandions breath</l>
<l>Before his time, and long ere age determinde had his death.    </l>
<l>Erecthey reigning after him the government did take:</l>
<l>A Prince of such a worthinesse as no man well can make</l>
<l>Resolution, if he more in armes or justice did excell.</l>
<l>Foure sonnes, and daughters foure he had. Of which a couple well</l>
<l>Did eche in beautie other match. The one of these whose name    </l>
<l>Was Procris unto Cephalus, King Aeolus sonne, became</l>
<l>A happie wife. The Thracians and King Tereus were a let</l>
<l>To Boreas: so that long it was before the God could gt</l>
<l>His dearbeloved Orithya, while trifling he did stand</l>
<l>With faire entreatance rather than did use the force of hand.   </l>
<l>But when he saw he no reliefe by gentle meanes could finde,</l>
<l>Then turning unto boystous wrath (which unto that same winde</l>
<l>Is too familiar and too much accustomed by kinde)</l>
<l>He said: I served am but well: for whylaid I apart</l>
<l>My proper weapons, fiercenesse, force, and ire, and cruell hart?  </l>
<l>And fell to fauning like a foole, which did me but disgrace?</l>
<l>For me is violence meete. Through this the pestred cloudes I chace.</l>
<l>Through this I tosse the Seas. Through this I turne up knottie Okes,</l>
<l>And harden Snow, and beate the ground in hayle with sturdie strokes,</l>
<l>When I my brothers chaunce to get in open Ayre and Skie.       </l>
<l>(For that is my fielde in the which my maisteries I doe trie)</l>
<l>I charge upon them with such brunt, that of our meeting smart</l>
<l>The Heaven betweene us soundes, and from the hollow Cloudes doth start</l>
<l>Enforced fire. And when I come in holes of hollow ground,</l>
<l>And fiersly in those emptie caves doe rouse my backe up round,  </l>
<l>I trouble even the ghostes, and make the verie world to quake.</l>
<l>This helpe in wooing of my wife (to speede) I should have take.</l>
<l>Erecthey should not have bene prayde my Fatherinlaw to bee:</l>
<l>He should have bene compelde thereto by stout extremitie.</l>
<l>In speaking these or other wordes as sturdie, Boreas gan  </l>
<l>To flaske his wings. With waving of the which he raysed than</l>
<l>So great a gale, that all the earth was blasted therewithall,</l>
<l>And troubled was the maine brode Sea. And as he traylde his pall</l>
<l>Bedusted over highest tops of things, he swept the ground.</l>
<l>And having now in smokie cloudes himselfe enclosed round,</l>
<l>Betweene his duskie wings he caught Orithya straught for feare,</l>
<l>And like a lover, verie soft and easly did hir beare.</l>
<l>And as he flew, the flames of love enkindled more and more</l>
<l>By meanes of stirring. Neither did he stay his flight before</l>
<l>He came within the land and towne of Cicons with his pray. </l>
<l>And there soone after being made his wife she hapt to lay</l>
<l>Hir belly, and a paire of boyes she at a burthen brings,</l>
<l>Who else in all resembled full their mother, save in wings</l>
<l>The which they of their father tooke. Howbeit (by report)</l>
<l>They were not borne with wings upon their bodies in this sort. </l>
<l>While <placeName key="tgn,7009002">Calais</placeName> and Zetes had no beard upon their chin,</l>
<l>They both were callow. But as soone as haire did once begin</l>
<l>In likenesse of a yellow Downe upon their cheekes to sprout,</l>
<l>Then (even as comes to passe in Birdes) the feathers budded out</l>
<l>Togither on their pinyons too, and spreaded round about</l>
<l>On both their sides. And finally when childhod once was spent</l>
<l>And youth come on, togither they with other Minyes went</l>
<l>To Colchos in the Galley that was first devisde in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>,</l>

<l>And now in ship of Pagasa the Mynies cut the seas.</l>
<l>And leading under endlesse night his age in great disease</l>
<l>Of scarcitie was Phiney seene, and Boreas sonnes had chaste</l>
<l>Away the Maidenfaced foules that did his victels waste.</l>
<l>And after suffring many things in noble Jasons band,        </l>
<l>In muddie <placeName key="tgn,7012263">Phasis</placeName> gushing streame at last they went aland.</l>
<l>There while they going to the King demaund the golden fleece</l>
<l>Brought thither certaine yeares before by Phryxus out of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>,</l>
<l>And of their dreadfull labors wait an answere to receive:</l>
<l>Aeetas daughter in hir heart doth mightie flames conceyve.  </l>
<l>And after strugling verie long, when reason could not win</l>
<l>The upper hand of rage: she thus did in hir selfe begin:</l>
<l>In vaine, Medea, doste thou strive: some God what ere he is</l>
<l>Against thee bendes his force. For what a wondrous thing is this?</l>
<l>Is any thing like this which men doe terme by name of Love?  </l>
<l>For why should I my fathers hestes esteeme so hard above</l>
<l>All measure? sure in very deede they are too hard and sore.</l>
<l>Why feare I lest yon straunger whome I never saw before</l>
<l>Should perish? what should be the cause of this my feare so great?</l>
<l>Unhappie wench (and if thou canst) suppresse this uncouth heat   </l>
<l>That burneth in thy tender brest: and if so be I coulde,</l>
<l>A happie turne it were, and more at ease then be I shoulde.</l>
<l>But now an uncouth maladie perforce against my will</l>
<l>Doth hale me. Love persuades me one, another thing my skill.</l>
<l>The best I see and like: the worst I follow headlong still.  </l>
<l>Why being of the royall bloud so fondly doste thou rave,</l>
<l>Upon a straunger thus to dote, desiring for to have</l>
<l>An husband of another world? at home thou mightest finde</l>
<l>A lover meete for thine estate on whome to set thy minde.</l>
<l>And yet it is but even a chaunce if he shall live or no:      </l>
<l>God graunt him for to live. I may without offence pray so,</l>
<l>Although I lovde him not: for what hath Jason trespast me?</l>
<l>Who woulde not pitie Jasons youth onlesse they cruell be?</l>
<l>What creature is there but his birth and prowesse might him move?</l>
<l>And setting all the rest asyde, who woulde not be in love     </l>
<l>With Jasons goodlie personage? my heart assuredly</l>
<l>Is toucht therewith. But if that I provide not remedie,</l>
<l>With burning breath of blasting Bulles needes sindged must he bee.</l>
<l>Of seedes that he himselfe must sow a harvest shall he see</l>
<l>Of armed men in battell ray upon the ground up grow           </l>
<l>Against the which it hoveth him his manhode for to show.</l>
<l>And as a pray he must be set against the Dragon fell.</l>
<l>If I these things let come to passe, I may confesse right well</l>
<l>That of a Tyger I was bred: and that within my brest</l>
<l>A heart more harde than any steele or stonie rocke doth rest.  </l>
<l>Why rather doe I not his death with wrathfull eyes beholde?</l>
<l>And joy with others seeing him to utter perill solde?</l>
<l>Why doe I not enforce the Bulles against him? Why, I say,</l>
<l>Exhort I not the cruell men which shall in battell ray</l>
<l>Arise against him from the ground? and that same Dragon too   </l>
<l>Within whose eyes came never sleepe? God shield I so should doo.</l>
<l>But prayer smally bootes, except I put to helping hand.</l>
<l>And shall I like a Caytife then betray my fathers land?</l>
<l>Shall I a straunger save whome we nor none of ours doth know?</l>
<l>That he by me preserved may without me homeward row?           </l>
<l>And take another to his wife, and leave me, wretched wight,</l>
<l>To torments? If I wist that he coulde worke me such a spight,</l>
<l>Or could in any others love than only mine delight,</l>
<l>The Churle should die for me. But sure he beareth not the face</l>
<l>Like one that wold doe so. His birth, his courage, and his grace  </l>
<l>Doe put me clearly out of doubt he will not me deceyve,</l>
<l>No nor forget the great good turnes he shall by me receyve.</l>
<l>Yet shall he to me first his faith for more assurance plight</l>
<l>And solemly he shall be sworne to keepe the covenant right.</l>
<l>Why fearste thou now without a cause? step to it out of hand:     </l>
<l>And doe not any lenger time thus lingring fondly stand.</l>
<l>For ay shall Jason thinke himselfe beholding unto thee:</l>
<l>And shall thee marrie solemly: yea honored shalt thou bee</l>
<l>Of all the Mothers great and small throughout the townes of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName></l>
<l>For saving of their sonnes that come to fetch the golden fleece.  </l>
<l>And shall I then leave brother, sister, father, kith and kin?</l>
<l>And household Gods, and native soyle, and all that is therein?</l>
<l>And saile I know not whither with a straunger? Yea: why not?</l>
<l>My father surely cruell is, my Countrie rude God wot:</l>
<l>My brother yet a verie babe: my sister I dare say</l>
<l>Contented is with all hir heart that I should go away:</l>
<l>The greatest God is in my selfe: the things I doe forsake</l>
<l>Are trifles in comparison of those that I shall take.</l>
<l>For saving of the Greekish ship renoumed shall I bee.</l>
<l>A better place I shall enjoy with Cities riche and free, </l>
<l>Whose fame doth florish fresh even here, and people that excell</l>
<l>In civill life and all good Artes: and whome I would not sell</l>
<l>For all the goods within the worlde, Duke Aesons noble sonne.</l>
<l>Whome had I to my lawfull Feere assuredly once wonne,</l>
<l>Most happie yea and blest of God I might my selfe account,        </l>
<l>And with my head above the starres to heaven I should surmount.</l>
<l>But men report that certaine rockes (I know not what) doe meete</l>
<l>Amid the waves, and monstrously againe asunder fleete:</l>
<l>And how Charybdis, utter foe to ships that passe thereby,</l>
<l>Now sowpeth in, now speweth out the Sea incessantly:              </l>
<l>And ravening Scylla being hemde with cruell dogs about,</l>
<l>Amids the gulfe of Sicilie doth make a barking out.</l>
<l>What skilleth that? As long as I enjoy the thing I love,</l>
<l>And hang about my Jasons necke, it shall no whit me move</l>
<l>To saile the daungerous Seas: as long as him I may embrace        </l>
<l>I cannot surely be afraide in any kinde of case.</l>
<l>Or if I chaunce to be afraide, my feare shall only tende</l>
<l>But for my husband. Callste thou him thy husband? Doste pretende</l>
<l>Gay titles to thy foule offence, Medea? nay not so:</l>
<l>But rather looke about how great a lewdnesse thou doste go,  </l>
<l>And shun the mischiefe while thou mayst. She had no sooner said</l>
<l>These wordes, but right and godlinesse and shamefastnesse were staid</l>
<l>Before hir eyes, and frantick love did flie away dismaid.</l>
<l>She went me to an Altar that was dedicate of olde</l>
<l>To Perseys daughter Hecate (of whome the witches holde   </l>
<l>As of their Goddesse) standing in a thicke and secrete wood</l>
<l>So close it coulde not well be spide: and now the raging mood</l>
<l>Of furious love was well alaide and clearely put to flight:</l>
<l>When spying Aesons sonne, the flame that seemed quenched quight</l>
<l>Did kindle out of hand againe. Hir cheekes began to glowe,</l>
<l>And flushing over all hir face the scarlet bloud did flowe.</l>
<l>And even as when a little sparke that was in ashes hid,</l>
<l>Uncovered with the whisking windes is from the ashes rid,</l>
<l>Eftsoones it taketh nourishment and kindleth in such wise,</l>
<l>That to his former strength againe and flaming it doth rise:  </l>
<l>Even so hir quailed love which late ye would have thought had quight</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,1052372">Bene</placeName> vanisht out of minde, as soone as Jason came in sight</l>
<l>Did kindle to his former force in vewing of the grace</l>
<l>With which he did avaunce himselfe then comming there in place.</l>
<l>And (as it chaunced) farre more faire and beautifull of face  </l>
<l>She thought him then than ever erst, but sure it doth behove</l>
<l>Hir judgement should be borne withall bicause she was in love.</l>
<l>She gapte and gazed in his face with fixed staring eyen</l>
<l>As though she never had him seene before that instant time.</l>
<l>So farre she was beside hir selfe she thought it should not bee  </l>
<l>The face of any worldly wight the which she then did see.</l>
<l>She was not able for hir life to turne hir eyes away,</l>
<l>But when he tooke hir by the hand and speaking gan to pray</l>
<l>Hir softly for to succor him, and promisde faithfully</l>
<l>To take hir to his wedded wife, she falling by and by      </l>
<l>A weeping, said: Sir, what I doe I see apparantly.</l>
<l>Not want of knowledge of the truth but love shall me deceive.</l>
<l>You shalbe saved by my meanes. And now I must receive</l>
<l>A faithfull promise at your hand for saving of your life.</l>
<l>He made a solemne vow, and sware to take hir to his wife,  </l>
<l>By triple Hecates holie rites, and by what other power</l>
<l>So ever else had residence within that secret bower,</l>
<l>And by the Sire of him that should his Fathrinlaw become</l>
<l>Who all things doth behold, and as he hopte to overcome</l>
<l>The dreadfull daungers which he had soone after to assay. </l>
<l>Duke Jason being credited receivde of hir streight way</l>
<l>Enchaunted herbes: and having learnde the usage of the same,</l>
<l>Departed thence with merrie heart, and to his lodging came.</l>
<l>Next Morne had chaste the streaming stars: and folke by heapes did flocke</l>
<l>To Marsis sacred field, and there stoode thronging in a shocke, </l>
<l>To see the straunge pastimes. The King most stately to beholde</l>
<l>With yvorie Mace above them all did sit in throne of golde.</l>
<l>Anon the brazenhoved Bulles from stonie nostrils cast</l>
<l>Out flakes of fire: their scalding breath the growing grasse did blast.</l>
<l>And looke what noise a chimney full of burning fewell makes,   </l>
<l>Or Flint in softning in the Kell when first the fire it takes</l>
<l>By sprincling water thereupon: such noyse their boyling brests</l>
<l>Turmoyling with the firie flames enclosed in their chests,</l>
<l>Such noise their scorched throtebolles make. Yet stoutly Jason went</l>
<l>To meete them. They their dreadfull eyes against him grimly bent, '</l>
<l>And eke their homes with yron tipt: and strake the dust about</l>
<l>In stamping with their cloven clees: and with their belowing out</l>
<l>Set all the fielde upon a smoke. The Mynies seeing that</l>
<l>Were past their wits with sodaine feare, but Jason feeled nat</l>
<l>So much as any breath of theirs: such strength hath sorcerie.  </l>
<l>Their dangling Dewlaps with his hand he coyd unfearfully.</l>
<l>And putting yokes upon their neckes he forced them to draw</l>
<l>The heavie burthen of the plough which erst they never saw,</l>
<l>And for to breake the fielde which erst had never felt the share.</l>
<l>The men of Colchos seeing this, like men amazed fare.          </l>
<l>The Mynies with their shouting out their mazednesse augment,</l>
<l>And unto Jason therewithall give more encouragement.</l>
<l>Then in a souldiers cap of steele a Vipers teeth he takes,</l>
<l>And sowes them in the new plowde fielde. The ground then soking makes</l>
<l>The seede foresteepte in poyson strong, both supple lithe and soft,  </l>
<l>And of these teeth a right straunge graine there growes anon aloft.</l>
<l>For even as in the mothers wombe an infant doth begin</l>
<l>To take the lively shape of man, and formed is within</l>
<l>To due proportion piece by piece in every limme, and when</l>
<l>Full ripe he is, he takes the use of Aire with other men:      </l>
<l>So when that of the Vipers teeth the perfect shape of man</l>
<l>Within the bowels of the earth was formed, they began</l>
<l>To rise togither orderly upon the fruitefull fielde:</l>
<l>And (which a greater wonder is) immediatly they wielde</l>
<l>Their weapons growing up with them, whom when the Greekes behilde </l>
<l>Preparing for to push their Pikes (which sharply headed were)</l>
<l>In Jasons face, downe went their heades, their heartes did faint for feare:</l>
<l>And also she that made him safe began abasht to bee.</l>
<l>For when against one naked man so huge an armie shee</l>
<l>Beheld of armed enmies bent, hir colour did abate             </l>
<l>And sodainly both voyd of bloud and livelie heate she sate.</l>
<l>And lest the chaunted weedes the which she had him given before</l>
<l>Should faile at neede, a helping charme she whispred overmore,</l>
<l>And practisde other secret Artes the which she kept in store.</l>
<l>He casting streight a mightie stone amid his thickest foes,  </l>
<l>Doth voyde the battell from him selfe and turnes it unto those.</l>
<l>These earthbred brothers by and by did one another wound</l>
<l>And never ceased till that all lay dead upon the ground.</l>
<l>The Greekes were glad, and in their armes did clasp their Champion stout,</l>
<l>And clinging to him earnestly embraced him about.            </l>
<l>And thou  fond Medea too couldst well have found in hart</l>
<l>The Champion for to have embraste, but that withheld thou wart</l>
<l>By shamefastnesse, and yet thou hadst embraced him, if dread</l>
<l>Of stayning of thine honor had not staid thee in that stead.</l>
<l>But yet as far forth as thou maist, thou doste in heart rejoyce,  </l>
<l>And secretly (although without expressing it in voyce)</l>
<l>Doste thanke thy charmes and eke the Gods as Authors of the same.</l>
<l>Now was remaining as the last conclusion of this game,</l>
<l>By force of chaunted herbes to make the watchfull Dragon sleepe</l>
<l>Within whose eyes came never winke: who had in charge to keepe </l>
<l>The goodly tree upon the which the golden fleeces hung.</l>
<l>With crested head, and hooked pawes, and triple spirting tung,</l>
<l>Right ougly was he to beholde. When Jason had besprent</l>
<l>Him with the juice of certaine herbes from Lethey River sent,</l>
<l>And thrice had mumbled certaine wordes which are of force to cast </l>
<l>So sound a sleepe on things that even as dead a time they last,</l>
<l>Which make the raging surges calme and flowing Rivers stay,</l>
<l>The dreadfull Dragon by and by (whose eyes before that day</l>
<l>Wist never erst what sleeping ment) did fall so fast asleepe</l>
<l>That Jason safely tooke the fleece of golde that he did keepe.  </l>
<l>Of which his bootie being proud, he led with him away</l>
<l>The Author of his good successe another fairer pray:</l>
<l>And so with conquest and a wife he loosde from Colchos strand,</l>
<l>And in <placeName key="perseus,Larissa">Larissa</placeName> haven safe did go againe aland.

<l>And cover all the Skie with Cloudes and chase them thence againe. </l>
<l>By charmes I raise and lay the windes, and burst the Vipers jaw.</l>

<l>The flaming breath of firie Bulles ye quenched for my sake</l>

<l>As soone as she had gotten up, and with hir hand had coyd  </l>
<l>The Dragons reined neckes, and with their bridles somewhat toyd,</l>
<l>They mounted with hir in the Ayre, whence looking downe she saw</l>
<l>The pleasant Temp of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessalie</placeName>, and made hir Dragons draw</l>

<l>Upon the bankes of Apidane agreeing to hir minde: </l>
<l>And many at Amphrisus foords: and thou Enipeus eke</l>

<l>About <placeName key="perseus,Anthedon">Anthedon</placeName> which against the Ile Euboea standes, </l>

<l>And thrise with brimstone, thrise with fire, and thrise with water pure</l>
<l>She purged Aesons aged corse that slept and slumbred sure.</l>
<l>The medicine seething all the while a wallop in a pan</l>
<l>Of brasse, to spirt and leape aloft and gather froth began.</l>

<l>Which from the fieldes of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessalie</placeName> she late had gathered thither.</l>
<l>She cast in also precious stones fetcht from the furthest East</l>
<l>And, which the ebbing Ocean washt, fine gravell from the West.</l>
<l>She put thereto the deaw that fell upon a Monday night:</l>
<l>And flesh and feathers of a Witch, a cursed odious wight      </l>
<l>Which in the likenesse of an Owle abrode a nightes did flie,</l>

<l>And where the fire had from the pan the scumming cast, or where</l>
<l>The scalding drops did fall, the ground did springlike florish there,</l>
<l>And flowres with fodder fine and soft immediatly arose. </l>
<l>Which when Medea did behold, with naked knife she goes</l>

<l>As well of head as beard from gray to coleblacke turned were.</l>
<l>His leane, pale, hore, and withered corse grew fulsome, faire and fresh:</l>

<l>And lest deceitfull guile should cease, Medea found a shift </l>

<l>And after of his mothers name <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> callde the same.</l>
<l>The common folke ran out by heapes desirous for to see</l>
<l>A man of such renowne as Minos bruited was to bee.        </l>
<l>The Kings three sonnes Duke Telamon, Duke Peley, and the yong</l>
<l>Duke Phocus went to meete with him. Old Aeacus also clung</l>
<l>With age, came after leysurely, and asked him the cause</l>
<l>Of his repaire. The ruler of the hundred Shires gan pause:</l>
<l>And musing on the inward griefe that nipt him at the hart,  </l>
<l>Did shape him aunswere thus: O Prince vouchsafe to take my part</l>
<l>In this same godly warre of mine: assist me in the just</l>
<l>Revengement of my murthred sonne that sleepeth in the dust.</l>
<l>I crave your comfort for his death. Aeginas sonne replide:</l>
<l>Thy suite is vaine: and of my Realme perforce must be denide.    </l>
<l>For unto <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> is no lande more sure than this alide:</l>
<l>Such leagues betweene us are which shall infringde for me abide.</l>
<l>Away went Minos sad: and said: full dearly shalt thou bie</l>
<l>Thy leagues. He thought it for to be a better pollicie</l>
<l>To threaten war than war to make, and there to spend his store    </l>
<l>And strength which in his other needes might much availe him more.</l>
<l>As yet might from Oenopia walles the Cretish fleete be kend.</l>
<l>When thitherward with puffed sayles and wind at will did tend</l>
<l>A ship from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, which anon arriving at the strand</l>
<l>Set Cephal with Ambassade from his Countrimen aland.      </l>
<l>The Kings three sonnes though long it were since last they had him seene,</l>
<l>Yet knew they him. And after olde acquaintance eft had beene</l>
<l>Renewde by shaking hands, to Court they did him streight convay.</l>
<l>This Prince which did allure the eyes of all men by the way,</l>
<l>As in whose stately person still remained to be seene      </l>
<l>The markes of beautie which in flowre of former yeares had beene,</l>
<l>Went holding out an Olife braunch that grew in Atticke lande</l>
<l>And for the reverence of his age there went on eyther hand</l>
<l>A Nobleman of yonger yeares. Sir Clytus on the right</l>
<l>And Butes on the left, the sonnes of one that Pallas hight.  </l>
<l>When greeting first had past betweene these Nobles and the King,</l>
<l>Then Cephal setting streight abroche the message he did bring,</l>
<l>Desired aide: and shewde what leagues stoode then in force betweene</l>
<l>His countrie and the Aeginites, and also what had beene</l>
<l>Decreed betwixt their aunceters, concluding in the ende </l>
<l>That under colour of this war which Minos did pretende</l>
<l>To only <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, he in deede the conquest did intende</l>
<l>Of all <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>. When he thus by helpe of learned skill</l>
<l>His countrie message furthred had, King Aeacus leaning still</l>
<l>His left hand on his scepter, saide: My Lordes, I would not have    </l>
<l>Your state of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> seeme so straunge as succor here to crave.</l>
<l>I pray commaund. For be ye sure that what this Ile can make</l>
<l>Is yours. Yea all that ere I have shall hazard for your sake.</l>
<l>I want no strength. I have such store of souldiers, that I may</l>
<l>Both vex my foes and also keepe my Realme in quiet stay.   </l>
<l>And now I thinke me blest of God that time doth serve to showe</l>
<l>Without excuse the great good will that I to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> owe.</l>
<l>God holde it sir (quoth Cephalus) God make the number grow</l>
<l>Of people in this towne of yours: it did me good alate</l>
<l>When such a goodly sort of youth of all one age and rate         </l>
<l>Did meete me in the streete. But yet me thinkes that many misse</l>
<l>Which at my former being here I have beheld ere this.</l>
<l>At that the King did sigh, and thus with plaintfull voice did say:</l>
<l>A sad beginning afterward in better lucke did stay.</l>
<l>I would I plainly could the same before your faces lay.           </l>
<l>Howbeit I will disorderly repeate it as I may.</l>
<l>And lest I seeme to wearie you with overlong delay,</l>
<l>The men that you so mindefully enquire for lie in ground</l>
<l>And nought of them save bones and dust remayneth to be found.</l>
<l>But as it hapt what losse thereby did unto me redound?            </l>
<l>A cruell plague through Junos wrath who dreadfully did hate</l>
<l>This Land that of hir husbands Love did take the name alate,</l>
<l>Upon my people fell: as long as that the maladie</l>
<l>None other seemde than such as haunts mans nature usually,</l>
<l>And of so great mortalitie the hurtfull cause was hid,            </l>
<l>We strove by Phisicke of the same the Pacients for to rid.</l>
<l>The mischief overmaistred Art: yea Phisick was to seeke</l>
<l>To doe it selfe good. First the Aire with foggie stinking reeke</l>
<l>Did daily overdreepe the earth: and close culme Clouds did make</l>
<l>The wether faint: and while the Moone foure times hir light did take </l>
<l>And fillde hir emptie homes therewith, and did as often slake:</l>
<l>The warme South windes with deadly heate continually did blow.</l>
<l>Infected were the Springs, and Ponds, and streames that ebbe and flow.</l>
<l>And swarmes of Serpents crawld about the fieldes that lay untillde</l>
<l>Which with their poison even the brookes and running water fillde. </l>
<l>In sodaine dropping downe of Dogs, of Horses, Sheepe and Kine,</l>
<l>Of Birds and Beasts both wild and tame as Oxen, Wolves, and Swine,</l>
<l>The mischiefe of this secret sore first outwardly appeeres.</l>
<l>The wretched Plowman was amazde to see his sturdie Steeres</l>
<l>Amid the furrow sinking downe ere halfe his worke was donne.    </l>
<l>Whole flocks of sheepe did faintly bleate, and therewithall begonne</l>
<l>Their fleeces for to fall away and leave the naked skin,</l>
<l>And all their bodies with the rot attainted were within.</l>
<l>The lustie Horse that erst was fierce in field renowne to win</l>
<l>Against his kinde grew cowardly: and now forgetting quight        </l>
<l>The auncient honor which he preast so oft to get in fight,</l>
<l>Stoode sighing sadly at the Racke as wayting for to yeelde</l>
<l>His wearie life without renowne of combat in the fielde.</l>
<l>The Boare to chafe, the Hinde to runne, the cruell Beare to fall</l>
<l>Upon the herdes of <placeName key="tgn,1129200">Rother</placeName> beastes had now no lust at all.        </l>
<l>A languishing was falne on all. In wayes, in woods, in plaines,</l>
<l>The filthie carions lay, whose stinche, the Ayre it selfe distaines.</l>
<l>(A wondrous thing to tell) not Dogges, not ravening Foules, nor yit</l>
<l>Horecoted Wolves would once attempt to tast of them a bit.</l>
<l>Looke, where they fell, there rotted they: and with their savor bred  </l>
<l>More harme, and further still abrode the foule infection spred.

<l>With losse that touched yet more nere, on Husbandmen it crept,</l>
<l>And ragingly within the walles of this great Citie stept.</l>
<l>It tooke men first with swelting heate that scalt their guts within:</l>
<l>The signes whereof were steaming breath and firie colourde skin.   </l>
<l>The tongue was harsh and swolne, the mouth through drought of burning veines</l>
<l>Lay gaping up to hale in breath, and as the pacient streines</l>
<l>To draw it in, he suckes therewith corrupted Aire beside.</l>
<l>No bed, no clothes though nere so thinne the pacients could abide.</l>
<l>But laide their hardened stomackes flat against the bare colde ground </l>
<l>Yet no abatement of the heate therein their bodies found:</l>
<l>But het the earth, and as for Leache was none that helpe could hight.</l>
<l>The Surgians and Phisitions too were in the selfesame plight.</l>
<l>Their curelesse cunning hurt themselves. The nerer any man</l>
<l>Approcheth his diseased friend, and doth the best he can</l>
<l>To succor him most faithfully, the sooner did he catch</l>
<l>His bane. All hope of health was gone. No easment nor dispatch</l>
<l>Of this disease except in death and buriall did they finde.</l>
<l>Looke, whereunto that eche mans minde and fancie was enclinde,</l>
<l>That followed he. He never past what was for his behoofe.        </l>
<l>For why? that nought could doe them good was felt too much by proofe.</l>
<l>In everie place without respect of shame or honestie</l>
<l>At <placeName key="tgn,7012348">Wels</placeName>, at brookes, at ponds, at pits, by swarmes they thronging lie:</l>
<l>But sooner might they quench their life than staunch their thirst thereby.</l>
<l>And therewithall so heavie and unwieldie they become,            </l>
<l>That wanting power to rise againe, they died there. Yet some</l>
<l>The selfesame waters guzled still without regard of feare,</l>
<l>So weary of their lothsome beds the wretched people were,</l>
<l>That out they lept: or if to stand their feeble force denide,</l>
<l>They wallowed downe and out of doores immediatly them hide:    </l>
<l>It was a death to every man his owne house to abide.</l>
<l>And for they did not know the cause whereof the sicknesse came,</l>
<l>The place (bicause they did it know) was blamed for the same.</l>
<l>Ye should have seene some halfe fordead go plundring here and there</l>
<l>By highways sides while that their legges were able them to beare.  </l>
<l>And some lie weeping on the ground or rolling piteously</l>
<l>Their wearie eyes which afterwards should never see the Skie:</l>
<l>Or stretching out their limmes to Heaven that overhangs on hie,</l>
<l>Some here, some there, and yonder some, in what so ever coste</l>
<l>Death finding them enforced them to yeelde their fainting Ghoste. </l>
<l>What heart had I, suppose you, then, or ought I then to have?</l>
<l>In faith I might have lothde my life, and wisht me in my grave</l>
<l>As other of my people were. I could not cast mine eie</l>
<l>In any place, but that dead folke there strowed I did spie</l>
<l>Even like as from a shaken twig when rotten Apples drop,    </l>
<l>Or Mast from Beches, Holmes or Okes when Poales doe scare their top.</l>
<l>Yon stately Church with greeces long against our Court you see:</l>
<l>It is the shrine of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>. What Wight was he or shee</l>
<l>That on those Altars burned not their frankincense in vaine?</l>
<l>How oft, yet even with Frankincense that partly did remaine  </l>
<l>Still unconsumed in their hands, did die both man and wife,</l>
<l>As ech of them with mutuall care did pray for others life?</l>
<l>How often dyde the mother there in suing for hir sonne,</l>
<l>Unheard upon the Altarstone, hir prayer scarce begonne?</l>
<l>How often at the Temple doore even while the Priest did bid  </l>
<l>His Beades, and poure pure wine betwene their homes, at sodaine slid</l>
<l>The Oxen downe without stroke given? Yea once when I had thought</l>
<l>My selfe by offring sacrifice Joves favor to have sought,</l>
<l>For me, my Realme, and these three ymps, the Oxe with grievous grone</l>
<l>Upon the sodaine sunke me downe: and little bloud or none   </l>
<l>Did issue scarce to staine the knife with which they slit his throte.</l>
<l>The sickly inwardes eke had lost the signes whereby we note</l>
<l>What things the Gods for certaintie would warne us of before:</l>
<l>For even the verie bowels were attainted with the sore.</l>
<l>Before the holie Temple doores, and (that the death might bee    </l>
<l>The more dispitefull) even before the Altars did I see</l>
<l>The stinking corses scattred. Some with haltars stopt their winde,</l>
<l>By death expulsing feare of death: and of a wilfull minde</l>
<l>Did haste their ende, which of it selfe was coming on apace.</l>
<l>The bodies which the plague had slaine were (O most wretched case) </l>
<l>Not caried forth to buriall now. For why such store there was</l>
<l>That scarce the gates were wyde inough for Coffins forth to passe.</l>
<l>So eyther lothly on the ground unburied did they lie,</l>
<l>Or else without solemnitie were burnt in bonfires hie.</l>
<l>No reverence nor regard was had. Men fell togither by            </l>
<l>The eares for firing. In the fire that was prepared for one</l>
<l>Another straungers corse was burnt. And lastly few or none</l>
<l>Were left to mourne. The sillie soules of Mothers with their small</l>
<l>And tender babes, and age with youth as Fortune did befall</l>
<l>Went wandring gastly up and downe unmourned for at all.          </l>
<l>In fine so farre outrageously this helpelesse <placeName key="tgn,1064217">Murren</placeName> raves,</l>
<l>There was not wood inough for fire, nor ground inough for graves.</l>
<l>Astonied at the stourenesse of so stout a storme of ills</l>
<l>I said: O father <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> whose mightie power fulfills</l>
<l>Both Heaven and Earth, if flying fame report thee not amisse     </l>
<l>In vouching that thou didst embrace in way of Love ere this</l>
<l>The River Asops daughter, faire <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> even by name,</l>
<l>And that to take me for thy sonne thou count it not a shame:</l>
<l>Restore thou me my folke againe, or kill thou me likewise.</l>
<l>He gave a signe by sodaine flash of lightning from the Skies,    </l>
<l>And double peale of Thundercracks. I take this same (quoth I)</l>
<l>And as I take it for a true and certaine signe whereby</l>
<l>Thou doest confirme me for thy sonne: so also let it be</l>
<l>A hansell of some happie lucke thou mindest unto me.</l>
<l>Hard by us as it hapt that time, there was an Oken tree           </l>
<l>With spreaded armes as bare of boughes as lightly one shall see.</l>
<l>This tree (as all the rest of Okes) was sacred unto Jove</l>
<l>And sprouted of an Acorne which was fet from Dodon grove.</l>
<l>Here markt we how the pretie Ants, the gatherers up of graine,</l>
<l>One following other all along in order of a traine,               </l>
<l>Great burthens in their little mouthes did painfully sustaine:</l>
<l>And nimbly up the rugged barke their beaten path maintaine.</l>
<l>As wondring at the swarme I stoode, I said: O father deere</l>
<l>As many people give thou me, as Ants are creeping heere.</l>
<l>And fill mine empty walles againe. Anon the Oke did quake,  </l>
<l>And unconstreynde of any blast, his loftie braunches shake,</l>
<l>The which did yeeld a certaine sound. With that for dreadfull feare</l>
<l>A shuddring through my bodie strake and up stoode stiffe my heare.</l>
<l>But yet I kissed reverently the ground and eke the tree.</l>
<l>Howbeit I durst not be so bolde of hope acknowne to bee.    </l>
<l>Yet hoped I: and in my heart did shroude my secret hope.

<div2 type="card" n="634">

<l>Anon came night: and sleepe upon my carefull carcasse crope.</l>
<l>Me thought I saw the selfesame Oke with all his boughes and twigs,</l>
<l>And all the Pismeres creeping still upon his tawnts and sprigs,</l>
<l>Which trembling with a sodaine brayd these Harvest folke off threw </l>
<l>And shed them on the ground about, who on the sodaine grew</l>
<l>In bignesse more and more, and from the earth themselves did lift:</l>
<l>And stoode upright against the tree: and therewithall did shift</l>
<l>Their maygernesse, and coleblacke hue, and number of their feete:</l>
<l>And clad their limmes with shape of man. Away my sleepe did fleete. </l>
<l>And when I wooke, misliking of my dreame I made my mone</l>
<l>That in the Gods I did perceive but slender helpe or none.</l>
<l>But straight much trampling up and downe and shuffling did I heare,</l>
<l>And (which to me that present time did verie straunge appeare)</l>
<l>Of people talking in my house me thought I heard the reare.  </l>
<l>Now while I musing on the same supposde it to have been</l>
<l>Some fancie of the foolish dreame which lately I had seen,</l>
<l>Behold, in comes me Telamon in hast, and thrusting ope</l>
<l>My Chamber doore, said: Sir, a sight of things surmounting hope</l>
<l>And credit shall you have: come forth. Forth came I by and by  </l>
<l>And even such men for all the world there standing did I spie</l>
<l>As in my sleepe I dreamed of, and knew them for the same.</l>
<l>They comming to me greeted me, their sovereigne Lord, by name.</l>
<l>And I (my vowes to Jove performde) my Citie did devide</l>
<l>Among my new inhabiters: and gave them land beside          </l>
<l>Which by decease of such as were late owners of the same</l>
<l>Lay wast. And in remembrance of the race whereof they came,</l>
<l>The name of Emets I them gave. Their persons you have seen:</l>
<l>Their disposition is the same that erst in them hath been.</l>
<l>They are a sparing kinde of folke, on labor wholy set,      </l>
<l>A gatherer, and a hoorder up of such as they doe get.</l>
<l>These fellowes being like in yeares and courage of the minde,</l>
<l>Shall go a warfare ny as soone as that the Easterne winde</l>
<l>Which brought you hither luckely, (the Easterne winde was it</l>

<l>With this and other such like talke they brought the day to ende.</l>
<l>The Even in feasting, and the night in sleeping they did spende.</l>
<l>The <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> next Morrow in the heaven with golden beames did burne,</l>
<l>And still the Easterne winde did blow and hold them from returne.</l>
<l>Sir Pallas sonnes to Cephal came (for he their elder was)  </l>
<l>And he and they to Aeacus Court togither forth did passe.</l>
<l>The King as yet was fast asleepe. Duke Phocus at the gate</l>
<l>Did meete them, and receyved them according to their state.</l>
<l>For Telamon and Peleus alreadie forth were gone,</l>
<l>To muster Souldiers for the warres. So Phocus all alone  </l>
<l>Did leade them to an inner roume, where goodly Parlours were,</l>
<l>And caused them to sit them downe. As he was also there</l>
<l>Now sitting with them, he beheld a Dart in Cephals hand</l>
<l>With golden head, the stele whereof he well might understand</l>
<l>Was of some straunge and unknowne tree. When certain talke had past </l>
<l>A while of other matters there, I am (quoth he) at last</l>
<l>A man that hath delight in woods and loves to follow game</l>
<l>And yet I am not able sure by any meanes to ame</l>
<l>What wood your Javeling stele is of. Of Ash it can not bee.</l>
<l>For then the colour should be browne. And if of Cornell tree,  </l>
<l>It would be full of knubbed knots. I know not what it is:</l>
<l>But sure mine eies did never see a fairer Dart than this.</l>
<l>The one of those same brethren twaine replying to him said:</l>
<l>Nay then the speciall propertie will make you more dismaid,</l>
<l>Than doth the beautie of this Dart. It hitteth whatsoever  </l>
<l>He throwes it at. The stroke thereof by Chaunce is ruled never.</l>
<l>For having done his feate, it flies all bloudie backe agen</l>
<l>Without the helpe of any hand. The Prince was earnest then</l>
<l>To know the truth of all: as whence so riche a present came,</l>
<l>Who gave it him, and whereupon the partie gave the same.  </l>
<l>Duke Cephal answerde his demaund in all points (one except)</l>
<l>The which (as knowne apparantly) for shame he overlept:</l>
<l>His beautie namely, for the which he did receive the Dart.</l>
<l>And for the losse of his deare wife right pensive at the hart,</l>
<l>He thus began with weeping eies: This Dart, O Goddesse sonne,  </l>
<l>(Ye ill would thinke it) makes me yirne, and long shall make me donne,</l>
<l>If long the Gods doe give me life. This weapon hath undonne</l>
<l>My deare beloved wife and me. O would to God this same</l>
<l>Had never unto me bene given. There was a noble Dame</l>
<l>That Procris hight (but you perchaunce have oftner heard the name </l>
<l>Of great Orythia whose renowne was bruited so by fame,</l>
<l>That blustring Boreas ravisht hir.) To this Orythia shee</l>
<l>Was sister. If a bodie should compare in ech degree</l>
<l>The face and natures of them both, he could none other deeme</l>
<l>But Procris worthier of the twaine of ravishment should seeme.    </l>
<l>Hir father and our mutuall love did make us man and wife.</l>
<l>Men said I had (and so I had in deede) a happie life.</l>
<l>Howbeit Gods will was otherwise, for had it pleased him</l>
<l>Of all this while, and even still yet in pleasure should I swim.</l>
<l>The second Month that she and I by band of lawfull bed      </l>
<l>Had joynde togither bene, as I my masking Toyles did spred,</l>
<l>To overthrow the horned Stags, the early Morning gray</l>
<l>Then newly having chased night and gun to breake the day,</l>
<l>From Mount Hymettus highest tops that freshly flourish ay,</l>
<l>Espide me, and against my will conveyde me quight away.     </l>
<l>I trust the Goddesse will not be offended that I say</l>
<l>The troth of hir. Although it would delight one to beholde</l>
<l>Hir ruddie cheekes: although of day and night the bounds she holde:</l>
<l>Although on juice of Ambrosie continually she feede:</l>
<l>Yet Procris was the only Wight that I did love in deede.    </l>
<l>On Procris only was my heart: none other word had I</l>
<l>But Procris only in my mouth: still Procris did I crie.</l>
<l>I upned what a holy thing was wedlocke: and how late</l>
<l>It was ago since she and I were coupled in that state.</l>
<l>Which band (and specially so soone) it were a shame to breake.    </l>
<l>The Goddesse being moved at the words that I did speake,</l>
<l>Said: Cease thy plaint, thou Carle, and keepe thy Procris still for me.</l>
<l>But (if my minde deceyve me not) the time will shortly be</l>
<l>That wish thou wilt thou had hir not. And so in anger she</l>
<l>To Procris sent me backe againe. In going homeward as       </l>
<l>Upon the Goddesse sayings with my selfe I musing was,</l>
<l>I gan to dreade bad measures lest my wife had made some scape.</l>
<l>Hir youthfull yeares begarnished with beautie, grace and shape,</l>
<l>In maner made me to beleve the deede already done.</l>
<l>Againe hir maners did forbid mistrusting over soone.           </l>
<l>But I had bene away: but even the same from whom I came</l>
<l>A shrewde example gave how lightly wives doe run in blame:</l>
<l>But we poore Lovers are afraide of all things. Hereupon</l>
<l>I thought to practise feates: which thing repented me anon:</l>
<l>And shall repent me while I live. The purpose of my drifts     </l>
<l>Was for t'assault hir honestie with great rewards and gifts.</l>
<l>The Morning fooding this my feare, to further my device,</l>
<l>My shape (which thing me thought I felt) had altered with a trice.</l>
<l>By meanes whereof anon unknowne to Pallas towne I came,</l>
<l>And entred so my house: the house was clearely voide of blame:    </l>
<l>And shewed signes of chastitie in mourning ever sith</l>
<l>Their maister had bene rapt away. A thousand meanes wherewith</l>
<l>To come to Procris speach had I devisde: and scarce at last</l>
<l>Obteinde I it. As soone as I mine eie upon hir cast,</l>
<l>My wits were ravisht in such wise that nigh I had forgot </l>
<l>The purposde triall of hir troth. Right much adoe God wot</l>
<l>I had to holde mine owne that I the truth bewrayed not.</l>
<l>To keepe my selfe from kissing hir full much adoe I had</l>
<l>As reason was I should have done. She looked verie sad.</l>
<l>And yet as sadly as she lookte, no Wight alive can show        </l>
<l>A better countenance than did she. Hir heart did inward glow</l>
<l>In longing for hir absent spouse. How beautifull a face</l>
<l>Thinke you, Sir Phocus, was in hir whome sorrow so did grace?</l>
<l>What should I make report how oft hir chast behaviour strave</l>
<l>And overcame most constantly the great assaults I gave?        </l>
<l>Or tell how oft she shet me up with these same words? To one</l>
<l>(Where ere he is) I keepe my selfe, and none but he alone</l>
<l>Shall sure enjoy the use of me. What creature having his</l>
<l>Wits perfect would not be content with such a proofe as this</l>
<l>Of hir most stedfast chastitie? I could not be content:        </l>
<l>But still to purchase to my selfe more wo I further went.</l>
<l>At last by profering endlesse welth, and heaping gifts on gifts,</l>
<l>In overlading hir with wordes I drave hir to hir shifts.</l>
<l>Then cride I out: Thine evill heart my selfe I tardie take.</l>
<l>Where of a straunge advouterer the countenance I did make, </l>
<l>I am in deede thy husband. O unfaithfull woman thou,</l>
<l>Even I my selfe can testifie thy lewde behavior now.</l>
<l>She made none answere to my words, but being stricken dum</l>
<l>And with the sorrow of hir heart alonly overcum,</l>
<l>Forsaketh hir entangling house, and naughtie husband quight:   </l>
<l>And hating all the sort of men by reason of the spight</l>
<l>That I had wrought hir, straide abrode among the Mountaines hie,</l>
<l>And exercisde Dianas feates. Then kindled by and by</l>
<l>A fiercer fire within my bones than ever was before,</l>
<l>When she had thus forsaken me by whome I set such store.     </l>
<l>I prayde hir she woulde pardon me, and did confesse my fault.</l>
<l>Affirming that my selfe likewise with such a great assault</l>
<l>Of richesse might right well have bene enforst to yeelde to blame,</l>
<l>The rather if performance had ensewed of the same.</l>
<l>When I had this submission made, and she sufficiently        </l>
<l>Revengde hir wronged chastitie, she then immediatly</l>
<l>Was reconcilde: and afterward we lived many a yeare</l>
<l>In joy and never any jarre betweene us did appeare.</l>
<l>Besides all this (as though hir love had bene too small a gift)</l>
<l>She gave me eke a goodly Grewnd which was of foote so swift,    </l>
<l>That when Diana gave him hir, she said he should outgo</l>
<l>All others, and with this same Grewnd she gave this Dart also</l>
<l>The which you see I hold in hand. Perchaunce ye faine would know</l>
<l>What fortune to the Grewnd befell. I will unto you show</l>
<l>A wondrous case. The straungenesse of the matter will you move.

<l>The krinkes of certaine Prophesies surmounting farre above</l>
<l>The reach of auncient wits to read, the Brookenymphes did expound:</l>
<l>And mindlesse of hir owne darke doubts Dame Themis being found,</l>
<l>Was as a rechelesse Prophetisse throwne flat against the ground.</l>
<l>For which presumptuous deede of theirs she tooke just punishment. </l>
<l>To <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> in Baeotia streight a cruell beast she sent,</l>
<l>Which wrought the bane of many a Wight. The countryfolk did feed</l>
<l>Him with their cattell and themselves, untill (as was agreed)</l>
<l>That all we youthfull Gentlemen that dwelled there about</l>
<l>Assembling pitcht our corded toyles the champion fields throughout. </l>
<l>But Net ne toyle was none so hie that could his wightnesse stop,</l>
<l>He mounted over at his ease the highest of the top.</l>
<l>Then everie man let slip their Grewnds, but he them all outstript</l>
<l>And even as nimbly as a birde in daliance from them whipt.</l>
<l>Then all the field desired me to let my Laelaps go:</l>
<l>(The Grewnd that Procris unto me did give was named so)</l>
<l>Who strugling for to wrest his necke already from the band</l>
<l>Did stretch his collar. Scarsly had we let him off of hand</l>
<l>But that where Laelaps was become we could not understand.</l>
<l>The print remained of his feete upon the parched sand,</l>
<l>But he was clearly out of sight. Was never Dart I trow,</l>
<l>Nor Pellet from enforced Sling, nor shaft from Cretish bow,</l>
<l>That flew more swift than he did runne. There was not farre fro thence</l>
<l>About the middle of the Laund a rising ground, from whence</l>
<l>A man might overlooke the fieldes. I gate me to the knap</l>
<l>Of this same hill, and there beheld of this straunge course the hap</l>
<l>In which the beast seemes one while caught, and ere a man would think,</l>
<l>Doth quickly give the Grewnd the slip, and from his bighting shrink:</l>
<l>And like a wilie Foxe he runnes not forth directly out,</l>
<l>Nor makes a windlasse over all the champion fieldes about,     </l>
<l>But doubling and indenting still avoydes his enmies lips,</l>
<l>And turning short, as swift about as spinning wheele he whips,</l>
<l>To disapoint the snatch. The Grewnd pursuing at an inch</l>
<l>Doth cote him, never losing ground: but likely still to pinch</l>
<l>Is at the sodaine shifted off. Continually he snatches         </l>
<l>In vaine: for nothing in his mouth save only Aire he latches.</l>
<l>Then thought I for to trie what helpe my Dart at neede could show.</l>
<l>Which as I charged in my hand by levell aime to throw,</l>
<l>And set my fingars to the thongs, I lifting from bylow</l>
<l>Mine eies, did looke right forth againe, and straight amids the field </l>
<l>(A wondrous thing) two Images of Marble I beheld:</l>
<l>Of which ye would have thought the t'one had fled on still apace</l>
<l>And that with open barking mouth the tother did him chase.</l>
<l>In faith it was the will of God (at least if any Goddes</l>
<l>Had care of them) that in their pace there should be found none oddes.  </l>
<l>Thus farre: and then he held his peace. But tell us ere we part</l>
<l>(Quoth Phocus) what offence or fault committed hath your Dart?</l>
<l>His Darts offence he thus declarde: My Lorde, the ground of all</l>
<l>My grief was joy. Those joyes of mine remember first I shall.</l>
<l>It doth me good even yet to thinke upon that blissfull time  </l>
<l>( meane the fresh and lustie yeares of pleasant youthfull Prime)</l>
<l>When I a happie man enjoyde so faire and good a wife,</l>
<l>And she with such a loving make did lead a happie life.</l>
<l>The care was like of both of us, the mutuall love all one.</l>
<l>She would not to have line with Jove my presence have forgone.  </l>
<l>Ne was there any Wight that could of me have wonne the love,</l>
<l>No though Dame Venus had hir selfe descended from above.</l>
<l>The glowing brands of love did burne in both our brests alike.</l>
<l>Such time as first with crased beames the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> is wont to strike</l>
<l>The tops of Towres and mountaines high, according to the wont  </l>
<l>Of youthfull men, in woodie Parkes I went abrode to hunt.</l>
<l>But neither horse nor Hounds to make pursuit upon the scent.</l>
<l>Nor Servingman, nor knottie toyle before or after went,</l>
<l>For I was safe with this same Dart. When wearie waxt mine arme</l>
<l>With striking Deere, and that the day did make me somewhat warme, </l>
<l>Withdrawing for to coole my selfe I sought among the shades</l>
<l>For Aire that from the valleyes colde came breathing in at glades.</l>
<l>The more excessive was my heate the more for Aire I sought.</l>
<l>I waited for the gentle Aire: the Aire was that that brought</l>
<l>Refreshing to my wearie limmes. And (well I bear't in thought)   </l>
<l>Come Aire I wonted was to sing, come ease the paine of me</l>
<l>Within my bosom lodge thy selfe most welcome unto me,</l>
<l>And as thou heretofore art wont abate my burning heate.</l>
<l>By chaunce (such was my destinie) proceeding to repeate</l>
<l>Mo words of daliance like to these, I used for to say     </l>
<l>Great pleasure doe I take in thee: for thou from day to day</l>
<l>Doste both refresh and nourish me. Thou makest me delight</l>
<l>In woods and solitarie grounds. Now would to God I might</l>
<l>Receive continuall at my mouth this pleasant breath of thine.</l>
<l>Some man (I wote not who) did heare these doubtfull words of mine,  </l>
<l>And taking them amisse supposde that this same name of Aire</l>
<l>The which I callde so oft upon, had bene some Ladie faire:</l>
<l>He thought that I had lovde some Nymph. And thereupon streight way</l>
<l>He runnes me like a Harebrainde blab to Procris, to bewray</l>
<l>This fault as he surmised it: and there with lavish tung   </l>
<l>Reported all the wanton words that he had heard me sung.</l>
<l>A thing of light beliefe is love. She (as I since have harde)</l>
<l>For sodeine sorrow swounded downe: and when long afterwarde</l>
<l>She came againe unto hir selfe, she said she was accurst</l>
<l>And borne to cruell destinie: and me she blamed wurst      </l>
<l>For breaking faith: and freating at a vaine surmised shame</l>
<l>She dreaded that which nothing was: she fearde a headlesse name.</l>
<l>She wist not what to say or thinke. The wretch did greatly feare</l>
<l>Deceit: yet could she not beleve the tales that talked were.</l>
<l>Onlesse she saw hir husbands fault apparant to hir eie,    </l>
<l>She thought she would not him condemne of any villanie.</l>
<l>Next day as soone as Morning light had driven the night away,</l>
<l>I went abrode to hunt againe: and speeding, as I lay</l>
<l>Upon the grasse, I said: Come, Aire, and ease my painfull heate.</l>
<l>And on the sodaine as I spake there seemed for to beate    </l>
<l>A certaine sighing in mine eares of what I could not gesse.</l>
<l>But ceasing not for that I still proceeded nathelesse:</l>
<l>And said, O come, most pleasant Aire. With that I heard a sound</l>
<l>Of russling softly in the leaves that lay upon the ground.</l>
<l>And thinking it had bene some beast I threw my flying Dart.</l>
<l>It was my wife. Who being now sore wounded at the hart,</l>
<l>Cride out, Alas. As soone as I perceyved by the shrieke</l>
<l>It was my faithfull spouse, I ran me to the voiceward lieke</l>
<l>A madman that had lost his wits. There found I hir halfe dead,</l>
<l>Hir scattred garments staining in the bloud that she had bled,  </l>
<l>And (wretched creature as I am) yet drawing from the wound</l>
<l>The gift that she hir selfe had given. Then softly from the ground</l>
<l>I lifted up that bodie of hirs of which I was more chare</l>
<l>Than of mine owne, and from hir brest hir clothes in hast I tare.</l>
<l>And binding up hir cruell wound I strived for to stay      </l>
<l>The bloud, and prayd she would not thus by passing so away</l>
<l>Forsake me as a murtherer: she waxing weake at length</l>
<l>And drawing to hir death apace, enforced all hir strength</l>
<l>To utter these few wordes at last: I pray thee humbly by</l>
<l>Our bond of wedlocke, by the Gods as well above the Skie   </l>
<l>As those to whome I now must passe, as ever I have ought</l>
<l>Deserved well by thee, and by the Love which having brought</l>
<l>Me to my death doth even in death unfaded still remaine,</l>
<l>To nestle in thy bed and mine let never Aire obtaine.</l>
<l>This sed, she held hir peace, and I perceyved by the same</l>
<l>And tolde hir also how she was beguiled in the name.</l>
<l>But what avayled telling then? she quoathde: and with hir bloud</l>
<l>Hir little strength did fade. Howbeit as long as that she coud</l>
<l>See ought, she stared in my face and gasping still on me</l>
<l>Even in my mouth she breathed forth hir wretched ghost. But she</l>
<l>Did seeme with better cheare to die for that hir conscience was</l>
<l>Discharged quight and cleare of doubtes. Now in conclusion as</l>
<l>Duke Cephal weeping told this tale to Phocus and the rest</l>
<l>Whose eyes were also moyst with teares to heare the pitious gest,</l>
<l>Behold King Aeacus and with him his eldest sonnes both twaine</l>
<l>Did enter in and after them there followed in a traine</l>
<l>Of well appointed men of warre new levied: which the King</l>

<l>The day starre now beginning to disclose the Morning bright</l>
<l>And for to dense the droupie Skie from darkenesse of the night,</l>
<l>The Easterne wind went downe and flakes of foggie Clouds gan show,</l>
<l>And from the South a merrie gale on Cephals sayles did blow.</l>
<l>The which did hold so fresh and large, that he and all his men  </l>
<l>Before that he was looked for arrived safe agen</l>
<l>In wished Haven. In that while King Minos with his fleete</l>
<l>Did waste the cost of <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName>. And first he thought it meete</l>
<l>To make a triall of the force and courage of his men</l>
<l>Against the towne Alcathoe where Nisus reigned then.       </l>
<l>Among whose honorable haire that was of colour gray,</l>
<l>One scarlet haire did grow upon his crowne, whereon the stay</l>
<l>Of all his Kingdome did depende. Sixe times did Phoebe fill</l>
<l>Hir homes with borrowed light, and yet the warre hung wavering still</l>
<l>In fickle fortunes doubtfull scaales: and long with fleeting wings    </l>
<l>Betwene them both flew victorie. A Turret of the Kings</l>
<l>Stood hard adjoyning to the Wall which being touched rings,</l>
<l>For Phoebus (so men say) did lay his golden Violl there,</l>
<l>And so the stones the sound thereof did ever after beare.</l>
<l>King Nisus daughter oftentimes resorted to this Wall       </l>
<l>And strake it with a little stone to raise the sound withall,</l>
<l>In time of peace. And in the warre she many a time and oft</l>
<l>Behelde the sturdie stormes of Mars from that same place aloft.</l>
<l>And by continuance of the siege the Captaines names she knew,</l>
<l>Their armes, horse, armor and aray in everie band and crew.       </l>
<l>Bit specially above the rest she noted Minos face.</l>
<l>She knew inough and more than was inough as stoode the case.</l>
<l>For were it that he hid his head in Helme with fethered crest,</l>
<l>To hir opinion in his Helme he stayned all the rest.</l>
<l>Or were it that he tooke in hand of steele his target bright,     </l>
<l>She thought in weelding of his shielde he was a comly Knight.</l>
<l>Or were it that he raisde his arme to throw the piercing Dart,</l>
<l>The Ladie did commend his force and manhode joynde with Art.</l>
<l>Or drew he with his arrow nockt his bended Bow in hand</l>
<l>She sware that so in all respectes was Phoebus wont to stand. </l>
<l>But when he shewde his visage bare, his Helmet laid aside,</l>
<l>And on a Milke white Steede brave trapt, in Purple Robe did ride,</l>
<l>She scarce was Mistresse of hir selfe, hir wits were almost straught.</l>
<l>A happie Dart she thought it was that he in fingars caught,</l>
<l>And happie called she those reynes that he in hand had raught.    </l>
<l>And if she might have had hir will, she could have founde in hart,</l>
<l>Among the enmies to have gone. She could have found in hart,</l>
<l>From downe the highest Turret there hir bodie to have throwne,</l>
<l>Among the thickest of the Tents of Gnossus to have flowne,</l>
<l>Or for to ope the brazen gates and let the enmie in,              </l>
<l>Or whatsoever else she thought might Minos favor win.</l>
<l>And as she sate beholding still the King of Candies tent,</l>
<l>She said: I doubt me whether that I rather may lament</l>
<l>Or of this wofull warre be glad. It grieves me at the hart</l>
<l>That thou O Minos unto me thy Lover enmie art.                    </l>
<l>But had not this same warfare bene, I never had him knowne.</l>
<l>Yet might he leave this cruell warre, and take me as his owne.</l>
<l>A wife, a feere, a pledge for peace he might receive of me.</l>
<l>O flowre of beautie, O thou Prince most pearlesse: if that she</l>
<l>That bare thee in hir wombe were like in beautie unto thee,       </l>
<l>A right good cause had Jove on hir enamored for to bee.</l>
<l>Oh happie were I if with wings I through the Aire might glide</l>
<l>And safely to King Minos Tent from this same Turret slide.</l>
<l>Then would I utter who I am, and how the firie flame</l>
<l>Of Cupid burned in my brest, desiring him to name           </l>
<l>What dowrie he would aske with me in loan of his love,</l>
<l>Save only of my Fathers Realme no question he should move.</l>
<l>For rather than by traitrous meanes my purpose should take place,</l>
<l>Adue, desire of hoped Love. Yet oftentimes such grace</l>
<l>Hath from the gentle Conqueror proceeded erst, that they    </l>
<l>Which tooke the foyle have found the same their profit and their stay.</l>
<l>Assuredly the warre is just that Minos takes in hand,</l>
<l>As in revengement of his sonne late murthered in this land.</l>
<l>And as his quarrell seemeth just, even so it cannot faile,</l>
<l>But rightfull warre against the wrong must (I beleve) prevaile.  </l>
<l>Now if this Citie in the ende must needes be taken, why</l>
<l>Should his owne sworde and not my Love be meanes to win it by?</l>
<l>It were yet better he should speede by gentle meanes without</l>
<l>The slaughter of his people, yea and (as it may fall out)</l>
<l>With spending of his owne bloud too. For sure I have a care  </l>
<l>O Minos lest some Souldier wound thee ere he be aware.</l>
<l>For who is he in all the world that hath so hard a hart</l>
<l>That wittingly against thy head would aime his cruell Dart?</l>
<l>I like well this devise, and on this purpose will I stand:</l>
<l>To yeelde my selfe endowed with this Citie to the hand</l>
<l>Of Minos: and in doing so to bring this warre to ende.</l>
<l>But smally it availeth me the matter to intende.</l>
<l>The gates and yssues of this towne are kept with watch and warde,</l>
<l>And of the Keyes continually my Father hath the garde.</l>
<l>My Father only is the man of whome I stand in dreede, </l>
<l>My Father only hindreth me of my desired speede.</l>
<l>Would God that I were Fatherlesse. Tush, everie Wight may bee</l>
<l>A God as in their owne behalfe, and if their hearts be free</l>
<l>From fearefulnesse. For fortune works against the fond desire</l>
<l>Of such as through faint heartednesse attempt not to aspire.  </l>
<l>Some other feeling in hir heart such flames of Cupids fire</l>
<l>Already would have put in proofe some practise to destroy</l>
<l>What thing so ever of hir Love the furtherance might anoy</l>
<l>And why should any woman have a bolder heart than I?</l>
<l>Through fire and sword I boldly durst adventure for to flie.  </l>
<l>And yet in this behalfe at all there needes no sword nor fire,</l>
<l>There needeth but my fathers haire to accomplish my desire. I</l>
<l>That Purple haire of his to me more precious were than golde:</l>
<l>That Purple haire of his would make me blest a thousand folde:</l>
<l>That haire would compasse my desire and set my heart at rest.

<l>Night (chiefest Nurce of thoughts to such as are with care opprest)</l>
<l>Approched while she spake these words, and darknesse did encrease</l>

<l>Of cares that all the day before were working in their heds,</l>
<l>By sleepe which falleth first of all upon them in their beds,  </l>
<l>Hir fathers chamber secretly she entered: where (alasse</l>

<l>She robde hir Father of the haire upon the which the fate</l>

<l>As if it were some lawfull spoyle acquired of the fo.</l>
<l>And passing through a posterne gate she marched through the mid</l>

<l>Untill she came before the King, whom troubled with the sight</l>
<l>She thus bespake: Enforst, O King, by love against all right  </l>
<l>I Scylla, Nisus daughter, doe present unto thee heere</l>
<l>My native soyle, my household Gods, and all that else is deere</l>
<l>For this my gift none other thing in recompence I crave</l>

<l>A haire but even my fathers head. And as these words she spake,</l>
<l>The cursed gift with wicked hand she profered him to take.</l>
<l>But Minos did abhorre hir gift: and troubled in his minde</l>
<l>With straungenesse of the heynous act so sore against hir kinde,    </l>
<l>He aunswerde: O thou slaunder of our age, the Gods expell</l>
<l>Thee out of all this world of theirs and let thee no where dwell.</l>
<l>Let rest on neither Sea nor Land be graunted unto thee.</l>
<l>Assure thy selfe that as for me I never will agree</l>
<l>That Candie, Joves owne foster place (as long as I there raigne),   </l>

<l>This said, he like a righteous Judge among his vanquisht foes</l>
<l>Set order under paine of death. Which done he willed those</l>
<l>That served him to go aboorde and Anchors up to wey.</l>
<l>When Scylla saw the Candian fleete aflote to go away,            </l>
<l>And that the Captaine yeelded not so good reward as shee</l>

<l>How sayst thou, Carle? compell not these my words thine eares to glow?</l>
<l>Or doe the windes that drive thy shyps, in vaine my sayings blow?</l>
<l>In faith it is no wonder though thy wife Pasiphae</l>

<l>The water sounds with Ores, and hales from me and from my land.</l>
<l>In vaine thou striveth, O thou Churle, forgetfull quight of my</l>

<l>Upon thy courbed Keele will I take holde: and hanging so     </l>
<l>Be drawen along the Sea with thee where ever thou do go.</l>
<l>She scarce had said these words, but that she leaped on the wave</l>
<l>And getting to the ships by force of strength that Love hir gave</l>
<l>Upon the King of Candies Keele in spight of him she clave.</l>
<l>Whome when hir father spide (for now he hovered in the aire,    </l>
<l>And being made a Hobby Hauke did soare between a paire</l>
<l>Of nimble wings of yron Mayle) he soused downe amaine</l>
<l>To seaze upon hir as she hung, and would have tome hir faine</l>
<l>With bowing Beake. But she for feare did let the Caricke go:</l>
<l>And as she was about to fall, the lightsome Aire did so      </l>
<l>Uphold hir that she could not touch the Sea as seemed tho.</l>
<l>Anon all fethers she became, and forth away did flie</l>
<l>Transformed to a pretie Bird that stieth to the Skie.</l>
<l>And for bicause like clipped haire hir head doth beare a marke,</l>

<l>The slaunder of his house encreast: and now appeared more     </l>
<l>The mothers filthie whoredome by the monster that she bore</l>
<l>Of double shape, an ugly thing. This shamefull infamie,</l>

<l>To put away, and in a house with many nookes and krinks</l>
<l>From all mens sights and speach of folke to shet it up he thinks.    </l>
<l>Immediatly one Daedalus renowmed in that lande</l>
<l>For fine devise and workmanship in building, went in hand</l>
<l>To make it. He confounds his worke with sodaine stops and stayes,</l>
<l>And with the great uncertaintie of sundrie winding wayes</l>
<l>Leades in and out, and to and fro, at divers doores astray.    </l>

<l>Yea scarce himselfe could find the meanes to winde himselfe well out:</l>
<l>So busie and so intricate the house was all about.</l>

<l>God Bacchus did both comfort hir and take hir to his bed.</l>

<l>The Chaplet thirled through the Aire: and as it gliding flew,</l>

<l>Now in this while gan Daedalus a wearinesse to take    </l>
<l>Of living like a banisht man and prisoner such a time</l>
<l>In <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, and longed in his heart to see his native Clime.</l>
<l>But Seas enclosed him as if he had in prison be.</l>
<l>Then thought he: though both Sea and Land King Minos stop fro me,</l>
<l>I am assurde he cannot stop the Aire and open Skie.         </l>
<l>To make my passage that way then my cunning will I trie.</l>
<l>Although that Minos like a Lord held all the world beside:</l>
<l>Yet doth the Aire from Minos yoke for all men free abide.</l>
<l>This sed: to uncoth Arts he bent the force of all his wits</l>
<l>To alter natures course by craft. And orderly he knits      </l>
<l>A rowe of fethers one by one, beginning with the short,</l>
<l>And overmatching still eche quill with one of longer sort,</l>
<l>That on the shoring of a hill a man would thinke them grow.</l>
<l>Even so the countrie Organpipes of Oten reedes ir row</l>
<l>Ech higher than another rise. Then fastned he with Flax     </l>
<l>The middle quilles, and joyned in the lowest sort with Wax.</l>
<l>And when he thus had finisht them, a little he them bent</l>
<l>In compasse, that the verie Birdes they full might represent.</l>
<l>There stoode me by him Icarus, his sonne, a pretie Lad.</l>
<l>Who knowing not that he in handes his owne destruction had,  </l>
<l>With smiling mouth did one while blow the fethers to and fro</l>
<l>Which in the Aire on wings of Birds did flask not long ago:</l>
<l>And with his thumbes another while he chafes the yelow Wax</l>
<l>And lets his fathers wondrous worke with childish toyes and knacks.</l>
<l>As soon as that the worke was done, the workman by and by   </l>
<l>Did peyse his bodie on his wings, and in the Aire on hie</l>
<l>Hung wavering: and did teach his sonne how he should also flie.</l>
<l>I warne thee (quoth he), Icarus, a middle race to keepe.</l>
<l>For if thou hold too low a gate, the dankenesse of the deepe</l>
<l>Will overlade thy wings with wet. And if thou mount too hie,  </l>
<l>The <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> will sindge them. Therfore see betweene them both thou flie.</l>
<l>I bid thee not behold the Starre Bootes in the Skie.</l>
<l>Nor looke upon the bigger Beare to make thy course thereby,</l>
<l>Nor yet on Orions naked sword. But ever have an eie</l>
<l>To keepe the race that I doe keepe, and I will guide thee right.  </l>
<l>In giving counsell to his sonne to order well his flight,</l>
<l>He fastned to his shoulders twaine a paire of uncoth wings.</l>
<l>And as he was in doing it and warning him of things,</l>
<l>His aged cheekes were wet, his hands did quake, in fine he gave</l>
<l>His sonne a kisse the last that he alive should ever have.   </l>
<l>And then he mounting up aloft before him tooke his way</l>
<l>Right fearfull for his followers sake: as is the Bird the day</l>
<l>That first she tolleth from hir nest among the braunches hie</l>
<l>Hir tender yong ones in the Aire to teach them for to flie.</l>
<l>So heartens he his little sonne to follow teaching him       </l>
<l>A hurtfull Art. His owne two wings he waveth verie trim,</l>
<l>And looketh backward still upon his sonnes. The fishermen</l>
<l>Then standing angling by the Sea, and shepeherdes leaning then</l>
<l>On sheepehookes, and the Ploughmen on the handles of their Plough,</l>
<l>Beholding them, amazed were: and thought that they that through </l>
<l>The Aire could flie were Gods. And now did on their left side stand</l>
<l>The Iles of <placeName key="tgn,7011023">Paros</placeName> and of Dele and <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>, Junos land:</l>
<l>And on their right, Lebinthos and the faire Calydna fraught</l>
<l>With store of honie: when the Boy a frolicke courage caught</l>
<l>To flie at randon. Whereupon forsaking quight his guide,      </l>
<l>Of fond desire to flie to Heaven, above his boundes he stide.</l>
<l>And there the nerenesse of the <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> which burnd more hote aloft,</l>
<l>Did make the Wax (with which his wings were glewed) lithe and soft.</l>
<l>As soone as that the Wax was molt, his naked armes he shakes,</l>
<l>And wanting wherewithall to wave no helpe of Aire he takes.    </l>
<l>But calling on his father loud he drowned in the wave:</l>
<l>And by this chaunce of his those Seas his name for ever have.</l>
<l>His wretched Father (but as then no father) cride in feare:</l>
<l>O Icarus, O Icarus, where art thou? tell me where</l>
<l>That I may finde thee, Icarus. He saw the fethers swim       </l>
<l>Upon the waves, and curst his Art that so had spighted him.</l>
<l>At last he tooke his bodie up and laid it in a grave,</l>
<l>And to the Ile the name of him then buried in it gave.</l>
<l>And as he of his wretched sonne the corse in ground did hide,</l>
<l>The cackling Partrich from a thicke and leavie thorne him spide, </l>
<l>And clapping with his wings for joy aloud to call began.</l>
<l>There was of that same kinde of Birde no mo but he as than.</l>
<l>In times forepast had none bene seene. It was but late anew</l>
<l>Since he was made a bird: and that thou, Daedalus, mayst rew:</l>
<l>For whyle the world doth last thy shame shall thereupon ensew.   </l>
<l>For why thy sister, ignorant of that which after hapt,</l>
<l>Did put him to thee to be taught full twelve yeares old and apt</l>
<l>To take instruction. He did marke the middle bone that goes</l>
<l>Through fishes, and according to the paterne tane of those</l>
<l>He filed teeth upon a piece of yron one by one             </l>
<l>And so devised first the Saw where erst was never none.</l>
<l>Moreover he two yron shankes so joynde in one round head,</l>
<l>That opening an indifferent space, the one point downe shall tread,</l>
<l>And tother draw a circle round. The finding of these things,</l>
<l>The spightfull heart of Daedalus with such a m lice stings, </l>
<l>That headlong from the holy towre of Pallas downe he thrue</l>
<l>His Nephew, feyning him to fall by chaunce, which was not true.</l>
<l>But Pallas (who doth favour wits) did stay him in his fall</l>
<l>And chaunging him into a Bird did clad him over all</l>
<l>With fethers soft amid the Aire. The quicknesse of his wit  </l>
<l>(Which erst was swift) did shed it selfe among his wings and feete.</l>
<l>And as he Partrich hight before, so hights he Partrich still.</l>
<l>Yet mounteth not this Bird aloft ne seemes to have a will</l>
<l>To build hir nest in tops of trees among the boughes on hie</l>
<l>But flecketh nere the ground and layes hir egges in hedges drie.   </l>
<l>And forbicause hir former fall she ay in minde doth beare,</l>
<l>She ever since all lofty things doth warely shun for feare.

<l>And now forwearied Daedalus alighted in the land</l>
<l>Within the which the burning hilles of firie <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName> stand.</l>
<l>To save whose life King Cocalus did weapon take in hand,    </l>
<l>For which men thought him merciful. And now with high renowne</l>

<l>And all the other Gods, to whome more honor for to show,    </l>
<l>Gifts, blud of beasts, and frankincense the people did bestow</l>
<l>As in performance of their vowes. The right redoubted name</l>
<l>Of Theseus through the lande of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> was spred by flying fame.</l>
<l>And now the folke that in the land of rich <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName> dwelt,</l>
<l>Praid him of succor in the harmes and perils that they felt.     </l>
<l>Although the land of Calydon had then Meleager:</l>
<l>Yet was it faine in humble wise to Theseus to prefer</l>
<l>A supplication for the aide of him. The cause wherfore</l>
<l>They made such humble suit to him was this. There was a Bore</l>
<l>The which Diana for to wreake hir wrath conceyvde before         </l>
<l>Had thither as hir servant sent the countrie for to waast.</l>
<l>For men report that Oenie when he had in storehouse plaast</l>
<l>The full encrease of former yeare, to Ceres did assigne</l>
<l>The firstlings of his corne and fruits: to Bacchus, of the Wine:</l>

<l>Of graine and fruits who put their help to toyling in the clods,</l>
<l>Ambitiously to all, even those that dwell in heaven did clime.</l>
<l>Dianas Altars (as it hapt) alonly at that time</l>
<l>Without reward of Frankincense were overskipt (they say).</l>

<l>Unpunisht, though unworshipped he passed me wyth spight:</l>
<l>He shall not make his vaunt he scapt me unrevenged quight,</l>
<l>Quoth Phoebe. And anon she sent a Bore to Oenies ground</l>
<l>Of such a hugenesse as no Bull could ever yet be found,</l>
<l>In Epyre: but in Sicilie are Bulles much lesse than hee. </l>
<l>His eies did glister blud and fire: right dreadfull was to see</l>
<l>His brawned necke, right dredfull was his haire which grew as thicke</l>
<l>With pricking points as one of them could well by other sticke.</l>
<l>And like a front of armed Pikes set close in battell ray</l>
<l>The sturdie bristles on his back stoode staring up alway. </l>
<l>The scalding fome with gnashing hoarse which he did cast aside,</l>
<l>Upon his large and brawned shield did white as Curdes abide.</l>
<l>Among the greatest Oliphants in all the land of <placeName key="tgn,7000198">Inde</placeName>,</l>
<l>A greater tush than had this Boare, ye shall not lightly finde.</l>
<l>Such lightning flashed from his chappes, as seared up the grasse.    </l>
<l>Now trampled he the spindling come to ground where he did passe,</l>
<l>Now ramping up their riped hope he made the Plowmen weepe.</l>
<l>And chankt the kernell in the eare. In vaine their floores they sweepe:</l>
<l>In vaine their Barnes for Harvest long, the likely store they keepe.</l>
<l>The spreaded Vines with clustred Grapes to ground he rudely sent, </l>
<l>And full of Berries loden boughes from Olife trees he rent.</l>
<l>On cattell also did he rage. The shepeherd nor his dog,</l>
<l>Nor yet the Bulles could save the herdes from outrage of this Hog.</l>
<l>The folke themselves were faine to flie. And yet they thought them not</l>
<l>In safetie when they had themselves within the Citie got. </l>
<l>Untill their Prince Meleager, and with their Prince a knot</l>
<l>Of Lords and lustie gentlemen of hand and courage stout,</l>
<l>With chosen fellowes for the nonce of all the Lands about,</l>

<l>Helpt Hercules the monstruous heades of Hydra off to seare.  </l>
<l>The lively Lad Eurytion and Echion who did beare</l>

<l>And <placeName key="tgn,1033577">Lelex</placeName> of Narytium too. And Panopie beside:</l>
<l>And Hyle: and cruell Hippasus: and Naestor who that tide</l>
<l>Was in the Prime of lustie youth: moreover thither went    </l>
<l>Three children of Hippocoon from old Amicle sent.</l>
<l>And he that of Penelope the fathrinlaw became.</l>
<l>And eke the sonne of Parrhasus, Ancaeus cald by name.</l>
<l>There was the sonne of Ampycus of great forecasting wit:</l>
<l>And Oeclies sonne who of his wife was unbetrayed yit.     </l>
<l>And from the Citie Tegea there came the Paragone</l>
<l>Of Lycey forrest, Atalant, a goodly Ladie, one</l>
<l>Of Schoenyes daughters, then a Maide. The garment she did weare</l>
<l>A brayded button fastned at hir gorget. All hir heare</l>
<l>Untrimmed in one only knot was trussed. From hir left            </l>
<l>Side hanging on hir shoulder was an Ivorie quiver deft:</l>
<l>Which being full of arrowes, made a clattring as she went.</l>
<l>And in hir right hand she did beare a Bow already bent.</l>
<l>Hir furniture was such as this. Hir countnance and hir grace</l>
<l>Was such as in a Boy might well be cald a Wenches face, </l>
<l>And in a Wench be cald a Boyes. The Prince of Calydon</l>
<l>No sooner cast his eie on hir, but being caught anon</l>
<l>In love, he wisht hir to his wife. But unto this desire</l>
<l>God Cupid gave not his consent. The secret flames of fire</l>
<l>He haling inward still did say: O happy man is he </l>
<l>Whom this same Ladie shall vouchsave hir Husband for to be.</l>
<l>The shortnesse of the time and shame would give him leave to say</l>
<l>No more: a worke of greater weight did draw him then away.</l>
<l>A wood thick growen with trees which stoode unfelled to that day</l>
<l>Beginning from a plaine, had thence a large prospect throughout </l>
<l>The falling grounds that every way did muster round about.</l>
<l>As soone as that the men came there, some pitched up the toyles,</l>
<l>Some tooke the couples from the Dogs, and some pursude the foyles</l>
<l>In places where the Swine had tract: desiring for to spie</l>
<l>Their owne destruction. Now there was a hollow bottom by,         </l>
<l>To which the watershots of raine from all the high grounds drew.</l>
<l>Within the compasse of this pond great store of Osiers grew:</l>
<l>And Sallowes lithe, and flackring Flags, and moorish Rushes eke,</l>
<l>And lazie Reedes on little shankes, and other baggage like.</l>
<l>From hence the Bore was rowzed out, and fiersly forth he flies   </l>
<l>Among the thickest of his foes like thunder from the Skies,</l>
<l>When Clouds in meeting force the fire to burst by violence out.</l>
<l>He beares the trees before him downe, and all the wood about</l>
<l>Doth sound of crashing. All the youth with hideous noyse and shout</l>
<l>Against him bend their Boarspeare points with hand and courage stout.  </l>
<l>He rushes forth among the Dogs that held him at a bay,</l>
<l>And now on this side now on that, as any come in way,</l>
<l>He rippes their skinnes and splitteth them, and chaseth them away,</l>
<l>Echion first of all the rout a Dart at him did throw,</l>
<l>Which mist and in a Maple tree did give a little blow.      </l>
<l>The next (if he that threw the same had used lesser might),</l>
<l>The backe at which he aimed it was likely for to smight.</l>
<l>It overflew him. Jason was the man that cast the Dart.</l>
<l>With that the sonne of Ampycus sayd: Phoebus (if with hart</l>
<l>I have and still doe worship thee) now graunt me for to hit  </l>
<l>The thing that I doe levell at. Apollo graunts him it</l>
<l>As much as lay in him to graunt. He hit the Swine in deede.</l>
<l>But neyther entred he his hide nor caused him to bleede.</l>
<l>For why Diana (as the Dart was flying) tooke away</l>
<l>The head of it: and so the Dart could headlesse beare no sway. </l>
<l>But yet the moodie beast thereby was set the more on fire</l>
<l>And chafing like the lightning swift he uttreth forth his ire.</l>
<l>The fire did sparkle from his eyes: and from his boyling brest</l>
<l>He breathed flaming flakes of fire conceyved in his chest.</l>
<l>And looke with what a violent brunt a mightie Bullet goes   </l>
<l>From engines bent against a wall, or bulwarks full of foes:</l>
<l>With even such violence rusht the Swine among the Hunts amayne,</l>
<l>And overthrew Eupalamon and Pelagon both twaine</l>
<l>That in the right wing placed were. Their fellowes stepping to</l>
<l>And drawing them away, did save their lives with much ado.  </l>
<l>But as for poore Enesimus, Hippocoons sonne had not</l>
<l>The lucke to scape the deadly dint. He would away have got,</l>
<l>And trembling turnde his backe for feare. The Swine him overtooke,</l>
<l>And cut his hamstrings, so that streight his going him forsooke.

<l>Of <placeName key="perseus,Tegea">Tegea</placeName> tooke an arrow swift, and shot it from hir bow.</l>
<l>The arrow lighting underneath the havers eare bylow,              </l>
<l>And somewhat rasing of the skin, did make the bloud to show.</l>
<l>The Maid hirselfe not gladder was to see that luckie blow,</l>
<l>Than was the Prince Meleager. He was the first that saw,</l>
<l>And first that shewed to his Mates the blud that she did draw:</l>
<l>And said: For this thy valiant act due honor shalt thou have.      </l>
<l>The men did blush, and chearing up ech other courage gave</l>
<l>With shouting, and disorderly their Darts by heaps they threw.</l>
<l>The number of them hindred them, not suffring to ensew</l>
<l>That any lighted on the marke at which they all did ame.</l>
<l>Behold, enragde against his ende the hardie Knight that came      </l>
<l>From <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadie</placeName>, rusht rashly with a Pollax in his fist</l>
<l>And said: You yonglings learne of me what difference is betwist</l>
<l>A wenches weapons and a mans: and all of you give place</l>
<l>To my redoubted force. For though Diana in this chase</l>
<l>Should with hir owne shield him defend, yet should this hand of mine </l>
<l>Even maugre Dame Dianas heart confound this orped Swine.</l>
<l>Such boasting words as these through pride presumptuously he crakes:</l>
<l>And streyning out himselfe upon his tiptoes streight he takes</l>
<l>His Pollax up with both his hands. But as this bragger ment</l>
<l>To fetch his blow, the cruell beast his malice did prevent:       </l>
<l>And in his coddes (the speeding place of death) his tusshes puts,</l>
<l>And rippeth up his paunche. Downe falles Ancaeus and his guts</l>
<l>Come tumbling out besmearde with bloud, and foyled all the plot.</l>
<l>Pirithous, Ixions sonne, at that abashed not:</l>
<l>But shaking in his valiant hand his hunting staffe did goe      </l>
<l>Still stoutly forward face to face t'encounter with his foe</l>
<l>To whome Duke Theseus cride afarre: O dearer unto mee</l>
<l>Than is my selfe, my soule I say, stay: lawfull we it see</l>
<l>For valiant men to keepe aloofe. The over hardie hart</l>
<l>In rash adventring of him selfe hath made Ancaeus smart.         </l>
<l>This sed, he threw a weightie Dart of Cornell with a head</l>
<l>Of brasse: which being leveld well was likely to have sped,</l>
<l>But that a bough of Chestnut tree thick leaved by the way</l>
<l>Did latch it, and by meanes therof the dint of it did stay.</l>
<l>Another Dart that Jason threw, by fortune mist the Bore,         </l>
<l>And light betwene a Mastifes chaps, and through his guts did gore,</l>
<l>And naild him to the earth. The hand of Prince Meleager</l>
<l>Plaid hittymissie. Of two Darts his first did flie too far,</l>
<l>And lighted in the ground: the next amid his backe stickt fast.</l>
<l>And while the Bore did play the fiend and turned round agast,   </l>
<l>And grunting flang his fome about togither mixt with blood,</l>
<l>The giver of the wound (the more to stirre his enmies mood,)</l>
<l>Stept in, and underneath the shield did thrust his Boarspeare through.</l>
<l>Then all the Hunters shouting out demeaned joy inough.</l>
<l>And glad was he that first might come to take him by the hand.   </l>
<l>About the ugly beast they all with gladnesse gazing stand</l>
<l>And wondring what a field of ground his carcasse did possesse,</l>
<l>There durst not any be so bolde to touch him. Nerethelesse,</l>
<l>They every of them with his bloud their hunting staves made red.</l>
<l>Then stepped forth Meleager, and treading on his hed             </l>
<l>Said thus: O Ladie Atalant, receive thou here my fee,</l>
<l>And of my glorie vouch thou safe partaker for to bee.</l>
<l>Immediatly the ugly head with both the tusshes brave</l>
<l>And eke the skin with bristles stur right griesly, he hir gave.</l>
<l>The Ladie for the givers sake, was in hir heart as glad          </l>
<l>As for the gift. The rest repinde that she such honor had.</l>
<l>Through all the rout was murmuring. Of whom with roring reare</l>
<l>And armes displayd that all the field might easly see and heare,</l>
<l>The Thesties cried: Dame, come off and lay us downe this geare.</l>
<l>And thou a woman offer not us men so great a shame,       </l>
<l>As we to toyle and thou to take the honor of our game.</l>
<l>Ne let that faire smooth face of thine beguile thee, lest that hee</l>
<l>That being doted in thy love did give thee this our fee,</l>
<l>Be over farre to rescow thee. And with that word they tooke</l>
<l>The gift from hir, and right of gift from him. He could not brooke   </l>
<l>This wrong: but gnashing with his teeth for anger that did boyle</l>
<l>Within, said fiersly: learne ye you that other folkes dispoyle</l>
<l>Of honor given, what diffrence is betweene your threats, and deedes.</l>
<l>And therewithall Plexippus brest (who no such matter dreedes)</l>
<l>With wicked weapon he did pierce. As Toxey doubting stood  </l>
<l>What way to take, desiring both t'advenge his brothers blood,</l>
<l>And fearing to be murthered as his brother was before,</l>
<l>Meleager (to dispatch all doubts of musing any more)</l>
<l>Did heate his sword for companie in bloud of him againe,</l>
<l>Before Plexippus bloud was cold that did thereon remaine.  </l>
<l>Althaea going toward Church with presents for to yild</l>
<l>Due thankes and worship to the Gods that for hir sonne had kild</l>
<l>The Boare, beheld hir brothers brought home dead: and by and by</l>
<l>She beate hir brest, and filde the towne with shrieking piteously,</l>
<l>And shifting all hir rich aray, did put on mourning weede  </l>
<l>But when she understoode what man was doer of the deede,</l>
<l>She left all mourning, and from teares to vengeance did proceede.

<div2 type="card" n="451">

<l>There was a certaine firebrand which when Oenies wife did lie</l>
<l>In childebed of Meleager, she chaunced to espie</l>
<l>The Destnies putting in the fire: and in the putting in,  </l>
<l>She heard them speake these words, as they his fatall threede did spin:</l>
<l>O lately borne, like time we give to thee and to this brand.</l>
<l>And when they so had spoken, they departed out of hand.</l>
<l>Immediatly the mother caught the blazing bough away,</l>
<l>And quenched it. This bough she kept full charely many a day:    </l>
<l>And in the keeping of the same she kept hir sonne alive.</l>
<l>But now intending of his life him clearly to deprive,</l>
<l>She brought it forth, and causing all the coales and shivers to</l>
<l>Be layed by, she like a foe did kindle fire thereto.</l>
<l>Fowre times she was about to cast the firebrand in the flame:  </l>
<l>Fowre times she pulled backe hir hand from doing of the same.</l>
<l>As mother and as sister both she strove what way to go:</l>
<l>The divers names drew diversly hir stomacke to and fro.</l>
<l>Hir face waxt often pale for feare of mischiefe to ensue:</l>
<l>And often red about the eies through heate of ire she grew.  </l>
<l>One while hir looke resembled one that threatned cruelnesse:</l>
<l>Another while ye would have thought she minded pitiousnesse.</l>
<l>And though the cruell burning of hir heart did drie hir teares,</l>
<l>Yet burst out some. And as a Boate which tide contrarie beares</l>
<l>Against the winde, feeles double force, and is compeld to yeelde  </l>
<l>To both, so Thesties daughter now unable for to weelde</l>
<l>Hir doubtful passions, diversly is caried off and on,</l>
<l>And chaungeably she waxes calme, and stormes againe anon.</l>
<l>But better sister ginneth she than mother for to be.</l>
<l>And to th'intent hir brothers ghostes with bloud to honor, she  </l>
<l>In meaning to be one way kinde, doth worke another way</l>
<l>Against kinde. When the plagie fire waxt strong she thus did say:</l>
<l>Let this same fire my bowels burne. And as in cursed hands</l>
<l>The fatall wood she holding at the Hellish Altar stands:</l>
<l>She said: Ye triple Goddesses of wreake, ye Helhounds three  </l>
<l>Beholde ye all this furious fact and sacrifice of mee.</l>
<l>I wreake, and do against all right: with death must death be payde:</l>
<l>In mischiefe mischiefe must be heapt: on corse must corse be laide.</l>
<l>Confounded let this wicked house with heaped sorrowes bee.</l>
<l>Shall Oenie joy his happy sonne in honor for to see          </l>
<l>And Thestie mourne bereft of his? Nay: better yet it were,</l>
<l>That eche with other companie in mourning you should beare.</l>
<l>Ye brothers Ghostes and soules new dead I wish no more, but you</l>
<l>To feele the solemne obsequies which I prepare as now:</l>
<l>And that mine offring you accept, which dearly I have bought  </l>
<l>The yssue of my wretched wombe. Alas, alas what thought</l>
<l>I for to doe? O brothers, I besech you beare with me.</l>
<l>I am his mother: so to doe my hands unable be.</l>
<l>His trespasse I confesse deserves the stopping of his breath:</l>
<l>But yet I doe not like that I be Author of his death.         </l>
<l>And shall he then with life and limme, and honor too, scape free?</l>
<l>And vaunting in his good successe the King of Calidon bee?</l>
<l>And you deare soules lie raked up but in a little dust?</l>
<l>I will not surely suffer it. But let the villaine trust</l>
<l>That he shall die, and draw with him to ruine and decay   </l>
<l>His Kingdome, Countrie and his Sire that doth upon him stay.</l>
<l>Why where is now the mothers heart and pitie that should raigne</l>
<l>In Parents? and the ten Monthes paines that once I did sustaine?</l>
<l>O would to God thou burned had a babie in this brand,</l>
<l>And that I had not tane it out and quencht it with my hand.  </l>
<l>That all this while thou lived hast, my goodnesse is the cause.</l>
<l>And now most justly unto death thine owne desert thee drawes.</l>
<l>Receive the guerdon of thy deede: and render thou agen</l>
<l>Thy twice given life, by bearing first, and secondarly when</l>
<l>I caught this firebrand from the flame: or else come deale with me   </l>
<l>As with my brothers, and with them let me entumbed be.</l>
<l>I would, and cannot. What then shall I stand to in this case?</l>
<l>One while my brothers corses seeme to prease before my face</l>
<l>With lively Image of their deaths. Another while my minde</l>
<l>Doth yeelde to pitie, and the name of mother doth me blinde. </l>
<l>Now wo is me. To let you have the upper hand is sinne:</l>
<l>But nerethelesse the upper hand O brothers doe you win.</l>
<l>Condicionly that when that I to comfort you withall</l>
<l>Have wrought this feate, my selfe to you resort in person shall.</l>
<l>This sed, she turnde away hir face, and with a trembling hand  </l>
<l>Did cast the deathfull brand amid the burning fire. The brand</l>
<l>Did eyther sigh, or seeme to sigh in burning in the flame,</l>
<l>Which sorie and unwilling was to fasten on the same.</l>
<l>Meleager being absent and not knowing ought at all</l>
<l>Was burned with this flame: and felt his bowels to appall  </l>
<l>With secret fire. He bare out long the paine with courage stout.</l>
<l>But yet it grieved him to die so cowardly without</l>
<l>The shedding of his bloud. He thought Anceus for to be</l>
<l>A happie man that dide of wound. With sighing called he</l>
<l>Upon his aged father, and his sisters, and his brother,   </l>
<l>And lastly on his wife too, and by chaunce upon his mother.</l>
<l>His paine encreased with the fire, and fell therewith againe:</l>
<l>And at the selfe same instant quight extinguisht were both twaine.</l>
<l>And as the ashes soft and hore by leysure overgrew</l>
<l>The glowing coales: so leysurly his spirit from him drew.  </l>
<l>Then drouped stately Calydon. Both yong and olde did mourne,</l>
<l>The Lords and Commons did lament, and maried wives with tome</l>
<l>And tattred haire did crie alas. His father did beray</l>
<l>His horie head and face with dust, and on the earth flat lay,</l>
<l>Lamenting that he lived had to see that wofull day</l>
<l>For now his mothers giltie hand had for that cursed crime</l>
<l>Done execution on hir selfe by sword before hir time.</l>
<l>If God to me a hundred mouthes with sounding tongues should send,</l>
<l>And reason able to conceyve, and thereunto should lend</l>
<l>Me all the grace of eloquence that ere the Muses had,        </l>
<l>I could not shew the wo wherewith his sisters were bestad.</l>
<l>Unmindfull of their high estate, their naked brests they smit,</l>
<l>Untill they made them blacke and blew. And while his bodie yit</l>
<l>Remained, they did cherish it, and cherish it againe.</l>
<l>They kist his bodie: yea they kist the chist that did containe  </l>
<l>His corse. And after that the corse was burnt to ashes, they</l>
<l>Did presse his ashes with their brests: and downe along they lay</l>
<l>Upon his tumb, and there embraste his name upon the stone,</l>
<l>And filde the letters of the same with teares that from them gone.</l>
<l>At length Diana satisfide with slaughter brought upon         </l>
<l>The house of Oenie, lifts them up with fethers everichone,</l>
<l>(Save Gorgee and the daughtrinlaw of noble Alcmene) and</l>
<l>Makes wings to stretch along their sides, and horned nebs to stand</l>
<l>Upon their mouthes. And finally she altring quight their faire</l>

<l>Of Pommy hollowed diversly and ragged Pebble stone</l>

<l>Barefooted Nymphes who brought in meate. And when that of the same</l>

<l>And set downe wine in precious stones. Then Theseus who did looke </l>
<l>Upon the Sea that underneath did lie within their sight,</l>
<l>Said: tell us what is yon same place, (and with his fingar right</l>
<l>Hee poynted thereunto) I pray, and what that Iland hight,</l>
<l>Although it seemeth mo than one. The River answerd thus,</l>
<l>It is not one mayne land alone that kenned is of us.        </l>
<l>There are uppon a fyve of them. The distaunce of the place,</l>

<l>Forgetting mee kept frolicke cheere. At that gan I to swell,</l>
<l>And ran more large than ever erst, and being over fell</l>
<l>In stomacke and in streame, I rent the wood from wood, and feeld</l>
<l>From feeld, and with the ground the Nymphes as then with stomacks meeld  </l>
<l>Remembring mee, I tumbled to the Sea. The waves of mee</l>
<l>And of the sea the ground that erst all whole was woont to bee</l>
<l>Did rend asunder into all the Iles you yonder see,</l>

<l>A great way off (behold yee) stands a great way off alone,</l>
<l>As you may see. The Mariners doo call it Perimell.</l>
<l>With her (shee was as then a Nymph) so farre in love I fell,</l>
<l>That of her maydenhod I her spoyld: which thing displeasd so sore</l>
<l>Her father Sir Hippodamas, that from the craggy shore    </l>
<l>He threw her headlong downe to drowne her in the sea. But I</l>
<l>Did latch her streight, and bearing her aflote did lowd thus crie:</l>
<l>O <placeName key="tgn,2065560">Neptune</placeName> with thy threetynde Mace who hast by lot the charge</l>

<l>And I will still embrace the same. The King of Seas did move  </l>
<l>His head, and as a token that he did my sute approve,</l>
<l>He made his surges all to shake. The Nymph was sore afrayd.</l>
<l>Howbee't shee swam, and as she swam, my hand I softly layd</l>

<l>Receyved them, and that was but a pelting one in deede. </l>

<l>Hot meate came pyping from the fyre. And shortly thereupon </l>
<l>A cup of greene hedg wyne was brought. This tane away, anon</l>
<l>Came in the latter course, which was of Nuts, Dates, dryed figges,</l>
<l>Sweete smelling Apples in a Mawnd made flat of <placeName key="tgn,2561548">Osier</placeName> twigges,</l>
<l>And Prunes and Plums and Purple grapes cut newly from the tree,</l>
<l>And in the middes a honnycomb new taken from the Bee.           </l>
<l>Besydes all this there did ensew good countnance overmore,</l>
<l>With will not poore nor nigardly. Now all the whyle before,</l>
<l>As ofen as Philemon and Dame Baucis did perceyve</l>
<l>The emptie Cup to fill alone, and wyne to still receyve,</l>
<l>Amazed at the straungenesse of the thing, they gan streyght way  </l>
<l>With fearfull harts and hands hilld up to frame themselves to pray.</l>
<l>Desyring for theyr slender cheere and fare to pardoned bee.</l>
<l>They had but one poore Goose which kept theyr little Tennantree,</l>
<l>And this to offer to the Gods theyr guestes they did intend.</l>
<l>The Gander wyght of wing did make the slow old folke to spend   </l>
<l>Theyr paynes in vayne, and mokt them long. At length he seemd to flye</l>
<l>For succor to the Gods themselves, who bade he should not dye.</l>
<l>For wee bee Gods (quoth they) and all this wicked towneship shall</l>
<l>Abye their gylt. On you alone this mischeef shall not fall.</l>
<l>No more but give you up your house, and follow up this hill  </l>
<l>Togither, and upon the top therof abyde our will.</l>
<l>They bothe obeyd. And as the Gods did lead the way before,</l>
<l>They lagged slowly after with theyr staves, and labored sore</l>
<l>Ageinst the rysing of the hill. They were not mickle more</l>
<l>Than full a flyghtshot from the top, when looking backe they saw   </l>
<l>How all the towne was drowned save their lyttle shed of straw.</l>
<l>And as they wondred at the thing and did bewayle the case</l>
<l>Of those that had theyr neyghbours beene, the old poore Cote so base</l>
<l>Whereof they had beene owners erst, became a Church. The proppes</l>
<l>Were turned into pillars huge. The straw uppon the toppes  </l>
<l>Was yellow, so that all the roof did seeme of burnisht gold:</l>
<l>The floore with Marble paved was. The doores on eyther fold</l>
<l>Were graven. At the sight hereof Philemon and his make</l>
<l>Began to pray in feare. Then Jove thus gently them bespake:</l>
<l>Declare thou ryghtuowse man, and thou  woman meete to have</l>
<l>A ryghtuowse howsband, what yee would most cheefly wish or crave.</l>
<l>Philemon taking conference a little with his wyfe,</l>
<l>Declared bothe theyr meenings thus: We covet during lyfe,</l>
<l>Your Chapleynes for to bee to keepe your Temple. And bycause</l>
<l>Our yeeres in concord wee have spent, I pray when death neere drawes,  </l>
<l>Let bothe of us togither leave our lives: that neyther I</l>
<l>Behold my wyves deceace, nor shee see myne when I doo dye.</l>
<l>Theyr wish had sequele to theyr will. As long as lyfe did last,</l>
<l>They kept the Church. And beeing spent with age of yeares forepast,</l>
<l>By chaunce as standing on a tyme without the Temple doore  </l>
<l>They told the fortune of the place, Philemon old and poore</l>
<l>Saw Baucis floorish greene with leaves, and Baucis saw likewyse</l>
<l>Philemon braunching out in boughes and twigs before hir eyes.</l>
<l>And as the Bark did overgrow the heades of both, eche spake</l>
<l>To other whyle they myght. At last they eche of them did take  </l>
<l>Theyr leave of other bothe at once, and therewithall the bark</l>
<l>Did hyde theyr faces both at once. The Phrygians in that park</l>
<l>Doo at this present day still shew the trees that shaped were</l>
<l>Of theyr two bodies, growing yit togither joyntly there.</l>
<l>Theis things did auncient men report of credit verie good.   </l>
<l>For why there was no cause why they should lye. As I there stood</l>
<l>I saw the garlands hanging on the boughes, and adding new</l>
<l>I sayd: Let them whom God dooth love be Gods, and honor dew</l>
<l>Bee given to such as honor him with feare and reverence trew.

<l>To heere of woondrous things, the brooke of Calydon thus bespake:</l>
<l>There are, O valiant knyght, sum folke that had the powre to take</l>

<l>And other sum to sundrie shapes have power themselves to frame,   </l>

<l>Thou wart a fyre. No lesser power than also thus to doo</l>
<l>Had Erisicthons daughter whom Awtolychus tooke to wyfe.</l>
<l>Her father was a person that despysed all his lyfe           </l>
<l>The powre of Gods, and never did vouchsauf them sacrifyse.</l>
<l>He also is reported to have heawen in wicked wyse</l>
<l>The grove of Ceres, and to fell her holy woods which ay</l>
<l>Had undiminisht and unhackt continewed to that day.</l>
<l>There stood in it a warrie Oke which was a wood alone.       </l>
<l>Uppon it round hung fillets, crownes, and tables, many one,</l>
<l>The vowes of such as had obteynd theyr hearts desyre. Full oft</l>
<l>The Woodnymphes underneath this tree did fetch theyr frisks aloft</l>
<l>And oftentymes with hand in hand they daunced in a round</l>
<l>About the Trunk, whose bignesse was of timber good and sound  </l>
<l>Full fifteene fadom. All the trees within the wood besyde,</l>
<l>Were unto this, as weedes to them: so farre it did them hyde.</l>
<l>Yit could not this move Triops sonne his axe therefro to hold,</l>
<l>But bade his servants cut it downe. And when he did behold</l>
<l>Them stunting at his hest, he snatcht an axe with furious mood</l>
<l>From one of them, and wickedly sayd thus: Although thys wood</l>
<l>Not only were the derling of the Goddesse, but also</l>
<l>The Goddesse even herself: yet would I make it ere I go</l>
<l>To kisse the clowers with her top that pranks with braunches so.</l>
<l>This spoken, as he sweakt his axe asyde to fetch his blow,</l>
<l>The manast Oke did quake and sygh, the Acornes that did grow</l>
<l>Thereon togither with the leaves to wex full pale began,</l>
<l>And shrinking in for feare the boughes and braunches looked wan.</l>
<l>As soone as that his cursed hand had wounded once the tree,</l>

<l>It issue from a Bullocks necke whose throte is newly cut</l>
<l>Before the Altar, when his flesh to sacrifyse is put.</l>
<l>They were amazed everychone. And one among them all</l>
<l>To let the wicked act, durst from the tree his hatchet call.</l>
<l>The lewd Thessalian facing him sayd: Take thou heere to thee  </l>
<l>The guerdon of thy godlynesse, and turning from the tree,</l>
<l>He chopped off the fellowes head. Which done, he went agen</l>
<l>And heawed on the Oke. Streight from amid the tree as then</l>
<l>There issued such a sound as this: Within this tree dwell I</l>
<l>A Nymph to Ceres very deere, who now before I dye            </l>
<l>In comfort of my death doo give thee warning thou shalt bye</l>
<l>Thy dooing deere within a whyle. He goeth wilfully</l>
<l>Still thorrough with his wickednesse, untill at length the Oke</l>
<l>Pulld partly by the force of ropes, and cut with axis stroke,</l>
<l>Did fall, and with his weyght bare downe of under wood great store. </l>
<l>The Wood nymphes with the losses of the woods and theyrs ryght sore</l>
<l>Amazed, gathered on a knot, and all in mourning weede</l>
<l>Went sad to Ceres, praying her to wreake that wicked deede</l>
<l>Of Erisicthons. Ceres was content it should bee so.</l>
<l>And with the moving of her head in nodding to and fro,       </l>

<l>Hir heare was harsh and shirle, her eyes were sunken in her head.  </l>

<l>And eke above her courbed loynes her withered hippes were seene.</l>

<l>A Garland made of reedes and flags upon his sedgie heare:</l>
<l>A greeveus pennance you enjoyne. For who would gladly show</l>
<l>The combats in the which himself did take the overthrow?</l>
<l>Yit will I make a just report in order of the same.</l>
<l>For why? to have the woorser hand was not so great a shame,</l>
<l>As was the honor such a match to undertake. And much</l>
<l>It comforts mee that he who did mee overcome, was such       </l>
<l>A valiant champion. If perchaunce you erst have heard the name</l>

<l>Shee was in myne opinion. And the hope to win her love</l>
<l>Did mickle envy and debate among hir wooers move.</l>

<l>And all the other suters streight gave place unto us two.</l>
<l>He vaunted of his father Jove, and of his famous deedes,</l>
<l>And how ageinst his stepdames spyght his prowesse still proceedes.  </l>
<l>And I ageine a toother syde sayd thus: It is a shame</l>
<l>That God should yeeld to man. (This stryfe was long ere he became</l>
<l>A God). Thou seeist mee a Lord of waters in thy Realme</l>
<l>Where I in wyde and wynding banks doo beare my flowing streame.</l>
<l>No straunger shalt thou have of mee sent farre from forreine land:   </l>
<l>But one of household, or at least a neyghbour heere at hand.</l>
<l>Alonly let it bee to mee no hindrance that the wyfe</l>
<l>Of Jove abhorres mee not, ne that upon the paine of lyfe</l>
<l>Shee sets mee not to talk. For where thou bostest thee to bee</l>
<l>Alcmenas sonne, Jove eyther is not father unto thee:          </l>
<l>Or if he bee it is by sin. In making Jove thy father,</l>
<l>Thou maakst thy mother but a whore. Now choose thee whither rather</l>
<l>Thou had to graunt this tale of Jove surmised for to bee,</l>
<l>Or else thy selfe begot in shame and borne in bastardee.</l>
<l>At that he grimly bendes his browes, and much adoo he hath   </l>
<l>To hold his hands, so sore his hart inflamed is with wrath.</l>
<l>He said no more but thus: My hand dooth serve mee better than</l>
<l>My toong. Content I am (so I in feighting vanquish can)</l>
<l>That thou shalt overcome in wordes. And therewithall he gan</l>
<l>Mee feercely to assaile. Mee thought it was a shame for mee   </l>
<l>That had even now so stoutly talkt, in dooings faint to bee.</l>
<l>I casting off my greenish cloke thrust stifly out at length</l>
<l>Mine armes and streynd my pawing armes to hold him out by strength,</l>
<l>And framed every limme to cope. With both his hollow hands</l>
<l>He caught up dust and sprincked mee: and I likewise with sands    </l>
<l>Made him all yelow too. One whyle hee at my necke dooth snatch</l>
<l>Another whyle my cleere crisp legges he striveth for to catch,</l>
<l>Or trippes at mee: and everywhere the vauntage he dooth watch.</l>
<l>My weightinesse defended mee, and cleerly did disfeate</l>
<l>His stoute assaults as when a wave with hideous noyse dooth beate   </l>
<l>Against a Rocke, the Rocke dooth still both sauf and sound abyde</l>

<l>And then incountring fresh ageine, wee kept our places stowt</l>
<l>Full minded not to yeeld an inch, but for to hold it owt.</l>
<l>Now were wee stonding foote to foote. And I with all my brest  </l>
<l>Was leaning forward, and with head ageinst his head did rest,</l>
<l>And with my gryping fingars I ageinst his fingars thrust.</l>
<l>So have I seene two myghtie Bulles togither feercely just</l>
<l>In seeking as their pryse to have the fayrest Cow in all</l>
<l>The feeld to bee their make, and all the herd bothe greate and small </l>

<l>My hold: and with a push (I will tell truthe) he had a knacke  </l>
<l>To turne me off, and heavily he hung upon my backe.</l>
<l>And if I may beleeved bee (as sure I meene not I</l>
<l>To vaunt my selfe vayngloriusly by telling of a lye,)</l>
<l>Mee thought a mountaine whelmed me. But yit with much adoo</l>

<l>Mee by the necke. Then was I fayne to sinke with knee to ground,</l>
<l>And kisse the dust. Now when in strength too weake myself I found,</l>
<l>I tooke mee to my slights, and slipt in shape of Snake away </l>
<l>Of wondrous length. And when that I of purpose him to fray</l>
<l>Did bend myself in swelling rolles, and made a hideous noyse</l>
<l>Of hissing with my forked toong, he smyling at my toyes,</l>
<l>And laughing them to scorne sayd thus: It is my Cradle game</l>
<l>To vanquish Snakes, O Acheloy. Admit thou overcame </l>
<l>All other Snakes, yet what art thou compared to the Snake</l>
<l>Of Lerna, who by cutting off did still encreasement take?</l>
<l>For of a hundred heades not one so soone was paarde away,</l>
<l>But that uppon the stump therof there budded other tway.</l>
<l>This sprouting Snake whose braunching heads by slaughter did revive </l>
<l>And grow by cropping, I subdewd, and made it could not thryve.</l>
<l>And thinkest thou (who being none wouldst seeme a Snake) to scape?</l>
<l>Who doost with foorged weapons feyght and under borowed shape?</l>
<l>This sayd, his fingars of my necke he fastned in the nape.</l>
<l>Mee thought he graand my throte as though he did with pinsons nip. </l>
<l>I struggled from his churlish thumbes my pinched chappes to slip</l>
<l>But doo the best and worst I could he overcame mee so.</l>
<l>Then thirdly did remayne the shape of Bull, and quickly tho</l>
<l>I turning to the shape of Bull rebelld ageinst my fo.</l>
<l>He stepping to my left syde cloce, did fold his armes about  </l>
<l>My wattled necke, and following mee then running maynely out</l>
<l>Did drag mee backe, and made mee pitch my homes against the ground,</l>
<l>And in the deepest of the sand he overthrew mee round.</l>
<l>And yit not so content, such hold his cruell hand did take</l>
<l>Uppon my welked horne, that he asunder quight it brake,</l>
<l>And pulld it from my maymed brew. The waterfayries came</l>
<l>And filling it with frute and flowres did consecrate the same,</l>
<l>And so my horne the Tresory of plenteousnesse became.</l>
<l>As soone as Acheloy had told this tale a wayting Mayd</l>
<l>With flaring heare that lay on both hir shoulders and arrayd</l>
<l>Like one of Dame Dianas Nymphes with solemne grace forth came</l>
<l>And brought that rich and precious home, and heaped in the same</l>
<l>All kynd of frutes that Harvest sendes, and specially such frute</l>
<l>As serves for latter course at meales of every sort and sute.</l>
<l>As soone as daylight came ageine, and that the Sunny rayes </l>

<l>But of the selfsame <placeName key="tgn,2497754">Mayd</placeName> the love killd thee, feerce Nesse, in deede,</l>
<l>When percing swiftly through thy back an arrow made thee bleede.</l>
<l>For as Joves issue with his wyfe was onward on his way</l>
<l>In going to his countryward, enforst he was to stay</l>
<l>At swift Euenus bank, bycause the streame was risen sore</l>
<l>Above his bounds through rage of rayne that fell but late before.</l>
<l>Agein so full of whoorlpooles and of gulles the channell was,  </l>
<l>That scarce a man could any where fynd place of passage. As</l>
<l>Not caring for himself but for his wyfe he there did stand,</l>
<l>This Nessus came unto him (who was strong of body and</l>
<l>Knew well the foordes), and sayd: Use thou thy strength, O <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName>,</l>
<l>In swimming. I will fynd the meanes this Ladie shall with ease</l>
<l>Bee set uppon the further bank. So <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName> betooke</l>
<l>His wyfe to Nessus. Shee for feare of him and of the brooke</l>
<l>Lookte pale. Her husband as he had his quiver by his syde</l>

<l>(For to the further bank he erst his club and bow had cast)  </l>
<l>Said: Sith I have begonne, this brooke bothe must and shalbee past.</l>
<l>He never casteth further doubts, nor seekes the calmest place,</l>
<l>But through the roughest of the streame he cuts his way apace.</l>
<l>Now as he on the furthersyde was taking up his bow,</l>
<l>His heard his wedlocke shreeking out, and did hir calling know:  </l>
<l>And cryde to <placeName key="tgn,1127714">Nesse</placeName> (who went about to deale unfaythfully</l>

<l>For all that thou hast horses feete which doo so bolde thee make,</l>
<l>Yit shalt thou not escape my hands. I will thee overtake      </l>
<l>With wound and not with feete. He did according as he spake.</l>
<l>For with an arrow as he fled he strake him through the backe,</l>
<l>And out before his brist ageine the hooked iron stacke.</l>
<l>And when the same was pulled out, the blood amayne ensewd</l>
<l>At both the holes with poyson foule of Lerna Snake embrewd:  </l>
<l>This blood did Nessus take, and said within himselfe: Well: sith</l>
<l>I needes must dye, yet will I not dye unrevendgd. And with</l>
<l>The same he staynd a shirt, and gave it unto Dyanyre,</l>
<l>Assuring hir it had the powre to kindle Cupids fyre.</l>
<l>A greate whyle after when the deedes of worthy Hercules </l>
<l>Were such as filled all the world, and also did appease</l>
<l>The hatred of his stepmother, as he uppon a day</l>
<l>With conquest from Oechalia came, and was abowt to pay</l>
<l>His vowes to Jove uppon the Mount of Cenye, tatling fame</l>
<l>(Who in reporting things of truth delyghts to sauce the same</l>

<l>Told Dyanyre that Hercules did cast a liking to</l>
<l>A Ladie called Iolee. And Dyanyra (whoo</l>
<l>Was jealous over Hercules,) gave credit to the same.          </l>
<l>And when that of a <placeName key="tgn,7003763">Leman</placeName> first the tidings to hir came,</l>
<l>She being striken to the hart, did fall to teares alone,</l>
<l>And in a lamentable wise did make most wofull mone.</l>
<l>Anon she said: what meene theis teares thus gushing from myne eyen?</l>
<l>My husbands <placeName key="tgn,7003763">Leman</placeName> will rejoyce at theis same teares of myne. </l>
<l>Nay, sith she is to come, the best it were to shonne delay,</l>
<l>And for to woork sum new devyce and practyse whyle I may,</l>
<l>Before that in my bed her limbes the filthy strumpet lay.</l>
<l>And shall I then complayne? or shall I hold my toong with skill?</l>
<l>Shall I returne to Calydon? or shall I tarry still?          </l>
<l>Or shall I get me out of doores, and let them have their will?</l>
<l>What if that I (Meleager) remembring mee to bee</l>
<l>Thy suster, to attempt sum act notorious did agree?</l>
<l>And in a harlots death did shew (that all the world myght see)</l>
<l>What greef can cause the womankynd to enterpryse among?     </l>
<l>And specially when thereunto they forced are by wrong.</l>
<l>With wavering thoughts ryght violently her mynd was tossed long.</l>
<l>At last shee did preferre before all others, for to send</l>
<l>The shirt bestayned with the blood of Nessus to the end</l>
<l>To quicken up the quayling love. And so not knowing what    </l>
<l>She gave, she gave her owne remorse and greef to Lychas that</l>
<l>Did know as little as herself: and wretched woman, shee</l>
<l>Desyrd him gently to her Lord presented it to see.</l>
<l>The noble Prince receyving it without mistrust therein,</l>
<l>Did weare the poyson of the Snake of <placeName key="perseus,Lerna">Lerna</placeName> next his skin.   </l>
<l>To offer incense and to pray to Jove he did begin,</l>
<l>And on the Marble Altar he full boawles of wyne did shed,</l>
<l>When as the poyson with the heate resolving, largely spred</l>
<l>Through all the limbes of Hercules. As long as ere he could,</l>
<l>The stoutnesse of his hart was such, that sygh no whit he would.    </l>
<l>But when the mischeef grew so great all pacience to surmount,</l>
<l>He thrust the altar from him streight, and filled all the mount</l>
<l>Of Oeta with his roring out. He went about to teare</l>
<l>The deathfull garment from his backe, but where he pulled, there</l>
<l>He pulld away the skin: and (which is lothsum to report)    </l>
<l>It eyther cleaved to his limbes and members in such sort</l>
<l>As that he could not pull it off, or else it tare away</l>
<l>The flesh, that bare his myghty bones and grisly sinewes lay.</l>
<l>The scalding venim boyling in his blood, did make it hisse,</l>

<l>There was no measure of his paine. The frying venim hent</l>

<l>And wounded over Oeta hygh, he stalking gan to stray,</l>

<l>Or casting up his handes to heaven where Jove his father dwelles.</l>
<l>Behold as Lychas trembling in a hollow rock did lurk,</l>

<l>He sayd: Art thou, syr Lychas, he that broughtest unto mee</l>
<l>This plagye present? of my death must thou the woorker bee?</l>
<l>Hee quaakt and shaakt, and looked pale, and fearfully gan make</l>

<l>The furious Hercule caught him up, and swindging him about  </l>
<l>His head a halfe a doozen tymes or more, he floong him out</l>
<l>Into th'Euboyan sea with force surmounting any sling.</l>
<l>He hardened into peble stone as in the ayre he hing.</l>
<l>And even as rayne conjeald by wynd is sayd to turne to snowe,</l>
<l>And of the snow round rolled up a thicker masse to growe,  </l>

<l>In shape of man ageinst the which the shipmen shun to knocke,</l>
<l>As though it could them feele, and they doo call it by the name</l>
<l>Of Lychas still. But thou Joves imp of great renowme and fame,</l>
<l>Didst fell the trees of Oeta high, and making of the same</l>
<l>A pyle, didst give to Poeans sonne thy quiver and thy bow, </l>
<l>And arrowes which should help agein <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> towne to overthrow.</l>
<l>He put to fyre, and as the same was kindling in the pyle,</l>
<l>Thy selfe didst spred thy <placeName key="tgn,7008772">Lyons</placeName> skin upon the wood the whyle,</l>
<l>And leaning with thy head ageinst thy Club, thou laydst thee downe</l>
<l>As cheerfully, as if with flowres and garlonds on thy crowne  </l>
<l>Thou hadst beene set a banquetting among full cups of wyne.</l>
<l>Anon on every syde about those carelesse limbes of thyne</l>
<l>The fyre began to gather strength, and crackling noyse did make,</l>
<l>Assayling him whose noble hart for daliance did it take.</l>
<l>The Goddes for this defender of the earth were sore afrayd  </l>
<l>To whom with cheerefull countnance Jove perceyving it thus sayd:</l>
<l>This feare of yours is my delyght, and gladly even with all</l>
<l>My hart I doo rejoyce, O Gods, that mortall folk mee call</l>
<l>Their king and father, thinking mee ay myndfull of their weale,</l>
<l>And that myne offspring should doo well your selves doo show such zeale. </l>
<l>For though that you doo attribute your favor to desert,</l>
<l>Considring his most woondrous acts: yit I too for my part</l>
<l>Am bound unto you. Nerethelesse, for that I would not have</l>
<l>Your faythfull harts without just cause in fearfull passions wave,</l>
<l>I would not have you of the flames in Oeta make account.     </l>
<l>For as he hath all other things, so shall he them surmount.</l>
<l>Save only on that part that he hath taken of his mother,</l>
<l>The fyre shall have no power at all. Eternall is the tother,</l>
<l>The which he takes of mee, and cannot dye, ne yeeld to fyre.</l>
<l>When this is rid of earthly drosse, then will I lift it hygher,  </l>
<l>And take it unto heaven: and I beleeve this deede of myne</l>
<l>Will gladsome bee to all the Gods. If any doo repyne,</l>
<l>If any doo repyne, I say, that Hercule should become</l>
<l>A God, repyne he still for mee, and looke he sowre and glum.</l>
<l>But let him know that Hercules deserveth this reward,         </l>
<l>And that he shall ageinst his will alow it afterward.</l>
<l>The Gods assented everychone. And Juno seemd to make</l>
<l>No evill countnance to the rest, untill hir husband spake</l>
<l>The last. For then her looke was such as well they might perceyve,</l>
<l>Shee did her husbands noting her in evil part conceyve.      </l>
<l>Whyle Jove was talking with the Gods, as much as fyre could waste</l>
<l>So much had fyre consumde. And now, O Hercules, thou haste</l>
<l>No carkesse for to know thee by. That part is quyght bereft</l>
<l>Which of thy mother thou didst take. Alonly now is left</l>
<l>The likenesse that thou tookst of Jove. And as the Serpent slye  </l>
<l>In casting of his withered slough, renewes his yeeres thereby,</l>
<l>And wexeth lustyer than before, and looketh crisp and bryght</l>
<l>With scoured scales: so Hercules as soone as that his spryght</l>
<l>Had left his mortall limbes, gan in his better part to thryve,</l>
<l>And for to seeme a greater thing than when he was alyve,    </l>
<l>And with a stately majestie ryght reverend to appeere.</l>
<l>His myghty father tooke him up above the cloudy spheere,</l>
<l>And in a charyot placed him among the streaming starres.

<l>Upon her left knee shee had pitcht her right ham, and besyde</l>

<l>Shee spyde Lucina set uppon the altar holding fast</l>

<l>That nothing save her upper partes shee could that present move.  </l>
<l>A tender barke growes from beneath up leysurly above,</l>
<l>And softly overspreddes her loynes, which when shee saw, shee went</l>
<l>About to teare her heare, and full of leaves her hand shee hent.</l>
<l>Her head was overgrowen with leaves. And little Amphise (so</l>
<l>Had Eurytus his Graundsyre naamd her sonne not long ago)    </l>
<l>Did feele his mothers dugges wex hard. And as he still them drew</l>
<l>In sucking, not a whit of milke nor moysture did ensew.</l>
<l>I standing by thee did behold thy cruell chaunce: but nought</l>
<l>I could releeve thee, suster myne. Yit to my powre I wrought</l>
<l>To stay the growing of thy trunk and of thy braunches by    </l>
<l>Embracing thee. Yea I protest I would ryght willingly</l>
<l>Have in the selfesame barke with thee bene closed up. Behold,</l>
<l>Her husband, good Andraemon, and her wretched father, old</l>
<l>Sir Eurytus came thither and enquyrd for Dryopee.</l>
<l>And as they askt for Dryopee, I shewd them Lote the tree.   </l>
<l>They kist the wood which yit was warme, and falling downe bylow,</l>
<l>Did hug the rootes of that their tree. My suster now could show</l>
<l>No part which was not wood except her face. A deawe of teares</l>
<l>Did stand uppon the wretched leaves late formed of her heares.</l>
<l>And whyle she might, and whyle her mouth did give her way to speake, </l>
<l>With such complaynt as this, her mynd shee last or all did breake:</l>
<l>If credit may bee given to such as are in wretchednesse,</l>
<l>I sweare by God I never yit deserved this distresse.</l>
<l>I suffer peyne without desert. My lyfe hath guiltlesse beene.</l>
<l>And if I lye, I would theis boughes of mine which now are greene,  </l>
<l>Myght withered bee, and I heawen downe and burned in the fyre.</l>
<l>This infant from his mothers wombe remove you I desyre:</l>
<l>And put him forth to nurce, and cause him underneath my tree</l>
<l>Oft tymes to sucke, and oftentymes to play. And when that hee</l>
<l>Is able for to speake I pray you let him greete mee heere,  </l>
<l>And sadly say: in this same trunk is hid my mother deere.</l>
<l>But lerne him for to shun all ponds and pulling flowres from trees,</l>
<l>And let him in his heart beleeve that all the shrubs he sees,</l>
<l>Are bodyes of the Goddesses. Adew deere husband now,</l>
<l>Adew deere father, and adew deere suster. And in yow        </l>
<l>If any love of mee remayne, defend my boughes I pray</l>
<l>From wound of cutting hooke and ax, and bite of beast for ay.</l>
<l>And for I cannot stoope to you, rayse you yourselves to mee,</l>
<l>And come and kisse mee whyle I may yit toucht and kissed bee.</l>
<l>And lift mee up my little boy. I can no lenger talke,       ^</l>
<l>For now about my lillye necke as if it were a stalke</l>
<l>The tender rynd beginnes to creepe, and overgrowes my top.</l>
<l>Remove your fingars from my face. The spreading barke dooth stop</l>
<l>My dying eyes without your help. Shee had no sooner left</l>
<l>Her talking, but her lyfe therewith togither was bereft.    </l>
<l>But yit a goodwhyle after that her native shape did fade,</l>
<l>Her newmade boughes continewed warme. Now whyle that Iole made</l>
<l>Report of this same woondrous tale, and whyle Alcmena (who</l>
<l>Did weepe) was drying up the teares of Iole weeping too,</l>
<l>By putting to her thomb: there hapt a sodeine thing so straunge,    </l>
<l>That unto mirth from heavinesse theyr harts it streight did chaunge.</l>
<l>For at the doore in manner even a very boy as then</l>
<l>With short soft Downe about his chin, revoked backe agen</l>
<l>To youthfull yeares, stood Iolay with countnance smooth and trim.</l>
<l>Dame Hebee, Junos daughter, had bestowde this gift on him,  </l>
<l>Entreated at his earnest sute. Whom mynding fully there</l>
<l>The giving of like gift ageine to any to forsweare,</l>
<l>Dame Themis would not suffer. For (quoth shee) this present howre</l>
<l>Is cruell warre in Thebee towne, and none but Jove hath powre</l>
<l>To vanquish stately Canapey. The brothers shall alike       </l>
<l>Wound eyther other. And alyve a Prophet shall go seeke</l>
<l>His owne quicke ghoste among the dead, the earth him swallowing in.</l>
<l>The sonne by taking vengeance for his fathers death shall win</l>
<l>The name of kynd and wicked man, in one and selfsame cace.</l>
<l>And flayght with mischeefes, from his wits and from his native place </l>
<l>The furies and his mothers ghoste shall restlessely him chace,</l>
<l>Untill his wyfe demaund of him the fatall gold for meede,</l>
<l>And that his cousin Phegies swoord doo make his sydes to bleede.</l>
<l>Then shall the fayre Callirrhoee, Achelous daughter, pray</l>
<l>The myghty Jove in humble wyse to graunt her children may    </l>
<l>Retyre ageine to youthfull yeeres, and that he will not see</l>
<l>The death of him that did revenge unvenged for to bee.</l>

<l>Which still reteynes the name of him that first the same did found.</l>
<l>And there the daughter of the brooke <placeName key="tgn,1121561">Maeander</placeName> which dooth go    </l>
<l>So often backward, Cyane, a Nymph of body so</l>
<l>Exceeding comly as the lyke was seldome heard of, as</l>

<l>Was knowen by <placeName key="tgn,7002386">Milet</placeName>: unto whom a payre of twinnes shee brought,</l>
<l>And of the twinnes the names were Caune and Byblis. Byblis ought </l>
<l>To bee a mirror unto Maydes in lawfull wyse to love.</l>
<l>This Byblis cast a mynd to Caune, but not as did behove</l>
<l>A suster to her brotherward. When first of all the fyre</l>
<l>Did kindle, shee perceyvd it not. Shee thought in her desyre</l>
<l>Of kissing him so oftentymes no sin, ne yit no harme        </l>
<l>In cleeping him about the necke so often with her arme.</l>
<l>The glittering glosse of godlynesse beguyld her long. Her love</l>
<l>Began from evill unto woorse by little too remove.</l>
<l>Shee commes to see her brother deckt in brave and trim attyre,</l>
<l>And for to seeme exceeding fayre it was her whole desyre.   </l>
<l>And if that any fayrer were in all the flocke than shee,</l>
<l>It spyghts her. In what case she was as yit shee did not see.</l>
<l>Her heate exceeded not so farre as for to vow: and yit</l>
<l>Shee suffred in her troubled brist full many a burning fit.</l>
<l>Now calleth shee him mayster, now shee utter hateth all    </l>
<l>The names of kin. Shee rather had he should her Byblis call</l>
<l>Than suster. Yit no filthy hope shee durst permit to creepe</l>
<l>Within her mynd awake. But as shee lay in quiet sleepe,</l>
<l>Shee oft behild her love: and oft she thought her brother came</l>
<l>And lay with her, and (though asleepe) shee blushed at the same. </l>
<l>When sleepe was gone, she long lay dumb still musing on the syght,</l>
<l>And said with wavering mynd: Now wo is mee, most wretched wyght.</l>
<l>What meenes the image of this dreame that I have seene this nyght?</l>
<l>I would not wish it should bee trew. Why dreamed I then so?</l>
<l>Sure hee is fayre although hee should bee judged by his fo.  </l>
<l>He likes mee well, and were he not my brother, I myght set</l>
<l>My love on him, and he were mee ryght woorthy for to get,</l>
<l>But unto this same match the name of kinred is a let.</l>
<l>Well, so that I awake doo still mee undefylde keepe,</l>
<l>Let come as often as they will such dreamings in my sleepe.  </l>
<l>In sleepe there is no witnesse by. In sleepe yit may I take</l>
<l>As greate a pleasure (in a sort) as if I were awake.</l>
<l>Oh Venus and thy tender sonne, Sir Cupid, what delyght,</l>
<l>How present feeling of your sport hath touched mee this nyght.</l>
<l>How lay I as it were resolvd both maree, flesh, and bone.  </l>
<l>How gladdes it mee to thinke thereon. Alas too soone was gone</l>
<l>That pleasure, and too hastye and despyghtfull was the nyght</l>
<l>In breaking of my joyes. O Lord, if name of kinred myght</l>
<l>Betweene us two removed bee, how well it would agree,</l>
<l>O Caune, that of thy father I the daughtrinlaw should bee.  </l>
<l>How fitly myght my father have a sonneinlaw of thee.</l>
<l>Would God that all save auncesters were common to us twayne.</l>
<l>I would thou were of nobler stocke than I. I cannot sayne,</l>
<l>O perle of beautie, what shee is whom thou shalt make a mother.</l>
<l>Alas how ill befalles it mee that I could have none other   </l>
<l>Than those same parents which are thyne. So only still my brother</l>
<l>And not my husband mayst thou bee. The thing that hurts us bothe</l>
<l>Is one, and that betweene us ay inseparably gothe.</l>
<l>What meene my dreames then? what effect have dreames? and may there bee</l>
<l>Effect in dreames? The Gods are farre in better case than wee.  </l>
<l>For why? the Gods have matched with theyr susters as wee see.</l>
<l>So Saturne did alie with Ops, the neerest of his blood.</l>
<l>So Tethys with Oceanus: So Jove did think it good</l>
<l>To take his suster Juno to his wyfe. What then? the Goddes</l>
<l>Have lawes and charters by themselves. And sith there is such oddes </l>
<l>Betweene the state of us and them, why should I sample take,</l>
<l>Our worldly matters equall with the heavenly things to make?</l>
<l>This wicked love shall eyther from my hart be driven away,</l>
<l>Or if it can not bee expulst, God graunt I perish may,</l>
<l>And that my brother kisse me, layd on Herce to go to grave.  </l>
<l>But my desyre the full consent of both of us dooth crave.</l>
<l>Admit the matter liketh me. He will for sin it take.</l>
<l>But yit the sonnes of Aeolus no scrupulousnesse did make</l>
<l>In going to theyr susters beds. And how come I to know</l>
<l>The feates of them? To what intent theis samples doo I show?</l>
<l>Ah whither am I headlong driven? avaunt foule filthy fyre:</l>
<l>And let mee not in otherwyse than susterlyke desyre</l>
<l>My brothers love. Yit if that he were first in love with mee,</l>
<l>His fondnesse to inclyne unto perchaunce I could agree.</l>
<l>Shall I therefore who would not have rejected him if hee    </l>
<l>Had sude to mee, go sue to him? and canst thou speake in deede?</l>
<l>And canst thou utter forth thy mynd? and tell him of thy neede?</l>

<l>Alas to what ungraciousnesse intend I for to fall?</l>
<l>What furie raging in my hart my senses dooth appall?        </l>

<l>She notes, she blurres, dislikes, and likes: and chaungeth this for that. </l>
<l>Shee layes away the booke, and takes it up. Shee wotes not what</l>
<l>She would herself. What ever thing shee myndeth for to doo</l>

<l>She snatcht the tables up, and did theis following woords ingrave:</l>
<l>The health which if thou give her not shee is not like to have</l>
<l>Thy lover wisheth unto thee. I dare not ah for shame</l>
<l>I dare not tell thee who I am, nor let thee heare my name.</l>
<l>And if thou doo demaund of mee what thing I doo desyre,    </l>
<l>Would God that namelesse I myght pleade the matter I requyre,</l>
<l>And that I were unknowen to thee by name of Byblis, till</l>

<l>My oft embracing of thee: and such kisses (if perdye</l>
<l>Thou marked them) as very well thou might have felt and found</l>
<l>Not for to have beene Susterlike. But though with greevous wound</l>
<l>I then were striken to the hart, although the raging flame </l>
<l>Did burne within: yit take I God to witnesse of the same,</l>
<l>I did as much as lay in mee this outrage for to tame.</l>
<l>And long I stryved (wretched wench) to scape the violent Dart</l>

<l>Deserve not on my tumb thy name subscribed for to have,</l>
<l>That thou art he whose cruelnesse did bring mee to my grave.</l>

<l>Immediatly to seale her shame shee takes a precious stone,</l>
<l>The which shee moystes with teares: from tung the moysture quight was gone.</l>
<l>She calld a servant shamefastly, and after certaine fayre</l>

<l>Of tables (quoth shee) to my (and a great whyle afterward       </l>
<l>Shee added) brother. Now through chaunce or want of good regard</l>
<l>The table slipped downe to ground in reaching to him ward.</l>
<l>The handsell troubled sore her mynd. But yit shee sent them. And</l>
<l>Her servant spying tyme did put them into Caunyes hand.</l>
<l>Maeanders nephew sodeinly in anger floong away                  </l>
<l>The tables ere he half had red, (scarce able for to stay</l>
<l>His fistocke from the servants face who quaakt) and thus did say:</l>
<l>Avaunt, thou baudye ribawd, whyle thou mayst. For were it not</l>
<l>For shame I should have killed thee. Away afrayd he got,</l>
<l>And told his mistresse of the feerce and cruell answer made     </l>
<l>By Caunye. By and by the hew of Byblis gan to fade,</l>
<l>And all her body was benumd with Icie colde for feare</l>
<l>To heere of this repulse. Assoone as that her senses were</l>
<l>Returnd ageine, her furious flames returned with her witts.</l>
<l>And thus shee sayd so soft that scarce hir toong the ayer hitts:  </l>
<l>And woorthely. For why was I so rash as to discover</l>
<l>By hasty wryghting this my wound which most I ought to cover?</l>
<l>I should with dowtfull glauncing woords have felt his humor furst,</l>
<l>And made a trayne to trye him if pursue or no he durst.</l>
<l>I should have vewed first the coast, to see the weather cleere,  </l>
<l>And then I myght have launched sauf and boldly from the peere.</l>
<l>But now I hoyst up all my sayles before I tryde the wynd:</l>
<l>And therfore am I driven uppon the rockes against my mynd,</l>
<l>And all the sea dooth overwhelme mee. Neyther may I fynd</l>
<l>The meanes to get to harbrough, or from daunger to retyre.  </l>
<l>Why did not open tokens warne to bridle my desyre,</l>
<l>Then when the tables falling in delivering them declaard</l>
<l>My hope was vaine? And ought not I then eyther to have spaard</l>
<l>From sending them as that day? or have chaunged whole my mynd?</l>
<l>Nay rather shifted of the day? For had I not beene blynd   </l>
<l>Even God himself by soothfast signes the sequele seemd to hit.</l>
<l>Yea rather than to wryghting thus my secrets to commit,</l>
<l>I should have gone and spoke myself, and presently have showde</l>
<l>My fervent love. He should have seene how teares had from mee flowde.</l>
<l>Hee should have seene my piteous looke ryght loverlike. I could    </l>
<l>Have spoken more than into those my tables enter would.</l>
<l>About his necke against his will, myne armes I myght have wound</l>
<l>And had he shaakt me off, I myght have seemed for to swound.</l>
<l>I humbly myght have kist his feete, and kneeling on the ground</l>
<l>Besought him for to save my lyfe. All theis I myght have proved,   </l>
<l>Wherof although no one alone his stomacke could have moved,</l>
<l>Yit all togither myght have made his hardened hart relent.</l>
<l>Perchaunce there was some fault in him that was of message sent.</l>
<l>He stept unto him bluntly (I beleeve) and did not watch</l>
<l>Convenient tyme, in merrie kew at leysure him to catch.</l>
<l>Theis are the things that hindred mee. For certeinly I knowe</l>
<l>No sturdy stone nor massy steele dooth in his stomacke grow.</l>
<l>He is not made of Adamant. He is no Tygers whelp.</l>
<l>He never sucked Lyonesse. He myght with little help</l>
<l>Bee vanquisht. Let us give fresh charge uppon him. Whyle I live  </l>
<l>Without obteyning victorie I will not over give.</l>
<l>For firstly (if it lay in mee my dooings to revoke)</l>
<l>I should not have begonne at all. But seeing that the stroke</l>
<l>Is given, the second poynt is now to give the push to win.</l>
<l>For neyther he (although that I myne enterpryse should blin)  </l>
<l>Can ever whyle he lives forget my deede. And sith I shrink,</l>
<l>My love was lyght, or else I meant to trap him, he shall think.</l>
<l>Or at the least he may suppose that this my rage of love</l>
<l>Which broyleth so within my brest, proceedes not from above</l>
<l>By Cupids stroke, but of some foule and filthy lust. In fyne  </l>
<l>I cannot but to wickednesse now more and more inclyne.</l>
<l>By wryghting is my sute commenst: my meening dooth appeere:</l>
<l>And though I cease: yit can I not accounted bee for cleere.</l>

<l>The waternymphes (so folk report) put under her a spring,</l>
<l>Whych never myght be dryde: and could they give a greater thing?</l>

<l>The fame of this same wondrous thing perhappes had filled all</l>
<l>The hundred Townes of Candye had a greater not befall</l>
<l>More neerer home by Iphys meanes transformed late before.</l>
<l>For in the shyre of Phestos hard by Gnossus dwelt of yore   </l>
<l>A yeoman of the meaner sort that <placeName key="perseus,Lyctus">Lyctus</placeName> had to name.</l>
<l>His stocke was simple, and his welth according to the same.</l>
<l>Howbee't his lyfe so upryght was, as no man could it blame.</l>
<l>He came unto his wyfe then big and ready downe to lye,</l>
<l>And sayd: Two things I wish thee. T'one, that when thou out shalt crye, </l>
<l>Thou mayst dispatch with little payne: the other that thou have</l>
<l>A Boay. For Gyrles to bring them up a greater cost doo crave.</l>
<l>And I have no abilitie. And therefore if thou bring</l>
<l>A wench (it goes ageinst my heart to thinke uppon the thing)</l>
<l>Although ageinst my will, I charge it streyght destroyed bee. </l>
<l>The bond of nature needes must beare in this behalf with mee</l>
<l>This sed, both wept exceedingly, as well the husband who</l>
<l>Did give commaundement, as the wyfe that was commaunded too.</l>
<l>Yit Telethusa earnestly at Lyct her husband lay,</l>
<l>(Although in vayne) to have good hope, and of himselfe more stay. </l>
<l>But he was full determined. Within a whyle, the day</l>
<l>Approched that the frute was rype, and shee did looke to lay</l>
<l>Her belly every mynute: when at midnyght in her rest</l>
<l>Stood by her (or did seeme to stand) the Goddesse Isis, drest</l>
<l>And trayned with the solemne pomp of all her rytes. Two homes   </l>
<l>Uppon her forehead lyke the moone, with eares of rypened comes</l>
<l>Stood glistring as the burnisht gold. Moreover shee did weare</l>
<l>A rich and stately diademe. Attendant on her were</l>
<l>The barking bug Anubis, and the saint of Bubast, and</l>
<l>The pydecote Apis, and the God that gives to understand     </l>
<l>By fingar holden to his lippes that men should silence keepe,</l>
<l>And Lybian wormes whose strnging dooth enforce continuall sleepe,</l>
<l>And thou, Osyris, whom the folk of Aegypt ever seeke,</l>
<l>And never can have sought inough, and Rittlerattles eke.</l>
<l>Then even as though that Telethuse had fully beene awake,   </l>
<l>And seene theis things with open eyes, thus Isis to her spake:</l>
<l>My servant Telethusa, cease this care, and breake the charge</l>
<l>Of Lyct. And when Lucina shall have let thy frute at large,</l>
<l>Bring up the same what ere it bee. I am a Goddesse who</l>
<l>Delyghts in helping folke at neede. I hither come to doo    </l>
<l>Thee good. Thou shalt not have a cause hereafter to complayne</l>
<l>Of serving of a Goddesse that is thanklesse for thy payne.</l>
<l>When Isis had this comfort given, shee went her way agayne.</l>
<l>A joyfull wyght rose Telethuse, and lifting to the sky</l>
<l>Her hardened hands, did pray hir dreame myght woorke effectually. </l>
<l>Her throwes increast, and forth alone anon the burthen came,</l>
<l>A wench was borne to Lyctus who knew nothing of the same.</l>
<l>The mother making him beleeve it was a boay, did bring</l>
<l>It up, and none but shee and nurce were privie to the thing.</l>
<l>The father thanking God did give the chyld the Graundsyres name, </l>
<l>The which was Iphys. Joyfull was the moother of the same,</l>
<l>Bycause the name did serve alike to man and woman bothe,</l>
<l>And so the lye through godly guile forth unperceyved gothe.</l>
<l>The garments of it were a boayes. The face of it was such</l>
<l>As eyther in a boay or gyrle of beawtie uttered much.       </l>
<l>When Iphys was of thirteene yeeres, her father did insure</l>
<l>The browne Ianthee unto her, a wench of looke demure,</l>
<l>Commended for her favor and her person more than all</l>
<l>The Maydes of Phestos: Telest, men her fathers name did call.</l>
<l>He dwelt in Dyctis. They were bothe of age and favor leeke,  </l>
<l>And under both one schoolemayster they did for nurture seeke.</l>
<l>And hereupon the hartes of both, the dart of Love did streeke,</l>
<l>And wounded both of them aleeke. But unlike was theyr hope.</l>
<l>Both longed for the wedding day togither for to cope.</l>
<l>For whom Ianthee thinkes to bee a man, shee hopes to see   </l>
<l>Her husband. Iphys loves whereof shee thinkes shee may not bee</l>
<l>Partaker, and the selfesame thing augmenteth still her flame.</l>
<l>Herself a Mayden with a Mayd (ryght straunge) in love became.</l>
<l>Shee scarce could stay her teares. What end remaynes for mee (quoth shee)</l>
<l>How straunge a love? how uncoth? how prodigious reygnes in mee? </l>
<l>If that the Gods did favor mee, they should destroy mee quyght.</l>
<l>Of if they would not mee destroy, at least wyse yit they myght</l>
<l>Have given mee such a maladie as myght with nature stond,</l>
<l>Or nature were acquainted with. A Cow is never fond</l>
<l>Uppon a Cow, nor Mare on Mare. The Ram delyghts the Eawe,   </l>
<l>The Stag the Hynde, the Cocke the Hen. But never men could shew,</l>
<l>That female yit was tane in love with female kynd. O would</l>
<l>To God I never had beene borne. Yit least that Candy should</l>
<l>Not bring foorth all that monstruous were, the daughter of the Sonne</l>
<l>Did love a Bull. Howbee't there was a Male to dote uppon.   </l>
<l>My love is furiouser than hers, if truthe confessed bee.</l>
<l>For shee was fond of such a lust as myght bee compast. Shee</l>
<l>Was served by a Bull beguyld by Art in Cow of tree.</l>
<l>And one there was for her with whom advowtrie to commit.</l>
<l>If all the conning in the worlde and slyghts of suttle wit</l>
<l>Were heere, or if that Daedalus himselfe with uncowth wing</l>
<l>Of Wax should hither fly againe, what comfort should he bring?</l>
<l>Could he with all his conning crafts now make a boay of mee?</l>
<l>Or could he, O Ianthee, chaunge the native shape of thee?</l>
<l>Nay rather, Iphys, settle thou thy mynd and call thy witts  </l>
<l>Abowt thee: shake thou off theis flames that foolishly by fitts</l>
<l>Without all reason reigne. Thou seest what Nature hathe thee made</l>
<l>(Onlesse thow wilt deceyve thy selfe.) So farre foorth wysely wade,</l>
<l>As ryght and reason may support, and love as women ought.</l>
<l>Hope is the thing that breedes desyre, hope feedes the amorous thought. </l>
<l>This hope thy sex denieth thee. Not watching doth restreyne</l>
<l>Thee from embracing of the thing wherof thou art so fayne.</l>
<l>Nor yit the Husbands jealowsie, nor rowghnesse of her <placeName key="tgn,1130482">Syre</placeName>,</l>
<l>Nor yit the coynesse of the Wench dooth hinder thy desyre.</l>
<l>And yit thou canst not her enjoy. No, though that God and man</l>
<l>Should labor to their uttermost and doo the best they can</l>
<l>In thy behalfe, they could not make a happy wyght of thee.</l>
<l>I cannot wish the thing but that I have it. Frank and free</l>
<l>The Goddes have given mee what they could. As I will, so will bee</l>
<l>That must become my fathrinlaw. So willes my father, too.  </l>
<l>But nature stronger than them all consenteth not thereto.</l>
<l>This hindreth mee, and nothing else. Behold the blisfull tyme,</l>
<l>The day of Mariage is at hand. Ianthee shalbee myne,</l>
<l>And yit I shall not her enjoy. Amid the water wee</l>
<l>Shall thirst. O Juno, president of mariage, why with thee  </l>
<l>Comes Hymen to this wedding where no brydegroome you shall see,</l>
<l>But bothe are Brydes that must that day togither coupled bee?

<l>This spoken, shee did hold hir peace. And now the tother mayd</l>

<l>That I escape unpunished, that this same wench dooth live,</l>
<l>Thy counsell and thy hest it is. Have mercy now on twayne,</l>
<l>And help us. With that word the teares ran downe her cheekes amayne.</l>
<l>The Goddesse seemed for to move her Altar: and in deede</l>
<l>She moved it. The temple doores did tremble like a reede.    </l>
<l>And homes in likenesse to the Moone about the Church did shyne.</l>
<l>And Rattles made a raughtish noyse. At this same luckie signe,</l>
<l>Although not wholy carelesse, yit ryght glad shee went away.</l>
<l>And Iphys followed after her with larger pace than ay</l>
<l>Shee was accustomd. And her face continued not so whyght.  </l>
<l>Her strength encreased, and her looke more sharper was to syght.</l>
<l>Her heare grew shorter, and shee had a much more lively spryght,</l>
<l>Than when shee was a wench. For thou, O Iphys, who ryght now</l>
<l>A modther wert, art now a boay. With offrings both of yow</l>

<l>From thence in saffron colourd robe flew Hymen through the ayre,</l>
<l>And into <placeName key="tgn,7001303">Thracia</placeName> beeing called by Orphy did repayre.</l>
<l>He came in deede at Orphyes call: but neyther did he sing</l>
<l>The woordes of that solemnitie, nor merry countnance bring,</l>
<l>Nor any handsell of good lucke. His torch with drizling smoke  </l>
<l>Was dim: the same to burne out cleere, no stirring could provoke.</l>
<l>The end was woorser than the signe. For as the Bryde did rome</l>
<l>Abrode accompanyde with a trayne of Nymphes to bring her home,</l>
<l>A serpent lurking in the grasse did sting her in the ancle:</l>
<l>Whereof shee dyde incontinent, so swift the bane did rancle.  </l>
<l>Whom when the Thracian Poet had bewayld sufficiently</l>
<l>On earth, the Ghostes departed hence he minding for to trie,</l>
<l>Downe at the gate of Taenarus did go to Limbo lake.</l>
<l>And thence by gastly folk and soules late buried he did take</l>
<l>His journey to Persephonee and to the king of Ghosts       </l>
<l>That like a Lordly tyran reignes in those unpleasant coasts.</l>
<l>And playing on his tuned harp he thus began to sound:</l>
<l>O you, the Sovereines of the world set underneath the ground,</l>
<l>To whome wee all (what ever thing is made of mortall kynd)</l>
<l>Repayre, if by your leave I now may freely speake my mynd,  </l>
<l>I come not hither as a spye the shady Hell to see:</l>
<l>Nor yet the foule three headed Curre whose heares all Adders bee</l>
<l>To tye in cheynes. The cause of this my vyage is my wyfe</l>
<l>Whose foote a Viper stinging did abridge her youthfull lyfe.</l>
<l>I would have borne it paciently: and so to doo I strave,    </l>
<l>But Love surmounted powre. This God is knowen great force to have</l>

<l>But I beleeve hee reignes heere too. If fame that flies abowt</l>
<l>Of former rape report not wrong, Love coupled also yow.</l>
<l>By theis same places full of feare: by this huge Chaos now, </l>
<l>And by the stilnesse of this waste and emptye Kingdome, I</l>
<l>Beseech yee of Eurydicee unreele the destinye</l>
<l>That was so swiftly reeled up. All things to you belong.</l>
<l>And though wee lingring for a whyle our pageants do prolong,</l>
<l>Yit soone or late wee all to one abyding place doo rome: </l>

<l>And you doo over humaine kynd reigne longest tyme. Now when</l>
<l>This woman shall have lived full her tyme, shee shall agen</l>
<l>Become your owne. The use of her but for a whyle I crave.</l>
<l>And if the Destnyes for my wyfe denye mee for to have        </l>
<l>Releace, I fully am resolvd for ever heere to dwell.</l>
<l>Rejoyce you in the death of both. As he this tale did tell,</l>
<l>And played on his instrument, the bloodlesse ghostes shed teares:</l>
<l>To tyre on Titius growing hart the greedy Grype forbeares:</l>
<l>The shunning water Tantalus endevereth not to drink:</l>
<l>And Danaus daughters ceast to fill theyr tubbes that have no brink.</l>
<l>Ixions wheele stood still: and downe sate Sisyphus uppon</l>
<l>His rolling stone. Then first of all (so fame for truth hath gone)</l>
<l>The Furies beeing striken there with pitie at his song</l>
<l>Did weepe. And neyther Pluto nor his Ladie were so strong    </l>
<l>And hard of stomacke to withhold his just petition long.</l>
<l>They called foorth Eurydicee who was as yit among</l>
<l>The newcome Ghosts, and limped of her wound. Her husband tooke</l>
<l>Her with condicion that he should not backe uppon her looke,</l>
<l>Untill the tyme that hee were past the bounds of Limbo quyght: </l>
<l>Or else to lose his gyft. They tooke a path that steepe upryght</l>
<l>Rose darke and full of foggye mist. And now they were within</l>
<l>A kenning of the upper earth, when Orphye did begin</l>
<l>To dowt him lest shee followed not, and through an eager love</l>
<l>Desyrous for to see her he his eyes did backward move. </l>
<l>Immediatly shee slipped backe. He retching out his hands,</l>
<l>Desyrous to bee caught and for to ketch her grasping stands.</l>
<l>But nothing save the slippry aire (unhappy man) he caught.</l>
<l>Shee dying now the second tyme complaynd of Orphye naught.</l>
<l>For why what had shee to complayne, onlesse it were of love   </l>
<l>Which made her husband backe agen his eyes uppon her move?</l>
<l>Her last farewell shee spake so soft, that scarce he heard the sound,</l>
<l>And then revolted to the place in which he had her found.</l>
<l>This double dying of his wife set Orphye in a stound,</l>
<l>No lesse than him who at the syght of Plutos dreadfull Hound </l>
<l>That on the middle necke of three dooth beare an iron cheyne,</l>
<l>Was striken in a sodein feare and could it not restreyne,</l>
<l>Untill the tyme his former shape and nature beeing gone,</l>
<l>His body quyght was overgrowne, and turned into stone.</l>
<l>Or than the foolish Olenus, who on himself did take           </l>
<l>Anothers fault, and giltlesse needes himself would giltie make,</l>
<l>Togither with his wretched wyfe Lethaea, for whose pryde</l>
<l>They both becomming stones, doo stand even yit on watry Ide.</l>
<l>He would have gone to Hell ageine, and earnest sute did make:</l>
<l>But Charon would not suffer him to passe the Stygian lake.    </l>
<l>Seven dayes he sate forlorne uppon the bank and never eate</l>
<l>A bit of bread. Care, teares, and thought, and sorrow were his meate</l>
<l>And crying out uppon the Gods of Hell as cruell, hee</l>
<l>Withdrew to lofty Rhodopee and Heme which beaten bee</l>
<l>With Northern wynds. Three tymes the Sunne had passed through the sheere </l>
<l>And watry signe of Pisces and had finisht full the yeere,</l>
<l>And Orphye (were it that his ill successe hee still did rew,</l>
<l>Or that he vowed so to doo) did utterly eschew</l>
<l>The womankynd. Yit many a one desyrous were to match</l>
<l>With him, but he them with repulse did all alike dispatch.    </l>
<l>He also taught the Thracian folke a stewes of Males to make</l>
<l>And of the flowring pryme of boayes the pleasure for to take.

<l>That burned in the brests of Girles, who for theyr wicked lust</l>
<l>According as they did deserve, receyved penance just.     </l>
<l>The King of Goddes did burne erewhyle in love of Ganymed</l>
<l>The Phrygian and the thing was found which <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> that sted</l>
<l>Had rather bee than that he was. Yit could he not beteeme</l>
<l>The shape of any other Bird than Aegle for to seeme</l>
<l>And so he soring in the ayre with borrowed wings trust up  </l>
<l>The Trojane boay who still in heaven even yit dooth beare his cup,</l>
<l>And brings him Nectar though against Dame Junos will it bee.</l>
<l>And thou Amyclys sonne (had not thy heavy destinee</l>
<l>Abridged thee before thy tyme) hadst also placed beene</l>
<l>By Phoebus in the firmament. How bee it (as is seene)     </l>
<l>Thou art eternall so farre forth as may bee. For as oft</l>
<l>As watrie Piscis giveth place to Aries that the soft</l>
<l>And gentle springtyde dooth succeede the winter sharp and stowre:</l>
<l>So often thou renewest thyself, and on the fayre greene clowre</l>
<l>Doost shoote out flowres. My father bare a speciall love to thee  </l>
<l>Above all others. So that whyle the God went oft to see</l>
<l>Eurotas and unwalled Spart, he left his noble towne</l>
<l>Of Delphos (which amid the world is situate in renowne)</l>
<l>Without a sovereigne. Neyther Harp nor Bow regarded were.</l>
<l>Unmyndfull of his Godhead he refused not to beare </l>
<l>The nets, nor for to hold the hounds, nor as a peynfull mate</l>
<l>To travell over cragged hilles, through which continuall gate</l>
<l>His flames augmented more and more. And now the sunne did stand</l>
<l>Well neere midway beetweene the nyghts last past and next at hand.</l>
<l>They stript themselves and noynted them with oyle of Olyfe fat.  </l>
<l>And fell to throwing of a Sledge that was ryght huge and flat.</l>
<l>Fyrst Phoebus peysing it did throw it from him with such strength,</l>
<l>As that the weyght drave downe the clouds in flying. And at length</l>
<l>It fell upon substantiall ground, where plainly it did show</l>
<l>As well the cunning as the force of him that did it throw.</l>
<l>Immediatly upon desyre himself the sport to trie,</l>
<l>The Spartane lad made haste to take up unadvisedly</l>
<l>The Sledge before it still did lye. But as he was in hand</l>
<l>To catch it, it rebounding up ageinst the hardened land,</l>
<l>Did hit him full upon the face. The God himselfe did looke     </l>
<l>As pale as did the lad, and up his swounding body tooke.</l>
<l>Now culles he him, now wypes he from the wound the blood away,</l>
<l>Anotherwhyle his fading lyfe he stryves with herbes to stay.</l>
<l>Nought booted Leechcraft. Helplesse was the wound. And like as one</l>
<l>Broosd violet stalkes or Poppie stalkes or Lillies growing on  </l>
<l>Browne spindles, streight they withering droope with heavy heads and are</l>
<l>Not able for to hold them up, but with their tops doo stare</l>
<l>Uppon the ground, so Hyacinth in yeelding of his breath</l>
<l>Chopt downe his head. His necke bereft of strength by meanes of death</l>
<l>Was even a burthen to itself, and downe did loosely wrythe     </l>
<l>On both his shoulders, now a t'one and now a toother lythe.</l>
<l>Thou faadst away, my Hyacinth, defrauded of the pryme</l>
<l>Of youth (quoth Phoebus) and I see thy wound my heynous cryme.</l>
<l>Thou art my sorrow and my fault: this hand of myne hath wrought</l>
<l>Thy death: I like a murtherer have to thy grave thee brought.  </l>
<l>But what have I offended thow? onlesse that to have playd,</l>
<l>Or if that to have loved, an offence it may be sayd.</l>
<l>Would God I render myght my lyfe with and instead of thee.</l>
<l>To which syth fatall destinee denyeth to agree,</l>
<l>Both in my mynd and in my mouth thou evermore shalt bee.      </l>
<l>My Violl striken with my hand, my songs shall sound of thee,</l>
<l>And in a newmade flowre thou shalt with letters represent</l>
<l>Our syghings. And the tyme shall come ere many yeeres bee spent,</l>
<l>That in thy flowre a valeant Prince shall joyne himself with thee,</l>
<l>And leave his name uppon the leaves for men to reede and see.    </l>
<l>Whyle Phoebus thus did prophesie, behold the blood of him</l>
<l>Which dyde the grasse, ceast blood to bee, and up there sprang a trim</l>
<l>And goodly flowre, more orient than the Purple cloth ingrayne,</l>
<l>In shape a Lillye, were it not that Lillyes doo remayne</l>
<l>Of sylver colour, whereas theis of purple hew are seene.     </l>
<l>Although that Phoebus had the cause of this greate honor beene,</l>
<l>Yit thought he not the same ynough. And therfore did he wryght</l>
<l>His syghes uppon the leaves thereof: and so in colour bryght</l>
<l>The flowre hath a  writ theron, which letters are of greef.</l>
<l>So small the Spartanes thought the birth of Hyacinth repreef  </l>
<l>Unto them, that they woorship him from that day unto this.</l>
<l>And as their fathers did before, so they doe never misse</l>
<l>With solemne pomp to celebrate his feast from yeere to yeere.

<l>Now in the whyle by wondrous Art an image he did grave       </l>
<l>Of such proportion, shape, and grace as nature never gave</l>
<l>Nor can to any woman give. In this his worke he tooke</l>

<l>And such a one as that yee would beleeve had lyfe, and that</l>

<l>For every other living wyght dame nature dooth permit</l>

<l>By reason of the worthy store of suters which did woo  </l>

<l>On which of them shee had herself most fancie to bestow.</l>
<l>At first shee hild her peace a whyle, and looking wistly on</l>
<l>Her fathers face, did boyle within: and scalding teares anon</l>
<l>Ran downe her visage. Cyniras, (who thought them to proceede    </l>
<l>Of tender harted shamefastnesse) did say there was no neede</l>
<l>Of teares, and dryed her cheekes, and kist her. Myrrha tooke of it</l>
<l>Exceeding pleasure in her selfe: and when that he did wit</l>
<l>What husband shee did wish to have, shee sayd: One like to yow.</l>
<l>He undertanding not hir thought, did well her woordes allow,  </l>
<l>And sayd: In this thy godly mynd continew. At the name</l>
<l>Of godlynesse, shee cast mee downe her looke for very shame.</l>
<l>For why her giltie hart did knowe shee well deserved blame.</l>
<l>Hygh mydnight came, and sleepe bothe care and carkesses opprest.</l>

<l>Shee fryes in Cupids flames, and woorkes continewally uppon</l>
<l>Her furious love. One while shee sinkes in deepe despayre. Anon</l>
<l>Shee fully myndes to give attempt, but shame doth hold her in.</l>
<l>Shee wishes and shee wotes not what to doo, nor how to gin.</l>
<l>And like as when a mightye tree with axes heawed rownd,   </l>
<l>Now redy with a strype or twaine to lye uppon the grownd,</l>
<l>Uncerteine is which way to fall and tottreth every way:</l>
<l>Even so her mynd with dowtfull wound effeebled then did stray</l>
<l>Now heere now there uncerteinely, and tooke of bothe encreace.</l>
<l>No measure of her love was found, no rest, nor yit releace,  </l>
<l>Save only death. Death likes her best. Shee ryseth, full in mynd</l>
<l>To hang herself. About a post her girdle she doth bynd,</l>
<l>And sayd: Farewell deere Cinyras, and understand the cause</l>
<l>Of this my death. And with that woord about her necke shee drawes</l>
<l>The nooze. Her trustye nurce that in another Chamber lay  </l>
<l>By fortune heard the whispring sound of theis her woordes (folk say).</l>
<l>The aged woman rysing up unboltes the doore. And whan</l>
<l>Shee saw her in that plyght of death, shee shreeking out began</l>
<l>To smyght her self, and scratcht her brest, and quickly to her ran</l>
<l>And rent the girdle from her necke. Then weeping bitterly    </l>
<l>And holding her betweene her armes, shee askt the question why</l>
<l>Shee went about to hang her self so unadvisedly.</l>
<l>The Lady hilld her peace as dumb, and looking on the ground</l>
<l>Unmovably, was sorye in her hart for beeing found</l>
<l>Before shee had dispatcht herself. Her nurce still at her lay,  </l>
<l>And shewing her her emptie dugges and naked head all gray,</l>
<l>Besought her for the paynes shee tooke with her both night and day</l>
<l>In rocking and in feeding her, shee would vouchsafe to say</l>
<l>What ere it were that greeved her. The Ladye turnd away</l>
<l>Displeasde and fetcht a sygh. The nurce was fully bent in mynd    </l>
<l>To bowlt the matter out: for which not onely shee did bynd</l>
<l>Her fayth, in secret things to keepe: but also sayd, put mee</l>
<l>In truth to fynd a remedye. I am not (thou shalt see)</l>
<l>Yit altogither dulld by age. If furiousenesse it bee,</l>
<l>I have bothe charmes and chaunted herbes to help. If any wyght  </l>
<l>Bewitcheth thee, by witchcraft I will purge and set thee quyght.</l>
<l>Or if it bee the wrath of God, we shall with sacrifyse</l>
<l>Appease the wrath of God right well. What may I more surmyse?</l>
<l>No theeves have broken in uppon this house and spoyld the welth.</l>
<l>Thy mother and thy father bothe are living and in helth.     </l>
<l>When Myrrha heard her father naamd, a greevous sygh she fet</l>
<l>Even from the bottom of her hart. Howbee't the nurce as yet</l>
<l>Misdeemd not any wickednesse. But nerethelesse shee gest</l>
<l>There was some love: and standing in one purpose made request</l>
<l>To breake her mynd unto her, and shee set her tenderly       </l>
<l>Uppon her lappe. The Ladye wept and sobbed bitterly.</l>
<l>Then culling her in feeble armes, shee sayd: I well espye</l>
<l>Thou art in love. My diligence in this behalf I sweare</l>
<l>Shall servisable to thee bee. Thou shalt not neede to feare</l>
<l>That ere thy father shall it knowe. At that same woord shee lept    </l>
<l>From nurces lappe like one that had beene past her witts, and stept</l>
<l>With fury to her bed. At which shee leaning downe hir face</l>
<l>Sayd: Hence I pray thee: force mee not to shewe my shamefull cace.</l>
<l>And when the nurce did urge her still, shee answered eyther: Get</l>
<l>Thee hence, or ceace to aske mee why myself I thus doo fret.  </l>
<l>The thing that thou desyrste to knowe is wickednesse. The old</l>
<l>Poore nurce gan quake, and trembling both for age and feare did hold</l>
<l>Her handes to her. And kneeling downe right humbly at her feete,</l>
<l>One whyle shee fayre intreated her with gentle woordes and sweete.</l>
<l>Another whyle (onlesse shee made her privie of her sorrow)  </l>
<l>Shee threatned her, and put her in a feare shee would next morrow</l>
<l>Bewray her how shee went about to hang herself. But if</l>
<l>Shee told her, shee did plyght her fayth and help to her releef.</l>
<l>Shee lifted up her head, and then with teares fast gushing out</l>
<l>Beesloobered all her nurces brest: and going oft about      </l>
<l>To speake, shee often stayd: and with her garments hid her face</l>
<l>For shame, and lastly sayd: O happye is my moothers cace</l>
<l>That such a husband hath. With that a greevous sygh shee gave,</l>
<l>And hilld her peace. Theis woordes of hers a trembling chilnesse drave</l>
<l>In nurcis limbes, which perst her bones: (for now shee understood</l>
<l>The cace) and all her horye heare up stiffly staring stood</l>
<l>And many things she talkt to put away her cursed love,</l>
<l>If that it had beene possible the madnesse to remove.</l>
<l>The Mayd herself to be full trew the councell dooth espye:</l>
<l>Yit if shee may not have her love shee fully myndes to dye.  </l>
<l>Live still (quoth nurce) thou shalt obteine (shee durst not say thy father,</l>
<l>But stayd at that). And forbycause that Myrrha should the rather</l>
<l>Beleeve her, shee confirmd her woordes by othe. The yeerely feast</l>
<l>Of gentle Ceres came, in which the wyves bothe moste and least</l>
<l>Appareld all in whyght are woont the firstlings of the feeld,  </l>
<l>Fyne garlonds made of eares of come, to Ceres for to yeeld.</l>
<l>And for the space of thryce three nyghts they counted it a sin</l>
<l>To have the use of any man, or once to towche his skin.</l>
<l>Among theis women did the Queene freequent the secret rites.</l>
<l>Now whyle that of his lawfull wyfe his bed was voyd a nightes, </l>
<l>The nurce was dooble diligent: and fynding Cinyras</l>
<l>Well washt with wyne, shee did surmyse there was a pretye lasse</l>
<l>In love with him. And hyghly shee her beawty setteth out.</l>
<l>And beeing asked of her yeeres, she sayd shee was about</l>
<l>The age of Myrrha. Well (quoth he) then bring her to my bed.    </l>
<l>Returning home she sayd: bee glad my nurcechilde: we have sped.</l>
<l>Not all so wholly in her hart was wretched Myrrha glad,</l>
<l>But that her fore misgiving mynd did also make her sad.</l>
<l>Howbee't shee also did rejoyce as in a certaine kynd,</l>
<l>Such discord of affections was within her combred mynd.     </l>
<l>It was the tyme that all things rest. And now Bootes bryght,</l>
<l>The driver of the Oxen seven, about the northpole pyght</l>
<l>Had sumwhat turnd his wayne asyde, when wicked Myrrha sped</l>
<l>About her buysnesse. Out of heaven the golden Phoebee fled.</l>
<l>With clowds more black than any pitch the starres did hyde their hed. </l>
<l>The nyght beecommeth utter voyd of all her woonted lyght.</l>
<l>And first before all other hid their faces out of syght</l>
<l>Good Icar and Erigonee, his daughter, who for love</l>
<l>Most vertuous to her fatherward, was taken up above</l>
<l>And made a starre in heaven. Three tymes had Myrrha warning given </l>
<l>By stumbling, to retyre. Three tymes the deathfull Owle that eeven</l>
<l>With doolefull noyse prognosticates unhappie lucke. Yet came</l>
<l>Shee forward still: the darknesse of the nyght abated shame.</l>
<l>Her left hand held her nurce, her right the darke blynd way did grope.</l>
<l>Anon shee to the chamber came: anon the doore was ope:      </l>
<l>Anon she entred in. With that her foltring hammes did quake:</l>
<l>Her colour dyde: her blood and hart did cleerly her forsake.</l>
<l>The neerer shee approched to her wickednesse, the more</l>
<l>She trembled: of her enterpryse it irked her full sore:</l>
<l>And fayne shee would shee might unknowen have turned back. Nurce led  </l>
<l>Her pawsing forward by the hand: and putting her to bed,</l>
<l>Heere, take this Damzell, Cinyras, shee is thine owne, shee sed.</l>
<l>And so shee layd them brest to brest. The wicked father takes</l>
<l>His bowelles into filthy bed, and there with wordes asslakes</l>
<l>The maydens feare, and cheeres her up. And lest this cryme of theyres </l>
<l>Myght want the ryghtfull termes, by chaunce as in respect of yeeres</l>
<l>He daughter did hir call, and shee him father. Beeing sped</l>
<l>With cursed seede in wicked womb, shee left her fathers bed,</l>
<l>Of which soone after shee became greate bagged with her shame.</l>
<l>Next night the lewdnesse doubled. And no end was of the same,    </l>
<l>Untill at length that Cinyras desyrous for to knowe</l>
<l>His lover that so many nyghts uppon him did bestowe,</l>
<l>Did fetch a light: by which he sawe his owne most heynous cryme,</l>
<l>And eeke his daughter. Nathelesse, his sorrow at that time</l>
<l>Represt his speeche. Then hanging by he drew a Rapier bryght. </l>
<l>Away ran Myrrha, and by meanes of darknesse of the nyght</l>
<l>Shee was delivered from the death: and straying in the broade</l>
<l>Datebearing feeldes of Arabye, shee through Panchaya yode,</l>
<l>And wandring full nyne moonethes at length shee rested beeing tyrde</l>
<l>In <placeName key="tgn,7016796">Saba</placeName> land. And when the tyme was neere at hand expyrde,  </l>
<l>And that uneath the burthen of her womb shee well could beare,</l>
<l>Not knowing what she might desyre, distrest betweene the feare</l>
<l>Of death, and tediousnesse of lyfe, this prayer shee did make:</l>
<l>O Goddes, if of repentant folk you any mercye take,</l>
<l>Sharpe vengeance I confesse I have deserved, and content  </l>
<l>I am to take it paciently. How bee it to th'entent</l>
<l>That neyther with my lyfe the quick, nor with my death the dead</l>
<l>Anoyed bee, from both of them exempt mee this same sted,</l>
<l>And altring mee, deny to mee both lyfe and death. We see</l>
<l>To such as doo confesse theyr faults sum mercy shewd to bee.  </l>
<l>The Goddes did graunt her this request, the last that she should make.</l>
<l>The ground did overgrow hir feete, and ancles as she spake.</l>
<l>And from her bursten toes went rootes, which wrything heere and there</l>
<l>Did fasten so the trunk within the ground shee could not steare.</l>
<l>Her bones did into timber turne, whereof the marie was    </l>
<l>The pith, and into watrish sappe the blood of her did passe.</l>
<l>Her armes were turnd to greater boughes, her fingars into twig,</l>
<l>Her skin was hardned into bark. And now her belly big</l>
<l>The eatching tree had overgrowen, and overtane her brest,</l>
<l>And hasted for to win her neck, and hyde it with the rest.  </l>
<l>Shee made no taryence nor delay, but met the comming tree,</l>
<l>And shroonk her face within the barke therof. Although that shee</l>
<l>Togither with her former shape her senses all did loose,</l>
<l>Yit weepeth shee, and from her tree warme droppes doo softly woose.</l>
<l>The which her teares are had in pryce and honour. And the Myrrhe </l>
<l>That issueth from her gummy bark dooth beare the name of her,</l>
<l>And shall doo whyle the world dooth last. The misbegotten chyld</l>
<l>Grew still within the tree, and from his mothers womb defyld</l>
<l>Sought meanes to bee delyvered. Her burthende womb did swell</l>
<l>Amid the tree, and stretcht her out. But woordes wherwith to tell  </l>
<l>And utter foorth her greef did want. She had no use of speech</l>
<l>With which Lucina in her throwes shee might of help beseech.</l>
<l>Yit like a woman labring was the tree, and bowwing downe</l>
<l>Gave often sighes, and shed foorth teares as though shee there should drowne.</l>
<l>Lucina to this wofull tree came gently downe, and layd    </l>
<l>Her hand theron, and speaking woordes of ease the midwife playd.</l>
<l>The tree did cranye, and the barke deviding made away,</l>
<l>And yeelded out the chyld alyve, which cryde and wayld streyght way.</l>
<l>The waternymphes uppon the soft sweete hearbes the chyld did lay,</l>
<l>And bathde him with his mothers teares. His face was such as spyght </l>
<l>Must needes have praysd. For such he was in all condicions right,</l>
<l>As are the naked Cupids that in tables picturde bee.</l>
<l>But to th'entent he may with them in every poynt agree,</l>
<l>Let eyther him bee furnisshed with wings and quiver light,</l>

<l>For as the armed Cupid kist Dame Venus, unbeware</l>

<l>The Goddesse being wounded, thrust away her sonne. The wound</l>
<l>Appeered not to bee so deepe as afterward was found.</l>

<l>And in the shadowe woont shee was to rest continually,</l>

</div2>

<div2 type="card" n="560">

<l>Perchaunce thou hast or this tyme heard of one that overcame</l>
<l>The swiftest men in footemanshippe. No fable was that fame.</l>
<l>She overcame them out of dowt. And hard it is to tell     </l>
<l>Thee whither she did in footemanshippe or beawty more excell.</l>
<l>Uppon a season as she askt of Phebus, what he was</l>
<l>That should her husband bee, he sayd: For husband doo not passe,</l>
<l>O Atalanta, thou at all of husband hast no neede.</l>
<l>Shonne husbanding. But yit thou canst not shonne it, I thee reede.  </l>
<l>Alyve thou shalt not be thy self. Shee being sore afrayd</l>
<l>Of this Apollos Oracle, did keepe herself a mayd,</l>
<l>And lived in the shady woodes. When wooers to her came,</l>
<l>And were of her importunate, shee drave away the same</l>
<l>With boystous woordes, and with the sore condition of the game.   </l>
<l>I am not to be had (quoth shee) onlesse yee able bee</l>
<l>In ronning for to vanquish mee. Yee must contend with mee</l>
<l>In footemanshippe. And who so winnes the wager, I agree</l>
<l>To bee his wife. But if that he bee found too slowe, then hee</l>
<l>Shall lose his head. This of your game the verrye law shall bee.  </l>
<l>Shee was in deede unmercifull. But such is beawties powre,</l>
<l>That though the sayd condition were extreme and over sowre,</l>
<l>Yit many suters were so rash to undertake the same.</l>
<l>Hippomenes as a looker on of this uncurteous game,</l>
<l>Sate by, and sayd: Is any man so mad to seeke a wyfe        </l>
<l>With such apparant perill and the hazard of his lyfe?</l>
<l>And utterly he did condemne the yongmens love. But when</l>
<l>He saw her face and bodye bare, (for why the Lady then</l>
<l>Did strippe her to her naked skin) the which was like to myne,</l>
<l>Or rather (if that thou wert made a woman) like to thyne:   </l>
<l>He was amazde. And holding up his hands to heaven, he sayth:</l>
<l>Forgive mee you with whom I found such fault even now: in fayth</l>
<l>I did not know the wager that yee ran for. As hee prayseth</l>
<l>The beawty of her, in himselfe the fyre of love he rayseth.</l>
<l>And through an envy fearing lest shee should away be woonne,  </l>
<l>He wisht that nere a one of them so swift as shee might roonne.</l>
<l>And wherfore (quoth hee) put not I myself in preace to trye</l>
<l>The fortune of this wager? God himself continually</l>
<l>Dooth help the bold and hardye sort. Now whyle Hippomenes</l>
<l>Debates theis things within himselfe and other like to these,  </l>
<l>The Damzell ronnes as if her feete were wings. And though that shee</l>
<l>Did fly as swift as arrow from a Turkye bowe: yit hee</l>
<l>More woondred at her beawtye than at swiftnesse of her pace.</l>
<l>Her ronning greatly did augment her beawtye and her grace.</l>
<l>The wynd ay whisking from her feete the labells of her socks  </l>
<l>Uppon her back as whyght as snowe did tosse her golden locks,</l>
<l>And eeke th'embroydred garters that were tyde beneathe her ham.</l>
<l>A rednesse mixt with whyght uppon her tender bodye cam,</l>
<l>As when a scarlet curtaine streynd ageinst a playstred wall</l>
<l>Dooth cast like shadowe, making it seeme ruddye therwithall.  </l>
<l>Now whyle he straunger noted this, the race was fully ronne,</l>
<l>And Atalant (as shee that had the wager cleerely wonne)</l>
<l>Was crowned with a garlond brave. The vanquisht sighing sore,</l>
<l>Did lose theyr lyves according to agreement made before.</l>
<l>Howbeeit nought at all dismayd with theis mennes lucklesse cace   </l>
<l>He stepped foorth, and looking full uppon the maydens face,</l>
<l>Sayd: Wherfore doost thou seeke renowne in vanquisshing of such</l>
<l>As were but dastards? Cope with mee. If fortune bee so much</l>
<l>My freend to give mee victorie, thou needest not hold scorne</l>
<l>To yeeld to such a noble man as I am. I am borne           </l>
<l>The sonne of noble Megaree, Onchestyes sonne, and hee</l>
<l>Was sonne to Neptune. Thus am I great graundchyld by degree</l>
<l>In ryght descent, of him that rules the waters. Neyther doo</l>
<l>I out of kynd degenerate from vertue meete therto,</l>
<l>Or if my fortune bee so hard as vanquisht for to bee,      </l>
<l>Thou shalt obteine a famous name by overcomming mee.</l>
<l>In saying thus, <placeName key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> cast a gentle looke on him:</l>
<l>And dowting whither shee rather had to lose the day or win,</l>
<l>Sayd thus: What God, an enmy to the beawtyfull, is bent</l>
<l>To bring this person to his end, and therefore hath him sent   </l>
<l>To seeke a wyfe with hazard of his lyfe? If I should bee</l>
<l>Myselfe the judge in this behalfe, there is not sure in mee</l>
<l>That dooth deserve so deerely to bee earned. Neyther dooth</l>
<l>His beawty moove my hart at all. Yit is it such in sooth</l>
<l>As well might moove mee. But bycause as yit a chyld he is,  </l>
<l>His person mooves mee not so much as dooth his age Iwis.</l>
<l>Beesydes that manhod is in him, and mynd unfrayd of death:</l>
<l>Beesydes that of the watrye race from <placeName key="tgn,2065560">Neptune</placeName> as he seth</l>
<l>He is the fowrth: beesydes that he dooth love mee, and dooth make</l>
<l>So great accompt to win mee to his wyfe, that for my sake  </l>
<l>He is contented for to dye, if fortune bee so sore</l>
<l>Ageinst him to denye him mee. Thou straunger hence therfore.</l>
<l>Away, I say, now whyle thou mayst, and shonne my bloody bed.</l>
<l>My mariage cruell is, and craves the losing of thy hed.</l>
<l>There is no wench but that would such a husband gladly catch.    </l>
<l>And shee that wyse were myght desyre to meete with such a match.</l>
<l>But why now after heading of so many, doo I care</l>
<l>For thee? Looke thou to that. For sith so many men as are</l>
<l>Alreadye put to slawghter can not warne thee to beeware,</l>
<l>But that thou wilt bee weerye of thy lyfe, dye: doo not spare.  </l>
<l>And shall he perrish then bycause he sought to live with mee?</l>
<l>And for his love unwoorthely wvith death rewarded bee?</l>
<l>All men of such a victory will speake too foule a shame.</l>
<l>But all the world can testifye that I am not to blame.</l>
<l>Would God thou wouldst desist. Or else bycause thou are so mad,   </l>
<l>I would to God a little more thy feete of swiftnesse had.</l>
<l>Ah what a maydens countenance is in this chyldish face.</l>
<l>Ah, foolish boy Hippomenes, how wretched is thy cace.</l>
<l>I would thou never hadst mee seene. Thou woorthy art of lyfe.</l>
<l>And if so bee I happy were, and that to bee a wyfe              </l>
<l>The cruell destnyes had not mee forbidden, sure thou art</l>
<l>The onely wyght with whom I would bee matcht with all my hart.</l>
<l>This spoken: shee yit rawe and but new striken with the dart</l>
<l>Of Cupid, beeing ignorant, did love and knew it nat.</l>
<l>Anon her father and the folk assembled, willed that             </l>
<l>They should begin theyr woonted race. Then Neptunes issue prayd</l>
<l>With carefull hart and voyce to mee, and thus devoutly sayd:</l>
<l>O Venus, favour myne attempt, and send mee downe thyne ayd</l>
<l>To compasse my desyred love which thou hast on mee layd.</l>
<l>His prayer movd mee (I confesse,) and long I not delayd         </l>
<l>Before I helpt him. Now there is a certaine feeld the which</l>
<l>The Cyprian folk call Damasene, most fertile and most rich</l>
<l>Of all the Cyprian feelds: the same was consecrate to mee</l>
<l>In auncient tyme, and of my Church the glebland woont to bee.</l>
<l>Amid this feeld, with golden leaves there growes a goodly tree  </l>
<l>The crackling boughes whereof are all of yellew gold. I came</l>
<l>And gathered golden Apples three: and bearing thence the same</l>

<l>Of whom one shooke her head at him, and thus began to carp:</l>
<l>Behold (sayes shee) behold yoon same is he that doth disdeine</l>

<l>' Another threw a stone at him, which vanquisht with his sweete</l>
<l>And most melodius harmonye, fell humbly at his feete</l>
<l>As sorye for the furious act it purposed. But rash</l>

<l>And frantik outrage reigned. Yit had the sweetenesse of his song  </l>

<l>With blowing shalmes, and beating drummes, and bedlem howling out,</l>
<l>And clapping hands on every syde by Bacchus drunken rout,</l>
<l>Did drowne the sownd of Orphyes harp. Then first of all stones were</l>
<l>Made ruddy with the prophets blood, and could not give him eare.  </l>
<l>And first the flocke of Bacchus froes by violence brake the ring</l>
<l>Of Serpents, birds, and savage beastes that for to heere him sing</l>

<l>They ran uppon the prophet who among them singing stands.</l>
<l>They flockt about him like as when a sort of birds have found  </l>
<l>An Owle a daytymes in a tod: and hem him in full round,</l>
<l>As when a Stag by hungrye hownds is in a morning found,</l>

<l>And labring men with brawned armes not farre fro thence were found</l>
<l>A digging of the hardned earth, and earning of theyr food,   </l>

<l>And through that mouth of his (oh lord) which even the stones had heard,</l>

<l>The rugged stones did moorne for him, the woods which many a tyme</l>
<l>Had followed him to heere him sing, bewayled this same cryme.</l>
<l>Yea even the trees lamenting him did cast theyr leavy heare.</l>
<l>The rivers also with theyr teares (men say) encreased were.  </l>
<l>Yea and the Nymphes of brookes and woods uppon theyr streames did sayle</l>

<l>The murther of the Chapleine of his Orgies, suffred not</l>

<l>The Thracian women by the feete with writhen roote in ground,</l>
<l>As many as consenting to this wicked act were found.</l>
<l>And looke how much that eche of them the prophet did pursew,</l>
<l>So much he sharpening of their toes, within the ground them drew.</l>
<l>And as the bird that fynds her legs besnarled in the net</l>

<l>And feeles shee cannot get away, stands flickering with her wings,</l>
<l>And with her fearefull leaping up drawes clocer still the strings:</l>
<l>So eche of theis when in the ground they fastned were, assayd</l>
<l>Aflayghted for to fly away. But every one was stayd</l>
<l>With winding roote which hilld her downe. Her frisking could not boote.</l>
<l>And whyle she lookte what was become of Toe, of nayle, and foote,</l>
<l>Shee sawe her leggs growe round in one, and turning into woode.</l>

<l>He tooke a flintstone from the ground, the stone likewyse became</l>
<l>Pure gold. He towched next a clod of earth, and streight the same</l>
<l>By force of towching did become a wedge of yellow gold.</l>
<l>He gathered eares of rypened come: immediatly beholde     </l>

<l>No meate his hunger slakes: his throte is shrunken up with thurst:</l>

<l>Behynd him in a shady vale not farre from Trachin towne,    </l>
<l>And with a little companye himself went thither downe.</l>
<l>Assoone as leave to come to Court was graunted him, he bare</l>
<l>A braunche of Olyf in his hand, and humbly did declare</l>
<l>His name and lynage. Onely of his crime no woord hee spake,</l>
<l>But of his flyght another cause pretensedly did make:     </l>
<l>Desyring leave within his towne or countrye to abyde.</l>
<l>The king of Trachin gently thus to him ageine replyde:</l>
<l>Our bownty to the meanest sort (O Peleus) dooth extend:</l>
<l>Wee are not woont the desolate our countrye to forfend.</l>
<l>And though I bee of nature most inclyned good to doo: </l>
<l>Thyne owne renowme, thy graundsyre Jove are forcements thereunto.</l>
<l>Misspend no longer tyme in sute. I gladly doo agree</l>
<l>To graunt thee what thou wilt desyre. Theis things that thou doost see</l>
<l>I would thou should account them as thyne owne, such as they bee</l>
<l>I would they better were. With that he weeped. Peleus and  </l>
<l>His freends desyred of his greef the cause to understand.</l>
<l>He answerd thus: Perchaunce yee think this bird that lives by pray</l>
<l>And putts all other birds in feare had wings and fethers ay.</l>
<l>He was a man. And as he was right feerce in feats of armes,</l>
<l>And stout and readye bothe to wreake and also offer harmes:  </l>
<l>So was he of a constant mynd. Daedalion men him hyght.</l>
<l>Our father was that noble starre that brings the morning bryght,</l>
<l>And in the welkin last of all gives place to <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> lyght.</l>
<l>My study was to maynteine peace, in peace was my delyght,</l>
<l>And for to keepe mee true to her to whom my fayth is plyght.  </l>
<l>My brother had felicite in warre and bloody fyght.</l>
<l>His prowesse and his force which now dooth chase in cruell flyght</l>
<l>The Dooves of Thisbye since his shape was altred thus anew,</l>
<l>Ryght puyssant Princes and theyr Realmes did heeretofore subdew.</l>
<l>He had a chyld calld Chyone, whom nature did endew        </l>
<l>With beawtye so, that when to age of fowreteene yeeres shee grew,</l>
<l>A thousand Princes liking her did for hir favour sew.</l>
<l>By fortune as bryght <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> and the sonne of Lady May</l>
<l>Came t'one from <placeName key="tgn,2079257">Delphos</placeName>, toother from mount Cyllen, by the way</l>
<l>They saw her bothe at once, and bothe at once were tane in love.   </l>
<l>Apollo till the tyme of nyght differd his sute to move.</l>
<l>But Hermes could not beare delay. He stroked on the face</l>
<l>The mayden with his charmed rod which hath the powre to chace</l>
<l>And bring in sleepe: the touch whereof did cast her in so dead</l>
<l>A sleepe, that Hermes by and by his purpose of her sped.   </l>
<l>As soone as nyght with twinckling starres the welkin had beesprent,</l>
<l>Apollo in an old wyves shape to Chyon clocely went,</l>
<l>And tooke the pleasure which the sonne of Maya had forehent.</l>
<l>Now when shee full her tyme had gone, shee bare by Mercurye</l>
<l>A sonne that hyght Awtolychus, who provde a wyly pye,       </l>
<l>And such a fellow as in theft and filching had no peere.</l>
<l>He was his fathers owne sonne right: he could mennes eyes so bleere,</l>
<l>As for to make the black things whyghlt, and whyght things black appeere.</l>
<l>And by Apollo (for shee bare a payre) was borne his brother</l>
<l>Philammon, who in musick arte excelled farre all other,    </l>
<l>As well in singing as in play. But what avayled it</l>
<l>To beare such twinnes, and of two Goddes in favour to have sit?</l>
<l>And that shee to her father had a stowt and valeant knight,</l>
<l>Or that her graundsyre was the sonne of Jove that God of might?</l>
<l>Dooth glorie hurt to any folk? It surely hurted her.        </l>
<l>For standing in her owne conceyt shee did herself prefer</l>
<l>Before <placeName key="tgn,2098819">Diana</placeName>, and dispraysd her face, who there with all</l>
<l>Inflaamd with wrath, sayd: Well, with deedes we better please her shall.</l>
<l>Immediatly shee bent her bowe, and let an arrow go,</l>
<l>Which strake her through the toong, whose spight deserved</l>
<l>wounding so. </l>
<l>Her toong wext dumb, her speech gan fayle that erst was over ryfe,</l>
<l>And as shee stryved for to speake, away went blood and lyfe.</l>
<l>How wretched was I then, O God? how strake it to my hart?</l>
<l>What woordes of comfort did I speake to ease my brothers smart?</l>
<l>To which he gave his eare as much as dooth the stony rocke  </l>
<l>To hideous roring of the waves that doo against it knocke.</l>
<l>There was no measure nor none ende in making of his mone,</l>
<l>Nor in bewayling comfortlesse his daughter that was gone.</l>
<l>But when he sawe her bodye burne, fowre tymes with all his myght</l>
<l>He russhed foorth to thrust himself amid the fyre in spyght.  </l>
<l>Fowre tymes hee beeing thence repulst, did put himself to flyght.</l>
<l>And ran mee wheras was no way, as dooth a Bullocke when</l>
<l>A hornet stings him in the necke. Mee thought hee was as then</l>
<l>More wyghter farre than any man. Yee would have thought his feete</l>
<l>Had had sum wings. So fled he quyght from all, and being fleete    </l>
<l>Through eagernesse to dye, he gat to mount Parnasos knappe</l>
<l>And there Apollo pitying him and rewing his missehappe,</l>
<l>When as Daedalion from the cliffe himself had headlong floong,</l>
<l>Transformd him to a bird, and on the soodaine as hee hung</l>
<l>Did give him wings, and bowwing beake, and hooked talants keene, </l>
<l>And eeke a courage full as feerce as ever it had beene.</l>
<l>And furthermore a greater strength he lent him therwithall,</l>
<l>Than one would thinke conveyd myght bee within a roome so small.</l>
<l>And now in shape of Gossehawke hee to none indifferent is,</l>
<l>But wreakes his teene on all birds. And bycause him selfe ere this   </l>
<l>Did feele the force of sorrowes sting within his wounded hart,</l>
<l>Hee maketh others oftentymes to sorrow and to smart.

<l>But made of wood, and hid with trees that dreeping hang theron.   </l>
<l>A visherman that zat and dryde hiz netts uppo the zhore</l>
<l>Did tell'z that Nereus and his Nymphes did haunt the place of yore,</l>
<l>And how that thay beene Goddes a zea. There butts a plot vorgrowne</l>
<l>With zallow trees uppon the zame, the which is overblowne</l>
<l>With tydes, and is a marsh. From thence a woolf, an orped wyght,   </l>
<l>With hideous noyse of rustling made the groundes neere hand afryght.</l>
<l>Anon he commes mee buskling out bezmeared all his chappes</l>

<l>Hiz eyen did glaster red as vyre, and though he raged zore</l>

<l>But wounded all the herd and made a havocke of them all,</l>
<l>And zum of us too, in devence did happen vor to vail,</l>

<l>To keepe an Obit to her sonne whom hee before had killd.</l>
<l>Immediatly uppon this newes the king of Trachin willd</l>

<l>Cast downe her heare, and ronning foorth caught Ceyx fast about</l>
<l>The necke, desyring him with teares to send his folk without  </l>
<l>Himself, and in the lyfe of him to save the lyves of twayne.</l>
<l>O Princesse, cease your godly feare (quoth Peleus then agayne).</l>
<l>Your offer dooth deserve great thanks. I mynd not warre to make</l>

<l>And help him. She no whit relents to that that he did pray.</l>
<l>But Thetis for hir husband made such earnest sute, that shee</l>

<l>In this meane tyme the Trachine king sore vexed in his thought</l>

<l>Fond fancyes, and not counsellers in perill to doo goode)</l>

<l>Alcyone preevye to the thing. Immediatly theyr strake</l>
<l>A chilnesse to her verry bones, and pale was all her face </l>
<l>Like box and downe her heavy cheekes the teares did gush apace.</l>
<l>Three times about to speake, three times shee washt her face with teares,</l>
<l>And stinting oft with sobbes, shee thus complayned in his eares:</l>
<l>What fault of myne,  husband deere, hath turnd thy hart fro mee?</l>
<l>Where is that care of mee that erst was woont to bee in thee?    </l>

<l>Bee voyd of feare? No no. The sea mee sore afrayd dooth make.</l>
<l>To think uppon the sea dooth cause my flesh for feare to quake.</l>

<l>And oft on <placeName key="tgn,7005838">Tumbes</placeName> I reade theyr names whose bodyes long before</l>
<l>The sea had swallowed. Let not fond vayne hope seduce thy mynd,  </l>

<l>The more that I doo know them, (for ryght well I know theyr powre,</l>

<l>But that thou needes wilt go: then mee, deere husband, with thee take.</l>

<l>So shall we whatsoever happes togitherjoyntly beare.</l>
<l>So shall wee on the broad mayne sea togither joyntly sayle.  </l>
<l>Theis woordes and teares wherewith the imp of Aeolus did assayle</l>
<l>Her husbond borne of heavenly race, did make his hart relent.</l>
<l>(For he lovd her no lesse than shee lovd him.) But fully bent</l>

<l>He many woordes of comfort spake her feare away to chace.</l>
<l>But nought hee could perswade therein to make her like the cace.</l>
<l>This last asswagement of her greef he added in the end,</l>
<l>Which was the onely thing that made her loving hart to bend: </l>
<l>All taryance will assuredly seeme over long to mee.</l>
<l>And by my fathers blasing beames I make my vow to thee</l>
<l>That at the furthest ere the tyme (if God therto agree)</l>

<l>And streyning Ceyx in her armes with pale and piteous looke,</l>

<l>And swounded flat uppon the ground. Anon the watermen</l>
<l>(As Ceyx sought delayes and was in dowt to turne agen)</l>
<l>Set hand to Ores, of which there were two rowes on eyther syde,    </l>
<l>And all at once with equall stroke the swelling sea devyde.</l>
<l>Shee lifting up her watrye eyes behilld her husband stand</l>
<l>Uppon the hatches making signes by beckening with his hand:</l>
<l>And shee made signes to him ageine. And after that the land</l>
<l>Was farre removed from the shippe, and that the sight began  </l>

<l>Shee looked still uppon the sayles that flasked with the wynd</l>
<l>Uppon the maast. And when shee could the sayles no longer fynd,  </l>
<l>She gate her to her empty bed with sad and sorye hart,</l>
<l>And layd her downe. The chamber did renew afresh her smart,</l>
<l>And of her bed did bring to mynd the deere departed part.</l>
<l>From harbrough now they quyght were gone: and now a plasant gale</l>

<l>Rend downe the mountaynes, Athe and Pind, and whole them overthrowe</l>
<l>Into the open sea: so soft the Billowe tumbling downe,</l>
<l>With weyght and violent stroke did sink and in the bottom drowne </l>
<l>The Gallye. And the moste of them that were within the same</l>
<l>Went downe therwith and never up to open aier came,</l>
<l>But dyed strangled in the gulf. Another sort againe</l>
<l>Caught peeces of the broken shippe. The king himself was fayne</l>
<l>A shiver of the sunken shippe in that same hand to hold,    </l>
<l>In which hee erst a royall mace had hilld of yellow gold.</l>
<l>His father and his fathrinlawe he calles uppon (alas</l>
<l>In vayne.) But cheefly in his mouth his wife Alcyone was.</l>
<l>In hart was shee: in toong was shee: he wisshed that his corse</l>
<l>To land where shee myght take it up the surges myght enforce:    </l>
<l>And that by her most loving handes he might be layd in grave.</l>
<l>In swimming still (as often as the surges leave him gave</l>
<l>To ope his lippes) he harped still upon Alcyones name,</l>
<l>And when he drowned in the waves he muttred still the same.</l>
<l>Behold, even full uppon the wave a flake of water blacke    </l>
<l>Did breake, and underneathe the sea the head of Ceyx stracke.</l>
<l>That nyght the lyghtsum Lucifer for sorrowe was so dim,</l>
<l>As scarcely could a man discerne or thinke it to bee him.</l>
<l>And forasmuch as out of heaven he might not steppe asyde,</l>
<l>With thick and darksum clowds that nyght his countnance he did hyde. </l>
<l>Alcyone of so great mischaunce not knowing aught as yit,</l>
<l>Did keepe a reckening of the nyghts that in the whyle did flit,</l>
<l>And hasted garments both for him and for herself likewyse,</l>
<l>To weare at his homecomming which shee vaynely did surmyse.</l>
<l>To all the Goddes devoutly shee did offer frankincence:     </l>
<l>But most above them all the Church of <placeName key="tgn,2075297">Juno</placeName> shee did sence.</l>
<l>And for her husband (who as then was none) shee kneeld before</l>
<l>The Altar, wisshing health and soone arrivall at the shore,</l>
<l>And that none other woman myght before her be preferd.</l>
<l>Of all her prayers this one peece effectually was heard.    </l>
<l>For <placeName key="tgn,2075297">Juno</placeName> could not fynd in hart intreated for to bee</l>
<l>For him that was already dead. But to th'entent that shee</l>
<l>From dame Alcyones deadly hands might keepe her Altars free,</l>
<l>Shee sayd: Most faythfull messenger of my commaundments, O</l>
<l>Thou Raynebowe, to the slugguish house of Slomber swiftly go.    </l>
<l>And bid him send a Dreame in shape of Ceyx to his wyfe</l>
<l>Alcyone, for to shew her playne the losing of his lyfe.</l>
<l>Dame Iris takes her pall wherein a thousand colours were</l>
<l>And bowwing lyke a stringed bow upon the dowdy sphere,</l>
<l>Immediatly descended to the drowzye house of Sleepe         </l>
<l>Whose Court the clowdes continually doo clocely overdreepe.

<l>Among the darke Cimmerians is a hollow mountaine found</l>
<l>And in the hill a Cave that farre dooth ronne within the ground,</l>
<l>The Chamber and the dwelling place where slouthfull sleepe dooth cowch.</l>
<l>The lyght of <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> golden beames this place can never towch.    </l>
<l>A foggye mist with dimnesse mixt streames upwarde from the ground,</l>
<l>And glimmering twylyght evermore within the same is found.</l>
<l>No watchfull bird with barbed bill, and combed crowne dooth call</l>
<l>The morning foorth with crowing out. There is no noyse at all</l>
<l>Of waking dogge, nor gagling goose more waker than the hound   </l>
<l>To hinder sleepe. Of beast ne wyld ne tame there is no sound.</l>
<l>No bowghes are stird with blastes of wynd, no noyse of tatling toong</l>
<l>Of man or woman ever yit within that bower roong.</l>
<l>Dumb quiet dwelleth there. Yit from the Roches foote dooth go</l>
<l>The ryver of forgetfulnesse, which ronneth trickling so     </l>
<l>Uppon the little pebble stones which in the channell lye,</l>
<l>That unto sleepe a great deale more it dooth provoke thereby.</l>
<l>Before the entry of the Cave, there growes of Poppye store,</l>
<l>With seeded heades, and other weedes innumerable more,</l>
<l>Out of the milkye jewce of which the night dooth gather sleepes,</l>
<l>And over all the shadowed earth with dankish deawe them dreepes.</l>
<l>Bycause the craking hindges of the doore no noyse should make,</l>
<l>There is no doore in all the house, nor porter at the gate.</l>
<l>Amid the Cave, of Ebonye a bedsted standeth hye,</l>
<l>And on the same a bed of downe with keeverings blacke dooth lye:  </l>
<l>In which the drowzye God of sleepe his lither limbes dooth rest.</l>
<l>About him, forging sundrye shapes as many dreames lye prest</l>
<l>As eares of come doo stand in feeldes in harvest tyme, or leaves</l>
<l>Doo grow on trees, or sea to shore of sandye cinder heaves.</l>
<l>As soone as Iris came within this house, and with her hand  </l>
<l>Had put asyde the dazeling dreames that in her way did stand,</l>
<l>The brightnesse of her robe through all the sacred house did shine.</l>
<l>The God of sleepe scarce able for to rayse his heavy eyen,</l>
<l>A three or fowre tymes at the least did fall ageine to rest,</l>
<l>And with his nodding head did knocke his chinne ageinst his brest. </l>
<l>At length he shaking of himselfe, uppon his elbowe leande.</l>
<l>And though he knew for what shee came: he askt her what shee meand.</l>
<l>O sleepe (quoth shee,) the rest of things, O gentlest of the Goddes,</l>
<l>Sweete sleepe, the peace of mynd, with whom crookt care is aye at oddes:</l>
<l>Which cherrishest mennes weery limbes appalld with toling sore,  </l>
<l>And makest them as fresh to woork and lustye as beefore,</l>
<l>Commaund a dreame that in theyr kyndes can every thing expresse,</l>
<l>To Trachine, Hercles towne, himself this instant to addresse.</l>
<l>And let him lively counterfet to Queene Alcyonea</l>
<l>The image of her husband who is drowned in the sea          </l>
<l>By shipwrecke. <placeName key="tgn,2023293">Juno</placeName> willeth so. Her message beeing told,</l>
<l>Dame Iris went her way. Shee could her eyes no longer hold</l>
<l>From sleepe. But when shee felt it come shee fled that instant tyme,</l>
<l>And by the boawe that brought her downe to heaven ageine did clyme.</l>
<l>Among a thousand sonnes and mo that father slomber had </l>
<l>He calld up Morph, the feyner of mannes shape, a craftye lad.</l>
<l>None other could so conningly expresse mans verrye face,</l>
<l>His gesture and his sound of voyce, and manner of his pace,</l>
<l>Togither with his woonted weede, and woonted phrase of talk.</l>
<l>But this same Morphye onely in the shape of man dooth walk. </l>
<l>There is another who the shapes of beast or bird dooth take,</l>
<l>Or else appeereth unto men in likenesse of a snake.</l>
<l>The Goddes doo call him Icilos, and mortall folke him name</l>
<l>Phobetor. There is also yit a third who from theis same</l>
<l>Woorkes diversly, and Phantasos he highteth. Into streames  </l>
<l>This turnes himself, and into stones, and earth, and timber beames,</l>
<l>And into every other thing that wanteth life. Theis three,</l>
<l>Great kings and Capteines in the night are woonted for to see.</l>
<l>The meaner and inferiour sort of others haunted bee.</l>
<l>Sir Slomber overpast the rest, and of the brothers all      </l>
<l>To doo dame Iris message he did only Morphye call.</l>
<l>Which doone he waxing luskish, streyght layd downe his drowzy head</l>
<l>And softly shroonk his layzye limbes within his sluggish bed.</l>
<l>Away flew Morphye through the aire: no flickring made his wings:</l>
<l>And came anon to Trachine. There his fethers off he flings,   </l>
<l>And in the shape of Ceyx standes before Alcyones bed,</l>
<l>Pale, wan, stark naakt, and like a man that was but lately deade.</l>
<l>His berde seemd wet, and of his head the heare was dropping drye,</l>
<l>And leaning on her bed, with teares he seemed thus to cry:</l>
<l>Most wretched woman, knowest thou thy loving Ceyx now       </l>
<l>Or is my face by death disformd? behold mee well, and thow</l>
<l>Shalt know mee. For thy husband, thou thy husbandes Ghost shalt see.</l>
<l>No good thy prayers and thy vowes have done at all to mee.</l>
<l>For I am dead. In vayne of my returne no reckning make.</l>
<l>The dowdy sowth amid the sea our shippe did tardy take,    </l>
<l>And tossing it with violent blastes asunder did it shake.</l>
<l>And floodes have filld my mouth which calld in vayne uppon thy name.</l>
<l>No persone whom thou mayst misdeeme brings tydings of the same.</l>
<l>Thou hearest not thereof by false report of flying fame.</l>
<l>But I myself: I presently my shipwrecke to thee showe.     </l>
<l>Aryse therefore and wofull teares uppon thy spouse bestowe.</l>
<l>Put moorning rayment on, and let mee not to Limbo go</l>
<l>Unmoorned for. In shewing of this shipwrecke Morphye so</l>
<l>Did feyne the voyce of Ceyx, that shee could none other deeme,</l>
<l>But that it should bee his in deede. Moreover he did seeme  </l>
<l>To weepe in earnest: and his handes the verry gesture had</l>
<l>Of Ceyx. Queene Alcyone did grone, and beeing sad</l>
<l>Did stirre her armes, and thrust them foorth his body to embrace.</l>
<l>In stead whereof shee caught but ayre. The teares ran downe her face.</l>
<l>Shee cryed, Tarry: whither flyste? togither let us go.    </l>
<l>And all this whyle she was asleepe. Both with her crying so,</l>
<l>And flayghted with the image of her husbands gastly spryght,</l>
<l>She started up: and sought about if fynd him there shee myght.</l>
<l>(For why her Groomes awaking with the shreeke had brought a light.)</l>
<l>And when shee no where could him fynd, shee gan her face to smyght, </l>
<l>And tare her nyghtclothes from her brest, and strake it feercely, and</l>
<l>Not passing to unty her heare shee rent it with her hand.</l>
<l>And when her nurce of this her greef desyrde to understand</l>
<l>The cause: Alcyone is undoone, undoone and cast away</l>
<l>With Ceyx her deare spouse (shee sayd). Leave comforting I pray. </l>
<l>By shipwrecke he is perrisht: I have seene him: and I knew</l>
<l>His handes. When in departing I to hold him did pursew</l>
<l>I caught a Ghost: but such a Ghost as well discerne I myght</l>
<l>To bee my husbands. Nathelesse he had not to my syght</l>
<l>His woonted countenance, neyther did his visage shyne so bryght, </l>
<l>As heeretofore it had beene woont. I saw him, wretched wyght,</l>
<l>Starke naked, pale, and with his heare still wet: even verry heere</l>
<l>I saw him stand. With that shee lookes if any print appeere</l>
<l>Of footing where as he did stand uppon the floore behynd.</l>
<l>This this is it that I did feare in farre forecasting mynd,     </l>
<l>When flying mee I thee desyrde thou shouldst not trust the wynd.</l>
<l>But syth thou wentest to thy death, I would that I had gone</l>
<l>With thee. Ah meete, it meete had beene thou shouldst not go alone</l>
<l>Without mee. So it should have come to passe that neyther I</l>
<l>Had overlived thee, nor yit beene forced twice to dye.          </l>
<l>Already, absent in the waves now tossed have I bee.</l>
<l>Already have I perrished. And yit the sea hath thee</l>
<l>Without mee. But the cruelnesse were greater farre of mee</l>
<l>Than of the sea, if after thy decease I still would strive</l>
<l>In sorrow and in anguish still to pyne away alive.              </l>
<l>But neyther will I strive in care to lengthen still my lyfe,</l>
<l>Nor (wretched wyght) abandon thee: but like a faythfull wyfe</l>
<l>At leastwyse now will come as thy companion. And the herse</l>
<l>Shall joyne us, though not in the selfsame coffin: yit in verse.</l>
<l>Although in tumb the bones of us togither may not couch,        </l>
<l>Yit in a graven Epitaph my name thy name shall touch.</l>
<l>Her sorrow would not suffer her to utter any more.</l>
<l>Shee sobd and syghde at every woord, untill her hart was sore.</l>
<l>The morning came, and out shee went ryght pensif to the shore</l>
<l>To that same place in which shee tooke her leave of him before.</l>
<l>Whyle there shee musing stood, and sayd: He kissed mee even heere,</l>
<l>Heere weyed hee his Anchors up, heere loosd he from the peere.</l>
<l>And whyle shee calld to mynd the things there marked with her eyes:</l>
<l>In looking on the open sea, a great way off shee spyes</l>
<l>A certaine thing much like a corse come hovering on the wave.   </l>
<l>At first shee dowted what it was. As tyde it neerer drave,</l>
<l>Although it were a good way off, yit did it plainely showe</l>
<l>To bee a corce. And though that whose it was shee did not knowe,</l>
<l>Yit forbycause it seemd a wrecke, her hart therat did ryse:</l>
<l>And as it had sum straunger beene, with water in her eyes       </l>
<l>She sayd: Alas poore wretch who ere thou art, alas for her</l>
<l>That is thy wyfe, if any bee. And as the waves did stirre,</l>
<l>The body floted neerer land: the which the more that shee</l>
<l>Behilld, the lesse began in her of stayed wit to bee.</l>
<l>Anon it did arrive on shore. Then plainely shee did see</l>
<l>And know it, that it was her feere. Shee shreeked, It is hee.</l>
<l>And therewithall her face, her heare, and garments shee did teare,</l>
<l>And unto Ceyx stretching out her trembling handes with feare,</l>
<l>Sayd: cumst thou home in such a plyght to mee, O husband deere?</l>
<l>Returnst in such a wretched plyght? There was a certeine peere    </l>
<l>That buylded was by hand, of waves the first assaults to breake,</l>
<l>And at the havons mouth to cause the tyde to enter weake.</l>
<l>Shee lept thereon. (A wonder sure it was shee could doo so)</l>
<l>Shee flew, and with her newgrowen winges did beate the ayre as tho.</l>
<l>And on the waves a wretched bird shee whisked to and fro.    </l>
<l>And with her crocking neb then growen to slender bill and round,</l>
<l>Like one that wayld and moorned still shee made a moaning sound.</l>
<l>Howbee't as soone as she did touch his dumb and bloodlesse flesh,</l>
<l>And had embraast his loved limbes with winges made new and fresh,</l>
<l>And with her hardened neb had kist him coldly, though in vayne,  </l>
<l>Folk dowt if Ceyx feeling it to rayse his head did strayne,</l>
<l>Or whither that the waves did lift it up. But surely hee</l>
<l>It felt: and through compassion of the Goddes both hee and shee</l>
<l>Were turnd to birdes. The love of them eeke subject to their fate,</l>
<l>Continued after: neyther did the faythfull bond abate</l>
<l>Of wedlocke in them beeing birdes: but standes in stedfast state.</l>
<l>They treade, and lay, and bring foorth yoong and now the Alcyon sitts</l>
<l>In wintertime uppon her nest, which on the water flitts</l>
<l>A sevennyght. During all which tyme the sea is calme and still,</l>
<l>And every man may to and fro sayle saufly at his will,</l>
<l>For Aeolus for his offsprings sake the windes at home dooth keepe,</l>
<l>And will not let them go abroade for troubling of the deepe.

<l>And what is wrought in all the world he layes to understand.</l>
<l>He gave the Trojans warning that the Greekes with valeant men </l>
<l>And shippes approched, that unwares they could not take them then.</l>
<l>For <placeName key="tgn,2383808">Hector</placeName> and the Trojan folk well armed were at hand</l>
<l>To keepe the coast and bid them bace before they came aland.</l>
<l>Protesilay by fatall doome was first that dyde in feeld</l>
<l>Of Hectors speare: and after him great numbers mo were killd  </l>
<l>Of valeant men. That battell did the Greeks full deerly cost.</l>
<l>And <placeName key="tgn,2383808">Hector</placeName> with his Phrygian folk of blood no little lost,</l>
<l>In trying what the Greekes could doo. The shore was red with blood.</l>
<l>And now king <placeName key="tgn,2079170">Cygnet</placeName>, Neptunes sonne, had killed where he stood</l>
<l>A thousand Greekes. And now the stout Achilles causd to stay  </l>
<l>His Charyot: and his lawnce did slea whole bandes of men that day.</l>
<l>And seeking <placeName key="tgn,2079170">Cygnet</placeName> through the feeld or <placeName key="tgn,2383807">Hector</placeName>, he did stray.</l>
<l>At last with <placeName key="tgn,2079170">Cygnet</placeName> he did meete. For <placeName key="tgn,2383807">Hector</placeName> had delay</l>
<l>Untill the tenth yeare afterward. Then hasting foorth his horses</l>
<l>With flaxen manes, ageinst his fo his Chariot he enforces.  </l>
<l>And brandishing his shaking dart, he sayd: O noble wyght,</l>
<l>A comfort let it bee to thee that such a valeant knyght</l>
<l>As is Achilles killeth thee. In saying so he threw</l>
<l>A myghty dart, which though it hit the mark at which it flew,</l>
<l>Yit perst it not the skinne at all. Now when this blunted blowe  </l>
<l>Had hit on Cygnets brest, and did no print of hitting showe,</l>
<l>Thou, Goddesse sonne (quoth <placeName key="tgn,2079170">Cygnet</placeName>), for by fame we doo thee knowe.</l>
<l>Why woondrest at mee for to see I can not wounded bee?</l>
<l>(Achilles woondred much thereat.) This helmet which yee see</l>
<l>Bedect with horses yellow manes, this sheeld that I doo beare,  </l>
<l>Defend mee not. For ornaments alonly I them weare.</l>
<l>For this same cause armes <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName> himself likewyse. I will disarme</l>
<l>Myself, and yit unrazed will I passe without all harme.</l>
<l>It is to sum effect, not borne to bee of Neryes race,</l>
<l>So that a man be borne of him that with threeforked mace  :</l>
<l>Rules Nereus and his daughters too, and all the sea besyde.</l>
<l>This sayd, he at <placeName key="tgn,2110228">Achilles</placeName> sent a dart that should abyde</l>
<l>Uppon his sheeld. It perced through the steele and through nyne fold</l>
<l>Of Oxen hydes, and stayd uppon the tenth. Achilles bold</l>
<l>Did wrest it out, and forcybly did throwe the same agayne.</l>
<l>His bodye beeing hit ageine, unwounded did remayne,</l>
<l>And cleere from any print of wound. The third went eeke in vayne.</l>
<l>And yit did <placeName key="tgn,2079170">Cygnet</placeName> to the same give full his naked brist.</l>
<l>Achilles chafed like a Bull that in the open list</l>
<l>With dreadfull homes dooth push ageinst the scarlet clothes that there  </l>
<l>Are hanged up to make him feerce, and when he would them teare</l>
<l>Dooth fynd his wounds deluded. Then Achilles lookt uppon</l>
<l>His Javelings socket, if the head thereof were looce or gone.</l>
<l>The head stacke fast. My hand byleeke is weakened then (quoth lice),</l>
<l>And all the force it had before is spent on one I see.    </l>
<l>For sure I am it was of strength, both when I first downe threw</l>
<l>Lyrnessus walles, and when I did Ile Tenedos subdew,</l>
<l>And eeke Aetions Thebe with her proper blood embrew.</l>
<l>And when so many of the folke of Tewthranie I slew,</l>
<l>That with theyr blood Caycus streame became of purple hew.  </l>
<l>And when the noble Telephus did of my Dart of steele</l>
<l>The dowble force, of wounding and of healing also feele.</l>
<l>Yea even the heapes of men slayne heere by mee, that on this strond</l>
<l>Are lying still to looke uppon, doo give to understond</l>
<l>That this same hand of myne both had and still hath strength. This sed,  </l>
<l>(As though he had distrusted all his dooings ere that sted,)</l>
<l>He threw a Dart ageinst a man of <placeName key="tgn,7001294">Lycia</placeName> land that hyght</l>
<l>Menetes, through whose Curets and his brest he strake him quyght.</l>
<l>And when he saw with dying limbes him sprawling on the ground,</l>
<l>He stepped to him streyght, and pulld the Javeling from the wound, </l>
<l>And sayd alowd: This is the hand, this is the selfsame dart</l>
<l>With which my hand did strike even now Menetes to the hart.</l>
<l>Ageinst my tother Copemate will I use the same: I pray</l>
<l>To God it may have like successe. This sed, without delay</l>
<l>He sent it toward <placeName key="tgn,2079170">Cygnet</placeName>, and the weapon did not stray,          </l>
<l>Nor was not shunned. Insomuch it lighted full uppon</l>
<l>His shoulder: and it gave a rappe as if uppon sum ston</l>
<l>It lyghted had, rebownding backe. Howbeeit where it hit,</l>
<l>Achilles sawe it bloodye, and was vaynly glad of it.</l>
<l>For why there was no wound. It was Menetes blood. Then lept       </l>
<l>He hastly from his Charyot downe, and like a madman stept</l>
<l>To carelesse <placeName key="tgn,2079170">Cygnet</placeName> with his swoord. He sawe his swoord did pare</l>
<l>His Target and his morion bothe. But when it toucht the bare,</l>
<l>His bodye was so hard, it did the edge thereof abate.</l>
<l>He could no lengar suffer him to tryumph in that rate,            </l>
<l>But with the pommell of his swoord did thump him on the pate,</l>
<l>And bobd him well about the brewes a doozen tymes and more,</l>
<l>And preacing on him as he still gave backe amaazd him sore,</l>
<l>And troubled him with buffetting, not respetting a whit.</l>
<l>Then <placeName key="tgn,2079170">Cygnet</placeName> gan to bee afrayd, and mistes beegan to flit         </l>
<l>Before his eyes, and dimd his syght. And as he still did yeeld,</l>
<l>In giving back, by chaunce he met a stone amid the feeld,</l>
<l>Ageinst the which Achilles thrust him back with all his myght,</l>
<l>And throwing him ageinst the ground, did cast him bolt upryght.</l>
<l>Then bearing bostowsely with both his knees ageinst his chest,    </l>
<l>And leaning with his elbowes and his target on his brest,</l>
<l>He shet his headpeece cloce and just, and underneathe his chin</l>
<l>So hard it straynd, that way for breath was neyther out nor in,</l>
<l>And closed up the vent of lyfe. And having gotten so</l>
<l>The upper hand, he went about to spoyle his vanquisht fo.         </l>
<l>But nought he in his armour found. For <placeName key="tgn,2065560">Neptune</placeName> had as tho</l>

<l>And Greekes likewyse within theyr trench, there came a day of joy,</l>
<l>In which Achilles for his luck in Cygnets overthrow,</l>
<l>A Cow in way of sacrifyse on Pallas did bestowe,</l>
<l>Whose inwards when he had uppon the burning altar cast</l>
<l>And that the acceptable fume had through the ayer past    </l>
<l>To Godward, and the holy rytes had had theyr dewes, the rest</l>
<l>Was set on boords for men to eate in disshes fynely drest.</l>
<l>The princes sitting downe, did feede uppon the rosted flesh,</l>
<l>And both theyr thirst and present cares with wyne they did refresh.</l>
<l>Not Harpes, nor songs, nor hollowe flutes to heere did them delyght. </l>
<l>They talked till they nye had spent the greatest part of nyght.</l>
<l>And all theyr communication was of feates of armes in fyght</l>
<l>That had beene doone by them or by theyr foes. And every wyght</l>
<l>Delyghts to uppen oftentymes by turne as came about</l>
<l>The perills and the narrow brunts himself had shifted out.  </l>
<l>For what thing should bee talkt beefore Achilles rather? Or</l>
<l>What kynd of things than such as theis could seeme more meeter for</l>
<l>Achilles to bee talking of? But in theyr talk most breeme</l>
<l>Was then Achilles victory of Cygnet. It did seeme</l>
<l>A woonder that the flesh of him should bee so hard and tough  </l>
<l>As that no weapon myght have powre to raze or perce it through,</l>
<l>But that it did abate the edge of steele: it was a thing</l>
<l>That both Achilles and the Greekes in woondrous maze did bring.</l>
<l>Then Nestor sayd: This Cygnet is the person now alone</l>
<l>Of your tyme that defyed steele, and could bee perst of none.  </l>
<l>But I have seene now long ago one <placeName key="tgn,1044140">Cene</placeName> of Perrhebye,</l>
<l>I sawe one <placeName key="tgn,1044140">Cene</placeName> of Perrhebye a thousand woundes defye</l>
<l>With unatteynted bodye. In mount Othris he did dwell:</l>
<l>And was renowmed for his deedes: (and which in him ryght well</l>
<l>A greater woonder did appeere) he was a woman borne.      </l>
<l>This uncouth made them all much more amazed than beforne,</l>
<l>And every man desyred him to tell it. And among</l>
<l>The rest, Achilles sayd: Declare, I pray thee (for wee long</l>
<l>To heare it every one of us), O eloquent old man,</l>
<l>The wisedome of our age: what was that <placeName key="tgn,1044140">Cene</placeName> and how he wan    </l>

<l>What fyght or skirmish, tweene you first acquaintance did beegin,</l>
<l>And who in fyne did vanquish him if any vanquisht him.</l>
<l>Then Nestor: Though the length of tyme have made my senses dim,</l>
<l>And dyvers things erst seene in youth now out of mynd be gone: </l>
<l>Yit beare I still mo things in mynd: and df them all is none</l>

<l>A man great store of things through long continuance for to see,</l>
<l>Two hundred yeeres already of my lyfe full passed bee,      </l>
<l>And now I go uppon the third. This foresayd Ceny was</l>
<l>The daughter of one Elatey. In beawty shee did passe</l>
<l>The maydens all of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>. From all the Cities bye</l>
<l>And from thy Cities also, O Achilles, came (for why</l>
<l>Shee was thy countrywoman) store of wooers who in vayne     </l>
<l>In hope to win her love did take great travail, suit and payne.</l>
<l>Thy father also had perchaunce attempted heere to matcht</l>
<l>But that thy moothers maryage was alreadye then dispatcht,</l>
<l>Or shee at least affyanced. But Ceny matcht with none,</l>
<l>Howbeeit as shee on the shore was walking all alone,        </l>
<l>The God of sea did ravish her. (So fame dooth make report.)</l>
<l>And Neptune for the great delight he had in Venus sport,</l>
<l>Sayd: Ceny, aske mee what thou wilt, and I will give it thee.</l>
<l>(This also bruited is by fame.) The wrong heere doone to mee</l>
<l>(Quoth Ceny) makes mee wish great things. And therfore to th'entent </l>
<l>I may no more constreyned bee to such a thing, consent</l>
<l>I may no more a woman bee. And if thou graunt thereto,</l>
<l>It is even all that I desyre, or wish thee for to doo.</l>
<l>In bacer tune theis latter woordes were uttred, and her voyce</l>
<l>Did seeme a mannes voyce as it was in deede. For to her choyce  </l>
<l>The God of sea had given consent. He graunted him besyde</l>
<l>That free from wounding and from hurt he should from thence abyde,</l>
<l>And that he should not dye of steele. Right glad of this same graunt</l>
<l>Away went Ceny, and the feeldes of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> did haunt,</l>

<l>The over bold Ixions sonne had taken to his wyfe</l>
<l>Hippodame. And kevering boordes in bowres of boughes of trees</l>
<l>His Clowdbred brothers one by one he placed in degrees.</l>
<l>There were the Lordes of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>. I also was among</l>
<l>The rest: a cheerefull noyse of feast through all the Pallace roong. </l>
<l>Sum made the altars smoke, and sum the brydale carrolls soong.</l>
<l>Anon commes in the mayden bryde, a goodly wench of face,</l>
<l>With wyves and maydens following her with comly gate and grace.</l>
<l>Wee sayd that sir Pirithous was happy in his wyfe:</l>
<l>Which handsell had deceyved us wellneere through soodeine stryfe. </l>
<l>For of the cruell Centawres thou most cruell Ewryt, tho</l>
<l>Like as thy stomacke was with wyne farre over charged: so</l>
<l>As soone as thou behilldst the bryde, thy hart began to frayne,</l>
<l>And doubled with thy droonkennesse thy raging lust did reigne.</l>
<l>The feast was troubled by and by with tables overthrowen.       </l>
<l>The bryde was hayled by the head, so farre was furye growen.</l>
<l>Feerce Ewryt caught Hippodame, and every of the rest</l>
<l>Caught such as commed next to hand, or such as likte him best.</l>
<l>It was the lively image of a Citie tane by foes.</l>
<l>The house did ring of womens shreekes. We all up quickly rose.    </l>
<l>And first sayd Theseus thus: What aylst? art mad, O Ewrytus?</l>
<l>That darest (seeing mee alive) misuse Pirithous?</l>
<l>Not knowing that in one thou doost abuse us both? And least</l>
<l>He myght have seemd to speake in vayne, he thrust way such as preast</l>
<l>About the bryde, and tooke her from them freating sore thereat.    </l>
<l>No answere made him Ewrytus: (for such a deede as that</l>
<l>Defended could not bee with woordes) but with his sawcye fist</l>
<l>He flew at gentle Theseus face, and bobd him on the brist.</l>
<l>By chaunce hard by, an auncient cuppe of image woork did stand,</l>
<l>Which being huge, himself more huge sir Theseus tooke in hand,  </l>
<l>And threw't at Ewryts head. He spewd as well at mouth as wound</l>
<l>Mixt cloddes of blood, and brayne and wyne, and on the soyled ground</l>
<l>Lay sprawling bolt upryght. The death of him did set the rest,</l>
<l>His dowblelimbed brothers, so on fyre, that all the quest</l>
<l>With one voyce cryed out, Kill, kill. The wyne had given them hart. </l>
<l>Theyr first encounter was with cuppes and cannes throwen overthwart,</l>
<l>And brittle tankerds, and with boawles, pannes, dishes, potts, and trayes,</l>
<l>Things serving late for meate and drinke, and then for bluddy frayes.</l>
<l>First Amycus, Ophions sonne, without remorse began</l>
<l>To reeve and rob the brydehouse of his furniture. He ran        </l>
<l>And pulled downe a Lampbeame full of lyghtes, and lifting it</l>
<l>Aloft like one that with an Ax dooth fetch his blowe to slit</l>
<l>An Oxis necke in sacrifyse, he on the forehead hit</l>
<l>A Lapith named Celadon, and crusshed so his bones</l>
<l>That none could know him by the face: both eyes flew out at ones.  </l>
<l>His nose was beaten backe and to hispallat battred flat.</l>
<l>One Pelates, a Macedone, exceeding wroth therat,</l>
<l>Pulld out a maple tressles foote, and napt him in the necks,</l>
<l>That bobbing with his chin ageinst his brest to ground he becks.</l>
<l>And as he spitted out his teeth with blackish blood, he lent  </l>
<l>Another blowe to Amycus, which streyght to hell him sent.</l>
<l>Gryne standing by and lowring with a fell grim visage at</l>
<l>The smoking Altars, sayd: Why use we not theis same? with that</l>
<l>He caught a myghty altar up with burning fyre thereon,</l>
<l>And it among the thickest of the Lapithes threw anon.       </l>
<l>And twoo he over whelmd therewith calld Brote and Orion.</l>
<l>This Orions moother, Mycale, is knowne of certeintye</l>
<l>The Moone resisting to have drawne by witchcraft from the skye.</l>
<l>Full dearely shalt thou by it (quoth Exadius) may I get</l>
<l>A weapon: and with that in stead of weapon, he did set      </l>
<l>His hand uppon a vowd harts horne that on a Pynetree hye</l>
<l>Was nayld, and with two tynes therof he strake out eyther eye</l>
<l>Of Gryne: whereof sum stacke uppon the home, and sum did flye</l>
<l>Uppon his beard, and there with blood like jelly mixt did lye.</l>
<l>A flaming fyrebrand from amids an Altar Rhaetus snatcht,    </l>
<l>With which uppon the leftsyde of his head Charaxus latcht</l>
<l>A blow that crackt his skull. The blaze among his yellow heare</l>
<l>Ran sindging up, as if dry come with lightning blasted were.</l>
<l>And in his wound the seared blood did make a greevous sound,</l>
<l>As when a peece of steele red hot tane up with tongs is drownd  </l>
<l>In water by the smith, it spirts and hisseth in the trowgh.</l>
<l>Charaxus from his curled heare did shake the fyre, and thowgh</l>
<l>He wounded were, yit caught he up uppon his shoulders twayne</l>
<l>A stone, the Jawme of eyther doore that well would loade a wayne.</l>
<l>The masse theof was such as that it would not let him hit    </l>
<l>His fo. It lighted short: and with the falling downe of it</l>
<l>A mate of his that Comet hyght, it all in peeces smit.</l>
<l>Then Rhaete restreyning not his joy, sayd thus: I would the rowt</l>
<l>Of all thy mates myght in the selfsame maner prove them stowt.</l>
<l>And with his halfeburnt brond the wound he searched new agayne, </l>
<l>Not ceasing for to lay on loade uppon his pate amayne,</l>
<l>Untill his head was crusht, and of his scalp the bones did swim</l>
<l>Among his braynes. In jolly ruffe he passed streyght from him</l>
<l>To Coryt, and Euagrus, and to Dryant on a rowe.</l>
<l>Of whom when Coryt (on whose cheekes yoong mossy downe gan grow)  </l>
<l>Was slayne, What prayse or honour (quoth Euagrus) hast thou got</l>
<l>By killing of a boy? mo woordes him Rhetus suffred not</l>
<l>To speake, but in his open mouth did thrust his burning brand,</l>
<l>And downe his throteboll to his chest. Then whisking in his hand</l>
<l>His fyrebrand round about his head he feercely did assayle  </l>
<l>The valyant Dryant. But with him he could not so prevayle.</l>
<l>For as he triumpht in his lucke, proceeding for to make</l>
<l>Continuall slaughter of his foes, sir Dryant with a stake</l>
<l>(Whose poynt was hardned in the fyre) did cast at him a foyne</l>
<l>And thrust him through the place in which the neck and shoulders joyne. </l>
<l>He groand and from his cannell bone could scarcely pull the stake.</l>
<l>And beeing foyled with his blood to flyght he did him take.</l>
<l>Arnaeus also ran away, and Lycidas likewyse.</l>
<l>And Medon (whose ryght shoulderplate was also wounded) flyes.</l>
<l>So did Pisenor, so did Cawne, and so did Mermeros           </l>
<l>Who late outronning every man, now wounded slower goes:</l>
<l>And so did Phole, and Menelas, and Abas who was woont</l>
<l>To make a spoyle among wylde Boares as oft as he did hunt:</l>
<l>And eeke the wyzarde Astylos who counselled his mates</l>
<l>To leave that fray: but he to them in vayne of leaving prates.  </l>
<l>He eeke to Nessus (who for feare of wounding seemed shye)</l>
<l>Sayd: Fly not, thou shalt scape this fray of Hercles bowe to dye.</l>
<l>But Lycid and Ewrinomos, and Imbreus, and Are</l>
<l>Escapte not death. Sir Dryants hand did all alike them spare.</l>
<l>Cayneius also (though that he in flying were not slacke,)   </l>
<l>Yit was he wounded on the face: for as he looked backe,</l>
<l>A weapons poynt did hit him full midway betweene the eyes,</l>

<l>And Dyctis from a slipprye knappe downe slyding, as he ment</l>
<l>To shonne Perithous preacing on, fell headlong downe, and with</l>
<l>His hugenesse brake the greatest Ash that was in all the frith,  </l>
<l>And goard his gutts uppon the stump. To wreake his death comes Phare:</l>
<l>And from the mount a mighty rocke with bothe his handes he tare:</l>
<l>Which as he was about to throwe, Duke Theseus did prevent,</l>
<l>And with an Oken plant uppon his mighty elbowe lent</l>
<l>Him such a blowe, as that he brake the bones, and past no further.  </l>
<l>For leysure would not serve him then his maymed corce to murther.</l>
<l>He lept on hygh Bianors backe, who none was woont to beare</l>
<l>Besydes himself. Ageinst his sydes his knees fast nipping were,</l>
<l>And with his left hand taking hold uppon his foretoppe heare</l>
<l>He cuft him with his knubbed plant about the frowning face,  </l>
<l>And made his wattled browes to breake. And with his Oken mace</l>
<l>He overthrew Nedimnus: and Lycespes with his dart,</l>
<l>And Hippasus whose beard did hyde his brest the greater part:</l>
<l>And Riphey tallar than the trees, and Therey who was woont</l>
<l>Among the hilles of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> for cruell Beares to hunt,   </l>
<l>And beare them angry home alyve. It did Demoleon spyght</l>
<l>That Theseus had so good successe and fortune in his fyght.</l>
<l>An old long Pynetree rooted fast he strave with all his myght</l>
<l>To pluck up whole bothe trunk and roote, which when he could not bring</l>
<l>To passe, he brake it off, and at his emnye did it fling.   </l>
<l>But Theseus by admonishment of heavenly Pallas (so</l>
<l>He would have folke beleve it were) start backe a great way fro</l>
<l>The weapon as it came. Yit fell it not without some harme.</l>
<l>It cut from Crantors left syde bulke, his shoulder, brest, and arme.</l>
<l>This Grantor was thy fathers Squyre (Achilles) and was given  </l>
<l>Him by Amyntor ruler of the Dolops, who was driven</l>
<l>By battell for to give him as an hostage for the peace</l>
<l>To bee observed faythfully. When Peleus in the preace</l>
<l>A great way off behilld him thus falne dead of this same wound,</l>
<l>O Grantor, deerest man to mee of all above the ground,</l>
<l>Hold heere an obitgift hee sayd: and both with force of hart</l>
<l>And hand, at stout Demoleons head he threw an asshen dart,</l>
<l>Which brake the watling of his ribbes, and sticking in the bone,</l>
<l>Did shake. He pulled out the steale with much adoo alone.</l>
<l>The head therof stacke still behynd among his lungs and lyghts.   </l>
<l>Enforst to courage with his payne, he ryseth streight uprights,</l>
<l>And pawing at his emny with his horsish feete, he smyghts</l>
<l>Uppon him. Peleus bare his strokes uppon his burganet,</l>
<l>And fenst his shoulders with his sheeld, and evermore did set</l>
<l>His weapon upward with the poynt, which by his shoulders perst  </l>
<l>Through both his brestes at one full blowe. Howbee't your father erst</l>
<l>Had killed Hyle and Phlegrye, and Hiphinous aloof</l>
<l>And Danes who boldly durst at hand his manhod put in proof.</l>
<l>To theis was added Dorylas, who ware uppon his head</l>
<l>A cap of woolves skinne. And the homes of Oxen dyed red     </l>
<l>With blood were then his weapon. I (for then my courage gave</l>
<l>Mee strength) sayd: See how much thy homes lesse force than Iron have.</l>
<l>And therewithall with manly might a dart at him I drave.</l>
<l>Which when he could not shonne, he clapt his right hand flat uppon</l>
<l>His forehead where the wound should bee. For why his hand anon  </l>
<l>Was nayled to his forehead fast. Hee roared out amayne.</l>
<l>And as he stood amazed and began to faynt for payne,</l>
<l>Your father Peleus (for he stood hard bv him) strake him under</l>
<l>The middle belly with his swoord, and ript his womb asunder.</l>
<l>Out girdes mee Dorill streyght, and trayles his guttes uppon the ground </l>
<l>And trampling underneath his feete did breake them, and they wound</l>
<l>About his leggs so snarling, that he could no further go,</l>
<l>But fell downe dead with empty womb. Nought booted Cyllar tho</l>
<l>His beawtye in that frentick fray, (at leastwyse if wee graunt</l>
<l>That any myght in that straunge shape, of natures beawtye vaunt.) </l>
<l>His beard began but then to bud: his beard was like the gold:</l>
<l>So also were his yellowe lokes, which goodly to behold</l>
<l>Midway beneath his shoulders hung. There rested in his face</l>
<l>A sharpe and lively cheerfulnesse with sweete and pleasant grace.</l>
<l>His necke, brest, shoulders, armes, and hands, as farre as he was man, </l>
<l>Were such as never carvers woork yit stayne them could or can.</l>
<l>His neather part likewyse (which was a horse) was every whit</l>
<l>Full equall with his upper part, or little woorse than it.</l>
<l>For had yee given him horses necke, and head, he was a beast</l>
<l>For Castor to have ridden on. So bourly was his brest:      </l>
<l>So handsome was his backe to beare a saddle: and his heare</l>
<l>Was blacke as jeate, but that his tayle and feete milk whyghtish were.</l>
<l>Full many Females of his race did wish him to theyr make.</l>
<l>But only dame Hylonome for lover he did take.</l>
<l>Of all the halfbrutes in the woodes there did not any dwell  </l>
<l>More comly than Hylonome. She usde herself so well</l>
<l>In dalyance, and in loving, and in uttring of her love,</l>
<l>That shee alone hilld Cyllarus. As much as did behove</l>
<l>In suchye limbes, shee trimmed them as most the eye might move.</l>
<l>With combing, smoothe shee made her heare: shee wallowed her full oft </l>
<l>In Roses and in Rosemarye, or Violets sweete and soft:</l>
<l>Sumtyme shee caryed Lillyes whyght: and twyce a day shee washt</l>
<l>Her visage in the spring that from the toppe of Pagase past:</l>
<l>And in the streame shee twyce a day did bath her limbes: and on</l>
<l>Her left syde or her shoulders came the comlyest things, and none  </l>
<l>But fynest skinnes of choycest beasts. Alike eche loved other:</l>
<l>Togither they among the hilles roamd up and downe: togither</l>
<l>They went to covert: and that tyme togither they did enter</l>
<l>The Lapithes house, and there the fray togither did adventer.</l>
<l>A dart on Cyllars left syde came, (I know not who it sent)  </l>
<l>Which sumwhat underneathe his necke his brest asunder splent.</l>
<l>As lyghtly as his hart was raazd, no sooner was the dart</l>
<l>Pluckt out, but all his bodye wext stark cold and dyed swart.</l>
<l>Immediatly Hylonome his dying limbes up stayd,</l>
<l>And put her hand uppon the wound to stoppe the blood, and layd   </l>
<l>Her mouth to his, and labored sore to stay his passing spryght.</l>
<l>But when shee sawe him throughly dead, then speaking woordes which might</l>
<l>Not to my hearing come for noyse, shee stikt herself uppon</l>
<l>The weapon that had gored him, and dyde with him anon</l>

<l part="F">There also stood before  </l>
<l>Myne eyes the grim Pheocomes both man and horse who wore</l>
<l>A <placeName key="tgn,7008772">Lyons</placeName> skinne uppon his backe fast knit with knotts afore.</l>
<l>He snatching up a timber log (which scarcely two good teeme</l>
<l>Of Oxen could have stird) did throwe the same with force extreeme</l>
<l>At Phonolenyes sonne. The logge him all in fitters strake,  </l>
<l>And of his head the braynepan in a thousand peeces brake,</l>
<l>That at his mouth, his eares, and eyes, and at his nosethrills too,</l>
<l>His crusshed brayne came roping out as creame is woont to doo</l>
<l>From sives or riddles made of wood, or as a Cullace out</l>
<l>From streyner or from Colender. But as he went about       </l>
<l>To strippe him from his harnesse as he lay uppon the ground,</l>
<l>(Your father knoweth this full well) my sword his gutts did wound,</l>
<l>Teleboas and Cthonius bothe, were also slaine by mee.</l>
<l>Sir Cthonius for his weapon had a forked bough of tree.</l>
<l>The tother had a dart. His dart did wound mee. You may see  </l>
<l>The scarre therof remayning yit. Then was the tyme that I</l>
<l>Should sent have beene to conquer <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. Then was the tyme that I</l>
<l>Myght through my force and prowesse, if not vanquish Hector stout,</l>
<l>Yit at the least have hilld him wag, I put you out of Dout.</l>
<l>But then was Hector no body: or but a babe. And now       </l>
<l>Am I forspent and worne with yeeres. What should I tell you how</l>
<l>Piretus dyde by Periphas? Or wherefore should I make</l>
<l>Long processe for to tell you of sir Ampycus that strake</l>
<l>The fowrefoote Oecle on the face with dart of Cornell tree,</l>
<l>The which had neyther head nor poynt? Or how that Macaree  </l>
<l>Of Mountaine Pelithronye with a leaver lent a blowe</l>
<l>To Erigdupus on the brest which did him overthrowe?</l>
<l>Full well I doo remember that Cymelius threw a dart</l>
<l>Which lyghted full in Nesseyes flank about his privie part.</l>
<l>And think not you that Mops, the sonne of Ampycus, could doo    </l>
<l>No good but onely prophesye. This stout Odites whoo</l>
<l>Had bothe the shapes of man and horse, by Mopsis dart was slayne,</l>
<l>And labouring for to speake his last he did but strive in vayne.</l>
<l>For Mopsis dart togither nayld his toong and neather chappe,</l>
<l>And percing through his throte did make a wyde and deadly gappe. </l>
<l>Fyve men had <placeName key="tgn,1044140">Cene</placeName> already slayne: theyr wounds I cannot say:</l>
<l>The names and nomber of them all ryght well I beare away.</l>
<l>The names of them were Stiphelus, and <placeName key="tgn,1038663">Brome</placeName>, and Helimus,</l>
<l>Pyracmon with his forest bill, and stout Antimachus.</l>
<l>Out steppes the biggest Centawre there, huge Latreus, armed in   </l>
<l>Alesus of Aemathias spoyle slayne late before by him.</l>
<l>His yeeres were mid tweene youth and age, his courage still was yoong,</l>
<l>And on his abrun head hore heares peerd heere and there amoong.</l>
<l>His furniture was then a swoord, a target and a lawnce</l>
<l>Aemathian like. To bothe the parts he did his face advaunce,  </l>
<l>And brandishing his weapon brave, in circlewyse did prawnce</l>
<l>About, and stoutly spake theis woordes: And must I beare with yow,</l>
<l>Dame Cenye? for none other than a moother (I avow)</l>
<l>No better than a moother will I count thee whyle I live.</l>
<l>Remembrest not what shape by birth dame nature did thee give?    </l>
<l>Forgettst thou how thou purchasedst this counterfetted shape</l>
<l>Of man? Consyderest what thou art by birth? and how for rape</l>
<l>Thou art become the thing thou art? Go take thy distaffe, and</l>
<l>Thy spindle, and in spinning yarne go exercyse thy hand.</l>
<l>Let men alone with feates of armes. As Latreus made this stout  </l>
<l>And scornefull taunting in a ring still turning him about,</l>
<l>This Cenye with a dart did hit him full uppon the syde</l>
<l>Where as the horse and man were joyned togither in a hyde.</l>
<l>The strype made Latreus mad: and with his lawnce in rage he stracke</l>
<l>Uppon sir Cenyes naked ribbes. The lawnce rebounded backe   </l>
<l>Like haylestones from a tyled house, or as a man should pat</l>
<l>Small stones uppon a dromslets head. He came more neere with that,</l>
<l>And in his brawned syde did stryve to thrust his swoord. There was</l>
<l>No way for swoord to enter in. Yit shalt thou not so passe</l>
<l>My handes (sayd he.) Well sith the poynt is blunted thou shalt dye </l>
<l>Uppon the edge: and with that woord he fetcht his blow awrye,</l>
<l>And sydling with a sweeping stroke along his belly smit.</l>
<l>The strype did give a clinke as if it had on marble hit.</l>
<l>And therewithall the swoord did breake, and on his necke did lyght.</l>
<l>When Ceny had sufficiently given Latreus leave to smyght  </l>
<l>His flesh which was unmaymeable, Well now (quoth he) lets see,</l>
<l>If my swoord able bee or no to byght the flesh of thee.</l>
<l>In saying so, his dreadfull swoord as farre as it would go</l>
<l>He underneathe his shoulder thrust, and wrinching to and fro</l>
<l>Among his gutts, made wound in wound. Behold with hydeous crye </l>
<l>The dowblemembred Centawres sore abasht uppon him flye,</l>
<l>And throwe theyr weapons all at him. Theyr weapons downe did fall</l>
<l>As if they had rebated beene, and Cenye for them all</l>
<l>Abydes unstriken through. Yea none was able blood to drawe.</l>
<l>The straungenesse of the cace made all amazed that it sawe. </l>
<l>Fy, fy for shame (quoth Monychus) that such a rable can</l>
<l>Not overcome one wyght alone, who scarcely is a man.</l>
<l>Although (to say the very truthe) he is the man, and wee</l>
<l>Through fayntnesse that that he was borne by nature for to bee.</l>
<l>What profits theis huge limbes of ours? what helpes our dowble force? </l>
<l>Or what avayles our dowble shape of man as well as horse</l>
<l>By puissant nature joynd in one? I can not thinke that wee</l>
<l>Of sovereigne Goddesse Juno were begot, or that wee bee</l>
<l>Ixions sonnes, who was so stout of courage and so hault,</l>
<l>As that he durst on Junos love attempt to give assault. </l>
<l>The emny that dooth vanquish us is scarcely half a man</l>
<l>Whelme blocks, and stones, and mountaynes whole uppon his hard brayne pan:</l>
<l>And presse yee out his lively ghoste with trees. Let timber choke</l>
<l>His chappes, let weyght enforce his death in stead of wounding stroke.</l>
<l>This sayd: by chaunce he gets a tree blowne downe by blustring blasts </l>
<l>Of Southerne wynds, and on his fo with all his myght it casts,</l>
<l>And gave example to the rest to doo the like. Within</l>
<l>A whyle the shadowes which did hyde mount <placeName key="tgn,4008379">Pelion</placeName> waxed thin:</l>
<l>And not a tree was left uppon mount Othris ere they went.</l>
<l>Sir Cenye underneathe this greate huge pyle of timber pent,  </l>
<l>Did chauf and on his shoulders hard the heavy logges did beare.</l>
<l>But when above his face and head the trees up stacked were,</l>
<l>So that he had no venting place to drawe his breth: One whyle</l>
<l>He faynted: and another whyle he heaved at the pyle,</l>
<l>To tumble downe the loggs that lay so heavy on his backe,    </l>
<l>And for to winne the open ayre ageine above the stacke:</l>
<l>As if the mountayne Ida (lo) which yoonder we doo see</l>
<l>So hygh, by earthquake at a tyme should chaunce to shaken bee.</l>
<l>Men dowt what did become of him. Sum hold opinion that</l>
<l>The burthen of the woodes had driven his soule to Limbo flat.  </l>
<l>But Mopsus sayd it was not so. For he did see a browne</l>
<l>Bird flying from amid the stacke and towring up and downe.</l>
<l>It was the first tyme and the last that ever I behild</l>
<l>That fowle. When Mopsus softly saw him soring in the feeld,</l>
<l>He looked wistly after him, and cryed out on hye:            </l>

<l>Our sorrow set us in a rage. It was too us a greef</l>

<l>In saying this, he brought him where Achilles with his brond</l>

<l>As that Achilles tumbled downe starke dead uppon the lond.</l>
<l>This was the onely thing wherof the old king Priam myght    </l>

<l>This matcheth thee, Achilles, full. And this can never dye.  </l>
<l>His target also (too th'entent that men myght playnly spye</l>

<l>The Lordes and Capteynes being set toogither with the King,</l>
<l>And all the souldiers standing round about them in a ring,</l>
<l>The owner of the sevenfold sheeld, to theis did Ajax ryse.</l>
<l>And (as he could not brydle wrath) he cast his frowning eyes</l>
<l>Uppon the shore and on the fleete that there at Anchor lyes   </l>
<l>And throwing up his handes:  God and must wee plead (quoth hee)</l>
<l>Our case before our shippes? and must Ulysses stand with mee?</l>
<l>But like a wretch he ran his way when Hector came with fyre,</l>
<l>Which I defending from theis shippes did force him to retyre.</l>
<l>It easyer is therefore with woordes in print to maynteine stryfe,  </l>
<l>Than for to fyght it out with fists. But neyther I am ryfe</l>
<l>In woordes, nor hee in deedes. For looke how farre I him excell</l>
<l>In battell and in feates of armes: so farre beares hee the bell</l>
<l>From mee in talking. Neyther think I requisite to tell</l>
<l>My actes among you. You your selves have seene them verry well.   </l>
<l>But let Ulysses tell you his doone all in hudther mudther,</l>
<l>And wherunto the only nyght is privy and none other.</l>
<l>The pryse is great (I doo confesse) for which wee stryve. But yit</l>
<l>It is dishonour unto mee, for that in clayming it</l>
<l>So bace a persone standeth in contention for the same.        </l>
<l>To think it myne already, ought to counted bee no shame</l>
<l>Nor pryde in mee: although the thing of ryght great valew bee</l>
<l>Of which Ulysses standes in hope. For now alreadye hee</l>
<l>Hath wonne the honour of this pryse, in that when he shall sit</l>
<l>Besydes the cuishon, he may brag he strave with mee for it.  </l>
<l>And though I wanted valiantnesse, yit should nobilitee</l>
<l>Make with mee. I of Telamon am knowne the sonne to bee</l>
<l>Who under valeant Hercules the walles of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> did scale,</l>
<l>And in the shippe of Pagasa to Colchos land did sayle.</l>
<l>His father was that Aeacus whoo executeth ryght </l>
<l>Among the ghostes where Sisyphus heaves up with all his myght</l>
<l>The massye stone ay tumbling downe. The hyghest Jove of all</l>
<l>Acknowledgeth this Aeacus, and dooth his sonne him call.</l>
<l>Thus am I Ajax third from Jove. Yit let this Pedegree,</l>
<l>O Achyves, in this case of myne avaylable not bee, </l>
<l>Onlesse I proove it fully with Achylles to agree.</l>
<l>He was my brother, and I clayme that was my brothers. Why</l>
<l>Shouldst thou that art of Sisyphs blood, and for to filch and lye</l>
<l>Expressest him in every poynt, by foorged pedegree</l>
<l>Aly thee to the Aeacyds, as though we did not see </l>
<l>Thee to the house of Aeacus a straunger for to bee?</l>
<l>And is it reason that you should this armour mee denye</l>
<l>Bycause I former was in armes, and needed not a spye</l>
<l>To fetch mee foorth? Or think you him more woorthye it to have,</l>
<l>That came to warrefare hindermost, and feynd himself to rave, </l>
<l>Bycause he would have shund the warre? untill a suttler head</l>
<l>And more unprofitable for himself, sir Palamed,</l>
<l>Escryde the crafty fetches of his fearefull hart, and drew</l>
<l>Him foorth a warfare which he sought so cowardly to eschew?</l>
<l>Must he now needes enjoy the best and richest armour, whoo </l>
<l>Would none at all have worne onlesse he forced were thertoo?</l>
<l>And I with shame bee put besyde my cousin germanes gifts</l>
<l>Bycause to shun the formest brunt of warres I sought no shifts?</l>
<l>Would God this mischeef mayster had in verrye deede beene mad,</l>
<l>Or else beleeved so to bee: and that wee never had </l>
<l>Brought such a panion unto <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. Then should not Paeans sonne</l>
<l>In <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName> like an outlawe to the shame of all us wonne.</l>
<l>Who lurking now (as men report) in woodes and caves, dooth move</l>
<l>The verry flints with syghes and grones, and prayers to God above</l>
<l>To send Ulysses his desert. Which prayer (if there bee        </l>
<l>A God) must one day take effect. And now beehold how hee</l>
<l>By othe a Souldier of our Camp, yea and as well as wee</l>
<l>A Capteine too, alas, (who was by Hercules assignde</l>
<l>To have the keeping of his shafts,) with payne and hungar pynde,</l>
<l>Is clad and fed with fowles, and dribs his arrowes up and downe  </l>
<l>At birds, which were by destinye preparde to stroy <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> towne.</l>
<l>Yit liveth hee bycause hee is not still in companie</l>
<l>With sly Ulysses. Palamed that wretched knyght perdie,</l>
<l>Would eeke he had abandond beene. For then should still the same</l>
<l>Have beene alyve: or at the least have dyde without our shame.  </l>
<l>But this companion bearing (ah) too well in wicked mynd</l>
<l>His madnesse which sir Palamed by wisdome out did fynd,</l>
<l>Appeached him of treason that he practysde to betray</l>
<l>The Greekish hoste. And for to vouch the fact, he shewd streyght way</l>
<l>A masse of goold that he himself had hidden in his tent, </l>
<l>And forged Letters which he feynd from Priam to bee sent.</l>
<l>Thus eyther by his murthring men or else by banishment</l>
<l>Abateth hee the Greekish strength. This is Ulysses fyght.</l>
<l>This is the feare he puttes men in. But though he had more might</l>
<l>Than Nestor hath, in eloquence he shal not compasse mee </l>
<l>To think his leawd abandoning of Nestor for to bee</l>
<l>No fault: who beeing cast behynd by wounding of his horse,</l>
<l>And slowe with age, with calling on Ulysses waxing hoarce,</l>
<l>Was nerethelesse betrayd by him. Sir Diomed knowes this cryme</l>
<l>Is unsurmysde. For he himselfe did at that present tyme</l>
<l>Rebuke him oftentymes by name, and feercely him upbrayd</l>
<l>With flying from his fellowe so who stood in neede of ayd.</l>
<l>With ryghtfull eyes dooth God behold the deedes of mortall men.</l>
<l>Lo, he that helped not his freend wants help himself agen.</l>
<l>And as he did forsake his freend in tyme of neede: so hee </l>
<l>Did in the selfsame perrill fall forsaken for to bee.</l>
<l>He made a rod to beat himself. He calld and cryed out</l>
<l>Uppon his fellowes. Streight I came: and there I saw the lout</l>
<l>Bothe quake and shake for feare of death, and looke as pale as clout.</l>
<l>I set my sheeld betweene him and his foes, and him bestrid:   </l>
<l>And savde the dastards lyfe. Small prayse redoundes of that I did.</l>
<l>But if thou wilt contend with mee, lets to the selfesame place</l>
<l>Agein: bee wounded as thou wart: and in the foresayd case</l>
<l>Of feare, beset about with foes: cowch underneath my sheeld:</l>
<l>And then contend thou with mee there amid the open feeld.   </l>
<l>Howbee't, I had no sooner rid this champion of his foes,</l>
<l>But where for woundes he scarce before could totter on his toes,</l>
<l>He ran away apace, as though he nought at all did ayle.</l>
<l>Anon commes Hector to the feeld and bringeth at his tayle</l>
<l>The Goddes. Not only thy hart there (Ulysses) did thee fayle,  </l>
<l>But even the stowtest courages and stomacks gan to quayle.</l>
<l>So great a terrour brought he in. Yit in the midds of all</l>
<l>His bloody ruffe, I coapt with him, and with a foyling fall</l>
<l>Did overthrowe him to the ground. Another tyme, when hee</l>
<l>Did make a chalendge, you my Lordes by lot did choose out mee,   </l>
<l>And I did match him hand to hand. Your wisshes were not vayne.</l>
<l>For if you aske mee what successe our combate did obteine,</l>
<l>I came away unvanquished. Behold the men of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName></l>
<l>Brought fyre and swoord, and all the feendes our navye to destroy.</l>
<l>And where was slye Ulysses then with all his talk so smooth?  </l>
<l>This brest of myne was fayne to fence your thousand shippes forsooth,</l>
<l>The hope of your returning home. For saving that same day</l>
<l>So many shippes, this armour give. But (if that I shall say</l>
<l>The truth) the greater honour now this armour beares away.</l>
<l>And our renownes togither link. For (as of reason ought)    </l>
<l>An Ajax for this armour, not an armour now is sought</l>
<l part="I">For Ajax.

<l part="F">Let Dulychius match with theis, the horses whyght</l>
<l>Of Rhesus, dastard Dolon, and the coward carpetknyght</l>
<l>King Priams Helen, and the stelth of Palladye by nyght.</l>
<l>Of all theis things was nothing doone by day nor nothing wrought  </l>
<l>Without the helpe of Diomed. And therefore if yee thought</l>
<l>To give them to so small deserts, devyde the same, and let</l>
<l>Sir Diomed have the greater part. But what should Ithacus get</l>
<l>And if he had them, who dooth all his matters in the dark,</l>

<l>It cannot but a burthen bee (and that ryght great) to beare  </l>

<l>Moreover this thy sheeld that feeles so seeld the force of fyght </l>
<l>Is sound. But myne is gasht and hakt and stricken thurrough quyght</l>
<l>A thousand tymes, with bearing blowes. And therfore myne must walk</l>

<l>Lets now bee seene another whyle what eche of us can doo.</l>
<l>The thickest of our armed foes this armour throwe into,        </l>
<l>And bid us fetch the same fro thence. And which of us dooth fetch</l>
<l>The same away, reward yee him therewith. Thus farre did stretch</l>
<l>The woordes of Ajax. At the ende whereof there did ensew</l>
<l>A muttring of the souldiers, till Laertis sonne the prew</l>
<l>Stood up, and raysed soberly his eyliddes from the ground </l>
<l>(On which he had a little whyle them pitched in a stound)</l>
<l>And looking on the noblemen who longd his woordes to heere</l>
<l>He thus began with comly grace and sober pleasant cheere:</l>
<l>My Lordes, if my desyre and yours myght erst have taken place,</l>
<l>It should not at this present tyme have beene a dowtfull cace,  </l>
<l>What person hath most ryght to this great pryse for which wee stryve.</l>
<l>Achilles should his armour have, and wee still him alyve.</l>
<l>Whom sith that cruell destinie to both of us denyes,</l>
<l>(With that same woord as though he wept, he wypte his watry eyes)</l>
<l>What wyght of reason rather ought to bee Achilles heyre,</l>
<l>Than he through whom to this your camp Achilles did repayre?</l>
<l>Alonly let it not avayle sir Ajax heere, that hee</l>
<l>Is such a dolt and grossehead, as he shewes himself to bee</l>
<l>Ne let my wit (which ay hath done you good, O Greekes) hurt mee.</l>
<l>But suffer this mine eloquence (such as it is) which now       </l>
<l>Dooth for his mayster speake, and oft ere this hath spoke for yow,</l>
<l>Bee undisdeynd. Let none refuse his owne good gifts he brings.</l>
<l>For as for stocke and auncetors, and other such like things</l>
<l>Wherof our selves no fownders are, I scarcely dare them graunt</l>
<l>To bee our owne. But forasmuch as Ajax makes his vaunt    </l>
<l>To bee the fowrth from Jove: even Jove the founder is also</l>
<l>Of my house: and than fowre descents I am from him no mo.</l>
<l><placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> is my father, and Arcesius his, and hee</l>
<l>Begotten was of Jupiter. And in this pedegree</l>
<l>Is neyther any damned soule, nor outlaw as yee see. </l>
<l>Moreover by my moothers syde I come of Mercuree,</l>
<l>Another honor to my house. Thus both by fathers syde</l>
<l>And moothers (as you may perceyve) I am to Goddes alyde.</l>
<l>But neyther for bycause I am a better gentleman</l>
<l>Then Ajax by the moothers syde, nor that my father can </l>
<l>Avouch himself ungiltye of his brothers blood, doo I</l>
<l>This armour clayme. Wey you the case by merits uprightly,</l>
<l>Provyded no prerogatyve of birthryght Ajax beare,</l>
<l>For that his father Telamon, and Peleus brothers were.</l>
<l>Let only prowesse in this pryse the honour beare away.    </l>
<l>Or if the case on kinrid or on birthryght seeme to stay,</l>
<l>His father Peleus is alive, and Pyrrhus eeke his sonne.</l>
<l>What tytle then can Ajax make? This geere of ryght should woone</l>
<l>To Phthya, or to Scyros Ile. And Tewcer is as well</l>
<l>Achilles uncle as is hee. Yit dooth not Tewcer mell.     </l>
<l>And if he did, should hee obteyne? Well, sith the cace dooth rest</l>
<l>On tryall which of us can prove his dooings to bee best,</l>
<l>I needes must say my deedes are mo than well I can expresse:</l>
<l>Yit will I shew them orderly as neere as I can gesse.</l>
<l>Foreknowing that her sonne should dye, the Lady Thetis hid  </l>
<l>Achilles in a maydes attyre. By which fyne slyght shee did</l>
<l>All men deceyve, and Ajax too. This armour in a packe</l>
<l>With other womens tryflyng toyes I caryed on my backe,</l>
<l>A bayte to treyne a manly hart. Appareld like a mayd</l>
<l>Achilles tooke the speare and sheeld in hand, and with them playd. </l>
<l>Then sayd I: O thou Goddesse sonne, why shouldst thou bee afrayd</l>
<l>To raze great <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, whoose overthrowe for thee is onely stayd?</l>
<l>And laying hand uppon him I did send him (as you see)</l>
<l>To valeant dooings meete for such a valeant man as hee.</l>
<l>And therfore all the deedes of him are my deedes. I did wound  </l>
<l>King Teleph with his speare, and when he lay uppon the ground,</l>
<l>I was intreated with the speare to heale him safe and sound.</l>
<l>That Thebe lyeth overthrowne, is my deede. You must think</l>
<l>I made the folk of <placeName key="perseus,Tenedos">Tenedos</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName> for to shrink.</l>
<l>Both <placeName key="perseus,Chryse">Chryse</placeName> and Cillas, Phebus townes, and Scyros I did take.  </l>
<l>And my ryght hand Lyrnessus walles to ground did levell make.</l>
<l>I gave you him that should confound (besydes a number mo)</l>
<l>The valeant Hector. Hector, that our most renowmed fo,</l>
<l>Is slayne by mee. This armour heere I sue agein to have</l>
<l>This armour by the which I found Achilles. I it gave       </l>
<l>Achilles whyle he was alive: and now that he is gone</l>
<l>I clayme it as myne owne agein. What tyme the greefe of one</l>
<l>Had perst the harts of all the Greekes, and that our thousand sayle</l>
<l>At Awlis by Ewboya stayd, bycause the wyndes did fayle,</l>
<l>Continewing eyther none at all or cleene ageinst us long,  </l>
<l>And that our Agamemnon was by destnyes overstrong</l>
<l>Commaunded for to sacrifyse his giltlesse daughter to</l>
<l>Diana, which her father then refusing for to doo</l>
<l>Was angry with the Godds themselves, and though he were a king</l>
<l>Continued also fatherlyke: by reason, I did bring           </l>
<l>His gentle nature to relent for publike profits sake.</l>
<l>I must confesse (whereat his grace shall no displeasure take)</l>
<l>Before a parciall judge I undertooke a ryght hard cace.</l>
<l>Howbeeit for his brothers sake, and for the royall mace</l>
<l>Committed, and his peoples weale, at length he was content  </l>
<l>To purchace prayse wyth blood. Then was I to the moother sent,</l>
<l>Who not perswaded was to bee, but compast with sum guyle.</l>
<l>Had Ajax on this errand gone, our shippes had all this whyle</l>
<l>Lyne still there yit for want of wynd. Moreover I was sent</l>
<l>To <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilion</placeName> as ambassadour. I boldly thither went,             </l>
<l>And entred and behilld the Court, wherin there was as then</l>
<l>Great store of princes, Dukes, Lords, knyghts, and other valeant men.</l>
<l>And yit I boldly nerethelesse my message did at large</l>
<l>The which the whole estate of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> had given mee erst in charge.</l>
<l>I made complaint of <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName>, and accusde him to his head.     </l>
<l>Demaunding restitution of Queene Helen that same sted</l>
<l>And of the bootye with her tane. Both Priamus the king</l>
<l>And eeke Antenor his alye the woordes of mee did sting.</l>
<l>And <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName> and his brothers, and the resdew of his trayne</l>
<l>That under him had made the spoyle, could hard and scarce refrayne </l>
<l>There wicked hands. You, Menelay, doo know I doo not feyne.</l>
<l>And that day was the first in which wee joyntly gan susteyne</l>
<l>A tast of perrills, store whereof did then behind remayne.

<l>It would bee overlong to tell eche profitable thing</l>
<l>That during this long lasting warre I well to passe did bring,  </l>
<l>By force as well as pollycie. For after that the furst</l>
<l>Encounter once was overpast, our emnyes never durst</l>
<l>Give battell in the open feeld, but hild themselves within</l>
<l>Theyr walles and bulwarks till the tyme the tenth yeere did begin,</l>
<l>Now what didst thou of all that whyle, that canst doo nought but streeke?  </l>
<l>Or to what purpose servedst thou? For if thou my deedes seeke,</l>
<l>I practysd sundry pollycies to trappe our foes unware:</l>
<l>I fortifyde our Camp with trench which heretofore lay bare:</l>
<l>I hartned our companions with a quiet mynd to beare</l>
<l>The longnesse of the weery warre: I taught us how wee were  </l>
<l>Bothe to bee fed and furnished: and to and fro I went</l>
<l>To places where the Counsell thought most meete I should bee sent.</l>
<l>Behold the king deceyved in his dreame by false pretence</l>
<l>Of Joves commaundement, bade us rayse our seedge and get us hence.</l>
<l>The author of his dooing so may well bee his defence.       </l>
<l>Now Ajax should have letted this, and calld them backe ageine</l>
<l>To sacke the towne of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. He should have fought with myght and maine.</l>
<l>Why did he not restreyne them when they ready were to go?</l>
<l>Why tooke he not his swoord in hand? why gave he not as tho</l>
<l>Sum counsell for the fleeting folk to follow at the brunt?  </l>
<l>In fayth it had a tryfle beene to him that ay is woont</l>
<l>Such vaunting in his mouth to have. But he himself did fly</l>
<l>As well as others. I did see, and was ashamed, I,</l>
<l>To see thee when thou fledst, and didst prepare so cowardly</l>
<l>To sayle away. And thereuppon I thus aloud did cry:         </l>
<l>What meene yee, sirs? what madnesse dooth you move to go to shippe</l>
<l>And suffer <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> as good as tane, thus out of hand to slippe?</l>
<l>What else this tenth yeere beare yee home than shame? with such like woord</l>
<l>And other, (which the eloquence of sorrowe did avoord,)</l>
<l>I brought them from theyr flying shippes. Then Agamemnon calld  </l>
<l>Toogither all the capteines who with feare were yit appalld.</l>
<l>But Ajax durst not then once creake. Yit durst Thersites bee</l>
<l>So bold as rayle uppon the kings, and he was payd by mee</l>
<l>For playing so the sawcye Jacke. Then stood I on my toes</l>
<l>And to my fearefull countrymen gave hart ageinst theyr foes. </l>
<l>And shed new courage in theyr mynds through talk that fro mee goes.</l>
<l>From that tyme foorth what ever thing hath valeantly atcheeved</l>

<l>And now to touche thee: which of all the Greekes commendeth thee?</l>
<l>Or seeketh thee? But Diomed communicates with mee </l>
<l>His dooings, and alloweth mee, and thinkes him well apayd</l>
<l>To have Ulysses ever as companion at the brayd.</l>
<l>And sumwhat woorth you will it graunt (I trow) alone for mee</l>
<l>Out of so many thousand Greekes by Diomed pikt to bee.</l>
<l>No lot compelled mee to go, and yit I setting lyght </l>
<l>As well the perrill of my foes as daunger of the nyght,</l>

<l>Uppon his fellowes. Woundlesse is his body and unrent.</l>
<l>But what skills that, as long as he is able for to vaunt</l>
<l>He fought against bothe <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and Jove to save our fleete? I graunt</l>
<l>He did so. For I am not of such nature as of spyght</l>
<l>Well dooings to deface: so that he chalendge not the ryght </l>
<l>Of all men to himself alone, and that he yeeld to mee</l>
<l>Sum share, whoo of the honour looke a partener for to bee.</l>
<l>Patroclus also having on Achilles armour, sent</l>
<l>The Trojans and theyr leader hence, to burne our navye bent.</l>
<l>And yit thinks hee that none durst meete with Hector saving hee,  </l>
<l>Forgetting bothe the king, and eeke his brother, yea and mee.</l>
<l>Where hee himself was but the nyneth, appoynted by the king,</l>
<l>And by the fortune of his lot preferd to doo the thing.</l>
<l>But now for all your valeantnesse, what Issue had I pray</l>
<l>Your combate? Shall I tell? Forsoothe, that Hector went his way    </l>
<l>And had no harme. Now wo is mee how greeveth it my hart</l>
<l>To think uppon that season when the bulwark of our part</l>
<l>Achilles dyde. When neyther teares, nor greef, nor feare could make</l>
<l>Mee for to stay, but that uppon theis shoulders I did take,</l>
<l>I say uppon theis shoulders I Achilles body tooke,         </l>
<l>And this same armour claspt theron, which now to weare I looke.</l>
<l>Sufficient strength I have to beare as great a weyght as this,</l>
<l>And eeke a hart wherein regard of honour rooted is.</l>
<l>Think you that Thetis for her sonne so instantly besought</l>
<l>Sir Vulcane this same heavenly gift to give her, which is wrought   </l>
<l>With such exceeding cunning, to th'entent a souldier that</l>
<l>Hath neyther wit nor knowledge should it weare? He knowes not what</l>
<l>The things ingraven on the sheeld doo meene. Of Ocean se,</l>
<l>Of land, of heaven, and of the starres no skill at all hath he.</l>
<l>The Beare that never dyves in sea he dooth not understand,  </l>
<l>The Pleyads, nor the Hyads, nor the cities that doo stand</l>
<l>Uppon the earth, nor yit the swoord that Orion holdes in hand.</l>
<l>He seekes to have an armour of the which he hath no skill.</l>
<l>And yit in fynding fault with mee bycause I had no will</l>
<l>To follow this same paynfull warre and sought to shonne the same,  </l>
<l>And made it sumwhat longer tyme before I thither came,</l>
<l>He sees not how hee speakes reproch to stout Achilles name.</l>
<l>For if to have dissembled in this case, yee count a cryme,</l>
<l>Wee both offenders bee. Or if protracting of the tyme</l>
<l>Yee count blame woorthye, yit was I the tymelyer of us twayne.  </l>
<l>Achilles loving moother him, my wyfe did mee deteyne.</l>
<l>The former tyme was given to them, the rest was given to yow.</l>
<l>And therefore doo I little passe although I could not now</l>
<l>Defend my fault, sith such a man of prowesse, birth and fame</l>
<l>As was Achilles, was with mee offender in the same.         </l>
<l>But yit was he espyed by Ulysses wit, but nat</l>
<l>Ulysses by sir Ajax wit. And lest yee woonder at</l>
<l>The rayling of this foolish dolt at mee, hee dooth object</l>
<l>Reproche to you. For if that I offended to detect</l>
<l>Sir Palamed of forged fault, could you without your shame   </l>
<l>Arreyne him, and condemne him eeke to suffer for the same?</l>
<l>But neyther could sir Palamed excuse him of the cryme</l>
<l>So heynous and so manifest: and you your selves that tyme</l>
<l>Not onely his indytement heard, but also did behold</l>
<l>His deed avowched to his face by bringing in the gold.

<l>You all consented therunto. Yit doo I not denye,</l>

<l>But let sir Ajax rather go. For he with eloquence</l>
<l>Or by some suttle pollycie, shall bring the man fro thence</l>
<l>And pacyfie him raging through disease, and wrathfull ire.</l>
<l>Nay, first the river Simois shall to his spring retyre,</l>

<l>Or as I did the Oracles and Trojane fates disclose,</l>

<l>That <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> should never taken bee by any force, untill</l>

<l>Sir Ajax? Where the stately woordes of such a hardy wyght?</l>
<l>Why feareth hee? Why dares Ulysses ventring through the watch</l>

<l>And through the pykes not only for to passe the garded wall</l>
<l>But also for to enter to the strongest towre of all</l>

<l>That nyght subdewed I <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> towne. That nyght did I it win,</l>

<l>And thou thy selfe when for our shippes thou diddest in reskew stand,</l>

<l>I had but only one with mee. Whoo (if he had not thought</l>
<l>A wyseman better than a strong, and that preferment ought</l>
<l>Not alway followe force of hand) would now himself have sought  </l>
<l>This Armour. So would toother Ajax better stayed doo,</l>
<l>And feerce Ewrypyle, and the sonne of hault Andremon too.</l>
<l>No lesse myght eeke Idominey, and eeke Meriones,</l>

<l>Bestowe it on this same. With that he shewed with his hand</l>
<l>Minervas fatall image, which hard by in syght did stand.</l>
<l>The Lords were moved with his woordes, and then appeared playne</l>
<l>The force that is in eloquence. The lerned man did gayne</l>
<l>The armour of the valeant. He that did so oft susteine      </l>
<l>Alone both fyre, and swoord, and Jove, and Hector could not byde</l>
<l>One brunt of wrath. And whom no force could vanquish ere that tyde,</l>
<l>Now only anguish overcommes. He drawes his swoord and sayes:</l>
<l>Well: this is myne yit. Unto this no clayme Ulysses layes.</l>
<l>This must I use ageinst myself: this blade that heretofore   </l>
<l>Hath bathed beene in Trojane blood, must now his mayster gore</l>
<l>That none may Ajax overcome save Ajax. With that woord</l>
<l>Into his brest (not wounded erst) he thrust his deathfull swoord.</l>
<l>His hand to pull it out ageine unable was. The blood</l>
<l>Did spout it out. Anon the ground bestayned where he stood,  </l>
<l>Did breede the pretye purple flowre uppon a clowre of greene,</l>
<l>Which of the wound of Hyacinth had erst engendred beene.</l>
<l>The selfsame letters eeke that for the chyld were written than,</l>

<l>Enforcing all her witts to fynd some kynd of ponnishment.   </l>
<l>And as a <placeName key="tgn,7008772">Lyon</placeName> robbed of her whelpes becommeth wood,</l>
<l>And taking on the footing of her emnye where hee stood,</l>

<l>To shew to him a masse of gold (so made shee her pretence)</l>
<l>Which for her lyttle Polydore was hid not farre from thence.</l>
<l>The Thracian king beleeving her, as eager of the pray,</l>

<l>Make speede I prey thee, Hecuba, and give thy sonne this gold.</l>
<l>I sweare by God it shall bee his, as well that I doo hold</l>

<l>Streyght calling out for succor to the wyves of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> at hand</l>
<l>Did in the traytors face bestowe her nayles, and scratched out</l>

<l>Shee thrust her fingars in as farre as could bee, and did bore  </l>
<l>Not now his eyes (for why his eyes were pulled out before)</l>
<l>But bothe the places of the eyes berayd with wicked blood.</l>
<l>The Thracians at theyr Tyrannes harme for anger wexing wood,</l>
<l>Began to scare the Trojane wyves with darts and stones. Anon</l>
<l>Queene Hecub ronning at a stone, with gnarring seazd theron,  </l>
<l>And wirryed it beetweene her teeth. And as shee opte her chappe</l>
<l>To speake, in stead of speeche shee barkt. The place of this missehappe</l>
<l>Remayneth still, and of the thing there done beares yit the name.</l>
<l>Long myndfull of her former illes, shee sadly for the same</l>
<l>Went howling in the feeldes of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>. Her fortune moved not </l>
<l>Her Trojans only, but the Greekes her foes to ruthe: her lot</l>
<l>Did move even all the Goddes to ruthe: and so effectually,</l>
<l>That Hecub to deserve such end even Juno did denye.

<l>Without the towne were funeralls a dooing for the dead,</l>

<l>The Trojans also gave to him as costly giftes agen.</l>
<l>Bycause he was Apollos preest they gave to him as then    </l>

<l>And when that I did fynd them I did take them up, and say</l>

<l>Now put thou up thy fayre bryght head, good Galat, I thee pray,</l>
<l>Above the greenish waves: now come my Galat, come away.       </l>
<l>And of my present take no scorne. I know my selfe to bee</l>

<l>Myne image in the water sheere, and sure mee thought I tooke</l>
<l>Delyght to see my goodly shape, and favor in the brooke.</l>
<l>Behold how big I am: not Jove in heaven (for so you men      </l>
<l>Report one Jove to reigne, of whom I passe not for to ken)</l>
<l>Is huger than this doughty corce of myne. A bush of heare</l>
<l>Dooth overdreepe my visage grim, and shadowes as it were</l>
<l>A grove uppon my shoulders twayne. And think it not to bee</l>
<l>A shame for that with bristled heare my body rough yee see.   </l>
<l>A fowle ilfavored syght it is to see a leavelesse tree.</l>
<l>A lothely thing it is, a horse without a mane to keepe.</l>
<l>As fethers doo become the birdes, and wooll becommeth sheepe,</l>
<l>Even so a beard and bristled skin becommeth also men.</l>
<l>I have but one eye, which dooth stand amid my frunt. What then?</l>
<l>This one round eye of myne is lyke a myghty target. Why?</l>
<l>Vewes not the Sun all things from heaven? Yit but one only eye</l>

<l>Him will I make thy fathrinlaw. Have mercy I thee pray,</l>

<l>Of thee, O Nerye. Thyne ill will is greevouser to beare</l>

<l>With which his shoulders and his backe all wholly covered were,</l>
<l>Shee saw his neather parts were like a fish with tayle wrythde round</l>
<l>Who leaning to the neerest Rocke, sayd thus with lowd cleere sound:</l>
<l>Fayre mayd, I neyther monster am nor cruell savage beast:</l>
<l>But of the sea a God, whoose powre and favour is not least.   </l>
<l>For neyther Protew in the sea nor Triton have more myght</l>

<l>Yit once I was a mortall man. But you must know that I</l>
<l>Was given to seawoorkes, and in them mee only did apply.</l>
<l>For sumtyme I did draw the drag in which the fishes were,  </l>
<l>And sumtyme sitting on the cliffes I angled heere and there.</l>
<l>There butteth on a fayre greene mede a bank wherof t'one half</l>

<l>The busye Bee did never there of flowres sweet smelling speede.  </l>
<l>No gladsum garlonds ever there were gathered for the head.</l>
<l>No hand those flowers ever yit with hooked sythe did shred.</l>
<l>I was the first that ever set my foote uppon that plot.</l>
<l>Now as I dryde my dropping netts, and layd abrode my lotte,</l>

<l>Or through theyr owne too lyght beeleefe on bayted hooke beene hent:</l>

<l>As soone as that my pray had towcht the grasse, it by and by</l>
<l>Began to move, and flask theyr finnes, and swim uppon the drye,</l>

<l>My draught of fishes everychone to seaward tooke theyr flyght,</l>
<l>And leaping from the shore, forsooke theyr newfound mayster quyght.</l>
<l>I was amazed at the thing: and standing long in dowt,</l>

<l>Or else sum jewce of herb. And as I so did musing stand,    </l>
<l>What herb (quoth I) hath such a powre? And gathering with my hand</l>

<l>A love of other nature in my brest with violence came.      </l>
<l>And long I could it not resist, but sayd: Deere land, adeew,</l>

<l>To overcome mee with his gifts: Thou mayd of Cumes (quoth he)</l>
<l>Choose what thou wilt, and of thy wish the owner thou shalt bee.</l>
<l>I taking full my hand of dust, and shewing it him there,</l>
<l>Desyred like a foole to live as many yeeres as were</l>
<l>Small graynes of cinder in that heape. I quight forgot to crave</l>
<l>Immediately, the race of all those yeeres in youth to have.</l>
<l>Yit did he graunt mee also that, uppon condicion I         </l>
<l>Would let him have my maydenhod, which thing I did denye.</l>
<l>And so rejecting Phebus gift a single lyfe I led.</l>
<l>But now the blessefull tyme of youth is altogither fled,</l>
<l>And irksome age with trembling pace is stolne uppon my head,</l>
<l>Which long I must endure. For now already as you see      </l>
<l>Seven hundred yeares are come and gone and that the number bee</l>
<l>Full matched of the granes of dust, three hundred harvestes mo,</l>
<l>I must three hundred vintages see more before I go.</l>
<l>The day will come that length of tyme shall make my body small,</l>
<l>And little of my withered limbes shall leave or naught at all.</l>
<l>And none shall think that ever God was tane in love with mee.</l>
<l>Even out of Phebus knowledge then perchaunce I growen shall bee,</l>
<l>Or at the least that ever he mee lovde he shall denye,</l>
<l>So sore I shall be altered. And then shall no mannes eye</l>
<l>Discerne mee. Only by my voyce I shall bee knowen. For why  </l>
<l>The fates shall leave mee still my voyce for folke to know mee by.

<l>As Sybill in the vaulted way such talk as this did frame,</l>
<l>The Trojane knyght Aenaeas up at Cumes fro Limbo came.</l>
<l>And having doone the sacrifyse accustomd for the same,</l>
<l>He tooke his journey to the coast which had not yit the name</l>

<l>Of wyse Ulysses, Macare of Neritus, whoo late</l>

<l>He spying Achemenides (whom late ago afrayd</l>
<l>They had among mount Aetnas Cliffs abandond when they fled  </l>
<l>From Polypheme): and woondring for to see he was not dead,</l>
<l>Sayd thus: O Achemenides, what chaunce, or rather what</l>
<l>Good God hathe savde the lyfe of thee? What is the reason that</l>
<l>A barbrous shippe beares thee a Greeke? Or whither saylest thou?</l>
<l>To him thus, Achemenides, his owne man freely now       </l>
<l>And not forgrowen as one forlorne, nor clad in bristled hyde,</l>
<l>Made answer: Yit ageine I would I should in perrill byde</l>
<l>Of Polypheme, and that I myght those chappes of his behold</l>
<l>Beesmeared with the blood of men, but if that I doo hold</l>
<l>This shippe more deere than all the Realme of wyse Ulysses, or</l>
<l>If lesser of Aenaeas I doo make account than for</l>
<l>My father, neyther (though I did as much as doone myght bee,)</l>
<l>I could ynough bee thankfull for his goodnesse towards mee.</l>
<l>That I still speake and breathe, that I the Sun and heaven doo see,</l>
<l>Is his gift. Can I thanklesse then or myndlesse of him bee,  </l>
<l>That downe the round eyed gyants throte this soule of myne went not?</l>
<l>And that from hencefoorth when to dye it ever be my lot</l>
<l>I may be layd in grave, or sure not in the Gyants mawe?</l>
<l>What hart had I that tyme (at least if feare did not withdrawe</l>
<l>Both hart and sence) when left behynd, you taking shippe I sawe?  </l>
<l>I would have called after you but that I was afrayd</l>
<l>By making outcrye to my fo myself to have beewrayd.</l>
<l>For even the noyse that you did make did put Ulysses shippe</l>
<l>In daunger. I did see him from a cragged mountaine strippe</l>
<l>A myghty rocke, and into sea it throwe midway and more. </l>
<l>Ageine I sawe his giants pawe throwe huge big stones great store</l>
<l>As if it were a sling. And sore I feared lest your shippe</l>
<l>Should drowned by the water bee that from the stones did skippe,</l>
<l>Or by the stones themselves, as if my self had beene therin.</l>
<l>But when that flyght had saved you from death, he did begin  </l>
<l>On <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName> syghing up and downe to walke: and with his pawes</l>
<l>Went groping of the trees among the woodes. And forbycause</l>
<l>He could not see, he knockt his shinnes ageinst the rocks eche where.</l>
<l>And stretching out his grisly armes (which all beegrymed were</l>
<l>With baken blood) to seaward, he the Greekish nation band,  </l>
<l>And sayd: O if that sum good chaunce myght bring unto my hand</l>
<l>Ulysses or sum mate of his, on whom to wreake myne ire,</l>
<l>Uppon whose bowells with my teeth I like a Hawke myght tyre:</l>
<l>Whose living members myght with theis my talants teared beene:</l>
<l>Whoose blood myght bubble down my throte: whose flesh myght pant between  </l>
<l>My jawes: how lyght or none at all this losing of myne eye</l>
<l>Would seeme. Theis woordes and many mo the cruell feend did cry.</l>
<l>A shuddring horror perced mee to see his smudged face,</l>
<l>And cruell handes, and in his frunt the fowle round eyelesse place,</l>
<l>And monstrous members, and his beard beslowbered with the blood </l>
<l>Of man. Before myne eyes then death the smallest sorrow stood.</l>
<l>I loked every minute to bee seased in his pawe.</l>
<l>I looked ever when he should have cramd mee in his mawe.</l>
<l>And in my mynd I of that tyme mee thought the image sawe</l>

<l>I trembling like an aspen leaf stood sad and bloodlesse quyght.    </l>
<l>And in beholding how he fed and belked up againe</l>
<l>His bloody vittells at his mouth, and uttred out amayne</l>
<l>The clottred gobbets mixt with wyne, I thus surmysde: Like lot</l>
<l>Hangs over my head now, and I must also go to pot.</l>
<l>And hyding mee for many dayes, and quaking horribly         </l>
<l>At every noyse, and dreading death, and wisshing for to dye,</l>
<l>Appeasing hunger with the leaves of trees, and herbes and mast,</l>
<l>Alone, and poore, and footelesse, and to death and pennance cast,</l>
<l>A long tyme after I espyde this shippe afarre at last,</l>
<l>And ronning downeward to the sea by signes did succour seeke.   </l>
<l>Where fynding grace, this Trojane shippe receyved mee, a Greeke.</l>
<l>But now I prey thee, gentle freend, declare thou unto mee</l>

<l>Anon did Damzells welcome us and led us through the hall</l>
<l>(The which was made of marble stone, floore, arches, roof, and wall)</l>
<l>To Circe. Shee sate underneathe a traverse in a chayre      </l>
<l>Aloft ryght rich and stately, in a chamber large and fayre.</l>
<l>Shee ware a goodly longtreynd gowne: and all her rest attyre</l>
<l>Was every whit of goldsmithes woork. There sate mee also by her</l>
<l>The Sea nymphes and her Ladyes whoose fyne fingers never knew</l>
<l>What toozing wooll did meene, nor threede from whorled spindle drew. </l>
<l>They sorted herbes, and picking out the flowers that were mixt,</l>
<l>Did put them into mawnds, and with indifferent space betwixt</l>
<l>Did lay the leaves and stalks on heapes according to theyr hew,</l>
<l>And shee herself the woork of them did oversee and vew.</l>
<l>The vertue and the use of them ryght perfectly shee knew,   </l>
<l>And in what leaf it lay, and which in mixture would agree.</l>
<l>And so perusing every herb by good advysement, shee</l>
<l>Did wey them out. Assoone as shee us entring in did see,</l>
<l>And greeting had bothe given and tane, shee looked cheerefully,</l>
<l>And graunting all that we desyrde, commaunded by and by     </l>

<l>Our highest heare tippes with her wand, (it is a shame, but yit</l>

<l>And could not make complaint with woordes. In stead of speech I there</l>
<l>Did make a rawghtish grunting, and with groveling face gan beare  </l>
<l>My visage downeward to the ground. I felt a hooked groyne</l>
<l>To wexen hard uppon my mouth, and brawned neck to joyne</l>
<l>My head and shoulders. And the handes with which I late ago</l>

<l>The peaceprocurer Mercurie had given to him a whyght</l>
<l>Fayre flowre whoose roote is black, and of the Goddes it Moly hyght</l>
<l>Assurde by this and heavenly hestes, he entred Circes bowre.</l>
<l>And beeing bidden for to drink the cup of baleful powre,       </l>
<l>As Circe was about to stroke her wand uppon his heare,</l>
<l>He thrust her backe, and put her with his naked swoord in feare.</l>
<l>Then fell they to agreement streyght, and fayth in hand was plyght.</l>
<l>And beeing made her bedfellowe, he claymed as in ryght</l>
<l>Of dowrye, for to have his men ageine in perfect plyght.       </l>
<l>Shee sprincled us with better jewce of uncowth herbes, and strake</l>
<l>The awk end of her charmed rod uppon our heades, and spake</l>
<l>Woordes to the former contrarie. The more shee charmd, the more</l>
<l>Arose wee upward from the ground on which wee daarde before.</l>
<l>Our bristles fell away, the clift our cloven clees forsooke.   </l>
<l>Our shoulders did returne agein: and next our elbowes tooke</l>
<l>Our armes and handes theyr former place. Then weeping wee enbrace</l>
<l>Our Lord, and hing about his necke whoo also wept apace.</l>
<l>And not a woord wee rather spake than such as myght appeere</l>
<l>From harts most thankfull to proceede. Wee taryed theyr a yeere.  </l>
<l>I in that whyle sawe many things, and many things did heere.</l>
<l>I marked also this one thing with store of other geere</l>
<l>Which one of Circes fowre cheef maydes (whoose office was alway</l>
<l>Uppon such hallowes to attend) did secretly bewray</l>

<l>This mayd a yoongmannes image sheawd of fayre whyght marble stone</l>
<l>Within a Chauncell. On the head therof were garlonds store</l>
<l>And eeke a woodspecke. And as I demaunded her wherfore</l>
<l>And whoo it was they honord so in holy Church, and why</l>
<l>He bare that bird uppon his head: shee answeering by and by  </l>

<l>He was of feature as yee see. And by this image heere     </l>
<l>The verry beawtye of the man dooth lyvelely appeere.</l>
<l>His courage matcht his personage. And scarcely had he well</l>

<l>Among the Latian hilles. The nymphes of fountaines and of brookes,</l>
<l>As those that haunted <placeName key="tgn,1121086">Albula</placeName> were ravisht with his lookes  </l>
<l>And so were they that Numicke beares, and Anio too, and <placeName key="tgn,1038155">Alme</placeName></l>
<l>That ronneth short, and heady Nar, and Farfar coole and calme.</l>
<l>And all the nymphes that usde to haunt Dianas shadye poole,</l>

<l>But he disdeyning all the rest did set his love uppon      </l>
<l>A lady whom Venilia bare (so fame reporteth) on</l>
<l>The stately mountayne <placeName key="tgn,3000935">Palatine</placeName> by Janus that dooth beare</l>
<l>The dowble face. Assoone as that her yeeres for maryage were</l>
<l>Thought able, shee preferring him before all other men,</l>
<l>Was wedded to this Picus whoo was king of Lawrents then.   </l>
<l>Shee was in beawtve excellent, but yit in singing, much</l>
<l>More excellent: and theruppon they naamd her Singer. Such</l>
<l>The sweetenesse of her musicke was, that shee therwith delyghts</l>
<l>The savage beastes, and caused birdes to cease theyr wandring flyghts,</l>
<l>And moved stones and trees, and made the ronning streames to stay. </l>
<l>Now whyle that shee in womans tune recordes her pleasant lay</l>
<l>At home, her husband rode abrode uppon a lustye horse</l>
<l>To hunt the Boare, and bare in hand twoo hunting staves of force.</l>
<l>His cloke was crymzen butned with a golden button fast.</l>
<l>Into the selfsame forest eeke was Phebus daughter past    </l>
<l>From those same feeldes that of herself the name of Circe beare,</l>
<l>To gather uncowth herbes among the fruteful hillocks there.</l>
<l>As soone as lurking in the shrubbes shee did the king espye,</l>
<l>Shee was astrawght. Downe fell her herbes to ground. And by and by</l>
<l>Through all her bones the flame of love the maree gan to frye.  </l>
<l>And when shee from this forced heate had cald her witts agen,</l>
<l>Shee purposde to bewray her mynd. But unto him as then</l>
<l>Shee could not come for swiftnesse of his horse and for his men</l>
<l>That garded him on every syde. Yit shalt thou not (quoth shee)</l>
<l>So shift thee fro my handes although the wynd should carrye thee,  </l>
<l>If I doo knowe myself, if all the strength of herbes fayle not,</l>
<l>Or if I have not quyght and cleene my charmes and spelles forgotte.</l>
<l>In saying theis same wordes, shee made the likenesse of a Boare</l>
<l>Without a body, causing it to swiftly passe before</l>
<l>King Picus eyes, and for to seeme to get him to the woode,  </l>
<l>Where for the thickenesse of the trees a horse myght do no good.</l>
<l>Immediatly the king unwares a hote pursute did make</l>
<l>Uppon the shadowe of his pray, and quikly did forsake</l>
<l>His foming horses sweating backe: and following vayne wan hope,</l>
<l>Did runne afoote among the woodes, and through the bushes crope. </l>
<l>Then Circe fell a mumbling spelles, and praying like a witch</l>
<l>Did honour straunge and uncowth Goddes with uncowth charmes, by which</l>
<l>Shee usde to make the moone looke dark, and wrappe her fathers head</l>
<l>In watry clowdes. And then likewyse the heaven was overspred</l>
<l>With darknesse, and a foggye mist steamd upward from the ground. </l>
<l>And nere a man about the king to gard him could bee found,</l>
<l>But every man in blynd bywayes ran scattring in the chace,</l>
<l>Through her inchauntments. At the length shee getting tyme and place,</l>
<l>Sayd: By those lyghtsum eyes of thyne which late have ravisht myne,</l>
<l>And by that goodly personage and lovely face of thyne,    </l>
<l>The which compelleth mee that am a Goddesse to enclyne</l>
<l>To make this humble sute to thee that art a mortall wyght,</l>
<l>Asswage my flame, and make this sonne (whoo by his heavenly syght</l>
<l>Foresees all things) thy fathrinlawe: and hardly hold not scorne</l>
<l>Of Circe whoo by long discent of Titans stocke am borne.   </l>
<l>Thus much sayd Circe. He ryght feerce rejecting her request,</l>
<l>And her, sayd: Whooso ere thou art, go set thy hart at rest.</l>
<l>I am not thyne, nor will not bee. Another holdes my hart:</l>
<l>And long God graunt shee may it hold, that I may never start</l>
<l>To leawdnesse of a forreigne lust from bond of lawfull bed,  </l>
<l>As long as Janus daughter, my sweete Singer, is not dead.</l>
<l>Dame Circe having oft renewd her sute in vayne beefore,</l>
<l>Sayd: Dearely shalt thou bye thy scorne. For never shalt thou more</l>
<l>Returne to Singer. Thou shalt lerne by proof what one can doo</l>
<l>That is provoked, and in love, yea and a woman too.</l>
<l>But Circe is bothe stird to wrath, and also tane in love,</l>
<l>Yea and a woman. Twyce her face to westward she did move,</l>
<l>And twyce to Eastward. Thryce shee layd her rod uppon his head.</l>
<l>And therwithall three charmes shee cast. Away king Picus fled.</l>
<l>And woondring that he fled more swift than earst he had beene woont, </l>
<l>He saw the fethers on his skin, and at the sodein brunt</l>
<l>Became a bird that haunts the wooddes. Wherat he taking spyght,</l>
<l>With angrye bill did job uppon hard Okes with all his myght,</l>
<l>And in his moode made hollowe holes uppon theyr boughes. The hew</l>
<l>Of Crimzen which was in his cloke, uppon his fethers grew.  </l>
<l>The gold that was a clasp and did his cloke toogither hold,</l>
<l>Is fethers, and about his necke goes circlewyse like gold.</l>
<l>His servants luring in that whyle oft over all the ground</l>
<l>In vayne, and fynding no where of theyr kyng no inkling, found</l>
<l>Dame Circe. (For by that tyme shee had made the ayer sheere, </l>
<l>And suffred both the sonne and wyndes the mistye steames to cleere)</l>
<l>And charging her with matter trew, demaunded for theyr kyng,</l>
<l>And offring force, began theyr darts and Javelings for to fling.</l>
<l>Shee sprincling noysom venim streyght and jewce of poysoning myght,</l>
<l>Did call togither Eribus and Chaos, and the nyght,          </l>
<l>And all the feendes of darknesse, and with howling out along</l>
<l>Made prayers unto Hecate. Scarce ended was her song,</l>
<l>But that (a woondrous thing to tell) the woodes lept from theyr place.</l>
<l>The ground did grone: the trees neere hand lookt pale in all the chace:</l>
<l>The grasse besprent with droppes of blood lookt red: the stones did seem   </l>
<l>To roare and bellow horce: and doggs to howle and raze extreeme:</l>
<l>And all the ground to crawle with snakes blacke scaalde: and gastly spryghts</l>
<l>Fly whisking up and downe. The folke were flayghted at theis syghts.</l>
<l>And as they woondring stood amaazd, shee strokte her witching wand</l>
<l>Uppon theyr faces. At the touche wherof, there out of hand  </l>
<l>Came woondrous shapes of savage beastes uppon them all. Not one</l>
<l>Reteyned still his native shape. The setting sonne was gone</l>
<l>Beyond the utmost coast of Spaine, and Singer longd in vayne</l>
<l>To see her husband. Bothe her folke and people ran agayne</l>
<l>Through all the woodes. And ever as they went, they sent theyr eyes </l>
<l>Before them for to fynd him out, but no man him espyes.</l>
<l>Then Singer thought it not ynough to weepe and teare her heare,</l>
<l>And beat herself (all which shee did). Shee gate abrode, and there</l>
<l>Raundgd over all the broade wyld feelds like one besyds her witts.</l>
<l>Six nyghts and full as many dayes (as fortune led by fitts)  </l>
<l>She strayd mee over hilles and dales, and never tasted rest,</l>
<l>Nor meate, nor drink of all the whyle. The seventh day, sore opprest</l>
<l>And tyred bothe with travell and with sorrowe, downe shee sate</l>
<l>Uppon cold Tybers bank, and there with teares in moorning rate</l>
<l>Shee warbling on her greef in tune not shirle nor over hye,  </l>

<l>This was the end of Macars tale. And ere long tyme was gone,</l>

<l>And making to the thickgrowen groves where through the yellow dust</l>
<l>The shady Tyber into sea his gusshing streame dooth thrust,</l>
<l>Aenaeas got the Realme of king Latinus, Fawnus sonne,</l>
<l>And eeke his daughter, whom in feyght by force of armes he wonne. </l>
<l>He enterprysed warre ageinst a Nation feerce and strong.</l>
<l>And Turne was wrothe for holding of his wyfe away by wrong.</l>
<l>Ageinst the Shyre of <placeName key="tgn,7003080">Latium</placeName> met all Tyrrhene, and long</l>
<l>With busye care hawlt victorie by force of armes was sought.</l>
<l>Eche partie to augment theyr force by forreine succour wrought.   </l>
<l>And many sent the Rutills help, and many came to ayd</l>
<l>The Trojanes: neyther was the good Aenaeas ill apayd</l>
<l>Of going to Evanders towne. But Venulus in vayne</l>
<l>To outcast Diomeds citie went his succour to obteine.</l>
<l>This Diomed under Dawnus, king of Calabrye, did found    </l>
<l>A myghtye towne, and with his wyfe in dowrye hild the ground.</l>
<l>Now when from Turnus, Venulus his message had declaard,</l>
<l>Desyring help: th'Aetolian knyght sayd none could well bee spaard.</l>
<l>And in excuce, he told him how he neyther durst be bold</l>
<l>To prest his fathers folk to warre of whom he had no hold,  </l>
<l>Nor any of his countrymen had left as then alyve</l>
<l>To arme. And lest yee think (quoth hee) I doo a shift contryve,</l>

<l>I will abyde to make a new rehersall. After that</l>
<l>The Greekes had burned <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and on the ground had layd it flat,  </l>
<l>And that the Prince of Narix by his ravishing the mayd</l>
<l>In Pallas temple, on us all the pennance had displayd</l>
<l>Which he himself deservd alone: then scattred heere and there</l>
<l>And harryed over all the seas, wee Greekes were fayne to beare</l>
<l>Nyght, thunder, tempest, wrath of heaven and sea, and last of all   </l>
<l>Sore shipwrecke at mount Capharey to mend our harmes withall.</l>
<l>And lest that mee to make too long a processe yee myght deeme</l>

<l>Ryght rewfull even to Priamus. Howbee't Minerva, shee</l>
<l>That weareth armour, tooke mee from the waves and saved mee.   </l>
<l>But from my fathers Realme ageine by violence I was driven.</l>
<l>For Venus bearing still in mynd the wound I had her given</l>
<l>Long tyme before, did woork revendge. By meanes wherof such toyle</l>
<l>Did tosse mee on the sea, and on the land I found such broyle</l>
<l>By warres, that in my hart I thought them blist of God whom erst   </l>
<l>The violence of the raging sea and hideous wynds had perst,</l>
<l>And whom the wrathfull Capharey by shipwrecke did confound:</l>
<l>Oft wisshing also I had there among the rest beene drownd.</l>
<l>My company now having felt the woorst that sea or warre</l>
<l>Could woorke, did faynt, and wisht an end of straying out so farre.  </l>
<l>But Agmon hot of nature and too feerce through slaughters made</l>
<l>Sayd: What remayneth, sirs, through which our pacience cannot wade?</l>
<l>What further spyght hath Venus yit to woork ageinst us more?</l>
<l>When woorse misfortunes may be feard than have beene felt before,</l>
<l>Then prayer may advauntadge men, and vowwing may then boote. </l>
<l>But when the woorst is past of things, then feare is under foote.</l>
<l>And when that bale is hyghest growne, then boote must next ensew.</l>
<l>Although shee heere mee, and doo hate us all (which thing is trew)</l>
<l>That serve heere under Diomed: Yit set wee lyght her hate.</l>
<l>And deerely it should stand us on to purchase hygh estate.       </l>
<l>With such stowt woordes did Agmon stirre dame Venus unto ire</l>
<l>And raysd ageine her settled grudge. Not many had desyre</l>
<l>To heere him talk thus out of square. The moste of us that are</l>
<l>His freendes rebukte him for his woordes. And as he did prepare</l>
<l>To answere, bothe his voyce and throte by which his voyce should go, </l>
<l>Were small: his heare to feathers turnd: his necke was clad as tho</l>
<l>With feathers: so was brist and backe. The greater fethers stacke</l>
<l>Uppon his armes: and into wings his elbowes bowwed backe.</l>
<l>The greatest portion of his feete was turned into toes.</l>
<l>A hardened bill of horne did growe uppon his mouth and noze,     </l>
<l>And sharpened at the neather end. His fellowes, Lycus, Ide,</l>
<l>Rethenor, Nyct, and Abas all stood woondring by his syde.</l>
<l>And as they woondred, they receyvd the selfsame shape and hew.</l>
<l>And finally the greater part of all my band up flew,</l>
<l>And clapping with theyr newmade wings, about the ores did gird.  </l>
<l>And if yee doo demaund the shape of this same dowtfull bird,</l>
<l>Even as they bee not verry Swannnes: so drawe they verry neere</l>

<l>But afterward recovering hart and hardynesse they durst</l>
<l>Despyse him when he chaced them, and with theyr nimble feete</l>
<l>Continewed on theyr dawncing still in tyme and measure meete.   </l>
<l>The shepeherd fownd mee fault with them: and with his lowtlike leapes</l>
<l>Did counterfette theyr minyon dawnce, and rapped out by heapes</l>
<l>A rabble of unsavery taunts even like a country cloyne,</l>
<l>To which, most leawd and filthy termes of purpose he did joyne.</l>
<l>And after he had once begon, he could not hold his toong,  </l>

<l>For now he is a tree, and by his jewce discerne yee may</l>

<l>A storme of rayne and skipping hayle, and soodeyne with the same</l>
<l>The sonnes of Astrey meeting feerce and feyghting verry sore,    </l>
<l>Did trouble bothe the sea and ayre and set them on a rore.</l>
<l>Dame Cybel using one of them to serve her turne that tyde,</l>

<l>He hanged on her postes. Oft tymes his tender sydes he layd  </l>
<l>Ageinst the threshold hard, and oft in sadnesse did upbrayd</l>
<l>The locke with much ungentlenesse. The Lady crueller</l>
<l>Than are the rysing narrowe seas, or falling Kiddes, and farre</l>
<l>More hard than steele of Noricum, and than the stonny rocke</l>
<l>That in the quarrye hath his roote, did him despyse and mock.  </l>
<l>Besyde her dooings mercylesse, of statelynesse and spyght</l>

<l>Of verry hope. But Iphis now unable any more</l>
<l>To beare the torment of his greef, still standing there before</l>
<l>Her gate, spake theis his latest woordes: Well, Anaxarete,   </l>
<l>Thou hast the upper hand. Hencefoorth thou shalt not neede to bee</l>
<l>Agreeved any more with mee. Go tryumph hardely:</l>
<l>Go vaunt thy self with joy: go sing the song of victorye:</l>
<l>Go put a crowne of glittring bay uppon thy cruell head.</l>
<l>For why thou hast the upper hand, and I am gladly dead.       </l>
<l>Well, steely harted, well: rejoyce. Compeld yit shalt thou bee</l>
<l>Of sumwhat in mee for to have a lyking. Thou shalt see</l>
<l>A poynt wherein thou mayst mee deeme most thankfull unto thee,</l>
<l>And in the end thou shalt confesse the great desert of mee.</l>
<l>But yit remember that as long as lyfe in mee dooth last,     </l>
<l>The care of thee shall never from this hart of myne be cast.</l>
<l>For bothe the lyfe that I doo live in hope of thee, and tother</l>
<l>Which nature giveth, shall have end and passe away toogither.</l>
<l>The tydings neyther of my death shall come to thee by fame.</l>
<l>Myself (I doo assure thee) will bee bringer of the same.     </l>
<l>Myself (I say) will present bee that those same cruell eyen</l>
<l>Of thyne may feede themselves uppon this livelesse corce of myne.</l>
<l>But yit, O Goddes, (if you behold mennes deedes) remember mee.</l>
<l>(My toong will serve to pray no more) and cause that I may bee</l>
<l>Longtyme heerafter spoken of: and length the lyfe by fame    </l>
<l>The which yee have abridgd in yeeres. In saying of this same</l>
<l>He lifted up his watrye eyes and armes that wexed wan</l>
<l>To those same stulpes which oft he had with garlondes deckt ere than,</l>
<l>And fastning on the topps therof a halter thus did say:</l>
<l>Thou cruell and ungodly wyght, theis are the wreathes that may  </l>
<l>Most pleasure thee. And with that woord he thrusting in his head,</l>
<l>Even then did turne him towards her as good as being dead,</l>
<l>And wretchedly did totter on the poste with strangled throte.</l>
<l>The wicket which his feerefull feete in sprawling maynely smote,</l>
<l>Did make a noyse: and flying ope bewrayd his dooing playne.  </l>
<l>The servants shreekt, and lifting up his bodye, but in vayne,</l>
<l>Conveyd him to his moothers house, his father erst was slayne.</l>
<l>His moother layd him in her lappe, and cleeping in her armes</l>
<l>Her sonnes cold bodye, after that shee had bewayld her harmes</l>
<l>With woordes and dooings mootherlyke, the corce with moorning cheere </l>
<l>To buryall sadly through the towne was borne uppon a beere.</l>
<l>The house of Anaxarete by chaunce was neere the way</l>
<l>By which this piteous pomp did passe. And of the doolefull lay</l>
<l>The sound came to the eares of her, whom God alreadye gan</l>
<l>To strike. Yit let us see (quoth shee) the buryall of this man.  </l>
<l>And up the hygh wyde windowde house in saying so, shee ran.</l>
<l>Scarce had shee well on Iphis lookt that on the beere did lye,</l>
<l>But that her eyes wext stark: and from her limbes the blood gan flye.</l>
<l>In stead therof came palenesse in. And as shee backeward was</l>
<l>In mynd to go, her feete stacke fast and could not stirre. And as    </l>
<l>Shee would have cast her countnance backe, shee could not doo it. And</l>
<l>The stonny hardnesse which alate did in her stomacke stand,</l>
<l>Within a whyle did overgrow her whole from sole to crowne.</l>
<l>And lest you think this geere surmysde, even yit in Salamin towne</l>
<l>Of Lady Anaxarete the image standeth playne.                  </l>
<l>The temple also in the which the image dooth remayne,</l>
<l>Is unto Venus consecrate by name of Looker Out.</l>
<l>And therfore weying well theis things, I prey thee looke about</l>
<l>Good Lady, and away with pryde: and be content to frame</l>
<l>Thy self to him that loveth thee and cannot quench his flame.  </l>
<l>So neyther may the Lentons cold thy budding frutetrees kill</l>
<l>Nor yit the sharp and boystous wyndes thy flowring Gardynes spill.</l>
<l>The God that can uppon him take what kynd of shape he list</l>
<l>Now having sayd thus much in vayne, omitted to persist</l>
<l>In beldames shape, and shewde himself a lusty gentleman,</l>
<l>Appeering to her cheerefully, even like as <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> whan</l>

<l>Dooth blaze his brightsum beames agein with fuller heate and lyght.</l>
<l>He offred force, but now no force was needfull in the cace.</l>
<l>For why shee beeing caught in love with beawty of his face,  </l>
<l>Was wounded then as well as hee, and gan to yeeld apace.

<l>A Persone in the whyle was sought sufficient to susteine</l>

<l>(Whoo harped then uppon the truthe before to passe it came)</l>
<l>Appoynted to the Empyre was. This <placeName key="tgn,2033144">Numa</placeName> thought it not        </l>
<l>Inough that he the knowledge of the <placeName key="tgn,7021127">Sabine</placeName> rites had got.</l>
<l>The deepenesse of the noble wit to greater things was bent,</l>
<l>To serch of things the natures out. The care of this intent</l>
<l>Did cause that he from Curie and his native Countrye went</l>
<l>With peynfull travell, to the towne where <placeName key="tgn,2059070">Hercules</placeName> did hoste.  </l>
<l>And asking who it was of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> that in th'Italian coast</l>
<l>Had buylt that towne, an aged man well seene in storyes old,</l>
<l>To satisfye his mynd therin the processe thus him told:</l>
<l>As <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName> enriched with the Spannish kyne did hold</l>
<l>His voyage from the Ocean sea, men say with lucky cut    </l>
<l>He came aland on Lacine coast. And whyle he there did put</l>
<l>His beace to grazing, he himself in Crotons house did rest,</l>
<l>The greatest man in all those parts and unto straungers best:</l>
<l>And that he there refresht him of his tedious travell, and</l>
<l>That when he should depart, he sayd: Where now thy house dooth stand, </l>
<l>Shall in thy childers childrens tyme a Citie buylded bee.</l>
<l>Which woordes of his have proved trew as playnly now wee see.</l>
<l>For why there was one Myscelus, a Greeke, Alemons sonne,</l>
<l>A persone more in favour of the Goddes than any one</l>
<l>In those dayes was. The God that beares the boystous club did stay  </l>
<l>Uppon him being fast asleepe, and sayd: Go seeke streyght way</l>
<l>The stonny streame of Aeserie. Thy native soyle for ay</l>
<l>Forsake. And sore he threatned him onlesse he did obey.</l>
<l>The God and sleepe departed both togither. Up did ryse</l>
<l>Alemons sonne, and in himself did secretly devyse</l>
<l>Uppon this vision. Long his mynd strove dowtfull to and fro.</l>
<l>The God bad go. His country lawes did say he should not go,</l>
<l>And death was made the penaltie for him that would doo so.</l>
<l>Cleere Titan in the Ocean sea had hid his lyghtsomme head,</l>
<l>And duskye nyght had put up hers most thick with starres bespred.  </l>
<l>The selfsame God by Myscelus did seeme to stand eftsoone,</l>
<l>Commaunding him the selfsame thing that he before had doone,</l>
<l>And threatning mo and greater plages onlesse he did obey.</l>
<l>Then being stricken sore in feare he went about streyghtway</l>
<l>His household from his natyve land to forreine to convey.   </l>
<l>A rumor heereuppon did ryse through all the towne of Arge</l>
<l>And disobedience of the lawe was layed to his charge.</l>
<l>Assoone as that the cace had first beene pleaded and the deede</l>
<l>Apparantly perceyved, so that witnesse did not neede,</l>
<l>Arreyned and forlorne to heaven he cast his handes and eyes, </l>
<l>And sayd: O God whoose labours twelve have purchaste thee the skyes,</l>
<l>Assist mee, I thee pray. For thou art author of my cryme.</l>
<l>When judgement should bee given it was the guyse in auncient tyme</l>
<l>With whyght stones to acquit the cleere, and eeke with blacke to cast</l>
<l>The giltye. That tyme also so the heavy sentence past.      </l>
<l>The stones were cast unmercifull all blacke into the pot.</l>
<l>But when the stones were powred out to number, there was not</l>
<l>A blacke among them. All were whyght. And so through Hercles powre</l>
<l>A gentle judgement did proceede, and he was quit that howre.</l>
<l>Then gave he thankes to <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName>, and having prosprous blast,  </l>
<l>Cut over the Ionian sea, and so by Tarent past</l>
<l>Which Spartanes buylt, and Cybaris, and Neaeth Salentine,</l>
<l>And Thurine bay, and Emese, and eeke the pastures fyne</l>
<l>Of Calabrye. And having scarce well sought the coastes that lye</l>
<l>Uppon the sea, he found the mouth of fatall Aeserye. </l>
<l>Not farre from thence, he also found the tumb in which the ground</l>
<l>Did kiver Crotons holy bones, and in that place did found</l>
<l>The Citie that was willed him, and gave thereto the name</l>

<l>Behild the things which nature dooth to fleshly eyes denye.</l>
<l>And when with care most vigilant he had assuredly</l>

<l>What nature was: and what was God: whence snow and lyghtning spring:</l>
<l>And whither Jove or else the wynds in breaking clowdes doo thunder:</l>
<l>What shakes the earth: what law the starres doo keepe theyr courses under:</l>
<l>And what soever other thing is hid from common sence.        </l>
<l>He also is the first that did injoyne an abstinence</l>
<l>To feede of any lyving thing. He also first of all</l>
<l>Spake thus: although ryght lernedly, yit to effect but small:</l>
<l>Yee mortall men, forbeare to frank your flesh with wicked foode.</l>
<l>Yee have both come and frutes of trees and grapes and herbes right good. </l>
<l>And though that sum bee harsh and hard: yit fyre may make them well</l>
<l>Both soft and sweete. Yee may have milk, and honny which dooth smell</l>
<l>Of flowres of tyme. The lavish earth dooth yeeld you plentiously</l>
<l>Most gentle foode, and riches to content bothe mynd and eye.</l>
<l>There needes no slaughter nor no blood to get your living by.  </l>
<l>The beastes do breake theyr fast with flesh: and yit not all beastes neyther.</l>
<l>For horses, sheepe, and Rotherbeastes to live by grasse had lever.</l>
<l>The nature of the beast that dooth delyght in bloody foode,</l>
<l>Is cruell and unmercifull. As <placeName key="tgn,7008772">Lyons</placeName> feerce of moode,</l>

<l>Which wee have naamd the golden world, cleene voyd of all such rage,</l>
<l>Livd blessedly by frute of trees and herbes that grow on ground,    </l>
<l>And stayned not their mouthes with blood. Then birds might safe and sound</l>
<l>Fly where they listed in the ayre. The hare unscaard of hound</l>
<l>Went pricking over all the feeldes. No angling hooke with bayt</l>
<l>Did hang the seely fish that bote mistrusting no deceyt.</l>
<l>All things were voyd of guylefulnesse: no treason was in trust:  </l>
<l>But all was freendshippe, love and peace. But after that the lust</l>
<l>Of one (what God so ere he was) disdeyning former fare,</l>
<l>To cram that cruell croppe of his with fleshmeate did not spare,</l>
<l>He made a way for wickednesse. And first of all the knyfe</l>

<l>And that had nothing beene amisse, if there had beene the stay.</l>
<l>For why wee graunt, without the breach of godlynesse wee may</l>
<l>By death confound the things that seeke to take our lyves away.</l>
<l>But as to kill them reason was: even so agein theyr was</l>
<l>No reason why to eate theyr flesh. This leawdnesse thence did passe </l>

<l>And did deceyve the tillmen of theyr hope next yeere thereby)</l>
<l>Was deemed woorthy by desert in sacrifyse to dye.</l>
<l>The Goate for byghting vynes was slayne at Bacchus altar whoo  </l>

<l>Nay doo not (I beseeche yee) so. But give good eare and heede</l>

<l>That whensoever you doo eate your Oxen, you devowre</l>

<l>The Oracles and secrets of the Godly majestye.</l>
<l>Greate things, and such as wit of man could never yit espye,</l>
<l>And such as have beene hidden long, I purpose to descrye.</l>
<l>I mynd to leave the earth, and up among the starres to stye.</l>
<l>I mynd to leave this grosser place, and in the clowdes to flye,  </l>
<l>And on stowt Atlas shoulders strong to rest my self on hye,</l>
<l>And looking downe from heaven on men that wander heere and there</l>

<l>O men amaazd with dread of death, why feare yee Limbo Styx,</l>
<l>And other names of vanitie, which are but Poets tricks?</l>
<l>And perrills of another world, all false surmysed geere?</l>
<l>For whether fyre or length of tyme consume the bodyes heere,</l>
<l>Yee well may thinke that further harmes they cannot suffer more.  </l>
<l>For soules are free from death. Howbee't, they leaving evermore</l>
<l>Theyr former dwellings, are receyvd and live ageine in new.</l>
<l>For I myself (ryght well in mynd I beare it to be trew)</l>
<l>Was in the tyme of Trojan warre Euphorbus, Panthewes sonne,</l>
<l>Quyght through whoose hart the deathfull speare of Menelay did ronne. </l>
<l>I late ago in Junos Church at <placeName key="tgn,7010720">Argos</placeName> did behold</l>
<l>And knew the target which I in my left hand there did hold.</l>
<l>Al things doo chaunge. But nothing sure dooth perrish. This same spright</l>
<l>Dooth fleete, and fisking heere and there dooth swiftly take his flyght</l>
<l>From one place to another place, and entreth every wyght,     </l>
<l>Removing out of man to beast, and out of beast to man.</l>
<l>But yit it never perrisheth nor never perrish can.</l>
<l>And even as supple wax with ease receyveth fygures straunge,</l>
<l>And keepes not ay one shape, ne bydes assured ay from chaunge,</l>
<l>And yit continueth alwayes wax in substaunce: so I say        </l>
<l>The soule is ay the selfsame thing it was and yit astray</l>
<l>It fleeteth into sundry shapes. Therfore lest Godlynesse</l>
<l>Bee vanquisht by outragious lust of belly beastlynesse,</l>
<l>Forbeare (I speake by prophesie) your kinsfolkes ghostes to chace</l>
<l>By slaughter: neyther nourish blood with blood in any cace.   </l>
<l>And sith on open sea the wynds doo blow my sayles apace,</l>
<l>In all the world there is not that that standeth at a stay.</l>
<l>Things eb and flow: and every shape is made to passe away.</l>
<l>The tyme itself continually is fleeting like a brooke.</l>
<l>For neyther brooke nor lyghtsomme tyme can tarrye still. But looke </l>
<l>As every wave dryves other foorth, and that that commes behynd</l>
<l>Bothe thrusteth and is thrust itself: even so the tymes by kynd</l>
<l>Doo fly and follow bothe at once, and evermore renew.</l>
<l>For that that was before is left, and streyght there dooth ensew</l>
<l>Anoother that was never erst. Eche twincling of an eye    </l>
<l>Dooth chaunge. Wee see that after day commes nyght and darks the sky,</l>
<l>And after nyght the lyghtsum <placeName key="tgn,1063690">Sunne</placeName> succeedeth orderly.</l>
<l>Like colour is not in the heaven when all things weery lye</l>
<l>At midnyght sound asleepe, as when the daystarre cleere and bryght</l>
<l>Commes foorth uppon his milkwhyght steede. Ageine in other plyght </l>
<l>The Morning, Pallants daughter fayre, the messenger of lyght</l>
<l>Delivereth into Phebus handes the world of cleerer hew.</l>
<l>The circle also of the sonne what tyme it ryseth new</l>
<l>And when it setteth, looketh red, but when it mounts most hye,</l>
<l>Then lookes it whyght, bycause that there the nature of the skye    </l>
<l>Is better, and from filthye drosse of earth dooth further flye.</l>
<l>The image also of the Moone that shyneth ay by nyght,</l>
<l>Is never of one quantitie. For that that giveth lyght</l>
<l>Today, is lesser than the next that followeth, till the full.</l>
<l>And then contrarywyse eche day her lyght away dooth pull.  </l>
<l>What? <placeName key="tgn,1028109">Seest</placeName> thou not how that the yeere as representing playne</l>
<l>The age of man, departes itself in quarters fowre? First bayne</l>
<l>And tender in the spring it is, even like a sucking babe.</l>
<l>Then greene, and voyd of strength, and lush, and foggye, is the blade,</l>
<l>And cheeres the husbandman with hope. Then all things florish gay. </l>
<l>The earth with flowres of sundry hew then seemeth for to play,</l>
<l>And vertue small or none to herbes there dooth as yit belong.</l>
<l>The yeere from springtyde passing foorth to sommer, wexeth strong,</l>
<l>Becommeth lyke a lusty youth. For in our lyfe through out</l>
<l>There is no tyme more plentifull, more lusty, hote and stout.  </l>
<l>Then followeth Harvest when the heate of youth growes sumwhat cold,</l>
<l>Rype, meeld, disposed meane betwixt a yoongman and an old,</l>
<l>And sumwhat sprent with grayish heare. Then ugly winter last</l>
<l>Like age steales on with trembling steppes, all bald, or overcast</l>
<l>With shirle thinne heare as whyght as snowe. Our bodies also ay   </l>
<l>Doo alter still from tyme to tyme, and never stand at stay.</l>
<l>Wee shall not bee the same wee were today or yisterday.</l>
<l>The day hath beene wee were but seede and only hope of men,</l>
<l>And in our moothers womb wee had our dwelling place as then:</l>
<l>Dame Nature put to conning hand and suffred not that wee   </l>
<l>Within our moothers streyned womb should ay distressed bee,</l>
<l>But brought us out to aire, and from our prison set us free.</l>
<l>The chyld newborne lyes voyd of strength. Within a season tho</l>
<l>He wexing fowerfooted lernes like savage beastes to go.</l>
<l>Then sumwhat foltring, and as yit not firme of foote, he standes    </l>
<l>By getting sumwhat for to helpe his sinewes in his handes.</l>
<l>From that tyme growing strong and swift, he passeth foorth the space</l>
<l>Of youth: and also wearing out his middle age apace,</l>
<l>Through drooping ages steepye path he ronneth out his race.</l>
<l>This age dooth undermyne the strength of former yeares, and throwes </l>
<l>It downe. Which thing old <placeName key="tgn,7010922">Milo</placeName> by example playnely showes.</l>
<l>For when he sawe those armes of his (which heeretofore had beene</l>
<l>As strong as ever Hercules in woorking deadly teene</l>
<l>Of biggest beastes) hang flapping downe, and nought but empty skin,</l>
<l>He wept. And Helen when shee saw her aged wrincles in    </l>
<l>A glasse wept also: musing in herself what men had seene,</l>
<l>That by two noble princes sonnes shee twyce had ravisht beene.</l>
<l>Thou tyme the eater up of things, and age of spyghtfull teene,</l>
<l>Destroy all things. And when that long continuance hath them bit,</l>
<l>You leysurely by lingring death consume them every whit.  </l>
<l>And theis that wee call Elements doo never stand at stay.</l>
<l>The enterchaunging course of them I will before yee lay.</l>
<l>Give heede therto. This endlesse world conteynes therin I say</l>
<l>Fowre substances of which all things are gendred. Of theis fower</l>
<l>The Earth and Water for theyr masse and weyght are sunken lower. </l>
<l>The other cowple Aire and Fyre, the purer of the twayne,</l>
<l>Mount up, and nought can keepe them downe. And though there doo remayne</l>
<l>A space betweene eche one of them: yit every thing is made</l>
<l>Of themsame fowre, and into them at length ageine doo fade.</l>
<l>The earth resolving leysurely dooth melt to water sheere.  </l>
<l>The water fyned turnes to aire. The aire eeke purged cleere</l>
<l>From grossenesse, spyreth up aloft, and there becommeth fyre.</l>
<l>From thence in order contrary they backe ageine retyre.</l>

<l part="F">No kind of thing keepes ay his shape and hew.</l>
<l>For nature loving ever chaunge repayres one shape anew</l>
<l>Uppon another. Neyther dooth there perrish aught (trust mee)</l>
<l>In all the world, but altring takes new shape. For that which wee</l>
<l>Doo terme by name of being borne, is for to gin to bee     </l>
<l>Another thing than that it was: and likewise for to dye,</l>

<l>Returning, do unperrisshed continew still the same.</l>
<l>But as for in one shape, bee sure that nothing long can last.  </l>
<l>Even so the ages of the world from gold to Iron past.</l>
<l>Even so have places oftentymes exchaunged theyr estate.</l>
<l>For I have seene it sea which was substanciall ground alate,</l>
<l>Ageine where sea was, I have seene the same become dry lond,</l>

<l>Deepe valleyes have by watershotte beene made of levell ground,</l>

<l>Hard gravell ground is sumtyme seene where marris was beforne,</l>

<l>Full many rivers in the world through earthquakes heretofore</l>

<l>Soo Lycus beeing swallowed up by gaping of the ground,</l>
<l>A greatway off fro thence is in another channell found.     </l>
<l>Even so the river Erasine among the feeldes of Arge</l>

<l>Men drank the waters of the brooke Anigrus heretofore,</l>
<l>Which now is such that men abhorre to towche them any more.</l>
<l>Which commes to passe, (onlesse wee will discredit Poets quyght)</l>
<l>Bycause the Centaures vanquisshed by Hercules in fyght      </l>

<l>From sea, and in the auncient tyme was joyned to the land.</l>
<l>But now environd round about with water it dooth stand.</l>
<l>Men say that Sicill also hath beene joynd to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName></l>

<l>The walles and steeples of the townes drownd under as they rowe.</l>
<l>Not farre from Pitthey Troyzen is a certeine high ground found    </l>
<l>All voyd of trees, which heeretofore was playne and levell ground,</l>

<l>To passe therefro, in struggling long to get the open skye</l>
<l>In vayne, (bycause in all the cave there was no vent wherby </l>

<l>As dooth a bladder that is blowen by mouth, or as the skinne</l>
<l>Of horned Goate in bottlewyse when wynd is gotten in.</l>
<l>The swelling of the foresayd place remaynes at this day still,</l>

<l>Of many things that come to mynd by heersay, and by skill</l>
<l>Of good experience, I a fewe will utter to you mo.</l>
<l>What? Dooth not water in his shapes chaunge straungely to and fro?</l>
<l>The well of horned Hammon is at noonetyde passing cold.</l>
<l>At morne and even it wexeth warme. At midnyght none can hold  </l>

<l>Is sayd to kindle woode what tyme the moone is in the wane.</l>
<l>The Cicons have a certeine streame which beeing droonk dooth bring</l>
<l>Mennes bowwelles into Marble hard: and whatsoever thing</l>

<l>The rivers Crathe and <placeName key="perseus,Sybaris">Sybaris</placeName> make yellow heare like gold</l>
<l>And Amber. There are also springs (which thing is farre more straunge)</l>
<l>Which not the bodye only, but the mynd doo also chaunge.</l>
<l>Whoo hath not heard of Salmacis, that fowle and filthye sink?</l>

<l>In only water: eyther for bycause there is a myght</l>
<l>Contrary unto warming wyne by nature in the well,        </l>
<l>Or else bycause (for so the folk of Arcadye doo tell)</l>
<l>Melampus, Amythaons sonne (when he delivered had</l>
<l>King Praetus daughters by his charmes and herbes from being mad),</l>
<l>Cast into that same water all the baggage wherewithall</l>

<l>That lothsomnesse of wyne did in those waters ay remayne.</l>
<l>Ageine in Lyncest contrarie effect to this dooth reigne.</l>
<l>For whoo so drinkes too much therof, he reeleth heere and there</l>

<l>There is a Lake in Arcadye which Pheney men did name        </l>

<l>The Grapegod Bacchus, when he had subdewd the land of <placeName key="tgn,7000198">Inde</placeName>,  </l>
<l>Did fynd a spotted beast cald Lynx, whoose urine (by report)</l>

<l>The sovereine Ladye of the world, by ryght descent shall take</l>
<l>His first beginning from thy sonne the little Jule. And when</l>

<l>For of the actes of Caesar, none is greater than that hee  </l>
<l>Left such a sonne behynd him as Augustus is, to bee</l>
<l>His heyre. For are they things more hard: to overcomme thy Realme</l>
<l>Of Britaine standing in the sea, or up the sevenfold streame</l>
<l>Of Nyle that beareth Paperreede victorious shippes to rowe,</l>
<l>Or to rebelliouse Numidye to give an overthrowe,          </l>
<l>Or <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName>, king of Moores, and <placeName key="tgn,1062356">Pons</placeName> (which proudely did it beare</l>

<l>To yeeld them subjects unto <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, or by his just desert</l>
<l>To merit many triumphes, and of sum to have his part,</l>
<l>Than such an heyre to leave beehynd, in whom the Goddes doo showe </l>
<l>Exceeding favour unto men for that they doo bestowe</l>
<l>So great a prince uppon the world? Now to th'entent that hee</l>
<l>Should not bee borne of mortall seede, the other was too bee</l>
<l>Canonyzde for a God. Which thing when golden Venus see,</l>
<l>(Shee also sawe how dreadfull death was for the bisshop then  </l>
<l>Prepaard, and how conspiracye was wrought by wicked men)</l>
<l>Shee looked pale. And as the Goddes came any in her way,</l>
<l>Shee sayd unto them one by one: Behold and see, I pray,</l>
<l>With how exceeding eagernesse they seeke mee to betray,</l>
<l>And with what woondrous craft they stryve to take my lyfe away,   </l>
<l>I meene the thing that only now remayneth unto mee</l>
<l>Of Jule the Trojans race. Must I then only ever bee</l>
<l>Thus vext with undeserved cares? How seemeth now the payne</l>

<l>How seemes it mee that <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName> ageine is lost through ill defence? </l>
<l>How seemes my sonne Aenaeas like a bannisht man, from thence</l>
<l>To wander farre ageine, and on the sea to tossed bee,</l>
<l>And warre with Turnus for to make? or rather (truth to say)</l>
<l>With Juno? What meene I about harmes passed many a day</l>
<l>Ageinst myne ofspring, thus to stand? This present feare and wo</l>
<l>Permit mee not to think on things now past so long ago.</l>
<l>Yee see how wicked swoordes ageinst my head are whetted. I</l>
<l>Beseeche yee keepe them from my throte, and set the traytors by</l>
<l>Theyr purpose. Neyther suffer you dame Vestas fyre to dye</l>
<l>By murthering of her bisshop. Thus went Venus wofully     </l>
<l>Complayning over all the heaven, and moovde the Goddes therby.</l>
<l>And for they could not breake the strong decrees of destinye,</l>
<l>They shewed signes most manifest of sorrowe to ensew.</l>
<l>For battells feyghting in the clowdes with crasshing armour flew.</l>
<l>And dreadfull trumpets sownded in the aire, and homes eeke blew,  </l>
<l>As warning men before hand of the mischeef that did brew.</l>
<l>And Phebus also looking dim did cast a drowzy lyght</l>
<l>Uppon the earth, which seemd lykewyse to bee in sorrve plyght.</l>
<l>From underneathe amid the starres brands oft seemd burning bryght.</l>
<l>It often rayned droppes of blood. The morning starre lookt blew,    </l>
<l>And was bespotted heere and there with specks of rusty hew.</l>
<l>The moone had also spottes of blood. The Screeche owle sent from hell</l>
<l>Did with her tune unfortunate in every corner yell.</l>
<l>Salt teares from Ivory images in sundry places fell.</l>
<l>And in the Chappells of the Goddes was singing heard, and woordes </l>
<l>Of threatning. Not a sacrifyse one signe of good afoordes.</l>
<l>But greate turmoyle to bee at hand theyr hartstrings doo declare.</l>
<l>And when the beast is ripped up the inwards headlesse are.</l>
<l>About the Court, and every house, and Churches in the nyghts</l>
<l>The doggs did howle, and every where appeered gastly spryghts.    </l>
<l>And with an earthquake shaken was the towne. Yit could not all</l>
<l>Theis warnings of the Goddes dispoynt the treason that should fall,</l>
<l>Nor overcomme the destinies. The naked swoordes were brought</l>
<l>Into the temple. For no place in all the towne was thought</l>
<l>So meete to woork the mischeef in, or for them to commit   </l>
<l>The heynous murder, as the Court in which they usde to sit</l>
<l>In counsell. Venus then with both her hands her stomacke smit,</l>
<l>And was about to hyde him with the clowd in which shee hid</l>
<l>Aenaeas, when shee from the swoord of Diomed did him rid,</l>
<l>Or <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName>, when from Menelay shee did him saufe convey.     </l>
<l>But Jove her father staying her did thus unto hir say:</l>
<l>Why, daughter myne, wilt thou alone bee stryving to prevent</l>
<l>Unvanquishable destinie? In fayth and if thou went</l>
<l>Thy self into the house in which the fatall susters three</l>
<l>Doo dwell, thou shouldest there of brasse and steele substantiall see </l>
<l>The registers of things so strong and massye made to bee,</l>
<l>That sauf and everlasting, they doo neyther stand in feare</l>
<l>Of thunder, nor of lyghtning, nor of any ruine there.</l>
<l>The destnyes of thyne offspring thou shalt there fynd graven deepe</l>
<l>In Adamant. I red them: and in mynd I doo them keepe.     </l>
<l>And forbycause thou shalt not bee quyght ignorant of all,</l>
<l>I will declare what things I markt herafter to befall.</l>
<l>The man for whom thou makest sute, hath lived full his tyme</l>
<l>And having ronne his race on earth must now to heaven up clyme.</l>
<l>Where thou shalt make a God of him ay honord for to bee    </l>
<l>With temples and with Altars on the earth. Moreover hee</l>
<l>That is his heyre and beares his name, shall all alone susteyne</l>
<l>The burthen layd uppon his backe, and shall our help obteyne</l>
<l>His fathers murther to revenge. The towne of Mutinye</l>
<l>Beseedged by his powre, shall yeeld. The feelds of Pharsaly  </l>
<l>Shall feele him, and Philippos in the Realme of Macedonne</l>
<l>Shall once ageine bee staynd with blood. The greate Pompeius sonne</l>
<l>Shall vanquisht be by him uppon the sea of Sicilye.</l>
<l>The Romane Capteynes wyfe, the Queene of Aegypt, through her hye</l>
<l>Presumption trusting to her match too much, shall threate in vayne </l>
<l>To make her Canop over our hygh Capitoll to reigne.</l>
<l>What should I tell thee of the wyld and barbrous nacions that</l>
<l>At bothe the Oceans dwelling bee? The universall plat</l>
<l>Of all the earth inhabited, shall all be his. The sea</l>
<l>Shall unto him obedient bee likewyse. And when that he    </l>
<l>Hathe stablisht peace in all the world, then shall he set his mynd</l>
<l>To civill matters, upryght lawes by justice for to fynd,</l>
<l>And by example of himself all others he shall bynd.</l>
<l>Then having care of tyme to comme, and of posteritye,</l>
<l>A holy wyfe shall beare to him a sonne that may supply    </l>
<l>His carefull charge and beare his name. And lastly in the end</l>
<l>He shall to heaven among the starres, his auncetors, ascend,</l>
<l>But not before his lyfe by length to drooping age doo tend.</l>
<l>And therfore from the murthred corce of Julius Caesar take</l>
<l>His sowle with speede, and of the same a burning cresset make,    </l>
<l>That from our heavenly pallace he may evermore looke downe</l>
<l>Uppon our royall Capitoll and Court within <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> towne.</l>
<l>He scarcely ended had theis woordes, but Venus out of hand</l>
<l>Amid the Senate house of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName> invisible did stand,</l>
<l>And from her Caesars bodye tooke his new expulsed spryght  </l>
<l>The which shee not permitting to resolve to ayer quyght,</l>
<l>Did place it in the skye among the starres that glister bryght</l>
<l>And as shee bare it, shee did feele it gather heavenly myght,</l>
<l>And for to wexen fyrye. Shee no sooner let it flye,</l>
<l>But that a goodly shyning starre it up aloft did stye       </l>
<l>And drew a greate way after it bryght beames like burning heare.</l>
<l>Whoo looking on his sonnes good deedes confessed that they were</l>
<l>Farre greater than his owne, and glad he was to see that hee</l>
<l>Excelled him. Although his sonne in no wyse would agree</l>
<l>To have his deedes preferd before his fathers: yit dooth fame,  </l>
<l>(Whoo ay is free, and bound to no commaund) withstand the same</l>
<l>And stryving in that one behalf ageinst his hest and will,</l>
<l>Proceedeth to preferre his deedes before his fathers still.</l>
<l>Even so to Agamemnons great renowne gives Atreus place,</l>
<l>Even so Achilles deedes, the deedes of Peleus doo abace.    </l>
<l>Even so beyond Aegaeus, farre dooth Theseyes prowesse go.</l>
<l>And (that I may examples use full matching theis) even so</l>
<l>Is Saturne lesse in fame than Jove. Jove rules the heavenly spheres,</l>
<l>And all the tryple shaped world. And our Augustus beares</l>
<l>Dominion over all the earth. They bothe are fathers: they   </l>
<l>Are rulers both. Yee Goddes to whom both fyre and swoord gave way,</l>
<l>What tyme yee with Aenaeas came from <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>: yee Goddes that were</l>
<l>Of mortall men canonyzed: thou Quirin whoo didst reere</l>
<l>The walles of <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>: and Mars who wart the valeant Quirins syre</l>
<l>And <placeName key="tgn,1016295">Vesta</placeName> of the household Goddes of Caesar with thy fyre   </l>
<l>Most holy: and thou <placeName key="tgn,2578371">Phebus</placeName> whoo with <placeName key="tgn,1016295">Vesta</placeName> also art</l>
<l>Of household: and thou <placeName key="tgn,2483975">Jupiter</placeName> whoo in the hyghest part</l>

<l>With conscience sauf by Poets bee appealed to: I pray</l>
<l>Let that same day bee slowe to comme and after I am dead,   </l>
<l>In which Augustus (whoo as now of all the world is head)</l>
<l>Quyght giving up the care therof ascend to heaven for ay,</l>
<l>There (absent hence) to favour such as unto him shall pray.</l>
<l>Now have I brought a woork to end which neither Joves feerce wrath,</l>
<l>Nor swoord, nor fyre, nor freating age with all the force it hath </l>
<l>Are able to abolish quyght. Let comme that fatall howre</l>
<l>Which (saving of this brittle flesh) hath over mee no powre,</l>
<l>And at his pleasure make an end of myne uncerteyne tyme.</l>
<l>Yit shall the better part of mee assured bee to clyme</l>
<l>Aloft above the starry skye. And all the world shall never  </l>
<l>Be able for to quench my name. For looke how farre so ever</l>
<l>The Romane Empyre by the ryght of conquest shall extend,</l>
<l>So farre shall all folke reade this woork. And tyme without all end</l>

<l>To  the  r y g h t  Ho n o r a ble</l>
<l>and  h i s  s i n g u-</l>
<l>lar good Lord, Robert Erle of Leycester,</l>
<l>most noble order of the Garter, etc. Arthur Gol-</l>
<l>ding Gent. wisheth continuance of health,</l>
<l>with prosperous estate and felicitie.</l>
<l>At length my chariot wheele about the mark hath found the way,</l>
<l>And at their weery races end, my breathlesse horses stay.</l>
<l>The woork is brought to end by which the author did account</l>
<l>(And rightly) with externall fame above the starres to mount.</l>
<l>For whatsoever hath bene writ of auncient tyme in greeke    </l>
<l>By sundry men dispersedly, and in the latin eeke,</l>
<l>Of this same dark Philosophie of turned shapes, the same</l>
<l>Hath Ovid into one whole masse in this booke brought in frame.</l>
<l>Fowre kynd of things in this his worke the Poet dooth conteyne.</l>
<l>That nothing under heaven dooth ay in stedfast state remayne.  </l>
<l>And next that nothing perisheth: but that eche substance takes</l>
<l>Another shape than that it had. Of theis twoo points he makes</l>
<l>The proof by shewing through his woorke the wonderfull exchaunge</l>
<l>Of Goddes, men, beasts, and elements, to sundry shapes right straunge,</l>
<l>Beginning with creation of the world, and man of slyme,    </l>
<l>And so proceeding with the turnes that happened till his tyme.</l>
<l>Then sheweth he the soule of man from dying to be free,</l>
<l>By samples of the noblemen, who for their vertues bee</l>
<l>Accounted and canonized for Goddes by heathen men,</l>
<l>And by the peynes of Lymbo lake, and blysfull state agen   </l>
<l>Of spirits in th'<placeName key="tgn,2054380">Elysian</placeName> feelds. And though that of theis three</l>
<l>He make discourse dispersedly: yit specially they bee</l>
<l>Discussed in the latter booke in that oration where</l>
<l>He bringeth in Pythagoras disswading men from feare</l>
<l>Of death, and preaching abstinence from flesh of living things.  </l>
<l>But as for that opinion which Pythagoras there brings</l>
<l>Of soules removing out of beasts to men, and out of men</l>
<l>To birdes and beasts both wyld and tame, both to and fro agen:</l>
<l>It is not to be understand of that same soule whereby</l>
<l>Wee are endewd with reason and discretion from on hie:         </l>
<l>But of that soule or lyfe the which brute beasts as well as wee</l>
<l>Enjoy. Three sortes of lyfe or soule (for so they termed bee)</l>
<l>Are found in things. The first gives powre to thryve, encrease and grow,</l>
<l>And this in senselesse herbes and trees and shrubs itself dooth show.</l>
<l>The second giveth powre to move and use of senses fyve,         </l>
<l>And this remaynes in brutish beasts, and keepeth them alyve.</l>
<l>Both theis are mortall, as the which receyved of the aire</l>
<l>By force of Phebus, after death doo thither eft repayre.</l>
<l>The third gives understanding, wit, and reason: and the same</l>
<l>Is it alonly which with us of soule dooth beare the name.      </l>
<l>And as the second dooth conteine the first: even so the third</l>
<l>Conteyneth both the other twaine. And neyther beast, nor bird,</l>
<l>Nor fish, nor herb, nor tree, nor shrub, nor any earthly wyght</l>
<l>(Save only man) can of the same partake the heavenly myght.</l>
<l>I graunt that when our breath dooth from our bodies go away,   </l>
<l>It dooth eftsoones returne to ayre: and of that ayre there may</l>
<l>Both bird and beast participate, and wee of theirs likewyse.</l>
<l>For whyle wee live, (the thing itself appeereth to our eyes)</l>
<l>Bothe they and wee draw all one breath. But for to deeme or say</l>
<l>Our noble soule (which is divine and permanent for ay)          </l>
<l>Is common to us with the beasts, I think it nothing lesse</l>
<l>Than for to bee a poynt of him that wisdome dooth professe.</l>
<l>Of this I am ryght well assurde, there is no Christen wyght</l>
<l>That can by fondnesse be so farre seduced from the ryght.</l>
<l>And finally hee dooth proceede in shewing that not all         </l>
<l>That beare the name of men (how strong, feerce, stout, bold, hardy, tall,</l>
<l>How wyse, fayre, rych, or hyghly borne, how much renownd by fame,</l>
<l>So ere they bee, although on earth of Goddes they beare the name)</l>
<l>Are for to be accounted men: but such as under awe</l>
<l>Of reasons rule continually doo live in vertues law:            </l>
<l>And that the rest doo differ nought from beasts, but rather bee</l>
<l>Much woorse than beasts, bicause they doo abace theyr owne degree.</l>
<l>To naturall philosophye the formest three perteyne,</l>
<l>The fowrth to morall: and in all are pitthye, apt and playne</l>
<l>Instructions which import the prayse of vertues and the shame      </l>
<l>Of vices, with the due rewardes of eyther of the same. Book I</l>
<l>As for example, in the tale of Daphnee turnd to Bay,</l>
<l>A myrror of virginitie appeere unto us may,</l>
<l>Which yeelding neyther unto feare, nor force, nor flatterye,</l>
<l>Doth purchace everlasting fame and immortalitye.                   </l>
<l>In Phaetons fable unto syght the Poet dooth expresse</l>
<l>The natures of ambition blynd, and youthfull wilfulnesse.</l>
<l>The end whereof is miserie, and bringeth at the last</l>
<l>Repentance when it is too late that all redresse is past.</l>
<l>And how the weaknesse and the want of wit in magistrate            </l>
<l>Confoundeth both his common weale and eeke his owne estate.</l>
<l>This fable also dooth advyse all parents and all such</l>
<l>As bring up youth, to take good heede of cockering them too much.</l>
<l>It further dooth commende the meane: and willeth to beware</l>
<l>Of rash and hasty promises which most pernicious are,              </l>
<l>And not to bee performed: and in fine it playnly showes</l>
<l>What sorrow to the parents and to all the kinred growes</l>
<l>By disobedience of the chyld: and in the chyld is ment</l>
<l>The disobedient subject that ageinst his prince is bent.</l>
<l>The transformations of the Crow and Raven doo declare              </l>
<l>That Clawbacks and Colcariers ought wysely to beware</l>
<l>Of whom, to whom, and what they speake. For sore against his will</l>
<l>Can any freendly hart abyde to heare reported ill</l>
<l>The partie whom he favoureth. This tale dooth eeke bewray</l>
<l>The rage of wrath and jelozie to have no kynd of stay:             </l>
<l>And that lyght credit to reportes in no wyse should be given,</l>
<l>For feare that men too late to just repentance should bee driven.</l>
<l>The fable of Ocyroee by all such folk is told</l>
<l>As are in serching things to come too curious and too bold.</l>
<l>A very good example is describde in Battus tale                    </l>
<l>For covetous people which for gayne doo set theyr toongs to sale. Book  I</l>
<l>All such as doo in flattring freaks, and hawks, and hownds delyght,</l>
<l>And dyce, and cards, and for to spend the tyme both day and nyght</l>
<l>In foule excesse of chamberworke, or too much meate and drink:</l>
<l>Uppon the piteous storie of Acteon ought to think.                </l>
<l>For theis and theyr adherents usde, excessive are in deede</l>
<l>The dogs that dayly doo devour theyr followers on with speede.</l>
<l>Tyresias willes inferior folk in any wyse to shun</l>
<l>To judge betweene their betters least in perill they doo run.</l>
<l>Narcissus is of scornfulnesse and pryde a myrror cleere,          </l>
<l>Where beawties fading vanitie most playnly may appeere.</l>
<l>And Echo in the selfsame tale dooth kyndly represent</l>
<l>The lewd behaviour of a bawd, and his due punishment.</l>
<l>The piteous tale of <placeName key="tgn,2065767">Pyramus</placeName> and Thisbee doth conteine</l>
<l>The headie force of frentick love whose end is wo and payne. </l>
<l>The snares of <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName> and Venus shew that tyme will bring to lyght</l>
<l>The secret sinnes that folk commit in corners or by nyght.</l>
<l>Hermaphrodite and Salmacis declare that idlenesse</l>
<l>Is cheefest nurce and cherisher of all volupteousnesse,</l>
<l>And that voluptuous lyfe breedes sin: which linking all toogither    </l>
<l>Make men to bee effeminate, unweeldy, weake and lither. Book V</l>
<l>Rich Piers daughters turnd to Pies doo openly declare</l>
<l>That none so bold to vaunt themselves as blindest bayardes are.</l>
<l>The Muses playnly doo declare ageine a tother syde,</l>
<l>That whereas cheefest wisdom is, most meeldnesse dooth abyde.    </l>
<l>Arachnee may example bee that folk should not contend</l>
<l>Ageinst their betters, nor persist in error to the end.</l>
<l>So dooth the tale of Niobee and of her children: and</l>
<l>The transformation of the Carles that dwelt in <placeName key="tgn,7001294">Lycie</placeName> land,</l>
<l>Toogither with the flaying off of piper Marsies skin.        </l>
<l>The first doo also show that long it is ere God begin</l>
<l>To pay us for our faults, and that he warnes us oft before</l>
<l>To leave our folly: but at length his vengeance striketh sore.</l>
<l>And therfore that no wyght should strive with God in word nor thought</l>
<l>Nor deede. But pryde and fond desyre of prayse have ever wrought  </l>
<l>Confusion to the parties which accompt of them do make.</l>
<l>For some of such a nature bee that if they once doo take</l>
<l>Opinion (be it ryght or wrong) they rather will agree</l>
<l>To dye, than seeme to take a foyle: so obstinate they bee.</l>
<l>The tale of Tereus, Philomele, and Prognee dooth conteyne    </l>
<l>That folke are blynd in thyngs that to their proper weale perteyne.</l>
<l>And that the man in whom the fyre of furious lust dooth reigne</l>
<l>Dooth run to mischeefe like a horse that getteth loose the reyne.</l>
<l>It also shewes the cruell wreake of women in their wrath</l>
<l>And that no hainous mischiefe long delay of vengeance hath.</l>
<l>And lastly that distresse doth drive a man to looke about</l>
<l>And seeke all corners of his wits, what way to wind him out.</l>
<l>The good successe of Jason in the land of Colchos, and</l>
<l>The dooings of Medea since, doo give to understand</l>
<l>That nothing is so hard but peyne and travail doo it win,     </l>
<l>For fortune ever favoreth such as boldly doo begin:</l>
<l>That women both in helping and in hurting have no match</l>
<l>When they to eyther bend their wits: and how that for to catch</l>
<l>An honest meener under fayre pretence of frendship, is</l>
<l>An easie matter. Also there is warning given of this,         </l>
<l>That men should never hastely give eare to fugitives,</l>
<l>Nor into handes of sorcerers commit their state or lyves.</l>
<l>It shewes in fine of stepmoothers the deadly hate in part,</l>
<l>And vengeaunce most unnaturall that was in moothers hart.</l>
<l>The deedes of Theseus are a spurre to prowesse, and a glasse  </l>
<l>How princes sonnes and noblemen their youthfull yeeres should passe.</l>
<l>King Minos shewes that kings in hand no wrongfull wars should take,</l>
<l>And what provision for the same they should before hand make.</l>
<l>King Aeacus gives also there example how that kings</l>
<l>Should keepe their promise and their leages above all other things.  </l>
<l>His grave description of the plage and end thereof, expresse</l>
<l>The wrath of God on man for sin: and how that nerethelesse</l>
<l>He dooth us spare and multiply ageine for goodmens sakes.</l>
<l>The whole discourse of Cephalus and Procris mention makes</l>
<l>That maried folke should warely shunne the vyce of jealozie      </l>
<l>And of suspicion should avoyd all causes utterly,</l>
<l>Reproving by the way all such as causelesse doo misdeeme</l>
<l>The chaste and giltlesse for the deedes of those that faultie seeme.</l>
<l>The storie of the daughter of king Nisus setteth out</l>
<l>What wicked lust drives folk unto to bring their wills about.     </l>
<l>And of a rightuous judge is given example in the same,</l>
<l>Who for no meede nor frendship will consent to any blame.</l>
<l>Wee may perceyve in Dedalus how every man by kynd</l>
<l>Desyres to bee at libertie, and with an earnest mynd</l>
<l>Dooth seeke to see his native soyle, and how that streight distresse    </l>
<l>Dooth make men wyse, and sharpes their wits to fynd their own redresse.</l>
<l>Wee also lerne by Icarus how good it is to bee</l>
<l>In meane estate and not to clymb too hygh, but to agree</l>
<l>To wholsome counsell: for the hyre of disobedience is</l>
<l>Repentance when it is too late forthinking things amisse.         </l>
<l>And Partrich telles that excellence in any thing procures</l>
<l>Men envie, even among those frendes whom nature most assures.</l>
<l>Philemon and his feere are rules of godly pacient lyfe,</l>
<l>Of sparing thrift, and mutuall love betweene the man and wyfe,</l>
<l>Of due obedience, of the feare of God, and of reward</l>
<l>For good or evill usage shewd to wandring straungers ward.</l>
<l>In Erisicthon dooth appeere a lyvely image both</l>
<l>Of wickednesse and crueltie which any wyght may lothe,</l>
<l>And of the hyre that longs thereto. He sheweth also playne</l>
<l>That whereas prodigalitie and gluttony dooth reigne,</l>
<l>A world of riches and of goods are ever with the least</l>
<l>To satisfye the appetite and eye of such a beast.</l>
<l>In <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName> and Acheloyes encounters is set out</l>
<l>The nature and behaviour of two wooers that be stout.</l>
<l>Wherein the Poet covertly taunts such as beeing bace        </l>
<l>Doo seeke by forged pedegrees to seeme of noble race.</l>
<l>Who when they doo perceyve no truth uppon their syde to stand,</l>
<l>In stead of reason and of ryght use force and myght of hand.</l>
<l>This fable also signifies that valiantnesse of hart</l>
<l>Consisteth not in woords, but deedes: and that all slyght and Art   </l>
<l>Give place to prowesse. Furthermore in Nessus wee may see</l>
<l>What breach of promise commeth to, and how that such as bee</l>
<l>Unable for to wreake theyr harmes by force, doo oft devyse</l>
<l>To wreake themselves by policie in farre more cruell wise.</l>
<l>And Deyanira dooth declare the force of jealozie            </l>
<l>Deceyved through too lyght beleef and fond simplicitie.</l>
<l>The processe following peinteth out true manlynesse of hart</l>
<l>Which yeeldeth neyther unto death, to sorrow, greef, nor smart.</l>
<l>And finally it shewes that such as live in true renowne</l>
<l>Of vertue heere, have after death an everlasting crowne     </l>
<l>Of glorie. Cawne and Byblis are examples contrarie:</l>
<l>The Mayd of most outrageous lust, the man of chastitie. Book X</l>
<l>The tenth booke cheefly dooth containe one kynd of argument</l>
<l>Reproving most prodigious lusts of such as have bene bent</l>
<l>To incest most unnaturall. And in the latter end            </l>
<l>It showeth in Hippomenes how greatly folk offend</l>
<l>That are ingrate for benefits which God or man bestow</l>
<l>Uppon them in the time of neede. Moreover it dooth show</l>
<l>That beawty (will they nill they) aye dooth men in daunger throw:</l>
<l>And that it is a foolyshnesse to stryve ageinst the thing   </l>
<l>Which God before determineth to passe in tyme to bring.</l>
<l>And last of all Adonis death dooth shew that manhod strives</l>
<l>Against forewarning though men see the perill of theyr lyves.</l>
<l>The death of Orphey sheweth Gods just vengeance on the vyle</l>
<l>And wicked sort which horribly with incest them defyle.     </l>
<l>In Midas of a covetous wretch the image wee may see</l>
<l>Whose riches justly to himself a hellish torment bee,</l>
<l>And of a foole whom neyther proof nor warning can amend,</l>
<l>Untill he feele the shame and smart that folly doth him send.</l>
<l>His <placeName key="tgn,2002253">Barbour</placeName> represents all blabs which seeme with chyld to bee  </l>

<l>In Ceyx and Alcyone appeeres most constant love,</l>
<l>Such as betweene the man and wyfe to bee it dooth behove.</l>
<l>This Ceyx also is a lyght of princely courtesie</l>
<l>And bountie toward such whom neede compelleth for too flie.  </l>
<l>His viage also dooth declare how vainly men are led</l>
<l>To utter perill through fond toyes and fansies in their head.</l>
<l>For Idols, doubtfull oracles and soothsayres prophecies</l>
<l>Doo nothing else but make fooles fayne and blynd their bleared eyes.</l>
<l>Dedalions daughter warnes to use the toong with modestee  </l>

<l>The seege of <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>, the death of men, the razing of the citie,</l>
<l>And slaughter of king Priams stock without remors of pitie,</l>
<l>Which in the xii. and xiii. bookes bee written, doo declare</l>
<l>How heynous wilfull perjurie and filthie whoredome are    </l>
<l>In syght of God. The frentick fray betweene the Lapithes and</l>
<l>The Centaures is a note wherby is given to understand</l>
<l>The beastly rage of drunkennesse.</l>
<l><placeName key="tgn,2062711">Ulysses</placeName> dooth expresse</l>
<l>The image of discretion, wit, and great advisednesse.</l>
<l>And Ajax on the other syde doth represent a man            </l>
<l>Stout, headie, irefull, hault of mynd, and such a one as can</l>
<l>Abyde to suffer no repulse. And both of them declare</l>
<l>How covetous of glorie and reward mens natures are.</l>
<l>And finally it sheweth playne that wisdome dooth prevayle</l>
<l>In all attempts and purposes when strength of hand dooth fayle.    </l>
<l>The death of fayre Polyxena dooth shew a princely mynd</l>
<l>And firme regard of honor rare engraft in woman kynd.</l>
<l>And Polymnestor, king of <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, dooth shew himself to bee</l>
<l>A glasse for wretched covetous folke wherein themselves to see.</l>
<l>This storie further witnesseth that murther crieth ay        </l>
<l>For vengeance, and itself one tyme or other dooth bewray.</l>
<l>The tale of Gyant Polypheme doth evidently prove</l>
<l>That nothing is so feerce and wyld, which yeeldeth not to love.</l>
<l>And in the person of the selfsame Gyant is set out</l>
<l>The rude and homely wooing of a country cloyne and lout.     </l>
<l>The tale of Apes reproves the vyce of wilfull perjurie,</l>
<l>And willeth people to beware they use not for to lye.</l>
<l>Aeneas going downe to hell dooth shew that vertue may</l>

<l>The length of lyfe in Sybill dooth declare it is but vayne   </l>
<l>To wish long lyfe, syth length of lyfe is also length of payne.</l>
<l>The Grecian Achemenides dooth lerne us how we ought</l>
<l>Bee thankfull for the benefits that any man hath wrought.</l>
<l>And in this Achemenides the Poet dooth expresse</l>
<l>The image of exceeding feare in daunger and distresse.        </l>
<l>What else are Circes witchcrafts and enchauntments than the vyle</l>
<l>And filthy pleasures of the flesh which doo our soules defyle?</l>
<l>And what is else herbe <placeName key="tgn,2520175">Moly</placeName> than the gift of stayednesse</l>
<l>And temperance which dooth all fowle concupiscence represse?</l>
<l>The tale of Anaxaretee willes dames of hygh degree            </l>
<l>To use their lovers courteously how meane so ere they bee.</l>
<l>And Iphis lernes inferior folkes too fondly not to set</l>
<l>Their love on such as are too hygh for their estate to get.</l>
<l>Alemons sonne declares that men should willingly obay</l>
<l>What God commaundes, and not uppon exceptions seeme to stay.  </l>
<l>For he will find the meanes to bring the purpose well about,</l>
<l>And in their most necessitie dispatch them saufly out</l>
<l>Of daunger. The oration of Pithagoras implyes</l>
<l>A sum of all the former woorke. What person can devyse</l>
<l>A notabler example of true love and godlynesse               </l>
<l>To ones owne natyve countryward than Cippus dooth expresse?</l>
<l>The turning to a blazing starre of Julius Cesar showes,</l>
<l>That fame and immortalitie of vertuous dooing growes.</l>
<l>And lastly by examples of Augustus and a few</l>
<l>Of other noble princes sonnes the author there dooth shew</l>
<l>That noblemen and gentlemen shoulde stryve to passe the fame</l>
<l>And vertues of their aunceters, or else to match the same.</l>
<l>Theis fables out of every booke I have interpreted,</l>
<l>To shew how they and all the rest may stand a man in sted.</l>
<l>Not adding over curiously the meaning of them all, </l>
<l>For that were labor infinite, and tediousnesse not small</l>
<l>Bothe unto your good Lordship and the rest that should them reede</l>
<l>Who well myght think I did the boundes of modestie exceede,</l>
<l>If I this one epistle should with matters overcharge</l>
<l>Which scarce a booke of many quyres can well conteyne at large.   </l>
<l>And whereas in interpreting theis few I attribute</l>
<l>The things to one, which heathen men to many Gods impute,</l>
<l>Concerning mercy, wrath for sin, and other gifts of grace:</l>
<l>Described for examples sake in proper tyme and place,</l>
<l>Let no man marvell at the same. For though that they as blynd  </l>
<l>Through unbeleefe, and led astray through error even of kynd,</l>
<l>Knew not the true eternall God, or if they did him know,</l>
<l>Yit did they not acknowledge him, but vaynly did bestow</l>
<l>The honor of the maker on the creature: yit it dooth</l>
<l>Behove all us (who ryghtly are instructed in the sooth)     </l>
<l>To thinke and say that God alone is he that rules all things</l>
<l>And worketh all in all, as lord of lords and king of kings,</l>
<l>With whom there are none other Gods that any sway may beare,</l>
<l>No fatall law to bynd him by, no fortune for to feare.</l>
<l>For Gods, and fate, and fortune are the termes of heathennesse,   </l>
<l>If men usurp them in the sense that Paynims doo expresse.</l>
<l>But if wee will reduce their sense to ryght of <placeName key="tgn,2000780">Christian</placeName> law,</l>
<l>To signifie three other things theis termes wee well may draw.</l>
<l>By Gods wee understand all such as God hath plaast in cheef</l>
<l>Estate to punish sin, and for the godly folkes releef:      </l>
<l>By fate the order which is set and stablished in things</l>
<l>By Gods eternall will and word, which in due season brings</l>
<l>All matters to their falling out. Which falling out or end</l>
<l>(Bicause our curious reason is too weake to comprehend</l>
<l>The cause and order of the same, and dooth behold it fall   </l>
<l>Unwares to us) by name of chaunce or fortune wee it call.</l>
<l>If any man will say theis things may better lerned bee</l>
<l>Out of divine philosophie or scripture, I agree</l>
<l>That nothing may in worthinesse with holy writ compare.</l>
<l>Howbeeit so farre foorth as things no whit impeachment are</l>
<l>To vertue and to godlynesse but furtherers of the same,</l>
<l>I trust wee may them saufly use without desert of blame.</l>
<l>And yet there are (and those not of the rude and vulgar sort,</l>
<l>But such as have of godlynesse and lerning good report)</l>
<l>That thinke the Poets tooke their first occasion of theis things  </l>
<l>From holy writ as from the well from whence all wisdome springs.</l>
<l>What man is he but would suppose the author of this booke</l>
<l>The first foundation of his woorke from Moyses wryghtings tooke?</l>
<l>Not only in effect he dooth with Genesis agree,</l>
<l>But also in the order of creation, save that hee </l>
<l>Makes no distinction of the dayes. For what is else at all</l>
<l>That shapelesse, rude, and pestred heape which Chaos he dooth call,</l>
<l>Than even that universall masse of things which God did make</l>
<l>In one whole lump before that ech their proper place did take.</l>
<l>Of which the Byble saith, that in the first beginning God        </l>
<l>Made heaven and earth: the earth was waste, and darknesse yit abod</l>
<l>Uppon the deepe: which holy woordes declare unto us playne</l>
<l>That fyre, ayre, water, and the earth did undistinct remayne</l>
<l>In one grosse bodie at the first.</l>
<l>"For God the father that</l>
<l>Made all things, framing out the world according to the plat,    </l>
<l>Conceyved everlastingly in mynd, made first of all</l>
<l>Both heaven and earth uncorporall and such as could not fall</l>
<l>As objects under sense of sight: and also aire lykewyse,</l>
<l>And emptynesse: and for theis twaine apt termes he did devyse.</l>
<l>He called ayer darknesse: for the ayre by kynd is darke.          </l>
<l>And emptynesse by name of depth full aptly he did marke:</l>
<l>For emptynesse is deepe and waste by nature. Overmore</l>
<l>He formed also bodylesse (as other things before)</l>
<l>The natures both of water and of spirit. And in fyne</l>
<l>The lyght: which beeing made to bee a patterne most divine        </l>
<l>Whereby to forme the fixed starres and wandring planets seven,</l>
<l>With all the lyghts that afterward should beawtifie the heaven,</l>
<l>Was made by God both bodylesse and of so pure a kynd,</l>
<l>As that it could alonly bee perceyved by the mynd."</l>
<l>To thys effect are Philos words. And certainly this same     </l>
<l>Is it that Poets in their worke confused Chaos name.</l>
<l>Not that Gods woorkes at any tyme were pact confusedly</l>
<l>Toogither: but bicause no place nor outward shape whereby</l>
<l>To shew them to the feeble sense of mans deceytfull syght</l>
<l>Was yit appointed unto things, untill that by his myght      </l>
<l>And wondrous wisdome God in tyme set open to the eye</l>
<l>The things that he before all tyme had everlastingly</l>
<l>Decreed by his providence. But let us further see</l>
<l>How Ovids scantlings with the whole true patterne doo agree.</l>
<l>The first day by his mighty word (sayth Moyses) God made lyght,  </l>
<l>The second day the firmament, which heaven or welkin hyght.</l>
<l>The third day he did part the earth from sea and made it drie,</l>
<l>Commaunding it to beare all kynd of frutes abundantly.</l>
<l>The fowrth day he did make the lyghts of heaven to shyne from hye,</l>
<l>And stablished a law in them to rule their courses by.       </l>
<l>The fifth day he did make the whales and fishes of the deepe,</l>
<l>With all the birds and fethered fowles that in the aire doo keepe,</l>
<l>The sixth day God made every beast both wyld and tame, and woormes</l>
<l>That creept on ground according to their severall kynds and foormes.</l>
<l>And in the image of himself he formed man of clay             </l>
<l>To bee the Lord of all his woorkes the very selfsame day.</l>
<l>This is the sum of Moyses woords. And <placeName key="tgn,2071526">Ovid</placeName> (whether it were</l>
<l>By following of the text aright, or that his mynd did beare</l>
<l>Him witnesse that there are no Gods but one) dooth playne uphold</l>
<l>That God (although he knew him not) was he that did unfold    </l>
<l>The former Chaos, putting it in forme and facion new,</l>
<l>As may appeere by theis his woordes which underneath ensew:</l>
<l>"This stryfe did God and nature breake and set in order dew.</l>
<l>The earth from heaven, the sea from earth he parted orderly,</l>
<l>And from the thicke and foggie aire he tooke the lyghtsome skye."  </l>
<l>In theis few lynes he comprehends the whole effect of that</l>
<l>Which God did woork the first three dayes about this noble plat.</l>
<l>And then by distributions he entreateth by and by</l>
<l>More largely of the selfsame things, and paynts them out to eye</l>
<l>With all their bounds and furniture: and whereas wee doo fynd    </l>
<l>The terme of nature joynd with God: (according to the mynd</l>
<l>Of lerned men) by joyning so, is ment none other thing,</l>
<l>But God the Lord of nature who did all in order bring.</l>
<l>The distributions beeing doone right lernedly, anon</l>
<l>To shew the other three dayes workes he thus proceedeth on:  </l>
<l>"The heavenly soyle to Goddes and starres and planets first he gave</l>
<l>The waters next both fresh and salt he let the fishes have.</l>
<l>The suttle ayre to flickering fowles and birds he hath assignd,</l>
<l>The earth to beasts both wyld and tame of sundry sorts and kynd."</l>
<l>Thus partly in the outward phrase, but more in verie deede,  </l>
<l>He seemes according to the sense of scripture to proceede.</l>
<l>And when he commes to speake of man, he dooth not vainly say</l>
<l>(As sum have written) that he was before all tyme for ay,</l>
<l>Ne mentioneth mo Gods than one in making him. But thus</l>
<l>He both in sentence and in sense his meening dooth discusse.  </l>
<l>"Howbeeit yit of all this whyle the creature wanting was</l>
<l>Farre more divine, of nobler mynd, which should the resdew passe</l>
<l>In depth of knowledge, reason, wit and hygh capacitee,</l>
<l>And which of all the resdew should the Lord and ruler bee.</l>
<l>Then eyther he that made the world and things in order set,  </l>
<l>Of heavenly seede engendred man: or else the earth as yet</l>
<l>Yoong, lusty, fresh, and in her flowre, and parted from the skye</l>
<l>But late before, the seedes thereof as yit hild inwardly.</l>
<l>The which Prometheus tempring streyght with water of the spring,</l>
<l>Did make in likenesse to the Goddes that governe every thing."    </l>
<l>What other thing meenes <placeName key="tgn,2071526">Ovid</placeName> heere by terme of heavenly seede,</l>
<l>Than mans immortall sowle, which is divine, and commes in deede</l>
<l>From heaven, and was inspyrde by God, as Moyses sheweth playne?</l>
<l>And whereas of Prometheus he seemes to adde a vayne</l>
<l>Devyce, as though he ment that he had formed man of clay, </l>
<l>Although it bee a tale put in for pleasure by the way:</l>
<l>Yit by th'interpretation of the name we well may gather,</l>
<l>He did include a misterie and secret meening rather.</l>
<l>This woord Prometheus signifies a person sage and wyse,</l>
<l>Of great foresyght, who headily will nothing enterpryse.    </l>
<l>It was the name of one that first did images invent:</l>
<l>Of whom the Poets doo report that hee to heaven up went,</l>
<l>And there stole fyre, through which he made his images alyve:</l>
<l>And therfore that he formed men the Paynims did contryve.</l>
<l>Now when the Poet red perchaunce that God almyghty by       </l>
<l>His providence and by his woord (which everlastingly</l>
<l>Is ay his wisdome) made the world, and also man to beare</l>
<l>His image, and to bee the lord of all the things that were</l>
<l>Erst made, and that he shaped him of earth or slymy clay:</l>
<l>Hee tooke occasion in the way of fabling for to say        </l>
<l>That wyse Prometheus tempring earth with water of the spring,</l>
<l>Did forme it lyke the Gods above that governe every thing.</l>
<l>Thus may Prometheus seeme to bee th'eternall woord of God,</l>
<l>His wisdom, and his providence which formed man of clod.</l>
<l>"And where all other things behold the ground with groveling eye: </l>
<l>He gave to man a stately looke replete with majesty:</l>
<l>And willd him to behold the heaven with countnance cast on hye,</l>
<l>To mark and understand what things are in the starrie skye."</l>
<l>In theis same woordes, both parts of man the Poet dooth expresse</l>
<l>As in a glasse, and giveth us instruction to addresse       </l>
<l>Our selves to know our owne estate: as that wee bee not borne</l>
<l>To follow lust, or serve the paunch lyke brutish beasts forlorne,</l>
<l>But for to lyft our eyes as well of body as of mynd</l>
<l>To heaven as to our native soyle from whence wee have by kynd</l>
<l>Our better part: and by the sight thereof to lerne to know  </l>
<l>And knowledge him that dwelleth there: and wholly to bestow</l>
<l>Our care and travail to the prayse and glorie of his name</l>
<l>Who for the sakes of mortall men created first the same.</l>
<l>Moreover by the golden age what other thing is ment,</l>
<l>Than <placeName key="tgn,1002137">Adams</placeName> tyme in Paradyse, who beeing innocent            </l>
<l>Did lead a blist and happy lyfe untill that thurrough sin</l>
<l>He fell from God? From which tyme foorth all sorrow did begin.</l>
<l>The earth accursed for his sake, did never after more</l>
<l>Yeeld foode without great toyle. Both heate and cold did vexe him sore.</l>
<l>Disease of body, care of mynd, with hunger, thirst and neede,  </l>
<l>Feare, hope, joy, greefe, and trouble, fell on him and on his seede.</l>
<l>And this is termd the silver age. Next which there did succeede</l>
<l>The brazen age, when malice first in peoples harts did breede,</l>
<l>Which never ceased growing till it did so farre outrage,</l>
<l>That nothing but destruction could the heate thereof asswage  </l>
<l>For why mens stomackes wexing hard as steele ageinst their God,</l>
<l>Provoked him from day to day to strike them with his rod.</l>
<l>Prowd Gyants also did aryse that with presumptuous wills</l>
<l>Heapt wrong on wrong, and sin on sin lyke huge and lofty hilles</l>
<l>Whereby they strove to clymb to heaven and God from thence to draw, </l>
<l>In scorning of his holy woord and breaking natures law.</l>
<l>For which anon ensewd the flood which overflowed all</l>
<l>The whole round earth and drowned quyght all creatures great and smal,</l>
<l>Excepting feaw that God did save as seede wherof should grow</l>
<l>Another ofspring. All these things the Poet heere dooth show  </l>
<l>In colour, altring both the names of persons, tyme and place.</l>
<l>For where according to the truth of scripture in this cace,</l>
<l>The universall flood did fall but sixteene hundred yeeres</l>
<l>And six and fifty after the creation (as appeeres</l>
<l>By reckening of the ages of the fathers) under Noy,          </l>
<l>With whom seven other persons mo like saufgard did enjoy</l>
<l>Within the arke, which at the end of one whole yeere did stay</l>
<l>Uppon the hilles of <placeName key="tgn,7006651">Armenie</placeName>: the Poet following ay</l>
<l>The fables of the glorying Greekes (who shamelessely did take</l>
<l>The prayse of all things to themselves) in fablying wyse dooth make </l>
<l>It happen in Deucalions tyme, who reignd in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName></l>
<l>Eyght hundred winters since Noyes flood or thereupon well nye,</l>
<l>Bicause that in the reigne of him a myghty flood did fall,</l>
<l>That drownde the greater part of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, townes, cattell, folk, and all,</l>
<l>Save feaw that by the help of boats atteyned unto him        </l>
<l>And to the highest of the forkt Parnasos top did swim.</l>
<l>And forbycause that hee and his were driven a whyle to dwell</l>
<l>Among the stonny hilles and rocks until the water fell,</l>
<l>The Poets hereupon did take occasion for to feyne,</l>
<l>That he and <placeName key="perseus,Pyrrha">Pyrrha</placeName> did repayre mankynd of stones ageyne.     </l>
<l>So in the sixth booke afterward Amphions harp is sayd</l>
<l>The first foundation of the walles of Thebee to have layd,</l>
<l>Bycause that by his eloquence and justice (which are ment</l>
<l>By true accord of harmonie and musicall consent)</l>
<l>He gathered into Thebee towne, and in due order knit         </l>
<l>The people that disperst and rude in hilles and rocks did sit.</l>
<l>So Orphey in the tenth booke is reported to delyght</l>
<l>The savage beasts, and for to hold the fleeting birds from flyght,</l>
<l>To move the senselesse stones, and stay swift rivers, and to make</l>
<l>The trees to follow after him and for his musick sake         </l>
<l>To yeeld him shadow where he went. By which is signifyde</l>
<l>That in his doctrine such a force and sweetnesse was implyde,</l>
<l>That such as were most wyld, stowre, feerce, hard, witlesse, rude, and bent</l>
<l>Ageinst good order, were by him perswaded to relent,</l>
<l>And for to bee conformable to live in reverent awe               </l>
<l>Like neybours in a common weale by justyce under law.</l>
<l>Considring then of things before reherst the whole effect,</l>
<l>I trust there is already shewd sufficient to detect</l>
<l>That Poets tooke the ground of all their cheefest fables out</l>
<l>Of scripture: which they shadowing with their gloses went about   </l>
<l>To turne the truth to toyes and lyes. And of the selfsame rate</l>
<l>Are also theis: their Phlegeton, their Styx, their blisfull state</l>
<l>Of spirits in th'Elysian feelds. Of which the former twayne</l>
<l>Seeme counterfetted of the place where damned soules remaine,</l>
<l>Which wee call hell. The third dooth seeme to fetch his pedegree    </l>
<l>From Paradyse which scripture shewes a place of blisse to bee.</l>
<l>If Poets then with leesings and with fables shadowed so</l>
<l>The certeine truth, what letteth us to plucke those visers fro</l>
<l>Their doings, and to bring ageine the darkened truth to lyght,</l>
<l>That all men may behold thereof the cleernesse shining bryght?    </l>
<l>The readers therefore earnestly admonisht are to bee</l>
<l>To seeke a further meening than the letter gives to see.</l>
<l>The travail tane in that behalf although it have sum payne</l>
<l>Yit makes it double recompence with pleasure and with gayne.</l>
<l>With pleasure, for varietie and straungenesse of the things,      </l>
<l>With gaine, for good instruction which the understanding brings.</l>
<l>And if they happening for to meete with any wanton woord</l>
<l>Or matter lewd, according as the person dooth avoord</l>
<l>In whom the evill is describde, doo feele their myndes thereby</l>
<l>Provokte to vyce and wantonnesse, (as nature commonly            </l>
<l>Is prone to evill) let them thus imagin in their mynd:</l>
<l>Behold, by sent of reason and by perfect syght I fynd</l>
<l>A Panther heere, whose peinted cote with yellow spots like gold</l>
<l>And pleasant smell allure myne eyes and senses to behold.</l>
<l>But well I know his face is grim and feerce, which he dooth hyde    </l>
<l>To this intent, that whyle I thus stand gazing on his hyde,</l>
<l>He may devour mee unbewares. Ne let them more offend</l>
<l>At vices in this present woork in lyvely colours pend,</l>
<l>Than if that in a chrystall glasse fowle images they found,</l>
<l>Resembling folkes fowle visages that stand about it round.       </l>
<l>For sure theis fables are not put in wryghting to th'entent</l>
<l>To further or allure to vyce: but rather this is ment,</l>
<l>That men beholding what they bee when vyce dooth reigne in stead</l>
<l>Of vertue, should not let their lewd affections have the head.</l>
<l>For as there is no creature more divine than man as long          </l>
<l>As reason hath the sovereintie and standeth firme and strong:</l>
<l>So is there none more beastly, vyle, and develish, than is hee,</l>
<l>If reason giving over, by affection mated bee.</l>
<l>The use of this same booke therfore is this: that every man</l>
<l>(Endevoring for to know himself as neerly as he can,)            </l>
<l>(As though he in a chariot sate well ordered,) should direct</l>
<l>His mynd by reason in the way of vertue, and correct</l>
<l>His feerce affections with the bit of temprance, lest perchaunce</l>
<l>They taking bridle in the teeth lyke wilfull jades doo praunce</l>
<l>Away, and headlong carie him to every filthy pit                 </l>
<l>Of vyce, and drinking of the same defyle his soule with it:</l>
<l>Or else doo headlong harrie him uppon the rockes of sin,</l>
<l>And overthrowing forcibly the chariot he sits in,</l>
<l>Doo teare him woorse than ever was Hippolytus the sonne</l>
<l>Of Theseus when he went about his fathers wrath to shun.          </l>
<l>This worthie worke in which of good examples are so many,</l>
<l>This Ortyard of Alcinous in which there wants not any</l>
<l>Herb, tree, or frute that may mans use for health or pleasure serve,</l>
<l>This plenteous horne of Acheloy which justly dooth deserve</l>
<l>To beare the name of treasorie of knowledge, I present            </l>
<l>To your good Lordship once ageine not as a member rent</l>
<l>Or parted from the resdew of the body any more:</l>
<l>But fully now accomplished, desiring you therfore</l>
<l>To let your noble courtesie and favor countervayle</l>
<l>My faults where Art or eloquence on my behalf dooth fayle.        </l>
<l>For sure the marke whereat I shoote is neyther wreathes of bay,</l>
<l>Nor name of Poet, no nor meede: but cheefly that it may</l>
<l>Bee lyked well of you and all the wise and lerned sort,</l>
<l>And next that every wyght that shall have pleasure for to sport</l>
<l>Him in this gardeine, may as well beare wholsome frute away       </l>
<l>As only on the pleasant flowres his rechlesse senses stay.</l>
<l>But why seeme I theis doubts to cast, as if that he who tooke</l>
<l>With favor and with gentlenesse a parcell of the booke</l>
<l>Would not likewyse accept the whole? Or even as if that they</l>
<l>Who doo excell in wisdome and in learning, would not wey </l>
<l>A wyse and lerned woorke aryght? Or else as if that I</l>
<l>Ought ay to have a speciall care how all men doo apply</l>
<l>My dooings to their owne behoof? As of the former twayne</l>
<l>I have great hope and confidence: so would I also fayne</l>
<l>The other should according to good meening find successe:       </l>
<l>If other wyse, the fault is theyrs not myne they must confesse.</l>
<l>And therefore breefly to conclude, I turne ageine to thee,</l>
<l>O noble <placeName key="tgn,1004441">Erle</placeName> of Leycester, whose lyfe God graunt may bee</l>
<l>As long in honor, helth and welth as auncient Nestors was,</l>
<l>Or rather as Tithonussis: that all such students as            </l>
<l>Doo travell to enrich our toong with knowledge heretofore</l>
<l>Not common to our vulgar speech, may dayly more and more</l>
<l>Procede through thy good furtherance and favor in the same.</l>
<l>To all mens profit and delyght, and thy eternall fame.</l>
<l>And that (which is a greater thing) our natyve country may     </l>
<l>Long tyme enjoy thy counsell and thy travail to her stay.</l>
<l>At Barwicke the xx. of Aprill. </l>
<l>Your good L. most humbly to</l>
<l>commaund Arthur Golding.</l>
<l>I would not wish the simple sort offended for to bee,</l>
<l>When in this booke the heathen names of feyned Godds they see.</l>
<l>The trewe and everliving God the Paynims did not knowe:</l>
<l>Which caused them the name of Godds on creatures to bestow.</l>
<l>For nature beeing once corrupt and knowledge blynded quyght  </l>
<l>By Adams fall, those little seedes and sparkes of heavenly lyght</l>
<l>That did as yit remayne in man, endevering foorth to burst</l>
<l>And wanting grace and powre to growe to that they were at furst,</l>
<l>To superstition did decline: and drave the fearefull mynd,</l>
<l>Straunge woorshippes of the living God in creatures for to fynd.    </l>
<l>The which by custome taking roote, and growing so to strength,</l>
<l>Through Sathans help possest the hartes of all the world at length.</l>
<l>Some woorshipt al the hoste of heaven: some deadmens ghostes and bones:</l>
<l>Sum wicked feends: sum wormes and fowles, herbes, fishes, trees and stones.</l>
<l>The fyre, the ayre, the sea, the land, and every roonning brooke,    </l>
<l>Eche queachie grove, eche cragged cliffe the name of Godhead tooke.</l>
<l>The nyght and day, the fleeting howres, the seasons of the yeere,</l>
<l>And every straunge and monstruous thing, for Godds mistaken weere.</l>
<l>There was no vertue, no nor vice: there was no gift of mynd</l>
<l>Or bodye, but some God therto or Goddesse was assignde.      </l>
<l>Of health and sicknesse, lyfe and death, of needinesse and wealth,</l>
<l>Of peace and warre, of love and hate, of murder, craft and stealth,</l>
<l>Of bread and wyne, of slouthfull sleepe, and of theyr solemne games,</l>
<l>And every other tryfling toy theyr Goddes did beare the names.</l>
<l>And looke, how every man was bent to goodnesse or to ill, </l>
<l>He did surmyse his foolish Goddes enclyning to his will.</l>
<l>For God perceyving mannes pervers and wicked will to sinne</l>
<l>Did give him over to his lust to sinke or swim therin.</l>
<l>By meanes wherof it came to passe (as in this booke yee see)</l>
<l>That all theyr Goddes with whoordome, theft, or murder blotted bee. </l>
<l>Which argues them to bee no Goddes, but woorser in effect</l>
<l>Than they whoose open poonnishment theyr dooings dooth detect.</l>
<l>Whoo seeing Jove whom heathen folke doo arme with triple fyre</l>
<l>In shape of Eagle, bull or swan to winne his foule desyre,</l>
<l>Or grysly Mars theyr God of warre intangled in a net </l>
<l>By Venus husband purposely to trappe him warely set,</l>
<l>Whoo seeing Saturne eating up the children he begate</l>
<l>Or Venus dalying wantonly with every lustie mate,</l>
<l>Whoo seeing Juno play the scold, or Phoebus moorne and rew</l>
<l>For losse of her whom in his rage through jealous moode he slew,    </l>
<l>Or else the suttle Mercurie that beares the charmed rod</l>
<l>Conveying neate and hyding them, would take him for a God?</l>
<l>For if theis faultes in mortall men doo justly merit blame,</l>
<l>What greater madnesse can there bee than to impute the same</l>
<l>To Goddes, whose natures ought to bee most perfect, pure and bright, </l>
<l>Most vertuous, holly, chaast, and wyse, most full of grace and lyght?</l>
<l>But as there is no Christen man that can surmyse in mynd</l>
<l>That theis or other such are Goddes which are no Goddes by kynd:</l>
<l>So would to God there were not now of christen men profest,</l>
<l>That worshipt in theyr deedes theis Godds whose names they doo detest. </l>
<l>Whoose lawes wee keepe his thralles wee bee, and he our God indeede.</l>
<l>So long is Christ our God as wee in christen lyfe proceede.</l>
<l>But if wee yeeld to fleshlye lust, to lucre, or to wrath,</l>
<l>Or if that Envy, Gluttony, or Pryde the maystry hath,</l>
<l>Or any other kynd of sinne, the thing the which wee serve </l>
<l>To bee accounted for our God most justly dooth deserve.</l>
<l>Then must wee thinke the learned men that did theis names frequent,</l>
<l>Some further things and purposes by those devises ment.</l>
<l>By Jove and Juno understand all states of princely port:</l>
<l>By Ops and Saturne auncient folke that are of elder sort: </l>
<l>By Phoebus yoong and lusty brutes of hand and courage stout:</l>
<l>By Mars the valeant men of warre that love to feight it out:</l>
<l>By Pallas and the famous troupe of all the Muses nyne,</l>
<l>Such folke as in the sciences and vertuous artes doo shyne.</l>
<l>By Mercurie the suttle sort that use to filch and lye,      </l>
<l>With theeves, and Merchants whoo to gayne theyr travail doo applye.</l>
<l>By Bacchus all the meaner trades and handycraftes are ment:</l>
<l>By Venus such as of the fleshe to filthie lust are bent.</l>
<l>By Neptune such as keepe the seas: by Phebe maydens chast,</l>
<l>And Pilgrims such as wandringly theyr tyme in travell waste.  </l>
<l>By Pluto such as delve in mynes, and Ghostes of persones dead:</l>
<l>By Vulcane smythes and such as woorke in yron, tynne or lead.</l>
<l>By Hecat witches, Conjurers, and Necromancers reede:</l>
<l>With all such vayne and devlish artes as superstition breede.</l>
<l>By Satyres, Sylvanes, Nymphes and Faunes with other such besyde, </l>
<l>The playne and simple country folke that every where abyde.</l>
<l>I know theis names to other thinges oft may and must agree</l>
<l>In declaration of the which I will not tedious bee.</l>
<l>But leave them to the Readers will to take in sundry wyse,</l>
<l>As matter rysing giveth cause constructions to devyse.      </l>
<l>Now when thou readst of God or man, in stone, in beast, or tree</l>
<l>It is a myrrour for thy self thyne owne estate to see.</l>
<l>For under feyned names of Goddes it was the Poets guyse,</l>
<l>The vice and faultes of all estates to taunt in covert wyse.</l>
<l>And likewyse to extoll with prayse such things as doo deserve,  </l>
<l>Observing alwayes comlynesse from which they doo not swerve.</l>
<l>And as the persone greater is of birth, renowne or fame,</l>
<l>The greater ever is his laud, or fouler is his shame,</l>
<l>For if the States that on the earth the roome of God supply,</l>
<l>Declyne from vertue unto vice and live disorderly,           </l>
<l>To Eagles, Tygres, Bulles, and Beares, and other figures straunge</l>
<l>Bothe to theyr people and themselves most hurtfull doo they chaunge,</l>
<l>And when the people give themselves to filthie life and synne,</l>
<l>What other kinde of shape thereby than filthie can they winne?</l>
<l>So was Licaon made a Woolfe: and Jove became a Bull:         </l>
<l>The t'one for using crueltie, the tother for his trull.</l>
<l>So was Elpenor and his mates transformed into swyne,</l>
<l>For following of theyr filthie lust in women and in wyne.</l>
<l>Not that they lost theyr manly shape as to the outward showe,</l>
<l>But for that in their brutish brestes most beastly lustes did growe.   </l>
<l>For why this lumpe of flesh and bones, this bodie, is not wee.</l>
<l>Wee are a thing which earthly eyes denyed are to see.</l>
<l>Our soule is wee endewd by God with reason from above:</l>
<l>Our bodie is but as our house, in which wee worke and move.</l>
<l>T'one part is common to us all, with God of heaven himself:</l>
<l>The tother common with the beastes, a vyle and stinking pelf.</l>
<l>The t'one bedect with heavenly giftes and endlesse: tother grosse,</l>
<l>Frayle, filthie, weake, and borne to dye as made of earthly drosse.</l>
<l>Now looke how long this clod of clay to reason dooth obey,</l>
<l>So long for men by just desert account our selves wee may.       </l>
<l>But if wee suffer fleshly lustes as lawlesse Lordes to reigne,</l>
<l>Than are we beastes, wee are no men, wee have our name in vaine.</l>
<l>And if wee be so drownd in vice that feeling once bee gone,</l>
<l>Then may it well of us bee sayd, wee are a block or stone.</l>
<l>This surely did the Poets meene when in such sundry wyse          </l>
<l>The pleasant tales of turned shapes they studyed to devyse.</l>
<l>There purpose was to profite men, and also to delyght</l>
<l>And so to handle every thing as best might like the sight.</l>
<l>For as the Image portrayd out in simple whight and blacke</l>
<l>(Though well proportiond, trew and faire) if comly colours lacke,  </l>
<l>Delyghteth not the eye so much, nor yet contentes the mynde</l>
<l>So much as that that shadowed is with colours in his kynde:</l>
<l>Even so a playne and naked tale or storie simply told</l>
<l>(Although the matter bee in deede of valewe more than gold)</l>
<l>Makes not the hearer so attent to print it in his hart,          </l>
<l>As when the thing is well declarde, with pleasant termes and art.</l>
<l>All which the Poets knew right well: and for the greater grace,</l>
<l>As Persian kings did never go abrode with open face,</l>
<l>But with some lawne or silken skarf, for reverence of theyr state:</l>
<l>Even so they following in their woorkes the selfsame trade and rate,  </l>
<l>Did under covert names and termes theyr doctrines so emplye,</l>
<l>As that it is ryght darke and hard theyr meening to espye.</l>
<l>But beeing found it is more sweete and makes the mynd more glad,</l>
<l>Than if a man of tryed gold a treasure gayned had.</l>
<l>For as the body hath his joy in pleasant smelles and syghts:      </l>
<l>Even so in knowledge and in artes the mynd as much delights.</l>
<l>Wherof aboundant hoordes and heapes in Poets packed beene</l>
<l>So hid that (saving unto fewe) they are not to bee seene.</l>
<l>And therfore whooso dooth attempt the Poets woorkes to reede,</l>
<l>Must bring with him a stayed head and judgement to proceede.     </l>
<l>For as there bee most wholsome hestes and precepts to bee found,</l>
<l>So are theyr rockes and shallowe shelves to ronne the ship aground.</l>
<l>Some naughtie persone seeing vyce shewd lyvely in his hew,</l>
<l>These persons overshoote themselves, and other folkes deceyve:</l>
<l>Dooth take occasion by and by like vices to ensew.</l>
<l>Another beeing more severe than wisdome dooth requyre, </l>
<l>Beeholding vice (to outward shewe) exalted in desyre,</l>
<l>Condemneth by and by the booke and him that did it make.</l>
<l>And willes it to be burnd with fyre for lewd example sake.</l>
<l>Not able of the authors mynd the meening to conceyve.      </l>
<l>The Authors purpose is to paint and set before our eyes</l>
<l>The lyvely Image of the thoughts that in our stomackes ryse.</l>
<l>Eche vice and vertue seems to speake and argue to our face,</l>
<l>With such perswasions as they have theyr dooinges to embrace.</l>
<l>And if a wicked persone seeme his vices to exalt,           </l>
<l>Esteeme not him that wrate the woorke in such defaultes to halt.</l>
<l>But rather with an upryght eye consyder well thy thought:</l>
<l>See if corrupted nature have the like within thee wrought.</l>
<l>Marke what affection dooth perswade in every kynd of matter.</l>
<l>Judge if that even in heynous crymes thy fancy doo not flatter.  </l>
<l>And were it not for dread of lawe or dread of God above,</l>
<l>Most men (I feare) would doo the things that fond affections move.</l>
<l>Then take theis woorkes as fragrant flowers most full of pleasant juce,</l>
<l>The which the Bee conveying home may put to wholesome use:</l>
<l>And which the spyder sucking on to poyson may convert,      </l>
<l>Through venym spred in all her limbes and native in her hart.</l>
<l>For to the pure and Godly mynd, are all things pure and cleene,</l>
<l>And unto such as are corrupt the best corrupted beene:</l>
<l>Lyke as the fynest meates and drinkes that can bee made by art</l>
<l>In sickly folkes to nourishment of sicknesse doo convert.   </l>
<l>And therefore not regarding such whose dyet is so fyne</l>
<l>That nothing can digest with them onlesse it bee devine,</l>
<l>Nor such as to theyr proper harme doo wrest and wring awrye</l>
<l>The thinges that to a good intent are written pleasantly,</l>
<l>Through Ovids woorke of turned shapes I have with peinfull pace  </l>
<l>Past on untill I had atteyned the end of all my race.</l>
<l>And now I have him made so well acquainted with our toong</l>
<l>As that he may in English verse as in his owne bee soong.</l>
<l>Wherein although for pleasant style, I cannot make account,</l>
<l>To match myne author, who in that all other dooth surmount:  </l>
<l>Yit (gentle Reader) doo I trust my travail in this cace</l>
<l>May purchace favour in thy sight my dooings to embrace:</l>
<l>Considring what a sea of goodes and Jewelles thou shalt fynd,</l>
<l>Not more delyghtfull to the eare than frutefull to the mynd.</l>
<l>For this doo lerned persons deeme, of Ovids present woorke:       </l>
<l>That in no one of all his bookes the which he wrate, doo lurke</l>
<l>Mo darke and secret misteries, mo counselles wyse and sage,</l>
<l>Mo good ensamples, mo reprooves of vyce in youth and age,</l>
<l>Mo fyne inventions to delight, mo matters clerkly knit,</l>
<l>No, nor more straunge varietie to shew a lerned wit.              </l>
<l>The high, the lowe: the riche, the poore: the mayster, and the slave:</l>
<l>The mayd, the wife: the man, the chyld: the simple and the brave:</l>
<l>The yoong, the old: the good, the bad: the warriour strong and stout:</l>
<l>The wyse, the foole: the countrie cloyne: the lerned and the lout:</l>
<l>And every other living wight shall in this mirrour see            </l>
<l>His whole estate, thoughtes, woordes and deedes expresly shewd to bee.</l>
<l>Whereof if more particular examples thou doo crave,</l>
<l>In reading the Epistle through thou shalt thy longing have.</l>
<l>Moreover thou mayst fynd herein descriptions of the tymes:</l>
<l>With constellacions of the starres and planettes in theyr clymes:  </l>
<l>The Sites of Countries, Cities, hilles, seas, forestes, playnes and floods:</l>
<l>The natures both of fowles, beastes, wormes, herbes, mettals, stones and woods,</l>
<l>And finally what ever thing is straunge and delectable,</l>
<l>The same conveyed shall you fynd most featly in some fable.</l>
<l>And even as in a cheyne eche linke within another wynds,          </l>
<l>And both with that that went before and that that followes binds:</l>
<l>So every tale within this booke dooth seeme to take his ground</l>
<l>Of that that was reherst before, and enters in the bound</l>
<l>Of that that folowes after it: and every one gives light</l>
<l>To other: so that whoo so meenes to understand them ryght,       </l>
<l>Must have a care as well to know the thing that went before,</l>
<l>As that the which he presently desyres to see so sore.</l>
<l>Now to th'intent that none have cause heereafter to complaine</l>
<l>Of mee as setter out of things that are but light and vaine,</l>
<l>If any stomacke be so weake as that it cannot brooke,             </l>
<l>The lively setting forth of things described in this booke,</l>
<l>I give him counsell to absteine untill he bee more strong,</l>
<l>And for to use Ulysses feat ageinst the Meremayds song.</l>
<l>Or if he needes will heere and sec and wilfully agree</l>
<l>(Through cause misconstrued) unto vice allured for to bee,    </l>
<l>Then let him also marke the peine that dooth therof ensue,</l>
<l>And hold himself content with that that to his fault is due.</l>
