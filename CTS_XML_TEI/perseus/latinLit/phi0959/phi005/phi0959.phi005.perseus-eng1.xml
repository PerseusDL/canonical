				<l>The title of this book when Cupid spied,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">The author endeavors, in this treatise, to make amends for the
						hurt he did in the former and proposes several remedies in the case of love;
						some of which are very good and useful as there are others very trivial, and
						not fit to be put in practice. <placeName key="tgn,2025973">Ovid</placeName>
						begins this treatise as agreeably as he has done the others, and, indeed,
						his invention is so fruitful that he never wants grace. Cupid seems
						frightened at the title of it, apprehending he is declaring war against
						him.</note></l>
				<l>"Treason! a plot against our state," he cried.</l>
				<l>Why should you thus your loyal poet wrong,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">No man understood the affairs of gallantry better than
						Ovid.</note></l>
				<l>Who in your war has serv'd so well and long?</l>
				<l>So savage and ill-bred I ne'er can prove,</l>
				<l>Like Diomede, to wound the queen of love.</l>
				<l>Others by fits have felt your am'rous flame,</l>
				<l>I still have been, and still your martyr am;</l>
				<l>Rules for your vot'ries I did late impart.</l>
				<l>Refining passion, and made love an art.</l>
				<l>Nor do I now of that or thee take leave,</l>
				<l>Nor does the muse her former web unweave.</l>
				<l>Let him who loves, where love success may find,</l>
				<l>Spread all his sails before the prosp'rous wind;</l>
				<l>But let poor youths who female scorn endure,</l>
				<l>And hopeless burn, repair to me for cure:</l>
				<l>For why should any worthy youth destroy</l>
				<l>Himself, because some worthless nymph is coy?</l>
				<l>Love should be nature's friend; let hemp and steel</l>
				<l>Hangmen and heroes use, whose trade's to kill.</l>
				<l>Where fatal it would prove, let passion cease;</l>
				<l>Nor love destroy, who should our race increase.</l>
				<l>A child you are, and like a child should play;</l>
				<l>And gentle as your years should be your sway.</l>
				<l>Keen arrows, and to wound the hardest hearts,</l>
				<l>You are permitted-but no mortal darts.</l>
				<l>Let your step-father, <placeName key="tgn,2090583">Mars</placeName>,<note

						Love (<bibl n="Ov. Ars 2.561">(2.561 ff)</bibl>.</note> on sword and
					spear,</l>
				<l>The crimson stains of cruel conquest wear;</l>
				<l>You should your mother's milder laws observe,</l>
				<l>Who ne'er did childless parent's curse deserve;</l>
				<l>Or if you must employ your wanton pow'r,</l>
				<l>Teach youths by night to force their mistress' door:</l>
				<l>How lovers safe and secretly may meet,</l>
				<l>And subtle wives the cautious husband cheat.</l>
				<l>Let now th' excluded youth the gate caress,</l>
				<l>A thousand wheedling soothing plaints express;</l>
				<l>Then on th' ill-natur'd timber vent his spite,</l>
				<l>And to some doleful tune weep out the night.</l>
				<l>For tears, not blood, love's altar should require:</l>
				<l>Love's torch, design'd to kindle kind desire,</l>
				<l>Must seem profan'd to light a fun'ral fire."</l>
				<l>Thus I. —— The god his purple wings display'd.</l>
				<l>And, "Forward, finish your design," he said. <milestone ed="p" n="41"
						unit="carte"/></l>
				<l>To me, ye injured youths, for help repair,</l>
				<l>Who hopeless languish for some cruel fair;</l>
				<l>I'll now unteach the art I taught before,</l>
				<l>The hand that wounded shall your health restore.</l>
				<l>One soil can herbs and pois'nous weeds disclose:</l>
				<l>The nettle oft is neighbour to the rose.</l>
				<l>Such was the cure the Arcadian hero found;<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">Telephys king of <placeName key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>,
						sun of Hercules and Auge, daughter of the king of <placeName
							key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>. He was called Telephus from his
						having been nursed by a doe in a wild place, where he was found by
						shepherds, who carried him to Corytus, king of <placeName key="tgn,7001399"
							>Thessaly</placeName>, by whom he was adopted for a son. When he had
						grown up to man's estate, he went to Delphos to enquire out his parents by
						the oracle, which bid him go to Theutras, kingn of <placeName
							key="tgn,7016748">Mysia</placeName>, where he should be informed of what
						he desired; he then found his mother Auge, and when his birth was known,
						great was the joy of the Mysian court. Theytras, who had no male issue, gave
						him his daughter Argiope in marriage and left him his successor in the
						kingdom at his death. The Trojan war happening nsome time after, the Greeks
						who did not know very well their way to <placeName key="perseus,Troy"
							>Troy</placeName>, landed in <placeName key="tgn,7016748"
							>Mysia</placeName>, where Telephus gave them battle, and wounded
						Ulysses; but was himself dangerously wounded by Achilles. Consulting the
						oracle about his cure, he was told he could never be cured, unless he was
						wounded again in the same place with the same lance; upon which he went to
							<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, whither the Greeks were
						returned, and promised Achilles to be his guide to <placeName
							key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> if he would cure him; accordingly
						the Grecian hero did cure him with the same lance that gave the wound.
						Diodorus Siculus tells this story in his fifth book.</note></l>
				<l>The Pelian spear that wounded, made him sound.</l>
				<l>But know, the rules that I to men prescribe,</l>
				<l>In like distress may serve the female tribe:</l>
				<l>And when beyond your sphere my methods go,</l>
				<l>You may, at least, infer what you should do.</l>
				<l>When flames beyond their useful bounds aspire,</l>
				<l>'Tis charity to quench the threat'ning fire.</l>
				<l>Nine visits to the shore poor Phillis made;</l>
				<l>Had I advis'd, the tenth she should have paid.</l>
				<l>Nor had Demophoon, when return'd from sea,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">He gives several instances of ladies who came to untimely ends
						through their impatience in their loves.</note></l>
				<l>For his expected bride embraced a tree,</l>
				<l>Nor Dido, from her flaming pile, by night,</l>
				<l>Discover'd her ungrateful Trojan's flight.</l>
				<l>Nor had that mother dire revenge pursu'd,</l>
				<l>Who in her offspring's blood her hands imbu'd.</l>
				<l>Fair Philomel, preserv'd from Tereus' rape<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">He was changed into a lapwing. The fable of Philomel is mentioned
						in the Art of Love.<bibl n="Ov. Ars 2.383">(2.383 f)</bibl></note></l>
				<l>Her honour she had kept, and he his shape.</l>
				<l>Pasiphae ne'er had felt such wild desire,</l>
				<l>Nor Phoedra suffered by incestuous fire.</l>
				<l>Let me the wanton <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName> take in
					hand,</l>
				<l>Helen shall be restor'd, and <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> shall
					stand.</l>
				<l>My wholesome precepts had lewd Scylla read,</l>
				<l>The purple lock had grown on Nisus' head.</l>
				<l>Learn, youths, from me, to curb the desp'rate force</l>
				<l>Of love, and steer, by my advice, your course.</l>
				<l>By reading me, you first receiv'd your bane;</l>
				<l>Now, for an antidote, read me again:</l>
				<l>From scornful beauty's chains I'll set you free,</l>
				<l>Consent but you to your own liberty.</l>
				<l>Phoebus, thou god of physic and of verse,</l>
				<l>Assist the healing numbers I rehearse;</l>
				<l>Direct at once my med'cines and my song,</l>
				<l>For to thy care both provinces belong. <milestone ed="p" n="79" unit="carte"
					/></l>
				<l>While the soft passion plays about your heart,</l>
				<l>Before the tickling venom turns to smart,</l>
				<l>Break then, (for then you may,) the treach'rous dart;</l>
				<l>Tear up the seeds of the unrooted ill</l>
				<l>While they are weak, and you have pow'r to kill.</l>
				<l>Beware delay: the tender-bladed grain,</l>
				<l>Shot up to stalk, can stand the wind and rain.</l>
				<l>The tree, whose branches now are grown too big</l>
				<l>For hands to bend, was set a slender twig;</l>
				<l>When planted, to your slightest touch 'twould yield,</l>
				<l>But now has fix'd possession of the field.</l>
				<l>Consider, ere to love you give the reins,</l>
				<l>If she's a mistress worth your future pains.</l>
				<l>While yet in breath, ere yet your nerves are broke,</l>
				<l>Cast from your gen'rous neck the shameful yoke!</l>
				<l>Check love's first symptoms, the weak foe surprise,</l>
				<l>Who, once entrench'd, will all your arts despise.</l>
				<l>Think, wretch, what you hereafter must endure,</l>
				<l>What certain toil, for an uncertain cure.</l>
				<l>Slip not one minute; who defers to day,</l>
				<l>To-morrow will be harden'd in delay.</l>
				<l>'Tis love's old practice still to sooth you on</l>
				<l>Till your disease gets strength, and till your</l>
				<l>strength is gone.</l>
				<l>Rivers small fountains have, and yet we find</l>
				<l>Vast seas, of those small fountain'd rivers join'd.</l>
				<l>Lock'd up in bark poor Myrrha ne'er had been,</l>
				<l>Had she the progress of her crime foreseen;</l>
				<l>But pleas'd with the soft kindling of love's fire,</l>
				<l>We day by day indulge the fond desire,</l>
				<l>Till like a serpent it has eat its way,</l>
				<l>And uncontroll'd does on our entrails prey.</l>
				<l>Yet if the proper season you have pass'd,</l>
				<l>Tho' hard the task, I'll use my skill at last;</l>
				<l>Nor see my patient perish by his grief,</l>
				<l>Because no sooner call'd to his relief.</l>
				<l>When Philoctetes first receiv'd his wound,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">He was born of Paean, and Hercules' faithful companion, who made
						him swear he would never discover where he lay buried, and gave him his
						arrows dipped in hydra's blood. The Greeks being told by the oracle that
						thsy should never conquer <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>
						until they found the fatal arrows, importuned Philoctetes to tell them where
						they were hid, which was in Hercules' tomb; and he discovered it by stamping
						on it with his foot, to keep himself from perjury. But he was wounded in the
						foot for his prevarication, by one of those arrows, when he went to the
						Trojan war. However, Marchaon cured him. Ulysses brought him to <placeName
							key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and boasted of it in the speech he
						made to the Grecian princes, when he demanded Achilles's arms.</note></l>
				<l>The venom'd part cut off, had sav'd the sound;</l>
				<l>Yet he, e'en after tedious years of grief,</l>
				<l>Was cur'd, and brought the fainting Greeks relief.</l>
				<l>Thus I, who charg'd you speedy means to use,</l>
				<l>Will none in last extremities refuse. <milestone ed="p" n="117" unit="carte"
					/></l>
				<l>Or try to quench the kindling flames, or stay</l>
				<l>Till the spent fury on itself doth prey.</l>
				<l>While in its full career, give scope to rage,</l>
				<l>And circumvent the force you can't engage.</l>
				<l>What pilot would against the current strive,</l>
				<l>When with a side course he may safely drive?</l>
				<l>Distemper'd minds, distracted with their grief,</l>
				<l>Take all for foes who offer them relief;</l>
				<l>But when the first fermenting smart is o'er,</l>
				<l>They suffer you to probe the ripen'd sore.</l>
				<l>'Tis madness a fond mother to dissuade</l>
				<l>From tears, while on his hearse her son is laid;</l>
				<l>But when grief's deluge can no higher swell,</l>
				<l>Declining sorrow you'll with ease repel.</l>
				<l>Cures have their times; the best that can be tried</l>
				<l>Inflame the wound, unseasonably applied.</l>
				<l>If therefore you expect to find redress,</l>
				<l>In the first place take leave of idleness;<note anchored="true" place="foot"
						resp="ed">An excellent remedy, and the most infallible in the distemper of
						love, which is begot by laziness and effeminacy.</note></l>
				<l>'Tis this that kindl'd first your fond desire,</l>
				<l>'Tis this brings fuel to the am'rous fire.</l>
				<l>Bar idleness, you ruin Cupid's game,</l>
				<l>You blunt his arrows, and you quench his flame.</l>
				<l>What wine to plain-trees, streams to poplars prove,</l>
				<l>Marshes to reeds, is idleness to love.</l>
				<l>Mind business, if your passion you'd destroy;</l>
				<l>Secure is he, who can himself employ.</l>
				<l>Sleep, drinking, gaming, for the foe make way,</l>
				<l>And to love's ambuscade the roving heart betray.</l>
				<l>The slothful he seeks out and makes his prize.</l>
				<l>Surely as he the mall of business flies.</l>
				<l>Make business then (no matter what) your care;</l>
				<l>Some dear friend's cause may want you at the bar;</l>
				<l>Or if your courage tempts you to the field,</l>
				<l>Love's wanton arms to rough campaigns will yield.</l>

				<l>Your sword as dreadful will to love appear,</l>

				<l>Th' adult'rous lust that did Aegisthus seize,<note anchored="true" place="foot"

				<l>Yoke oxen, plough the painful field, you'll find</l>
				<l>The wounded earth will cure your love-sick mind.</l>
				<l>Then trust your grain to the new-furrow'd soil,</l>
				<l>That with large int'rest will requite your toll.</l>
				<l>Behold what kind returns your fruit-trees send;</l>
				<l>Down to your hand the burden'd branches bend.</l>
				<l>Belold a murmuring brook thro' pastures glide,</l>
				<l>Behold the grazing sheep on either side;</l>
				<l>While in the shade his pipe the shepherd tries,</l>
				<l>The watchfull dog his master's cares supplies;</l>
				<l>With loud complaints another grove is till'd</l>
				<l>Of heifers lowing for their firstlings killd.</l>
				<l>What pleasure 'tis with smoke of yew to drive</l>
				<l>The mur'ring swarm, and seize the loaden hive.</l>
				<l>All seasons friendly to the swain are found;</l>
				<l>Autumn withfruit, with harvest summer's crown'd</l>
				<l>The spring's adorn'd with flowers to charm the eye</l>
				<l>And winter fires the absent sun supply.</l>
				<l>At certain times you'll see the vintage full,</l>
				<l>And for your wine-press may choice clusters cull;</l>
				<l>At certain times your ponderous sheafs may bind,</l>
				<l>Yet for the rake leave work enough behind.</l>
				<l>In mellow ground, your plants no wat'ring need;</l>
				<l>The thirsty you from neighb'ring springs may feed.</l>
				<l>Then, grafting, make old stocks sprout fresh and green,</l>
				<l>And various fruits in one proud branch be seen.</l>
				<l>When once these pleasures have your mind possess'd,</l>
				<l>Love soon departs like a neglected guest.</l>
				<l>Hunt, if the dull distemper you'd remove;</l>
				<l>Diana will too hard for Venus prove.</l>
				<l>Thro' all her doubling shifts the hare pursue,</l>
				<l>Or spread your toil upon the mountain's brew:</l>
				<l>E'en when the stag's at bay provoke his rage,</l>
				<l>Or with your spear the foaming boar engage.</l>
				<l>Thus tir'd, your rest at night will prove so deep,</l>
				<l>Dreams of your mistress ne'er will haunt your sleep.</l>
				<l>'Tis easier work, yet 'twill require your care,</l>
				<l>The feather'd game with birdlime to ensnare;</l>
				<l>Or else for fish your bearded hook to bait,</l>
				<l>And for your art's success with patience wait.</l>
				<l>Thro' sports like these you'll steal into relief,</l>
				<l>And while your time you cozen, cheat your grief. <milestone ed="p" n="213"

				<l>Or travel (tho' you find your fetter strong);</l>
				<l>Set out betimes; your journey must be long.</l>

				<l>But how much more unwilling to proceed,</l>
				<l>Compel your feet to so much greater speed.</l>

				<l>You'll call my precepts hard; I grant they are;</l>
				<l>But for dear health who would not hardships bear;</l>
				<l>When sick, the bitter potion I have ta'en;</l>
				<l>And, for the food I've fancied, begg'd in vain.</l>
				<l>Both steel and fire you'll patiently endure,</l>
				<l>And thirst, more scorching, for your body's cure.</l>
				<l>Can you, who thus your earthly part redeem,</l>
				<l>For your immortal mind have less esteem?</l>
				<l>Yet, for my patient's comfort, I must own,</l>
				<l>When this first stage he manfully has run,</l>
				<l>The half, the worst half of his task is done.</l>
				<l>Gall'd with the yoke, at first the heifer draws;</l>
				<l>The curb's first trial frets the courser's jaws.</l>
				<l>Perhaps to leave your father's house you'll mourn;</l>
				<l>Yet go; and think, when tempted to return,</l>
				<l>Your kindred but the false pretence is made;</l>
				<l>'Tis absence from your mistress does persuade.</l>
				<l>When once set out, diversions you will meet,</l>
				<l>Fair country prospects, and companions sweet.</l>
				<l>Nor only travel far, but tarry long;</l>
				<l>Nor once look homewards while your passion's strong.</l>
				<l>Rebellious love, if he perceives you halt,</l>
				<l>With greater fury will renew th' assault</l>
				<l>Half-famish'd passion will more fiercely prey</l>
				<l>And all your labor past be thrown away. <milestone ed="p" n="249" unit="carte"

				<l>You'll think, when thro' Hemonian fields you rove,</l>
				<l>That magic arts may yield a cure for love.</l>
				<l>Old tales, of witchcraft strange effects rehearse;</l>
				<l>The only charm I bring is sacred verse.</l>
				<l>By my advice no jargon shall be read,</l>

				<l>No standing crop to other fields shall range,</l>
				<l>No sick eclipse the sun's complexion change;</l>
				<l>Old Tyber shall his sacred course retain,</l>
				<l>And Cynthia, unmolested, gain her wain.</l>
				<l>No suffering heart to spells shall be oblig'd.</l>
				<l>Nor love resign, by sulphur streams besieg'd.</l>
				<l>Think on Medea, of all hopes bereft,</l>

				<l>And what did Circe's powerful drugs avail,<note anchored="true" place="foot"

				<l>In these soft terms, to her departing guest,</l>

				<l>Study no dress when she is to be seen,</l>

				<l>Nor trust her tears, though plenteous tears distil;</l>
				<l>Their eyes are disciplin'd to weep at will.</l>
