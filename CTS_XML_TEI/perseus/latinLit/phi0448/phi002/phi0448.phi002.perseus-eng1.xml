					<head>THE SUPPLEMENT of DIONYSIUS VOSSIUS TO CAESAR'S FIRST BOOK of THE CIVIL WAR. </head>
					<p>I think it needless to say any thing here, in opposition to those who
                        pretend, that the following Commentaries, concerning the Civil War, were not
                        penned by Caesar himself. We have not only the express testimony of
                        Suetonius to the contrary, but the very style sufficiently declares, that
                        Caesar alone could be the author of the work. There is room however to
                        suspect, from the abrupt manner in which the subject is introduced, that the
                        beginning of this first book is wanting: for history takes notice of several
                        previous facts, of which no mention is made here. I have therefore collected
                        out of Plutarch, Appian, and <placeName key="perseus,Dion">Dion</placeName>, as much as was necessary to connect
                        this and the former Commentary, and fancy it will not be disagreeable to the
                        reader, to offer it here by way of preface. <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> being wholly reduced, Caesar, upon
                        his arrival in <placeName key="tgn,7003237">Lombardy</placeName>, thought proper, for many
                        reasons, to send deputies to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to demand the consulship, and a
                        prolongation of his command. Pompey, who, though averse to Caesar's
                        interest, had not yet openly declared against him, neither furthered nor
                        opposed his request. But the consuls Marcellus and Lentulus, who had already
                        joined the party of his enemies, resolved by every method in their power to
                        frustrate the design. Marcellus scrupled not to add other injuries to that
                        of which we speak. For Caesar had lately planted a colony at Novocomum in
                        Cisalpine Gaul; and Marcellus, not satisfied with stripping the inhabitants
                        of the privilege of Roman citizens, seized one of their chief magistrates at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, ordered him to be scourged, and
                        then dismissed him to carry his complaints to Caesar, an ignominy from which
                        all free citizens were expressly exempted by the laws. While affairs were in
                        this train, C. Curio, tribune of the people, came to Caesar in <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. This nobleman, after many attempts
                        in behalf of the commonwealth, and to promote Caesar's interest; finding at
                        length all his endeavours without effect, fled from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to avoid the malice of his enemies,
                        and informed Caesar of all that was transacted against him. Caesar received
                        him with great marks of respect, as well on account of his rank in the
                        commonwealth, as the many services he had done himself and the state; and
                        thanked him for the signal zeal he had shown in his cause. But Curio advised
                        him, since his enemies were now openly preparing for war, to draw his army
                        together without delay, and rescue the commonwealth from the tyranny of an
                        aspiring faction. Caesar, though fully satisfied of the truth of Curio's
                        report, resolved to sacrifice all other considerations to the public
                        tranquillity, that no man might justly charge him with being the author of a
                        civil war. He therefore only petitioned by his friends, that the government
                        of Cisalpine Gaul and <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>, with the command of two
                        legions, might be continued to him, in all which his principal aim was, by
                        the equity of his demands, to induce his enemies to grant peace to the
                        commonwealth. These offers appeared so reasonable, that even Pompey himself
                        knew not how to oppose them. But the consuls still continuing inflexible,
                        Caesar wrote a letter to the senate, wherein, after briefly enumerating his
                        exploits and services, he requested them not to deprive him of the benefit
                        of the people's favour, who had permitted him to sue for the consulship in
                        his absence. He protested his readiness, if such was the resolution of the
                        senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to dismiss his army, provided
                        Pompey did the same: but could by no means resolve, so long as he continued
                        in command and authority, to divest himself of troops, and lay himself open
                        to the injuries of his enemies. Curio was commissoned to carry this letter,
                        who travelling with incredible despatch, reached <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> in three days (a distance of a
                        hundred and sixty miles,) before the beginning of January, and ere the
                        consuls could get any thing determined relating to Caesar's command. Curio,
                        upon his arrival, refused to part with the letter, resolving not to deliver
                        it but in full senate, and when the tribunes of the people were present: for
                        he was apprehensive, should he do otherwise, that the consuls would suppress
                        it. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="1" id="b1c1" type="chapter">
					<p>Caesar's letter being delivered to the consuls, the tribunes, with much
                        difficulty, procured it a reading in the senate; but could by no means
                        prevail to have his demands brought under deliberation. The consuls proposed
                        to debate upon the state of the republic. " Lentulus promised to stand by
                        the senate and the people, if they would deliver their sentiments with
                        freedom and courage; but if they regarded Caesar, and affected to court his
                        friendship, as had been the practice for some time past, he knew, he told
                        them, what he had to do, and was determined to disclaim their authority; not
                        doubting but he would find a ready admittance to the favour and protection
                        of Caesar." Scipio spoke much to the same purpose: "That Pompey was firmly
                        bent not to abandon the republic, if he found the senators ready to support
                        him; but if they cooled, or were remiss in their resolves, it would be in
                        vain for them to expect his aid, if they saw cause afterwards to apply for
                        it."</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="2" id="b1c2" type="chapter">
					<p> This speech of Scipio, as the senate was held in the city, and Pompey
                        resided in the suburbs, was considered as coming from Pompey's own mouth.
                        Some were for following milder counsels, of which number was M. Marcellus,
                        who gave it as his opinion: "That it was not proper to enter upon the
                        present deliberation, till troops were raised over all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and an army got ready, under whose
                        protection the senate might proceed with freedom and safety in their
                        debates." " Callidius was for sending Pompey to his government, to take away
                        all occasion of discord; because Caesar had reason to fear, as two of his
                        legions had been taken from him, that Pompey retained them in the
                        neighbourhood of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, with a view to employ them against
                        him." M. Rufus nearly agreed with Callidius. But they were all severely
                        reprimanded by the consul Lentulus, who expressly refused to put Callidius's
                        motion to the vote. Marcellus, awed by the consul's reprimand, retracted
                        what he had said. Thus the clamours of Lentulus, the dread of an army at the
                        gates of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and the menaces of Pompey's
                        friends, forced the greater part of the senate, though with the utmost
                        reluctance and dislike, into a compliance with Scipio's motion: " That
                        Caesar should be ordered to disband his army before a certain day then
                        fixed; and that in case of disobedience, he should be declared an enemy to
                        the republic." M. Antonius and Q. Cassius, tribunes of the people, opposed
                        their negative to this decree. Immediately a debate arose, upon the validity
                        of their interposition. Many severe speeches were made against them; and the
                        more warm and passionate any one appeared, the more was he applauded by
                        Caesar's enemies. </p>

					<p>In the evening the senate rose; and Pompey sending for all those of his
                        party, commended the forward; confirmed them in their resolutions; reproved
                        and animated the more moderate. Multitudes of veterans, who had formerly
                        served under him, flocked to him from all parts, allured by the expectation
                        of rewards and dignities. A great number of officers belonging to the two
                        legions lately returned by Caesar, had likewise orders to attend him. <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> was filled with troops. Curio
                        assembled the tribunes to support the decree of the people. On the other
                        hand, all the friends of the consuls, all the partizans of Pompey, and of
                        such as bore any ancient grudge to Caesar, repaired to the senate: by whose
                        concourse and votes the weaker sort were terrified, the irresolute
                        confirmed, and the greater part deprived of the liberty of speaking their
                        mind freely. L. Piso the censor, and L. Roscius the pretor, offered to go
                        and acquaint Caesar with the state of affairs, demanding only six days for
                        that purpose. Some were for sending deputies to him, to inform him of the
                        senate's disposition. </p>

					<p>But all these proposals were rejected, because the consul, Scipio, and Cato,
                        declared against them. Cato was incited by the remembrance of an old
                        quarrel, and the disappointment he had sustained in standing candidate for
                        the pretorship with Caesar. Lentulus was oppressed with debt, and flattered
                        himself with the command of armies, the government of provinces, and the
                        largesses of the kings for whom he should procure the title of allies and
                        friends of the Roman people. He was besides wont to boast, among those of
                        his own party, that he doubted not of becoming a second Sylla, in whom the
                        whole authority of the commonwealth should centre. Scipio entertained the
                        same hope of commands and governments, which he expected to share with his
                        son-in-law Pompey: added to this his dread of a prosecution; his vanity and
                        selfconceit; and the flatteries and applauses of his friends, who at that
                        time bore a considerable sway in the commonwealth and courts of justice.
                        Pompey himself, instigated by Caesar's enemies, and not able to endure an
                        equal dignity, was now entirely alienated from him, and had joined with
                        their common adversaries, most of whom Caesar had contracted during his
                        affinity with Pompey. Beside, the fraudulent step he had taken, in
                        detaining, for the purposes of his own ambition, the two legions destined to
                        serve in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, determined him to use all his

                        Caesar's friends had no time given them to inform him of what passed. Even
                        the tribunes themselves were not exempt from danger, nor durst they have
                        recourse to that right of intercession, which Sylla had left them, as the
                        last bulwark of liberty; insomuch that the seventh day after entering upon
                        their office, they saw themselves obliged to provide for their safety;
                        whereas in former times, the most turbulent and seditious tribunes never

                        threatened with ruin and conflagration: "That the consuls, the pretors, the

                        commonwealth received no detriment." This decree passed the seventh of
                        January; so that during the first five days in which it was permitted the
                        senate to assemble, after Lentulus's entrance upon the consulship, (for two
                        days are always appropriated to the holding of the comitia,) the most severe
                        and rigorous resolutions were taken, both in relation to Caesar's
                        government, and the tribunes of the people, men of eminent worth and
                        dignity. The tribunes immediately quitted the city, and fled to Caesar, who
                        was then at <placeName key="perseus,Ravenna">Ravenna</placeName>, waiting an answer to his late

					<p>The following days the senate assembled without the city, where Pompey
                        confirmed everything he had before intimated by the mouth of Scipio. He
                        applauded the resolution and courage of the senators, acquainted them with
                        the state of his forces, that he had ten legions already in arms, and was
                        besides well informed, that Casar's troops were by no means satisfied with
                        their general; nay, had even refused to support and follow him. It was then
                        proposed in the senate, that troops should be raised over all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; that Faustus Sylla should be sent
                        propretor into <placeName key="tgn,1000176">Mauritania</placeName>; that Pompey should be supplied
                        with money out of the public treasury, and that king <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName> should be declared friend and ally of
                        the people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>: but Marcellus opposed the last of
                        these; and Philippus, tribune of the people, would not agree to the
                        propretorship of Sylla. The other motions were approved by the senate. The
                        affair of the provinces was next decided; two of which were consular, the
                        rest pretorian. <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> fell to the share of Scipio, and <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> fell to L. Domitius. Philippus and
                        Marcellus were set aside, through the private views of the prevailing party.
                        The rest of the provinces were assigned to men of pretorian rank; who waited
                        not to have their nomination confirmed by the people, as had been the custom
                        in former years, but after taking the usual oath, departed for their several
                        commands in a military habit. The consuls left the city, a thing unheard of
                        till that time, and lictors were seen walking before private men in the
                        forum and capitol, contrary to the express practice of former ages. Troops
                        were levied over all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, arms enjoined, money demanded of
                        the colonies and free towns, and even taken from the very temples; in fine,
                        neither divine nor human rights were regarded. </p>

				<div2 n="7" id="b1c7" type="chapter">
					<p>Caesar having intelligence of these proceedings, addressed himself to his
                        troops: "He took notice of the many injuries he had received on all
                        occasions from his enemies, who had alienated Pompey from him, by filling
                        him with an envy and jealousy of his reputation, though he had done every
                        thing in his power to promote his glory, and favour his advancement to the
                        highest dignities. He complained of the new precedent introduced into the
                        commonwealth, in checking, and hindering by arms, the opposition of the
                        tribunes, which of late years had been restored to its wonted force. That
                        Sylla, who had almost annihilated the tribuneship, had yet left it the
                        liberty of opposition; whereas Pompey, who valued himself upon the
                        re-establishment of that office, deprived it now of a privilege it had
                        always enjoyed. That the decree enjoining the magistrates to provide for the
                        safety of the commonwealth, which implied an order to the Roman people to
                        repair to arms, was never wont to be used but on occasion of dangerous laws,
                        seditious measures pursued by the tribunes, or a general secession of the
                        people, when they possessed themselves of the temples and places of strength
                        ; crimes, which in former ages had been expiated by the fate of Saturninus
                        and the Gracchi. That at present nothing of this kind had been attempted,
                        nor so much as thought of; no law promulged, no endeavour used to seduce the
                        people, no appearance of revolt or disaffection. He therefore conjured them
                        to defend against the malice of his enemies, the honour and reputation of a
                        general, under whom they had served nine years with so much advantage to the
                        commonwealth, gained so many battles, and subdued all <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>." The soldiers of the thirteenth
                        legion, who were present, and whom he had sent for in the beginning of the
                        troubles, (the rest not being yet arrived,) cried out, that they were
                        determined to maintain the honour of their general, and to revenge the
                        wrongs done to the tribunes. </p>

				<div2 n="8" id="b1c8" type="chapter">
					<p>Being assured of the good will of the soldiers, he marched with that legion

                        of the people, who had fled to him for protection He ordered the other
                        legions to quit their winter quarters, and follow him with all expedition.
                        While he was at <placeName key="tgn,7004929">Rimini</placeName>, young L. Caesar, whose father was
                        one of his lieutenants, came to him; and after acquainting him with the
                        occasion of his journey, added, that he had a private message to him from
                        Pompey, "who was desirous of clearing himself to Caesar, that he might not
                        interpret those actions as designed to affront him, which had no other aim
                        but the good of the commonwealth: that it had been his constant maxim, to
                        prefer the interest of the republic to any private engagement: that it was
                        worthy of Caesar, to sacrifice his passion and resentment to the same noble
                        motive; and not prejudice the commonwealth, by pushing too far his revenge
                        against his private enemies." He added something more to the same purpose,
                        mingled with excuses for Pompey. The pretor Roscius joined likewise in the
                        negotiation, declaring he was commissioned so to do. </p>

				<div2 n="9" id="b1c9" type="chapter">
					<p>Though all this tended little to redress the injuries of which Caesar
                        complained, yet considering these as proper persons by whom to transmit his
                        thoughts, he begged of them, that as they had not scrupled to bring Pompey's
                        demands to him, they would likewise carry back his proposals to Pompey;
                        that, if possible, so small a labour might put an end to mighty differences,

                        told them "That the interest of the commonwealth had always been dearer to
                        him than life; but he could not help grieving at the malice of his enemies,
                        who had frustrated the good intentions of the Roman people in his favour, by
                        cutting off six months from his command, and obliging him to return to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> to sue for the consulship, though a
                        law had been made dispensing with his personal attendance; that he had yet,
                        for the sake of the commonwealth, patiently submitted to this assault upon
                        his honour; that even his proposal of disbanding the armies on both sides,
                        which he had made by a letter to the senate, had been rejected: that new
                        levies were making over all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>: that two legions, which had been
                        taken from him, under pretence of the Parthian war, were still retained in

                        this aim at but his destruction ? That, nevertheless, he was ready to agree
                        to any proposal, and expose himself to any danger, for the sake of his
                        country. Let Pompey go to his government: let all the armies be disbanded:
                        let every body throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> lay down their arms: let every thing

                        magistrates he made with perfect freedom; and let the republic be
                        administered by the authority of the senate and people. And the better to
                        settle all these articles, and corroborate them with the sanction of an
                        oath, let either Pompey himself draw nearer; or suffer Ceesar to approach

                        actions had deserved so well of the commonwealth: that therefore he would do
                        well to consult his own safety and reputation." Attius, moved by this
                        speech, drew off his garrison and fled. But some of Caesar's first ranks
                        pursuing him, obliged him to stop; and a battle ensuing, he was deserted by
                        his men. Some of the troops returned home; the rest went over to Caesar, and
                        brought along with them L. Pupius, first centurion of the legion, who had
                        formerly held the same rank in Pompey's army. Caesar commended Attius's
                        soldiers: dismissed Papius: returned thanks to the inhabitants of <placeName key="perseus,Auximum">Auximum</placeName>; and promised to retain always
                        a grateful remembrance of their attachment. </p>

					<p>These things being reported at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, the consternation was so great over

                        he scarce waited the opening of the inner door, but precipitately left the
                        place, upon a false rumour, that Caesar was approaching, and some of his
                        cavalry already in view. He was soon followed by his colleague Marcellus,
                        and the greater part of the magistrates, Pompey had left the town the day

                        he had received from Caesar. The levies were discontinued within the city,
                        and no place appeared secure on this side <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>. Here, at last, they took courage
                        and rallied, and began to renew their levies in the colonies round about,
                        which had been sent thither by the Julian law. Lentulus summoned into the
                        forum the gladiators whom Caesar had ordered to be trained up there, gave
                        them their liberty, furnished them with horses, and commanded them to follow
                        him. But being afterwards admonished by his friends that this step was
                        universally condemned, he dispersed them into the neighbouring town of <placeName key="tgn,7003005">Campania</placeName>, to keep garrison there. </p>

                        who furnished his army with every thing necessary. Even Cingulum itself, a
                        town founded by Labienus, and built at his own expense, sent deputies to
                        him, with an offer of their submission and services. He demanded a certain
                        number of soldiers, which were sent immediately. Meantime the twelfth legion
                        joined him; and with these two he marched to <placeName key="perseus,Asculum">Asculum</placeName>, a town of Picenum. Here
                        Lentulus Spinther commanded with ten cohorts; who, hearing of Caesar's

                        upon the march. Being left with only a few, he fell in with Vibullius Rufus,
                        whom Pompey had sent into Picenum to encourage his followers in those parts.
                        Vibullius understanding from him the state of affairs in Picenum, dismissed
                        Lentulus, and took the soldiers under his command. He likewise drew together
                        from the neighbouring provinces as many as he could meet with of Pompey's
                        levies: among the rest, Lucilius Hirus, who was flying, with six cohorts,
                        from <placeName key="tgn,7004016">Camerinum</placeName>, where they had been quartered.
                        Out of all these he formed thirteen cohorts, with which he posted, by great
                        journeys, to <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName>, where Domitius
                        Ahenobarbus commanded; whom he informed that Caesar was approaching with two
                        legions. Domitius had already got together, with great expedition, twenty
                        cohorts from Alba, the country of the Marsi, Peligni,and the neighbouring

                        new levies to be made. He remained only one day there, to settle what
                        related to provisions, and then pursued his march to <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName>. Upon his arrival there,

                        employed in breaking down a bridge about three miles distant from the town.
                        But Caesar's advanced parties attacking them, they quickly abandoned the

                        requested him to come to his aid. He told him, "That it would be easy, in
                        that close country, to shut up Caesar between two armies, and cut off his
                        provisions: that unless this course was followed, he himself, with above

                        exposed to imminent danger." Meanwhile,having encouraged his men, he
                        disposed engines along the walls, appointed every one his particular post,

                        under his protection, but were restrained by Q. Lucretius, a senator, and
                        Attius, a Pelignian, who held them in subjection with a garrison ot seven
                        cohorts. He therefore despatched M. Antony thither, with five cohorts of the
                        seventh legion, whose ensigns were no sooner descried from the walls of <placeName key="tgn,7004202">Sulmona</placeName>, than the gates were thrown open,
                        and the whole people in a body, both soldiers and townsmen, came out to
                        congratulate Antony on his arrival. Lucretius and Attius endeavoured to
                        escape over the wall: but Attius being taken, and brought to Antony,
                        requested that he might be sent to Caesar. Antony returned the same day,
                        bringing along with him the cohorts and Attius. Caesar joined these cohorts
                        to his army, and set Attius at liberty. </p>
					<p>Caesar resolved to employ the three first days in strongly fortifying his
                        camp, in procuring corn from the neighbouring towns, and waiting the arrival
                        of the rest of his forces. During this space, the eighth legion joined him,
                        with two and twenty cohorts of new levies from <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and about three hundred horse from
                        the king of Noricum. This obliged him to form a second camp on the other
                        side of the town, under the command of Curio. The remaning days were spent
                        in drawing a line with redoubts round the place, which work was nearly
                        completed when the messengers, that had been sent to Pompey, returned. </p>

					<p>Domitius, perusing the despatches, thought proper to dissemble the contents,
                        and declared, in council, that Pompey would speedily come to their
                        assistance. Meantime he exhorted them to behave with courage, and provide
                        every thing necessary for a vigorous defence. He conferred, however,
                        privately with a few of his most intimate friends, and, in concert with
                        them, determined upon flight. But as his looks and speech were found to
                        disagree; as he behaved not with his usual composure and firmness; and was
                        observed, contrary to custom, to be much in secret conference with his
                        friends; avoiding public appearances, and councils of war: it was not
                        possible for the truth to remain any longer concealed. For Pompey had wrote
                        back, "That he could not put all to hazard for his sake; that he had neither
                        advised nor consented to his shutting himself up in <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName>; that he must therefore
                        endeavour to extricate himself as well as he could, and come and join him
                        with all his forces." But as Caesar had invested and carried his lines round
                        the place, this retreat was now become impracticable. </p>

				<div2 n="20" id="b1c20" type="chapter">
					<p>Domitius's design being discovered, the soldiers who were at <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName> began to assemble in the

                        made known their thoughts to one another: "That they were besieged by
                        Caesar, who had already, in a manner, completed his works: that their
                        general, Domitius, in whose promises of assistance they had placed their
                        chief hope, abandoning all concern for their safety, was contriving to
                        escape privately by flight: that it was therefore incumbent upon them to
                        look also to their own preservation." The Marsi at first opposed this
                        resolution, and possessed themselves of the strongest part of the town; nay,
                        the dispute was so warm, that it almost came to be decided by the sword. But
                        shortly after, being made accquainted with Domitius's intended flight, of
                        which before they had no knowledge; they all, in a body, surrounded
                        Domitius, secured his person, and sent deputies to Caesar: "That they were
                        ready to open their gates, receive his orders, and deliver up Domitius
                        alive." </p>

					<p>Though Caesar was fully sensible of how great importance it was to get
                        possession of the town immediately, and join the garrison to his own army;
                        lest by largesses, promises of speedy relief, or false reports, any change
                        should be produced; as in war great revolutions often arise from very
                        trifling causes: yet, fearing that if he introduced his soldiers in the
                        dark, they would take that opportunity to plunder the town, he sent back the
                        deputies, with thanks for their proffer, resolving to have the walls and
                        gates watched with great care. To that end he disposed his men along the
                        works, not at a certain distance, as usual, but in one continued rank, so as
                        to touch each other, and completely invest the town. He ordered the military
                        tribunes, and officers of the cavalry, to patrol about the works, and not
                        only be on their guard against sallies, but even take care to prevent the
                        escape of particular persons. And indeed so alert and vigilant were our
                        soldiers, that not a man closed his eyes that night; each expecting the
                        event with impatience, and carrying his thoughts from one thing to another;
                        what would be the fate of the Corfinians, what of Domitius, what of
                        Lentulus, and the other illustrious persons in the place: in fine, what was
                        like to be the issue of so complicated a scene. </p>

					<p>About the fourth watch of the night, Lentulus Spinther called from the wall
                        to the guard, and desired to be conducted to Caesar. His request being
                        granted, he came out of the town, attended by some of Domitius's soldiers,
                        who never left him till they had conducted him into Caesar's presence. He
                        begged him to spare his life, and pardon the injuries he had done him, in
                        consideration of their former friendship. He owned the many obligations he
                        had laid him under, in procuring him an admission into the college of
                        priests, obtaining for him the government of <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, after the expiration of the
                        pretorship, and supporting him in the demand of the consulship. Caesar
                        interrupted him by saying: "That he was not come out of the bounds of his
                        province, with an intent to injure any body; but to repel the injuries done
                        him by his enemies; to revenge the wrongs of the tribunes; and to restore to
                        the Roman people, who were oppressed by a small faction of the nobles, their
                        liberties and privileges." Lentulus, encouraged by this speech, asked leave
                        to return into the town, "where, he said, the assurances he had obtained of
                        his own safety, would contribute not a little to the consolation of others,
                        some of whom were so terrified, that they were ready to take desperate
                        resolutions." Leave being granted, he departed for the town. </p>

					<p>As soon as it was light, Caesar ordered before him all the senators,
                        senators' sons, military tribunes, and Roman knights. There were

                        decurions, or senators of the neigbouring municipal towns, who had been sent
                        for by Domitius. As soon as they appeared, he gave orders to secure them
                        from the insults of the soldiery; and, addressing them in a few words,
                        remonstrated: "That they had made a very ill requital for the many signal
                        services received at his hands." After which, he set them at liberty. He
                        likewise restored to Domitius six millions of sesterces, which that general
                        had brought with him to <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName>, and deposited in the
                        hands of the two treasurers of the town, who surrendered it to Caesar. As

                        might justly have seized it; but he was willing to show himself generous, as
                        well as merciful. He ordered Domitius's soldiers to take the usual oath to
                        him, decamped that very day; made the ordinary march; and after staying in
                        all seven days before <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName>, arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7010380">Apulia</placeName>, through the territories of the

                        despatch, in a personal treaty, what, if managed by the intervention of
                        others, could not be hindered from running into a tedious negotiation." </p>

				<div2 n="25" id="b1c25" type="chapter">
					<p>Having dismissed him with these instructions, he arrived before <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName> with six legions, three
                        of which were composed of veteran soldiers, and the rest of new levies drawn
                        together upon his march; for as to Domitius's troops, he had sent them
                        directly from <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. He found the consuls were gone to <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName> with great part of the army,
                        and that Pompey remained in <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName> with twenty cohorts. Nor
                        was it certainly known whether he continued there with design to keep
                        possession of <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>, that he might be master
                        of the whole <placeName key="tgn,7016532">Adriatic Sea</placeName>, the extreme parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and the country of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, in order to make war on both sides
                        the gulf; or for want of shipping to transport his men. Fearing, therefore,
                        that it was his intention to keep footing in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> he resolved to deprive him of the
                        advantages he might receive from the port of <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>. The works he contrived
                        for this purpose were as follows: He carried on a mole on either side the
                        mouth of the haven where the entrance was narrowest, and the water shallow.
                        But as this work could not be carried quite across the port, by reason of
                        the great depth of the sea, he prepared double floats of timber, thirty feet
                        square, which were each secured by four anchors from the four corners, to
                        enable them to resist the fury of the waves. These, extending all the way
                        between the two moles, were covered over with earth and fascines, that the
                        soldiers might pass and repass with ease, and have firm footing to defend
                        them. The front and sides were armed with a parapet of hurdies, and every
                        fourth float had a tower of two stories, the better to guard the work from
                        fire and the shocks of the vessels. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="26" id="b1c26" type="chapter">
					<p>Against these preparations, Pompey made use of several large ships which he
                        found in the port of <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>: and having fi ted them
                        with towers of three stories, which he filled with a great number of engines
                        and darts, let them loose upon Caesar's floats, to break through the
                        staccado, and interrupt the works. Thus daily skirmishes happened with
                        darts, arrows, and slings, at a distance. Amidst these hostilities, Caesar's
                        thoughts were still bent upon peace; and though he could not but wonder that
                        Magius, whom he had sent with proposals to Pompey, was not yet returned with
                        an answer; and even saw his designs and undertakings retarded by his
                        frequent offers of this kind, he nevertheless still persevered in these
                        peaceable resolutions. Accordingly, he despatched Caninius Rebilus, one of
                        his lieutenants, a relation and intimate friend of Scribonius Libo, to
                        confer with him on this subject. He charged him to exhort that nobleman to
                        think seriously of peace, and, if possible, procure an interview between him
                        and Pompey. Could this be effected, he showed there was the greatest ground
                        to believe that peace would soon be concluded on reasonable terms; the
                        honour and reputation of which would in a manner wholly redound to Libo, if,
                        by his mediation, both parties slould be prevailed with to lay down their
                        arms. Libo, after conferring with Caninius, waited on Pompey: soon after he
                        returned with this answer; that the consuls were absent, without whom Pompey
                        had no power to treat of an accommodation. Thus Caesar having often tried in
                        vain to bring about a peace, thought it now time to drop that design, and
                        bend all his thoughts to war. </p>

					<p>Caesar having spent nine days about his works, had now half finished the
                        staccado, when the ships employed in the first embarkation, being sent back
                        by the consuls from <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, returned to <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>. Pompey, either alarmed
                        at Caesar's works, or because from the first he had determined to relinquish <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, no sooner saw the transports
                        arrive, than he prepared to carry over the rest of his forces. And the
                        better to secure himself against Caesar, and prevent his troops from
                        breaking into the town during the embarkation, he walled up the gates,
                        barricaded the streets, or cut ditches across them, filled with pointed
                        stakes, and covered with hurdles and earth. The two streets which led to the
                        port and which he left open for the passage of his men, were fortified with
                        a double palisado of very strong well sharpened stakes. These preparations
                        being made, he ordered the soldiers to embark with great silence, having
                        placed on the walls and towers some select archers and slingers, who were to
                        wait till all the troops had got aboard, and then retire, upon a signal
                        given, to some small ships that waited them at a convenient distance. </p>

                        wished well to Caesar's cause; and having notice of Pompey's intended
                        departure while the soldiers were busied with the care of embarking, found
                        means to signify it from the tops o their houses. Caesar, upon this
                        intelligence, ordered scaling ladders to be prepared, and the soldiers to
                        repair to their arms, that he might not lose any opportunity of acting
                        Pompey weighed anchor a little before night, and gave the signal for
                        recalling the soldiers that were upon the walls, who repaired with all
                        expedition to the ships prepared for them. Meantime the scaling ladders are
                        applied to the walls, and Caesar's troops enter the town. But being informed
                        by the Brundusians of the snares and ditches provided for them by the enemy,
                        they were obliged to take a great circuit, which gave Pompey time enough to
                        put to sea. Two transports only, impeded by Caesar's mole, were taken with
                        the troops on board. </p>

					<p>Though Caesar was fully sensible, that to finish the war at a blow, he must
                        pass the sea immediately, and endeavour to come up with Pompey, before he
                        could draw his transmarine forces together; yet he dreaded the delay and
                        length of time that such a project might require; because Pompey having
                        carried with him all the ships on the coast, rendered the present execution
                        of the design impracticable. He must therefore wait the arrival of ships
                        from Picenum, <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and the remoter coasts of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, which was a tedious business, and,
                        at that season of the year, subject to great uncertainty. It appeared
                        likewise of dangerous consequence, to suffer a veteran army, and the two
                        Spains, one of which was wholly devoted to Pompey, to strengthen themselves
                        in his rival's interest; to let them grow powerful by levies of horse and

                        pursuing Pompey, and turn all his thoughts towards <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>. He ordered the magistrates of the
                        municipal towns to assemble all the vessels they could, and send them to <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>. He sent Valerius, one

                        commission, of their own accord, before he had left <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, drove Cotta out of their city; who
                        terrified by the unanimous opposition he met with from the province, fled
                        into <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>. In <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, Cato applied himself with great
                        diligence to the refitting of old ships, and building of new. He sent his
                        lieutenant to raise forces in <placeName key="tgn,7004610">Lucania</placeName>, and the country of the Brutians,
                        and ordered the states of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> to furnish him with a certain
                        number of horse and foot. When these preparations were almost completed,
                        being informed of Curio's arrival, he called his chief officers together,
                        and complained, " That he was betrayed and abandoned by Pompey, who, without
                        any previous preparation, had involved the commonwealth in an unnecessary
                        war; and upon being questioned by himself and others in the senate, had
                        assured them, that he was abundantly able to sustain it." Having thus
                        declared his mind, he quitted the province, which by this means submitted
                        without trouble to Curio, as <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName> had before done to Valerius.</p>

                        cantoned them in the nearest towns, and set out himself for <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. There he assembled the senate, and
                        after complaining of the injuries of his enemies, told them, "That he had
                        never affected extraordinary honours, but waited patiently the time
                        prescribed by the laws, to solicit for a second consulship, to which every
                        Roman citizen had a right to aspire: that the people, with the concurrence
                        of their tribunes, (in spite of the attempts of his enemies, and the
                        vigorous opposition of Cato, who endeavoured, according to custom, to spin
                        out the time in speaking,) had permitted him to stand candidate though
                        absent, and that even in the consulship of Pompey; who, if he disapproved of
                        the decree, why did he let it pass? But if he allowed it, why now oppose the
                        execution ? He set before them his moderation, in voluntarily proposing that
                        both parties should lay down their arms, by which he must have been himself
                        divested of his government and command. He displayed the malice of his
                        enemies, who sought to impose terms on him, to which they would not submit
                        themselves; and chose rather to involve the state in a civil war than part
                        with their armies and provinces. He enlarged upon the injury they had done
                        him, in taking away two of his legions, and their cruelty and insolence, in
                        violating the authority of the tribunes. He spoke of his many offers of
                        peace, his frequent desire of an interview, and the continual refusals he
                        had received. For all these reasons, he requested and conjured them to
                        undertake the administration of the republic, jointly with him. But if they
                        declined it through fear, he had no intention to force so great a burden
                        upon them, and would take the whole charge alone. That in the mean time it
                        would be proper to send a deputation to Pompey, to treat of an
                        accommodation: nor was he frighted at the difficulty Pompey had started some
                        time before in the senate; that to send deputies was to acknowledge the
                        superiority of him to whom they were sent, and a sign of timidity in the
                        sender. That this was a little low way of thinking; and that, in the same
                        manner as he had endeavoured at a superiority in action, he would also
                        strive to be superior in justice and equity." </p>

					<p>The senate liked the proposal of a deputation to Pompey; but the great
                        difficulty was, to find deputies; every one, out of fear, refusing to charge
                        himself with that commission. For Pompey, at his departure from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, had declared in the senate, "That

                        traverse his design, and hinder whatever he should propose. Which Caesar
                        coming to understand, and that he only wasted his time to no purpose; he set
                        out from <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, without effecting what he intended,

					<p>Caesar sending for fifteen of the principal men of the city, exhorted them
                        not to be the first to begin the war, but to be swayed rather by the
                        authority of all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, than the will of one particular
                        person. He forgot not such other considerations as seemed most likely to
                        bring them to reason. The deputies returning into the town, brought back
                        this answer from the senate: "That they saw the Romans divided into two
                        parties, and it did not belong to them to decide such a quarrel: that at the
                        head of these parties were Pompey and Caesar, both patrons of their city,
                        the one having added to it the country of the Vulcae Arecomici and Helvians;
                        the other after the reduction of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, considerably augmented its
                        territories and revenues; that as they were therefore equally indebted to
                        both, it became them not to aid the one against the other; but to remain
                        neuter, and grant neither an admittance into their city nor port." </p>

					<p>Whilst these things were in agitation, Domitius arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName> with his fleet, and being
                        received into the town, was appointed governor, and charged with the whole
                        administration of the war. By his order, they sent out their fleet to cruise
                        round the coasts; seized and brought in all the merchant vessels they could
                        find, and made use of the nails, rigging, and timber, of such as were unfit
                        for service, to repair the rest. They deposited in public granaries, all the
                        corn that was to be found in the city, and secured whatever else they
                        thought might be serviceable to them in case of a siege. Caesar, provoked at
                        these preparations, brought three legions before the town, began to erect
                        towers and galleries, and gave orders for building twelve galleys at <placeName key="tgn,7008775">Arles</placeName>, which being finished, launched, and

                        cutting of the wood they were composed of, he put them under the command of
                        D. Brutus, and having directed the manner of the siege, left the care of it
                        to C. Trebonius, his lieutenant. </p>

                        and commanded, the one from the Castilian Forest to the Anas; the other from
                        the Anas, quite through <placeName key="tgn,1000090">Lusitania</placeName>, and the territories of the
                        Vettones. These three lieutenants, upon the arrival of Vibullius Rufus, whom
                        Pompey had sent into <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, as we have, seen above, consulted
                        together, and agreed, that Petreius should join Afranius with his two
                        legions, and that Varro should stay and secure farther <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>. These resolutions being taken,

                        the barbarous nations bordering upon the ocean. When the levies were
                        completed, Petreius speedily joined Afranius, through the territories of the
                        Vettones; and both resolved to make <placeName key="tgn,7008912">Lerida</placeName> the seat of the war, because the

					<p>We have already observed that Afranius had three legions, and Petreius two.
                        Besides these, there were about eighty cohorts, some light, some heavy
                        armed, and five thousand horse, raised in both provinces. Caesar had sent
                        his legions before him into <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, with six thousand auxiliary foot,
                        and three thousand horse, who had served under him in all his former wars,
                        and he was furnished with the like number from <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, all chosen troops. For hearing that
                        Pompey was coming with his whole force through <placeName key="tgn,1000176">Mauritania</placeName> into <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, he sent circular letters to all the
                        Gallic states, inviting by name those of the most known and approved valour,
                        and in particular a select body of mountaineers from Aquitain, where it
                        borders upon the Roman province. At the same time he borrowed money from the
                        military tribunes and centurions, which he distributed among the soldiers.
                        This policy was attended with two great advantages: it bound the officers to
                        him by the obligation of interest, and the soldiers by the tie of gratitude.

					<p>Fabius, by letters and messengers, endeavoured to sound the disposition of
                        the neighbouring states. He had laid two bridges over the Sicoris, four
                        miles distant from each other, for the convenience of foraging, having
                        consumed all the pasture on this side the river. Pompey's generals did the
                        same, with much the like view, which occasioned frequent skirmishes between
                        the horse. Two of Fabius's legions, which was the ordinary guard of the
                        foragers, passing one day according to custom, and the cavalry and carriages
                        following, the bridge broke down on a sudden, by the violence of the winds
                        and floods, and separated them from the rest of the army. Afranius and
                        Petreius perceiving it, by the fascines and hurdles that came down with the
                        stream; detached immediately four legions, with all their cavalry, over the
                        bridge that lay between the town and their camp, and marched to attack
                        Fabius's legions. Upon this, L. Plancus, who commanded the escort, finding
                        himself hard pressed, seizing a rising ground, and forming his men into two
                        divisions, posted them back to back, that he might not be surrounded by the
                        enemy's horse. By this disposition, though inferior in number, he was
                        enabled to sustain the furious charge of their legions and cavalry. During
                        the course of the battle, the ensigns of two legions were perceived at a
                        distance, which Fabius had sent by the farther bridge to sustain his party,
                        suspecting what might happen, and that Pompey's generals might seize the
                        opportunity offered them by fortune, to fall upon our men. Their arrival put
                        an end to the engagement, and both parties returned to their respective
                        camps. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="41" id="b1c41" type="chapter">
					<p>Two days after, Caesar arrived in the camp with nine hundred horse, which he
                        had kept for a body guard. He began by re-establishing in the night the
                        bridge which had been broken down, and was not yet quite repaired. Next day
                        he took a view of the country, and leaving six cohorts to guard the bridge,
                        the camp, and the baggage, marched with all his forces in three lines to <placeName key="tgn,7008912">Lerida</placeName>, and stopped near Afranius's camp,
                        where he remained some time under arms, and offered him battle on an even
                        ground. Afranius drew out his troops, and formed them before his camp, half
                        way down the hill. Caesar, finding that he declined an engagement, resolved
                        to encamp within four hundred paces of the foot of the mountain; and to
                        hinder his troops from being alarmed or interrupted in their works, by
                        sudden incursions from the enemy, ordered them not to throw up a rampart,
                        which must have appeared and betrayed them at a distance, but to cut a ditch
                        in front, fifteen feet broad. The first and second lines continued in order
                        of battle, as had been resolved from the beginning, and the third carried on
                        the work behind them unperceived. Thus the whole was completed, before
                        Afranius had the least suspicion of his design to encamp there. In the
                        evening, Caesar retreated with his legions behind the ditch, and passed the
                        whole night under arms. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="42" id="b1c42" type="chapter">
					<p>Next day he carried the intrenchment quite round his camp, and because
                        materials for a rampart must have been fetched from a great distance, he
                        contented himself for the present with a naked ditch, as the day before,
                        allotting a legion to each side of the camp, and keeping the rest of the
                        troops under arms, to cover those that worked. Afranius and Petreius, to
                        alarm our men and disturb the works, advanced with their troops to the foot
                        of the mountain, and threatened to give battle, But Caesar, trusting to the
                        three legions under arms, and the defence of the ditch, still persisted in
                        his design. At last, after a short stay, and without daring to come forward
                        into the plain, they retreated again to their camp. The third day, Caesar
                        added a rampart to his camp, and brought into it the six cohorts, with the
                        baggage which he had left in his former camp. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="43" id="b1c43" type="chapter">
					<p>Between the city of <placeName key="tgn,7008912">Lerida</placeName>, and the hill where Petreius and
                        Afranius were encamped was a plain of about three hundred paces, in the
                        midst of which was a rising ground, which Caesar wanted to take possession
                        of; because, by that means, he could cut off the enemy's communication with
                        the town and bridge, and render the magazines they had in the town useless.
                        In this hope, he drew out three legions, and having formed them in order of
                        battle, commanded the first ranks of one of them to run before, and gain the
                        place. Afranius perceiving his design, despatched the cohorts that were upon
                        guard before the camp, a nearer way to the same eminence. The contest was
                        sharply maintained on both sides: but Afranius's party, who first got
                        possession of the post, obliged our men to give ground, and being reinforced
                        by fresh supplies, put them at last to rout, and forced them to fly for
                        shelter to the legions. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="44" id="b1c44" type="chapter">
					<p>The manner of fighting of Afranius's soldiers was, to come forward briskly
                        against an enemy, and boldly take possession of some post, neither taking
                        care to keep their ranks, nor holding it necessary to fight in a close
                        compact body. If they found themselves hard pushed, they thought it no
                        dishonour to retire and quit their posts, following in this the custom of
                        the Lusitanians, and other barbarous nations, as it almost always happens,
                        that soldiers give in to the manners of the country where they have long
                        been used to make war. This manner of fighting, however, as it was new and
                        unexpected, disordered our men, who seeing the enemy come forward, without
                        regard to their ranks, were apprehensive of being surrounded, and yet not
                        think themselves at ensigns, or quit their post, without some very urgent
                        cause. The first ranks therefore being put into disorder, the legion in that
                        wing gave ground, and retired to a neighbouring hill. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="45" id="b1c45" type="chapter">
					<p>Caesar, contrary to his expectation, finding the consternation like to spread
                        through the whole army, encouraged his men, and led the ninth legion to
                        their assistance. He soon put a stop to the vigorous and insulting pursuit
                        of the enemy, obliged them to turn their backs, and pushed them to the very
                        walls of <placeName key="tgn,7008912">Lerida</placeName>. But the soldiers of the ninth
                        legion, elated with success, and eager to repair the loss we had sustained,
                        followed the runaways with so much heat that they were drawn into a place of
                        disadvantage, and found themselves directly under the hill where the town
                        stood, whence when, they endeavoured to retire, the enemy again facing
                        about, charged vigorously from the higher ground. The hill was rough, and
                        steep on each side, extending only so far in breadth as was sufficient for
                        drawing up three cohorts; but they could neither be reinforced in flank, nor
                        sustained by the cavalry. The descent from the town was indeed something
                        easier for about four hundred paces, which furnished our men with the means
                        of extricating themselves from the danger into which their rashness had
                        brought them. Here they bravely maintained the fight, though with great
                        disadvantage to themselves, as well on account of the narrowness of the
                        place, as because being posted at the foot of the hill, none of the enemy's
                        darts fell in vain. Still however they supported themselves by their courage
                        and patience, and were not disheartened by the many wounds they received.
                        The enemy's forces increased every moment, fresh cohorts being sent from the
                        camp through the town, who succeeded in the place of those that were
                        fatigued. Caesar was likewise obliged to detach small parties to maintain
                        the battle, and bring off such as were wounded. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="46" id="b1c46" type="chapter">
					<p>The fight had now lasted five hours without intermission, when our men,
                        oppressed by the multitude of the enemy, and having spent all their darts,
                        attacked the mountain sword in hand, and overthrowing such as opposed them,
                        obliged the rest to betake themselves to flight. The pursuit was continued
                        to the very walls of <placeName key="tgn,7008912">Lerida</placeName>, and some out of fear took shelter
                        in the town, which gave our men an opportunity of making good their retreat.
                        At the same time the cavalry, though posted disadvantageously in a bottom,
                        found means by their valour to gain the summit of the mountain, and riding
                        between both armies, hindered the enemy from harassing our rear. Thus the
                        engagement was attended with various turns of fortune. Caesar lost about
                        seventy men in the first encounter, among whom was Q. Fulginius, first
                        centurion of the Hastati of the fourteenth legion, who had raised himself by
                        his valour to that rank, through all the inferior orders. Upwards of six
                        hundred were wounded. On Afranius's side was slain T. Caecilius, first
                        centurion of a legion; also four centurions of inferior degree, and above
                        two hundred private men. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="47" id="b1c47" type="chapter">
					<p>Yet such were the circumstances of this day's action, that both sides laid
                        claim to the victory; the Afranians, because, though allowed to be inferior
                        in number, they had long sustained our attack, kept possession of the
                        eminence which occasioned the dispute, and obliged our men at first to give
                        ground: Caesar's troops, because they had maintained a fight of five hours,
                        with a handful of men, and in a very disadvantageous post; because they had
                        attacked the mountain sword in hand ; because they had driven their
                        adversaries from the higher ground, and compelled them to take shelter in
                        the town. Meantime Afranius fortified the hillock which had been the subject
                        of dispute, with a great number of works, and posted there a large body of
                        troops. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="48" id="b1c48" type="chapter">
					<p>Two days after, a very unfortunate accident happened. For so great a storm
                        arose, that the water was never known to be higher in those parts; and the
                        snow came down in such quantities from all the mountains round about, that
                        the river overflowed its banks, and in one day broke down both the bridges
                        Fabius had built over it. Caesar's army was reduced to great extremities on
                        this occasion. For his camp, as we have before observed, was between the
                        Sicoris and Cinga, two rivers that were neither of them fordable, and
                        necessarily shut him up within the space of no more than thirty miles. By
                        this means, neither could the states that had declared for him supply him
                        with provisions, nor the troops that had been sent beyond the rivers to
                        forage, return, nor the large convoys he expected from <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> get to his camp. Add to all this,
                        that it being near the time of harvest, corn was extremely scarce and the
                        more, as before Caesar's arrival, Afranius had carried great quantities of
                        it to <placeName key="tgn,7008912">Lerida</placeName>; and the rest had been consumed by
                        Caesar's troops. The cattle, which was the next resource in the present
                        scarcity, had been removed to places of security, on the breaking out of the
                        war. The parties sent out to forage and bring in corn, were perpetually
                        harassed by the Spanish infantry, who being well acquainted with the
                        country, pursued them every where. The rivers themselves did not impede
                        them, because they were accustomed to pass them on blown-up skins, which
                        they always brought with them into the field.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="49" id="b1c49" type="chapter">
					<p> Afranius, on the contrary, abounded in all things. He had large magazines of
                        corn already laid up, was continually receiving fresh supplies from the
                        province, and had plenty of forage. The bridge of <placeName key="tgn,7008912">Lerida</placeName> furnished all these conveniences
                        without danger, and opened a free communication with the country beyond the
                        river, from which Caesar was wholly excluded. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="50" id="b1c50" type="chapter">
					<p>The waters continued several days. Caesar endeavoured to re-establish his
                        bridges, but could not get the better of the obstacles occasioned by the
                        swelling of the river, and the enemy's forces stationed on the opposite
                        bank. They found it the easier to prevent his design, as the river was deep
                        and rapid, and they could discharge their darts all along the bank, on that
                        particular spot where our men were at work: whereas it was extremely
                        difficult on our side to struggle with the force of the stream, and, at the
                        same time, guard ourselves against the assaults of the enemy.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="51" id="b1c51" type="chapter">
					<p>Meanwhile Afranius was informed that a large convoy, which was on its way to
                        join Caesar, had been obliged to halt at the river side. It consisted of
                        archers from Rovergue, Gaulish horse, with many carts and much baggage,
                        according to the custom, of the Gauls, and about six thousand men of all
                        sorts, with their domestics and slaves; but without discipline or commander,
                        every one following his own choice, and all marching in perfect security, as
                        if they had nothing more to apprehend than in former times. There were
                        likewise many young gentlemen of quality, senators' sons, and Roman knights,
                        with the deputies of the states of <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and some of Caesar's lieutenants;
                        who were all stopped night, with three legions, and all his cavalry; and
                        sending the horse before, attacked them when they least expected it. The
                        Gaulish squadrons, forming with great expedition, began the fight. While the
                        contest was upon equal terms, the Gauls, though few in number, bore up
                        against the vast multitude of the enemy; but seeing the legions advance, and
                        having lost some of their men, they retreated to the neighbouring mountains.
                        This delay saved the convoy, for during the skirmish, the rest of the troops
                        gained the higher ground. We lost that day about two hundred archers, a few
                        troopers, and some servants and baggage. </p>

				<div2 n="52" id="b1c52" type="chapter">
					<p>All this served to enhance the price of provisions, a calamity inseparable
                        from present scarcity, and the prospect of filture want. Corn was already at
                        fifty denarii a bushel, the soldiers began to lose their strength, and the
                        evil increased every moment. Nay, so great was the change produced in a few
                        days, and such the alteration of fortune, that while our men were in the
                        utmost want of all kind of necessaries, the enemy had plenty of every thing,
                        and were accounted victorious. Caesar left nothing untried to remove the
                        present scarcity: he dismissed all the useless mouths, and applied to the
                        states that had declared for him, desiring them to send him cattle where
                        they wanted corn. </p>

                        friends, in the letters they sent, upon this occasion, to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. Nor was fame backward in adding to
                        the account; insomuch that the war appeared to be almost at an end. These
                        couriers and letters having reached <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> there was a great concourse of
                        people at Afranius's house, many congratulations passed, and multitudes of
                        the nobility flocked out of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> to Pompey; some to carry the first
                        accounts of this grateful news; others, that they might not be so late as to

					<p>Affairs being in this extremity, and all the passes guarded by Afranius's
                        parties, without a possibility of repairing the bridges; Caesar ordered the
                        soldiers to build some light boats, in imitation of those he had formerly
                        seen in <placeName key="tgn,7008653">Britain</placeName>, whose keel and ribs were of wood,
                        and the rest of wicker, covered with leather. When he had got a sufficient
                        number, he sent them by night in waggons, twenty-two miles off from his
                        camp. In these he embarked a good number of soldiers, and sent them over the
                        river; took possession unexpectedly of a hill adjoining to the bank on the
                        other side; threw up a fortification before the enemy thought of hindering
                        him; posted a legion in this fortification; and then threw a bridge over the
                        Sicoris in two days. By this means he recovered his foragers, secured the
                        convoy, and opened a passage for future supplies.</p>

                        without a suspicion of danger, made a considerable capture of men and
                        horses; and observing some Spanish cohorts on the march to their assistance,
                        skilfully divided themselves into two bodies; one to secure the booty; the
                        other, to receive and return the enemy's charge. One of their cohorts, which
                        had rashly separated from the rest, and advanced too far before the main
                        body, was surrounded and cut to pieces by our men, who returned over the
                        same bridge to the camp, without loss, and enriched with a considerably
                        booty. </p>

                        equipped seventeen galleys, eleven of which were covered. To these they
                        added a multitude of smaller vessels, that they might strike a terror into
                        our fleet by their very number; and manned them with archers, and the
                        mountaineers we have already mentioned, whom they encouraged to perform
                        their part by great rewards and promises. Domitius desired some of these
                        ships, and filled them with the shepherds and labourers he had brought
                        thither with him. Thus furnished and equipped, they sailed with great
                        confidence, in quest of our fleet, which was commanded by Decimus Brutus,
                        and rode at anchor at an island over against <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>.</p>

					<p> Brutus was much inferior to the enemy in number of ships; but Caesar had
                        manned them with his best soldiers, chosen out of all the legions, and
                        headed by centurions of distinguished bravery, who had petitioned him for
                        this service. These had provided themselves with hooks and grapplingirons,
                        and a great number ofdarts,javelins, and offensive weapons of all sorts.
                        Thus prepared, upon notice of the enemy's arrival, they stood out to sea,
                        and attacked their fleet. The conflict was sharp and vigorous. For the
                        mountaineers, a hardy race, habituated to arms, and trained up in war,
                        scarce yielded to the Romans in bravery; and, having but just parted from <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, still retained a lively sense
                        of the promises so lately made them. The shepherds too, animated by the
                        hopes of liberty, and fighting under the eye of their master, did wonders to
                        merit his approbation.</p>

					<p> The townsmen themselves, confiding in the nimbleness of their ships, and the
                        skill of their pilots, eluded the shock of our vessels, and baffled all
                        their attempts. As they had abundance of sea-room, they extended their line
                        of battle, in order to surround our fleet, or attack our ships singly with a
                        number of theirs, or in running along-side, sweep away a range of oars. If
                        they were compelled to come to a closer engagement, setting aside the skill
                        and address of their pilots, they relied wholly on the bravery of their
                        mountaineers. Our men were but indifferently provided with rowers and
                        pilots, who had been hastily taken out of some merchant ships, and knew not
                        so much as the names of the tackle. They were incommoded too by the weight
                        and lumpishness of their vessels, which being built in haste, of unseasoned
                        timber, were not so ready at tacking about. But when an opportunity offered
                        of coming to close fight, they would boldly get between two of the enemy's
                        ships; and grappling them with theirhooks, charge them on each side, board
                        them, and cut to pieces the mountaineers and shepherds that defend them. In
                        this manner they sunk part of their vessels, took some with all the men on
                        board, and drove the rest into the haven. In this engagement, the enemy had
                        nine galleys sunk or taken. </p>

                        dreading the courage of our horse, durst not disperse about the country as
                        formerly; but either foraged in the I neighbourhood of the camp, that they
                        might the sooner make good their retreat; or, by a long circuit, endeavoured
                        to avoid our parties: and upon receiving any check, or even descrying our
                        cavalry at a distance, they would throw down their trusses, and fly. At
                        last, they were reduced to omit foraging several days together, and resolved
                        to pursue it of war. </p>

					<p>In the mean time the Oscenses and Calagurritani, jointly sent deputies to

                        Jacitani, and Ausetani, and not many days after, the Illurgavonenses, who
                        inhabit along the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7007649">Iberus</placeName>, followed their example. He only
                        required them to supply him with corn, to which they readily agreed; and
                        having got together a great number of carriage-horses, brought it to his
                        camp. A cohort of the Illurgavonenses, hearing of the resolution taken by
                        their state, deserted from the enemy, and came over to Caesar's camp. The
                        change was sudden and great; for, the bridge being finished, provisions
                        secured, this rumour of Pompey's march through <placeName key="tgn,1000176">Mauritania</placeName> extinguished, and five
                        considerable states having declared in his favour; a great number of distant
                        provinces renounced their engagements with Afranius, and entered into new
                        ones with Caesar. </p>

				<div2 n="61" id="b1c61" type="chapter">
					<p>These things having struck a terror into the enemy; that he might not be
                        always obliged to send his cavalry so far about to forage, the bridges lying
                        about seven miles from his camp, he bethought himself of draining the river,
                        by turning some of its water into canals thirty feet deep, so as to make it
                        fordable. The work being almost completed, Petreius and Afranius grew
                        extremely apprehensive of being entirely cut off from their provisions and
                        forage, because Caesar was very strong in cavalry. They therefore thought
                        proper to quit a post that was no longer tenable, and to carry the war into
                        Celtiberia. What contributed still further to confirm them in this
                        resolution was, that of the two contrary parties, concerned in the late
                        war,those who had declared for Sertorius, still trembled at the name of the
                        conqueror, and dreaded his power, though absent; and those who had attached
                        themselves to Pompey, continued to love him for the many services he had
                        done them: but Caesar's name was hardly known among these barbarians. Here
                        they expected considerable reinforcements of horse and foot; and doubted
                        not, by taking the advantage of places, to be able to protract the war till
                        winter. In order to execute this plan, they collected all the boats to be
                        found on the <placeName key="tgn,7007649">Iberus</placeName>, and ordered them to be brought to
                        Octogesa, a city on that river, about twenty miles from their camp. Here
                        they commanded a bridge of boats to be built; and, having sent two legions
                        over the Sicoris, fortified their camp with a rampart of twelve feet. </p>

                        drains with the utmost diligence; and had already so far diminished the
                        water of the Sicoris, that the cavalry could, with some difficulty, pass
                        over: but it took the infantry as high as the shoulders, who had therefore
                        both the depth of the river, and the rapidity of the stream to struggle
                        with. Meanwhile it was known, that the bridge over the <placeName key="tgn,7007649">Iberus</placeName> was almost finished, and Caesar's

                        their forces, and joined the two legions they had sent over before. Caesar
                        had now no other remedy left but to harass and fatigue them with his
                        cavalry: for if he went with his whole army over his bridge, he lengthened
                        his march prodigiously, and gave Afranius time enough to get to the <placeName key="tgn,7007649">Iberus</placeName>. Accordingly the horse having
                        forded the river, came up with Petreius and Afranius's rear, who had
                        decamped about midnight; and making a motion to surround them, began to stop
                        and retard their march. </p>

					<p>At day-break we discovered from the hills near the camp, that the enemy's
                        rear was greatly harassed by our cavalry. Sometimes they obliged them to
                        halt, and disordered their ranks: at other times, the enemy facing about,
                        charged with all their cohorts at once, and forced our men to give ground;
                        who, wheeling again as soon as they began to march, failed not to renew the
                        attack. At this sight, the legionary soldiers, running up and down the camp,
                        complained that the enemy would escape out of their hands, and the war
                        necessarily be prolonged. They addressed themselves to the centurions and
                        military tribunes, and desired them to beg of Caesar not to spare them; that
                        they feared neither danger nor fatigue, and were ready to pass the river as
                        the horse had done. Caesar, moved by their alacrity and entreaties, though
                        he saw some danger in exposing his army to the rapidity of a deep river,
                        judged it yet proper to attempt and make trial of the passage. Having
                        therefore withdrawn from every company such as were weak of body, or of less
                        courage than the rest, he left them in the camp with the army happily passed
                        the river, by the assistance of a double line of cavalry, placed above and
                        below them. Some of the infantry were carried away by the violence of the
                        current; but they were picked up and saved by the horse below them; so that
                        no one man was lost. Having passed the river without loss, he drew up his
                        army in order of battle, and began to pursue the enemy in three lines: and
                        such was the ardour of the soldiers, that notwithstanding the army was
                        obliged to make a circuit of six miles, notwithstanding the time necessarily
                        lost in crossing the river, they got up at the ninth hour of the day to the
                        enemy, who had set out at midnight. </p>

					<p>When Afranius and Petreius perceived them at some distance, being with reason
                        intimidated, they suspended their march, halted on an eminence, and formed
                        in order of battle. Caesar would not hazard an action with his troops, thus
                        fatigued, and halted likewise in the plain. On this the enemy resumed their
                        march, and he the pursuit; which obliged them to encamp earlier than they
                        designed. Hard by was a range of mountains, and about five miles farther,
                        the ways were difficult and narrow. The enemy retired among these mountains,
                        to avoid the pursuit of the cavalry; and having placed parties in all the
                        passes, to stop Caesar's army, hoped, by this means, to continue their march
                        to the <placeName key="tgn,7007649">Iberus</placeName>, without fear or danger. This was
                        their great affair, and what before all things they should have endeavoured
                        to effect but, being fatigued by a long march, and their continual
                        skirmishes with Caesar's cavalry, they deferred it till next day. Caesar
                        likewise encamped on a hill that lay near him. </p>

					<p>About midnight, the cavalry having surprised some of the enemy, who had
                        adventured a little too far from their camp in quest of water; Caesar was
                        informed by them, that Pompey's lieutenants were decamping without noise.
                        Immediately he ordered the alarm to be sounded, and gave his army the signal
                        to march. The enemy, finding they should be pursued, kept still; being
                        afraid of a nocturnal flight, wherein they would have had greatly the
                        disadvantage, on account of their heavy baggage which they had with them,
                        and the superiority of Caesar's cavalry. Next day, Petreius went privately
                        out with a party of horse, to take a view of the country. Caesar pose, under
                        the command of Decidius Saxa. Both made the like report in their several
                        camps; that for five miles together, the country was level and open, but
                        after that rough and mountainous; and that whoever should first get
                        possession of the defiles might easily prevent the other army from
                        approaching them. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="67" id="b1c67" type="chapter">
					<p>Upon this, a council of war was held by Petreius and Afranius, to deliberate
                        about the time of beginning their march. The greater number were for setting
                        out by night, in hopes of reaching the defiles before Caesar ould have
                        notice of their departure. Others argued against the possibility of
                        decamping privately, by the alarm given in Caesar's camp the night before:
                        "That the enemy's cavalry were continually patrolling in the night, and had
                        beset all the ways and passes: that a nocturnal engagement was to be
                        avoided, because, in a civil war, the soldiers were more apt to listen to
                        their fears, than the obligations of the military oath: that shame and the
                        presence of the centurions and tribunes, the great instruments of obedience
                        and military duty, could have their proper effect only in the light, which
                        rendered it of infinite importance to wait the approach of day; that in case
                        of a disaster, yet the bulk of the army would escape, and be able to possess
                        themselves of the post in question." This opinion prevailed in the council,
                        and they resolved to set out the next morning by break of day. </p>

					<p>Caesar having taken a view of the country, decamped as soon as it was light,
                        taking a considerable circuit and observing no particular route; for the
                        direct way to the <placeName key="tgn,7007649">Iberus</placeName> and Octogesa lay in the rear of the
                        enemy's camp. He was therefore obliged to march through valleys and
                        precipices, and over steep rocks, which the soldiers could not climb, but by
                        disencumbering themselves of their arms, and returning them afterwards to
                        one I another. But not a man murmured at these difficulties, in hopes of
                        seeing a speedy end of all their labours, if they could but gain the <placeName key="tgn,7007649">Iberus</placeName> before the enemy, and intercept

					<p> As in this march we pursued at first an opposite course, and seemed to turn
                        our backs upon the enemy, Afranius's soldiers who observed us from their
                        camp, came forth with joyful looks, and insulted us on our supposed flight,
                        imagining the want of provisions obliged us to return to <placeName key="tgn,7008912">Lerida</placeName>. Their generals applauded
                        themselves upon their resolution of not decamping, and were confirmed in the
                        notion of our retreat, as they saw we had neither horses nor carriages;
                        whence they concluded the scarcity must be exceeding great. But when they
                        saw us, after some time, turn to the right, and that our advanced guard had
                        already gained the ground beyond their camp, there was not a man so tardy or
                        indolent, as not to perceive the necessity of decamping and opposing our
                        march. Immediately they ran to arms, and leaving a few cohorts to guard the
                        camp, sallied in a body, pursuing their way directly to the <placeName key="tgn,7007649">Iberus</placeName>. </p>

                        Afranius's by the continual attacks of Caesar's cavalry. But such was the
                        situation of the Afranians, that even supposing them to gain the hills
                        first, they could only secure their own retreat, without a possibility of
                        preserving their baggage, and the cohorts left to guard the camp; because
                        Caesar's army getting between, cut them off from all communication with
                        their own men. Caesar arrived first at the place in question; and having
                        found a plain beyond the rocks, formed his men in order of battle against
                        the enemy. Afranius, who now saw our army in his front, at the same time
                        that his rear was continually harassed by the cavalry, halted on an
                        eminence, from whence he detached four Spanish cohorts, to take possession
                        of the highest mountain thereabouts; ordering them to make all the despatch
                        they could to seize it, that he might get thither himself with the rest of
                        his forces, and changing his route, march them over the hills to Octogesa.
                        The Spaniards wheeling obliquely, to take possession of the place, were
                        perceived by Caesar's cavalry; who charged them furiously, broke them at the
                        first onset, surrounded, and cut them in pieces in sight of both armies.

                        make but a faint resistance; more especially as it was surrounded on all
                        sides by the cavalry, and would be obliged to fight on equal ground. He was
                        pressed, on all hands, to give the signal. The lieutenants, centurions, and
                        military tribunes got round him, urging him not to delay the engagement:
                        "That the soldiers were all eager for a battle; whereas, on the contrary,
                        the Afranians had given many marks of fear: that they had neither dared to
                        support their own detachment, nor offered to descend from the hill, nor been
                        able to withstand the very first charge of our cavalry; that they had
                        brought their ensigns all into one place where they crowded confusedly round
                        them, without observing ranks or order: that if he was afraid to attack them
                        on the eminence, he would soon have an opportunity of more equal ground, as

					<p>Caesar was in hopes of terminating the affair without bloodshed, or a battle;
                        because he had intercepted the enemy's provisions. Why therefore, even
                        supposing the event to be prosperous, should he unnecessarily lose any of
                        his men? Why should he expose to wounds, soldiers who had so well deserved
                        of him? Why, in fine, should he tempt fortune? especially as it redounded no
                        less to the honour of a good general, to gain the victory by his conduct,
                        than by the force of his arms. He was also touched with compassion for
                        Afranius's soldiers; who after all, were fellow-citizens, and whom he must
                        have slaughtered, when he could equally succeed without touching their
                        lives. This resolution was not at all relished by the army; who, in their
                        discontent, openly declared, that since Caesar did not lay hold of so
                        favourable an opportunity, nor let them fight when they had a mind, they
                        would not fight when he had a mind. But nothing could shake him. Nay, he
                        even retreated a little, to give Afranius and Petreius liberty to regain
                        their camp, which they did. He then posted troops on the mountains, to guard
                        the defiles. and came and encamped as near the enemy as possible. </p>

                        matter, notice was brought them, that our cavalry had fallen upon their
                        parties sent out in quest of water. Upon this intelligence, they formed
                        several posts of horse and foot, intermixed with legionary cohorts; and to

					<p>In their absence, their soldiers found frequent opportunities of conversing
                        with our men, and sought out every one his fellowcitizen and acquaintance.
                        They began by thanking them for having spared them the day before, owning
                        they were indebted to them for their lives. Afterwards they asked them, if
                        they might trust to Caesar's honour; testifying much grief at being obliged
                        to fight with their countrymen and relations, with whom they were united by
                        the strictest ties. At last they stipulated even for their generals, whom
                        they would not seem to betray: and promised, if the lives of Petreius and
                        Afranius were granted them, to change sides. At the same time they sent some
                        of their principal officers to negotiate with Caesar; and these
                        preliminaries to an accommodation being settled, the soldiers of both armies
                        went into one another's tents, so that the two camps were now in a manner
                        one. A great number of centurions and military tribunes came to pay their
                        court to Caesar, and beg his protection. The Spanish chiefs, who had been
                        summoned to attend Afranius, and were detained in the camp as hostages,
                        followed their example. Every man sought out his acquaintance and friend,
                        who might recommend and procure him a favourable reception from Caesar.
                        Things were carried to such a length, that Afranius's son, a young
                        gentleman, treated with Caesar, by the mediation of Sulpicius, to desire he
                        would give his word for his life, and that of his father. The joy was
                        general; they mutually congratulated each other; the one, in that they had
                        escaped so imminent a danger; and the other, in that they had brought to a
                        happy conclusion so important an enterprise, without striking a blow.
                        Caesar, in the judgment of all, was upon the point of amply reaping the
                        fruits of his wonted clemency, and every body applauded his late conduct.

                        have pity on him, and Pompey their general; and that they would not deliver
                        them both up to the cruel vengeance of their enemies. Every one upon this
                        flocks to the head-quarters. There Petreius proposes to the army to bind
                        themselves by a new oath, not to abandon nor betray their commanders, nor to
                        act separately, but all in concert, for the common good. He himself took
                        this oath first, and then exacted it of Afranius, afterwards of the military
                        tribunes and centurions, and lastly of all the companies, man by man, At the
                        same time an order was issued that all who had any of Caesar's soldiers in
                        their tents should signify it, that they might be put to death in the sight
                        of the whole army. But the majority detesting this bloody order, carefully
                        hid those who were under their protection, and procured them means to escape
                        in the night. However, the terror they had been thrown into by their
                        generals, the severity shown in punishing, and the new oath they had been
                        obliged to take, defeated, for the present, all hopes of a surrender,
                        changed the soldiers' minds, and reduced the war to its former state. </p>

					<p>Caesar ordered diligent search to be made after such of the enemy's soldiers
                        as had come to his camp during the time of conference, and carefully sent
                        them back. Some military tribunes and centurions voluntarily chose to stay
                        with him; whom he afterwards treated with great distinction; promoting the
                        centurions to higher ranks, and honouring the Roman knights with the office

					<p>The Afranian troops were destitute of forage, and could not water without
                        much difficulty. The legionary soldiers had, indeed, some provisions,
                        because they had been ordered to bring two and twenty days' corn with them
                        from <placeName key="tgn,7008912">Lerida</placeName>; but the Spanish infantry and
                        auxiliaries had none; for they neither had opportunities of supplying
                        themselves, nor were their bodies inured to carry heavy burdens.
                        Accordingly, they every day deserted in shoals to Caesar. In this extremity,
                        of the two expedients proposed, that of returning to <placeName key="tgn,7008912">Lerida</placeName> appeared the safest, as they had
                        still some provisions in that city, and might there concert what further
                        measures to pursue. <placeName key="tgn,7008715">Tarraco</placeName> was at a greater distance, and
                        they would of course be exposed to more accidents by the way. This
                        resolution being taken they decamped. Caesar sent the cavalry before, to
                        harass and retard them in their march; and followed himself with the rest of
                        the army. The cavalry gave the enemy no respite, being continually engaged
                        with their rear. </p>

				<div2 n="79" id="b1c79" type="chapter">
					<p>The manner of fighting was thus: Some light-armed cohorts formed the
                        rearguard, which, in a plain, halted from time to time, and made head
                        against our cavalry. When they fell in with an eminence, the very nature of
                        the ground furnished them with the means of defending themselves, because
                        those who were first could, cover them behind. But when a valley or descent
                        came in the way, the van could give no assistance to the rear, and our
                        cavalry annoyed them with their darts from the higher ground, which put them
                        in imminent danger. In this case, the legions were obliged to halt, and
                        endeavour to drive back the cavalry a good way, after which they ran down
                        the valley precipitately, until they came to the opposite eminence. For
                        their cavalry, of which they had a considerable number, was so terrified by
                        their ill success in former skirmishes, that, far from being of any service,
                        they were forced to place it in the centre to secure it; and if any of them
                        chanced to straggle from the main body, they were immediately taken by
                        Caesar's horse. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="80" id="b1c80" type="chapter">
					<p>During these continual skirmishes, in which the enemy were often obliged to
                        halt, in order to disengage their rear, it is easy to perceive that their
                        march could not be very expeditious. This was in fact the case; so that
                        after advancing four miles, finding themselves greatly incommoded by the
                        cavalry they halted on an eminence, and drew a line before them, as it were
                        to encamp, but did not unload their beasts of burden. When they saw that
                        Caesar had marked out his camp, pitched his tents, and sent his cavalry to
                        forage; suddenly, towards noon, they resumed their march briskly, hoping to
                        be rid of the cavalry which had so much incommoded them. But Caesar set out
                        immediately with his legions, leaving a few cohorts to guard the baggage,
                        and sent orders to his cavalry to return with all diligence. The cavalry
                        returned accordingly, and having overtaken the enemy before the close of
                        day, attacked their rear so vigorously, that they were almost routed, a
                        great number of soldiers, and even some centurions being slain. Caesar's
                        whole army came up, and threatened them with an immediate attack. </p>

				<div2 n="81" id="b1c81" type="chapter">
					<p>As they could then neither choose a proper place for a camp, nor continue
                        their march, they were forced to halt where they were, far from any water,
                        and on very disadvantageous ground. Caesar did not offer to attack them, for
                        the reasons mentioned before: he would not even permit any tents to be
                        pitched that day, that he might be the readier to pursue with all his
                        forces, should they attempt to escape either by night or by day. The
                        Afranians perceiving the disadvantage of their situation, employed the whole
                        night in throwing up intrenchments, and disposed their camp directly
                        fronting ours. The same they did the following day, from sun-rise till
                        evening. But the farther they extended their camp, and produced their lines,
                        in order to better their position, the farther they went from water, and to
                        avoid one inconvenience, fell into another. The first night nobody went out
                        of the camp for water, and the next day the whole army was obliged to do it
                        in order of battle, so that they could not forage that day. Caesar waited to
                        humble them by these misfortunes, and reduce them by want and necessity
                        rather than force. He began, however, to draw lines round the camp, the
                        better to check their sudden sallies and irruptions, to which he foresaw
                        they would be obliged to have recourse at last. Want, soon constrained them
                        to kill all the beasts of burden. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="82" id="b1c82" type="chapter">
					<p>Two days were spent in forming and executing those resolutions; on the third,
                        Caesar had considerably advanced his works. Afranius and Petreius, sensible
                        of the consequences, drew all their forces out of the camp, and formed them
                        in order of battle. Caesar previously called in his workmen, assembled his
                        cavalry, and put his army in a condition to receive them, for he was aware
                        of the hurt his reputation might sustain, if, contrary to the opinion of the
                        troops, and the earnest expectations of all, he should still seem to decline
                        an engagement. However, for the reasons already mentioned, he resolved to
                        keep only upon the defensive; and the rather, because the distance between
                        the two camps was so small, that should he even put his adversaries to rout,
                        he could not flatter himself with the hopes of a complete victory. In fact,
                        from camp to camp was not above two thousand feet; the armies were posted on
                        each side of this space, which was left void for the mutual charge and
                        assault of the soldiers. On supposition therefore of a battle, the nearness
                        of their camp furnished an easy retreat to the vanquished. For this reason
                        he resolved to wait the enemy's charge, and not enter the first into action.

					<p>Afranius's troops were ranged in two lines, consisting of five legions, and
                        the cohorts wont to be stationed in the wings, formed a body of reserve.
                        Caesar's army was upon three lines; in the first of which were posted four
                        cohorts, detached out of each of the five legions; in the second three; and
                        in the third the like number, all from their respective legions: the archers
                        and slingers were disposed in the midst, and the cavalry on the two wings.
                        The armies being drawn up in this manner, each general kept firm to his
                        resolution; Caesar, not to engage, unless forced to it; and Afranius, to
                        prevent the progress of our works. In this posture they continued till
                        sun-set, when both armies returned to their several camps. The next day,
                        Caesar prepared to finish his lines; and Pompey's lieutenants, as their last
                        resource, endeavoured to find a fordable place in the Sicoris. But Caesar,
                        penetrating their design, sent his light-armed Germans, with part of good
                        bodies of troops along the banks, at a small distance from one another. </p>

					<p>At last, having no hope left, and being in want of every thing, wood, water,
                        forage, corn, they demanded an interview, and that it might be, if possible,
                        in some place out of the sight of the soldiers. Caesar denied the last part
                        of their request, but offered to grant them a public interview; whereupon
                        Afranius, having given his son for a hostage, went to the place appointed by
                        Caesar, where, in the presence of both armies, he addressed him to this
                        effect: "That it was no just matter of blame, either in him or his soldiers,
                        to have preserved their fidelity to their general, Pompey; but that they had
                        now sufficiently acquitted themselves of their duty, and suffered enough in
                        his cause, by the want of all kind of necessaries; that like wild beasts
                        caught in a toil, they were deprived of the most common enjoyments, having
                        their bodies oppressed by want, and their minds overwhelmed with ignominy,
                        that they therefore acknowledged themselves vanquished, and besought and
                        conjured him, not to make a rigorous use of his victory, but to spare the
                        lives of his unhappy countrymen." This speech was delivered with all
                        possible marks of humility and submission. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="85" id="b1c85" type="chapter">
					<p>Caesar replied, "That he of all mankind, had least reason to complain, or
                        implore compassion: that all the rest had fully done their duty; himself, in
                        forbearing to attack him, with all the advantages of time and place, that
                        the way to an accommodation might be the more open; his army, in returning
                        untouched, the men that were in their power, after injuries received, and
                        the massacre of their comrades: in fine, even his own troops, in
                        endeavouring to conclude a peace, whereon they thought their safety
                        depended. Thus all orders had shown an inclination to treat, while Afranius
                        and Petreius alone opposed an accommodation, refusing both interview and
                        truce, and barbarously murdering those whom the faith of a conference had
                        enticed to their camp: that it had therefore happened to them, as frequently
                        happens to men of obstinacy and arrogance, and they were forced to have
                        recourse to those conditions, and earnestly solicit the very same terms,
                        which not long before they had despised. However, he would not take
                        advantage of their present submission, or the favourable circumstances in
                        which he found himself, to demand any thing tending to the increase of his
                        own power, but only that they would disband those troops which they had now
                        for so many years kept on foot against him. For with what other view had six
                        legions been sent into <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>; a seventh levied there, so many
                        powerful navies equipped, so many able and experienced officers sent over.
                        These mighty preparations could not be meant against <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, or to supply the wants of the
                        province, which having enjoyed a long run of peace, had no occasion for such
                        extraordinary forces. Their real aim was to pave the way to his destruction;
                        to effect which, a new species of power had been introduced into the
                        commonwealth, and the same man appointed to command in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, at the gates of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and hold for so many years, though
                        absent, the government of the two most potent provinces of the republic. For
                        this reason the magistrates were stripped of their prerogatives, and not
                        suffered to take possession of their provinces, at the expiration of the
                        pretorship or consulship, as had always been the custom; but particular
                        governors were sent, by the choice and management of a faction. For this
                        reason even the excuse of old age was disallowed; and those who had merited
                        a discharge by their past services, were compelled to take arms again, to
                        complete the number of their troops. In fine, for this reason, he alone had
                        been denied that justice, which was never refused to any general before him;
                        that after having successfully served the commonwealth, he should be allowed
                        to return home, and disband his own army, with some marks of honour, orat
                        least without ignominy. All which, nevertheless, he had hitherto borne, and
                        still resolved to bear with patience; nor was it now his design, to take
                        from them their soldiers, and enlist them, as it would be easy for him to
                        do, but to prevent their employing them against him. Therefore, as he had
                        already intimated, they must resolve to quit <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and disband their forces, in which
                        case he would injure no man. This was his final resolution, and the only
                        condition of peace they were to expect." </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="86" id="b1c86" type="chapter">
					<p>These conditions were agreeable to Afranius's soldiers, who, instead of being
                        punished, as they feared, were in some sort rewarded by the discharge
                        procured them. They plainly showed their satisfaction. For, while the place
                        and time of their dismission were debating, they signified by their gestures
                        and cries from the rampart, where they stood, that they desired to be
                        disbanded immediately; because no sufficient security could be given for the
                        performance of what was put off till another time. After some discussion of
                        that article by Caesar and Afranius, it was regulated, that those who had
                        houses or possessions in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, should be discharged on the spot;
                        and the rest near the Var, a river between <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Caesar, on his side, declared, that
                        he would hurt nobody, nor force any one to take on in his service. </p>

					<p>Caesar undertook to find them in corn until they got to the Var. He even
                        promised to restore to them all they had lost in the war, that could be
                        known again; himself indemnifying his own soldiers, who hereby lost quired
                        their confidence to such a degree, that he was arbiter of all the disputes
                        they had, either among themselves, or with their commanders. The soldiers
                        being ready to mutiny about their pay, because Petreius and Afranius
                        affirmed it was not yet due, the matter was referred to Caesar, who
                        determined it to the satisfaction of both parties. About a third of the army
                        was disbanded during the two days they continued here, after which the rest
                        set out for the Var in this order. Two of Caesar's legions marched at the
                        head, the others in the rear, and the vanquished troops in the middle. Q.
                        Fufius Calenus, one of Caesar's lieutenants, presided over the march. In
                        this manner they continued their route to the Var, where the remainder of
                        the troops were disbanded. </p>

					<p>While these things passed in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, Trebonius, Caesar's lieutenant, who
                        had been left to carry on the siege of <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, raised terraces for two
                        different attacks, and approached with his towers and galleries. One of the
                        attacks was on the side of the port; the other, towards the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,7023890">Rhone</placeName>, which empties itself into the sea,
                        bordering upon <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>. For <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName> is washed by the sea on three

                        where the citadel stands, being very strong by nature, because of a deep
                        valley that runs before it, requires a long and difficult siege. For the
                        completing of these works, Trebonius drew together, from all parts of the
                        province, a great number of workmen and beasts of carriage; ordered wood and
                        osiers to be brought; and having prepared all things necessary, raised a
                        terrace eighty feet high. </p>

				<div2 n="2" id="b2c2" type="chapter">
					<p>But so well was the town provided with all the requisites of war, and so
                        great was the multitude of machines to annoy the besiegers, that no mantles
                        were sufficient to withstand their violence. For they had wooden bars,
                        twelve feet in length, armed at the point with iron, which were shot with
                        such force from their balistae, that they pierced four rows of hurdles, and
                        entered a considerable way into the ground. To resist the violence of these
                        batteries, the besiegers made use of galleries, whose roofs consisted of
                        pieces of wood of about a foot in thickness, strongly compacted together.
                        Under this cover, the materials necessary for raising the terrace were
                        conveyed: and a tortoise, sixty feet long, every thing necessary to defend
                        it against fire and stones, went before, to level the ground. But in spite
                        of all endeavours, the greatness of the works, the height of the wall and
                        towers, and the multitude of machines made use of by the besieged, greatly
                        retarded the approaches. Besides, the mountaineers made frequent sallies,
                        and set fire to the towers and mount: which though our men easily sustained,
                        driving them back with great loss into the town, yet failed not very much to
                        incommode the works. </p>

					<p>In the mean time L. Nasidius, sent by Pompey to the assistance of Domitius
                        and the Marseillians, with a fleet of sixteen ships, some of which were
                        strengthened with beaks of brass, passed the straits of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> unknown to Curio, landed at <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>, and raised so great a terrorin
                        the place, that being abandoned by the senate and principal inhabitants, he
                        found means to carry off one of their gallies; and joining it to his own
                        fleets steered directly for <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, having despatched a frigate
                        before, to apprize Domitius and the inhabitants of his coming, and press
                        them to hazard a second engagement with Brutus, when they should be
                        reinforced by his fleet. </p>

					<p>The Marseillians, after their defeat, had drawn as many old ships out of the
                        docks as they had lost in the engagement, and repaired and rigged them with
                        wondrous expedition. They were likewise well provided with rowers and
                        pilots; and had prepared a number of fishing barks, which they filled with
                        archers and engines, and strengthened with roofs, to shelter the rowers from
                        the enemy's darts. The fleet being equipped in this manner, the
                        Marseillians, animated by the prayers and tears of theirold men, matrons,
                        and virgins, to exert themselves in defence of their country in so pressing
                        a conjuncture; embarked with no less confidence and assurance, than they had
                        before their late defeat. For such is the weakness of the human mind, that
                        things dark, hidden, and unknown, always produce in us a greater degree of
                        confidence or terror; as happened in the present case: for the arrival of
                        Nasidius had filled all men with an uncommon share of hope and eagerness.
                        The wind springing up fair, they set sail, and rendezvoused at Tauroenta, a
                        castle belonging to the town, where Nasidius lay with his fleet. Here they
                        put their ships in order, armed themselves with courage for a second
                        encounter, and entering readily into all the measures proposed by Nasidius,
                        left to him the command of the left wing, and stationed themselves upon the
                        right. </p>

				<div2 n="5" id="b2c5" type="chapter">
					<p>Brutus sailed to meet them, with his fleet considerably increased; for
                        besides the ships which Caesar had caused to be built at <placeName key="tgn,1121365">Aries</placeName>, he had also joined to it six more,
                        taken from the Marseillians, which he had refitted and rigged since the late
                        action. Wherefore exhorting his men to despise an enemy, who had not been
                        able to resist them when entire and unvanquished, he advanced against them
                        full of resolution and confidence. It was easy to discern from Trebonius's
                        camp, and the eminences around it, what passed in the town. All the youth
                        that were left, the old men, the women, children, and even the guards upon
                        the walls, extending their hands to heaven, or repairing to the temples, and
                        prostrating themselves at the altars, besought the gods to grant them
                        victory. Nor was there a man among them who did not believe, that their
                        safety depended wholly on the issue of that day's action. For the choice of
                        their youth, and the most considerable men of their city, were all on board
                        the fleet: insomuch, that in case of any disaster, they had no resource
                        left; but should they obtain the victory, they were in hopes of preserving
                        their city, either by their own forces, or t the reinforcements they
                        expected from without. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="6" id="b2c6" type="chapter">
					<p>Accordingly, in the engagement, they behaved with the most determined
                        courage. The remembrance of what their wives and children had represented to
                        them at their departure served to exalt their bravery; in a full persuasion,
                        that this was the last opportunity they should have of exerting themselves
                        in defence of their country; and that if they fell in the engagement, their
                        fellow-citizens could not long survive them, as their fate must be the same
                        upon the taking of the town. Our ships being at some distance from each
                        other, both gave the enemy's pilots an opportunity of showing their address
                        in working their vessels, and flying to the assistance of their friends,
                        when they were laid hold on by our grappling hooks. And indeed, when it came
                        to a close fight, they seconded the mountaineers with wonderful resolution,
                        and, in bravery, seemed to yield but little to our men. At the same time, a
                        great quantity of darts, poured incessantly from their smaller frigates,
                        wounded a great many of our rowers, and such of the soldiers as were without
                        shelter. Two of their galleys fell upon that of Brutus, which was easily
                        distinguished by its flag; but though they attacked him on both sides, he
                        extricated himself with such agility and address, as in a short time to get
                        a little before; which made them run foul of each other so violently, that
                        they were both considerably shattered; one in particular had its beak
                        broken, and was in a manner totally crushed; which being observed by those
                        of our fleet that lay nearest, they suddenly fell upon and sunk them, before
                        they could recover out of their disorder. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="7" id="b2c7" type="chapter">
					<p>In this encounter, the ships under Nasidius were of no manner of service to
                        the Marseillians, but quickly retired out of the fight. For as they were
                        neither animated by the sight of their country, nor the entreaties of their
                        relations, they were not very forward to expose their lives to hazard, but
                        escaped without hurt from the combat. The Marseillians had five ships sunk,
                        and four taken. One escaped to the coast of hither <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, with those of Nasidius. Of the rest
                        that remained, one was immediately despatched to <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, to carry thither the news of
                        the defeat. As soon as it drew near the town, all the inhabitants flocked
                        out to know what had passed; and being informed of it, appeared no less
                        dejected, than if the city had been taken by storm. However, they still
                        continued their preparations for the defence of the place with as much
                        diligence as ever. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="8" id="b2c8" type="chapter">
					<p>The legionaries, who had the charge of tower of brick, built at a little
                        distance from the walls, would be of great service to shelter them from the
                        frequent sallies of the enemy. At first they made it very low and small, to
                        guard against sudden incursions. Hither they retired in case of danger: here
                        they defended themselves against the most obstinate attacks of the enemy;
                        nay, even assaulted them in their turn, repulsed, and pursued them. This
                        tower was of a square form, thirty feet every way, allowing for the
                        thickness of the walls, which might be about five feet. Afterwards, (being
                        instructed by experience, which is the best of teachers,) they plainly
                        perceived, that the higher it was carried, the more serviceable it would
                        prove. The manner of effecting it was thus:</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="9" id="b2c9" type="chapter">
					<p> When the work was raised to the height of one story, they laid a floor over
                        it, the extremities of whose beams were concealed in the thickness of the
                        wall; that they might not by appearing on the outside, be liable to be set
                        on fire. Thence they continued the wall directly upwards, as far as their
                        galleries and mantles would allow. Here they laid two beams crosswise, whose
                        extremities almost reached the angles of the wall, for supporting the floor,
                        which was to serve as a roof to the whole. Over these beams they laid the
                        joists of the roof, and boarded them with planks. The roof was so contrived
                        as to project a little beyond the wall, in order to suspend from it what
                        might be necessary to shelter the workmen, while employed in completing the
                        story. This floor was paved with tiles and clay, to render it proof against
                        fire, and had besides a covering of strong mattresses, to break the force of
                        stones and darts. At the same time they suspended from the beams of the
                        roof, that projected beyond the wall, curtains made of strong cables, woven
                        to the depth of four feet, and which went round the three sides of the tower
                        that were exposed to the engines of the enemy; having experienced on former
                        occasions, that this kind of cover was impenetrable to any dart or engine
                        whatever. When this part of the tower was finished, roofed, and sheltered
                        from the enemy's blows, they removed their mantles to another, and by means
                        of engines elevated the roof entire from the first story, as far as the
                        curtains would allow. There, secure from all insult, they laboured at the
                        wall, elevating the roof a second time, and thereby enabling themselves both
                        to continue the work, and lay the interjacent floors. In this manner they
                        proceeded from story to story, mounting them one upon another, till without
                        danger or wounds, they had completed the number of six, leaving loop-holes
                        in convenient places, for the engines to play through. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="10" id="b2c10" type="chapter">
					<p>When, by means of this tower, they thought they had sufficiently provided for
                        the security of the works around it, they resolved to build a gallery sixty
                        feet long, of wood, two feet in thickness, to extend from the brick tower to
                        the tower of the enemy, and the very walls of the town. The form of the
                        gallery was this: First, two beams of equal length were laid upon the
                        ground, at the distance of four feet from one another; and in these were
                        fixed little pillars five feet high, joined at the top by beams designed to
                        suppirt the roof of the gallery. Over these were laid rafters, two feet
                        square, fastened strongly with nails and plates of iron. The upper part of
                        the roof was composed of square laths, four inches thick, which were placed
                        at a small distance one from another, to bear the tiles that were to be laid
                        upon them. Thus was the whole finished with a sloping roof, which being
                        partly composed of tiles and mortar, was proof against fire, and had besides
                        a covering of hides, to hinder the mortar from being washed away by spouts
                        of water. Over all we threw strong mattresses, to screen the hides from fire
                        and stones. This work was finished close by the brick tower, under cover of
                        four mantles, and immediately carried forward upon rollers, in the manner
                        ships are launched, till it unexpectedly reached the very tower of the
                        enemy. </p>

					<p>The Marseillians astonished at so threatening and unlooked-for a machine,
                        pushed forward with levers the largest stones they could find, and tumbled
                        them from the top of the wall upon the gallery. But the strength of the wood
                        resisted the violence of their blows, so that they fell to the ground
                        without doing any hurt. Observing this, they changed their design, and
                        poured down upon us burning barrels of pitch and tallow. But these likewise
                        rolled along the roof without damage, and falling upon the ground, were
                        afterwards thrust away with forks and long poles. Meanwhile our soldiers,
                        under protection of the gallery, were endeavouring with their levers to
                        undermine the enemy's tower. The gallery itself was defended by tne tower of
                        brick whence our engines played without intermission insomuch that the
                        enemy, driven from their tower and walls, were at last obliged to abandon
                        their defence. By degrees the tower being undermined, part of it fell down,
                        and the rest was so shaken that it could not stand long. </p>
					<p>Upon this the enemy, alarmed at so unexpected a misfortune, discouraged by
                        the downfall of the tower, awed by such a testimony of the wrath of the
                        gods, and dreading the plunder and devastation of their city, came forth in
                        the habit of suppliants, and with outstretched hands, besought the
                        compassion of the army and generals.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="12" id="b2c12" type="chapter">
					<p> At this new and unexpected sight, all acts of hostility ceased, and the
                        soldiers, laying aside their ardour for the fight, were eager to hear and
                        get acquainted with the proposals of the enemy, who arriving ib presence of
                        the army and generals, threw themselves at their feet, requesting them to
                        suspend all further operations till Caesar's arrival. They told them: "That
                        as the works were now completed, and the tower destroyed, they were sensible
                        the city could no longer hold out, and therefore meant not to defend it:
                        that in the mean time, no prejudice could arise to the besiegers from this
                        respite, because, if they refused to submit upon Caesar's coming, he would
                        have it in his power to treat them as he pleased. They added, that if the
                        whole tower should be brought down, it would be impossible to hinder the
                        soldiers from yielding to the desire of plunder, by breaking into and
                        pillaging the town." This, and much more of the same nature (for the
                        Marseillians are a learned people), they urged in a very moving and pathetic
                        strain. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="13" id="b2c13" type="chapter">
					<p>The generals, moved by these monstrances, drew off the soldiers from the
                        works, discontinued the attack, and contented themselves with posting guards
                        in convenient places. Compassion occasioned a kind of truce till Caesar's
                        arrival; so that on neither side were any acts of hostility committed, but
                        every thing was quiet and secure, as if the siege had beenl= at an end. For
                        Caesar had earnestly recommended it to Trebonius, by letter, to prevent, if
                        possible, the city's being taken by storm, lest the soldiers, irritated by
                        their revolt, and the resistance they had found, should put all the youth to
                        the sword, as they threatened to do. Nay, they were even then hardly
                        restrained from breaking into the town, and loudly murmured against
                        Trebonius for delaying a conquest which they looked upon as certain. </p>

					<p>But the Marseillians, a nation without faith, aimed at nothing further in all
                        this, than to find a time and opportunity to deceive us, and put in practice
                        the treacherous purpose they had formed. For after some days, our men
                        suspecting no danger, but relying upon the good faith of the enemy, while
                        some were retired to their tents, others laid down, to rest in the trenches,
                        overpowered by the long fatigue they had undergone, and all the arms laid up
                        and removed out of sight, suddenly they sallied from the town, and the wind
                        being high, and favourable to their design, set fire to the works. The flame
                        in a moment spread itself on all sides, insomuch that the battery, the
                        mantles, the tortoise, the tower, the machines, and the gallery were
                        entirely destroyed, before it was possible to discover whence the disaster
                        arose. The suddenness of the accident made our men immediately run to their
                        arms, where every one took what came first to hand. Some sallied out upon
                        the enemy, but were checked by the arrows and darts poured upon them from
                        the town; insomuch that the Marseillians, sheltered by their walls, burnt
                        without any difficulty the tower of brick and the gallery. Thus the labour
                        of many months was destroyed in an instant, by the treachery of an enemy,
                        and the violence of the wind. Next day they made the same attempt, favoured
                        by the same wind, and with yet greater assurance, against the tower and
                        terrace of the other attack. They approached them boldly, and threw plenty
                        of fire upon them; but our men, grown wise by their late misfortune, had
                        made all necessary preparations for their defence, so that after losing many
                        men, they were obliged to retreat into the city, without effecting their
                        purpose. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="15" id="b2c15" type="chapter">
					<p>Trebonius immediately resolved to repair his loss, in which he found himself
                        warmly seconded by the zeal of the soldiers. They saw the works, which had
                        cost so much labour and toil, destroyed by the perfidy of a people, who made
                        no scruple of violating the most sacred engagements: they saw that their
                        credulity had been abused, and that they were become the jest of their
                        enemies, which grieved and provoked them at the same time. But it was still
                        difficult to determine whence they might be supplied with wood, to repair
                        all these works. There was none in the neighbourhood of <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, the trees having been all cut
                        down for a great way round. They resolved therefore to raise a terrace of a
                        new kind, and such as history no where mentions before that time. They
                        raised two walls of brick, each six feet thick, and distant from one
                        another, nearly the breadth of the former mount. Over these they laid a
                        floor, and to render it firm, besides its being supported on either side,
                        placed pillars underneath between the walls, to bear it up where it was
                        weakest, or had a greater stress of weight to support. There were moreover
                        cross beams, which rested upon niches in the wall; and to render the several
                        floors proof against fire, hurdles were laid over them, which were
                        afterwards covered with clay. The soldiers, thus sheltered over head by the
                        roof, on the right and left by walls, and before by a breast-work, brought
                        the necessary materials without danger, and by the eagerness with which they
                        laboured, soon completed the whole, leaving overtures in convenient places
                        to sally out upon occasion. </p>

					<p>The enemy seeing we had repaired, in so short a time, what they imagined must
                        have cost us the labour of many days; that there was now no hope left,
                        either of deceiving us, or sallying out upon us with success; that all the
                        approaches to the city by land, might in like manner be shut up by a wall
                        and towers, so as to render it impossible for them to appear upon their
                        works, our walls overtopping and commanding theirs, that they could neither
                        discharge their javelins, nor make any use of their engines, in which their
                        principal hope lay; and that they were now reduced to the necessity of
                        fighting us upon equal terms, though conscious of their great inferiority in
                        point of valour; they were forced to have recourse again to the same

					<p>M. Varro, in farther <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, having early notice of what passed
                        in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and beginning to distrust the
                        success of Pompey's affairs, spoke in a very friendly manner to `Caesar. He
                        said, "That he was indeed under particular obligations to Pompey, who had
                        made him his lieutenant-general, but at the same time was no less indebted
                        to Caesar: that he was not ignorant of the duty of a lieutenant, employed by
                        his general in an office of trust; but that he likewise knew his own
                        strength, and the attachment of the whole province to Caesar." After this
                        manner he talked in all companies, nor declared expressly for either side.
                        But when he afterwards understood, that Caesar was detained by the siege of <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>; that the armies of Petreius
                        and Afranius had joined, and daily grew stronger by the arrival of new
                        succours; that there was room to hope for every thing; that the hither
                        province had unanimously declared in their favour; that Caesar himself was
                        reduced to great straits at <placeName key="tgn,7008912">Lerida</placeName>, of all which Afranius wrote
                        largely, magnifying his own advantages, he began to alter with fortune.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="18" id="b2c18" type="chapter">
					<p> He raised troops over the whole province; added thirty auxiliary cohorts to
                        the two legions he had already under his command; formed great magazines of
                        corn to supply <placeName key="tgn,7008781">Marseilles</placeName>, and the armies under Afranius
                        and Petreius; ordered the Gaditani to furnish him with ten ships of war;
                        caused a considerable number to be built at <placeName key="tgn,7008676">Hispalis</placeName>; sent all the money and ornaments
                        he found in the temple of Hercules to <placeName key="perseus,Cales">Cales</placeName>; left there a garrison of six
                        cohorts, under the command of Caius Gallonius, a Roman knight, the friend of
                        Domitius, who had sent him thither to look after an inheritance of his;
                        conveyed all the arms, public and private, to Gallonius's house; spoke every
                        where disadvantageously of Caesar; declared several times from his tribunal,
                        that Caesar had been worsted, and that many of his soldiers had gone over to
                        Afranius, as he was well assured by undoubted testimonies: by all which,
                        having struck a terror into the Roman citizens of that province, he obliged
                        them to promise him one hundred and ninety thousand sesterces, twenty
                        thousand weight of silver, and one hundred and twenty thousand bushels of
                        wheat. The states well affected to Caesar he loaded with heavy
                        contributions; confiscated the effects of such as had spoken against the
                        commonwealth; quartered soldiers upon them; harassed them with arbitrary
                        judgments; and in fine, obliged the whole province to take an oath of
                        fidelity to himself and Pompey. Hearing of what had passed in hither <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, he prepared for war. His design
                        was, to shut himself up with his two legions in <placeName key="perseus,Cales">Cales</placeName>, where all the provisions and
                        shipping lay, because he very well understood, that the whole province was
                        in Caesar's interest, for he judged it would be easy in that island, with
                        the ships and provisions he had to draw out the war into length. </p>
					<p>Caesar, though called upon by many and necessary affairs to return to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, resolved, however, not to leave <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, till he had entirely quelled the
                        war in that province; for he knew that hither <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> had many obligations to Pompey, and
                        that most of the inhabitants were strongly in his interest. </p>

                        tribune of the people, he himself advanced, by great journeys, at the head
                        of six hundred horse. He sent orders before to the magistrates, and the
                        principal men of every state, to meet him by a certain day at <placeName key="tgn,7002817">Cordova</placeName>. All obeyed; every state sent his
                        deputies; nor was there a single Roman citizen of any consideration, who did
                        not repair thither on this occasion, The very senate of <placeName key="tgn,7002817">Cordova</placeName>, of their own proper motion, shut
                        their gates against Varro, stationed guards and sentinels along the walls,
                        and detained two cohorts, called Calonicae, which chanced to march that way,
                        that they might serve to protect the town. At the same time those of <placeName key="tgn,7007588">Carmona</placeName>, the most considerable state in
                        the province, drove out of their city three cohorts, which Varro had left to
                        garrison the citadel, and shut their gates against them. </p>

					<p>This determined Varro to make all possible despatch, that he might reach <placeName key="perseus,Cales">Cales</placeName>, as soon as possible, lest his
                        march should be intercepted; so great and apparent was the affection of the
                        province to Caesar. When he was advanced a little way, he received letters
                        from <placeName key="perseus,Cales">Cales</placeName>, which informed him, "That as soon
                        as Caesar's edict was known, the principal men of <placeName key="perseus,Cales">Cales</placeName>, with the tribunes of the cohorts
                        he had left in garrison, had conspired to drive Gallonius from the city, and
                        preserve the town and island for Caesar; that this project being formed,
                        they had warned Gallonius to retire of his own accord, while he yet might
                        with safety; threatening, if he did not, to come to some immediate
                        resolution against him: that Gallonius, terrified by so general a revolt,
                        had accordingly left <placeName key="perseus,Cales">Cales</placeName>." Upon this intelligence, one of
                        the two legions, known by the name of Vernacula, took up their ensigns in
                        Varro's presence, quitted the camp, and marched directly to <placeName key="tgn,7008676">Hispalis</placeName>, where they sat down in the
                        market-place and cloisters, without committing the least act of violence,
                        which so wrought upon the Roman citizens residing in the town, that every
                        one houses. Varro, astonished at these proceedings, turned back with design
                        to reach <placeName key="tgn,7009534">Italica</placeName>, but was informed that the gates
                        were shut. At last, finding himself surrounded on all sides, and the ways
                        every where beset, he wrote to Caesar that he was ready to resign the legion
                        under his command, to whomsoever he should order to receive it. Caesar sent
                        Sextus Caesar to take the command; and Varro, having resigned the legion
                        accordingly, came to him at <placeName key="tgn,7002817">Cordova</placeName>. After giving him an account of
                        the state of the province, he faithfully resigned all the public money he
                        had in his hands, and informed him of the quantity of corn and shipping he
                        had prepared. </p>

                        centuriens sent thither to guard the place, for having confirmed them in
                        their resolutions by their example. He remitted the tribute imposed by Varro
                        upon the Roman citizens; restored their estates to those who had been

                        obliged the Gaditani to furnish, arrived there in a few days. There he found
                        deputies from almost all the states of the province, and having, in like

					<p>The Marseillians, overwhelmed with profusion of calamities, reduced to the
                        utmost distress by famine, worsted in two different engagements by sea,
                        weakened by continual sallies, assaulted by a heavy pestilence, occasioned
                        by the length of the siege, and their constant change of diet (for they were
                        obliged to feed upon old meal and musty barley, which had been long
                        treasured up in their magazines against an accident of this kind), their
                        tower being overthrown, a great part of their walls undermined, and no
                        prospect of relief from armies or the provinces, which were now all reduced
                        under Caesar's power, they resolved to surrender in good earnest. But some
                        days before, Domitius, who was apprized of their intentions, having prepared
                        three ships (two of which he assigned to his followers, and embarked in
                        person on board the third), took occasion, during a storm, to make his
                        escape. Some of Brutus's galleys, which he had ordered to keep constantly
                        cruising before the port, chancing to get sight of him, prepared to give
                        chace. That in which Domitius was, escaped under favour of the tempest; but
                        the two others, alarmed at seeing our galleys so near them, re-entered the
                        port. Caesar spared the town, more in regard to its antiquity and
                        reputation, than any real merit it could plead. He obliged the citizens
                        however to deliver up their arms, machines, and ships of war, whether in the
                        port or arsenal; to surrender all the money in their treasury; and to
                        receive a garrison of two legions. Then sending the rest of the army into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, he himself set out for <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>. </p>

					<p>About the same time, C. Curio sailed from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> into <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, with two of the four legions which
                        had been put under his command by Caesar, and five hundred horse; having
                        conceived the highest contempt of the troops headed by P. Attius Varus.
                        After two days and three nights sailing, he landed at a place called
                        Aquilaria. This place is about twenty-two miles distant from Clupea, and has
                        a very convenient harbour for ships in the summer time, sheltered on each
                        side by a promontory. L. Caesar, the son, waited for him at Clupea, with ten
                        galleys, which P. Attius had taken in the war against the pirates, and
                        repaired at <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>, for the service of the present war.
                        But terrified at the number of ships Curio brought with him, he stood in for
                        the coast; where, running his galley on shore, he left her, and went by land
                        to Adrumetum. C. Confidius Longus commanded in that town, with one legion:
                        and here also the rest of the fleet repaired after Caesar's flight. M. Rufus

                        him from <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, to guard the transports; when he
                        saw Caesar's own galley upon the strand, he towed her off, and returned with
                        the fleet to Curio. </p>

					<p>Curio ordered him to sail directly for <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>, and followed himself with the land

                        left C. Caninius Rebilus with the legions, and advanced before with the
                        cavalry, to take a view of the Cornelian camp, which was judged to be a
                        situation extremely advantageous. It is a high rock, jutting out into the
                        sea, steep and rough on both sides, but with an easier descent where it
                        fronts <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>. It lies little more than a mile
                        from <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName> in a direct line; but as there is a
                        fountain about half way, which runs towards the sea, and overflowing the
                        plain, forms a morass; to avoid this, in marching to <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>, it is necessary to take a compass
                        of six miles.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="25" id="b2c25" type="chapter">
					<p> When he had taken a view of this post, he went next and examined Varus's
                        camp, which was under the walls of the town, towards the gate named the Gate
                        of War. The situation of it was extremely advantageous; for on the one side
                        it was covered by the city of <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName> itself, and on the other by a kind
                        of theatre, which stood without the walls, the works round which took up so
                        much room, that they rendered the approach to the camp extremely difficult.
                        At the same time he saw all the ways crowded with people, who, out of fear
                        of being pillaged, were carrying their most valuable effects into the city.
                        He detached the cavalry against them to disperse them, and likewise have an
                        opportunity of making some booty. Upon which, Varus ordered six hundred
                        Numidian horse to advance to their assistance, which he further strengthened
                        with four hundred foot, sent by <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName>, a few days before, to reinforce the
                        garrison of <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>. This king inherited from his father
                        an affection for Pompey, and besides personally hated Curio; who, during his
                        tribuneship had published a law to deprive him of his kingdom. The Numidian
                        cavalry soon came to blows with ours; but were not able to stand their first
                        charge, retreating to their camp, with the loss of a hundred and twenty men.
                        Meantime, upon the arrival of Curio's fleet he ordered proclamation to be
                        made among the merchant ships, which were at <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>, to the number of two hundred, that
                        he would treat them as enemies, if they did not immediately repair to the
                        Cornelian camp. Upon this proclamation, they instantly weighed anchor, and
                        leaving <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>, sailed whither they were ordered;
                        by which means the army was plentifully supplied with every thing they stood
                        in need of. </p>

				<div2 n="26" id="b2c26" type="chapter">
					<p>These things despatched, Curio repaired to his camp at Bagrada, where, with
                        the joint acclamations of the whole army, he was saluted by the name of
                        Imperator. Next day he led his army towards <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>, and encamped not far from the town.
                        But before he had finished his entrenchments, he was informed by some
                        parties of horse, who were upon the scout, that a powerful body of horse and
                        foot had been sent by the king of <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>: at the same time a great cloud of
                        dust began to appear, and soon after the enemy's van was in view. Curio,
                        astonished at a motion so unexpected, sent the cavalry before to sustain
                        their first charge, and keep them in play: he, meanwhile, drawing off the
                        legions from the works, with all possible expedition, formed them in order
                        of battle. The horse engaged according to orders; and with such success,
                        that before the legions could be duly drawn up, the whole reinforcement sent
                        by the king, who marched without order or apprehension of danger, falling
                        into confusion, at last betook themselves to flight. The cavalry, wheeling
                        nimbly along the shore, escaped, with little loss, into the town; but great
                        numbers of the infantry were cut to pieces. </p>

					<p>Next night, two centurions of the nation of the Marsi, with twenty-two
                        private soldiers, deserted from Curio, and went over to Attius Varus. These,
                        either believing the thing themselves, or desirous to carry grateful tidings
                        to Varus (for we easily believe what we wish, and readily hope that others
                        will fall into our way of thinking), assured him, that the whole army was
                        extremely averse to Curio, and would infallibly revolt, if he would but
                        advance, and come to a conference with them, Accordingly Varus drew out his
                        legions next day. Curio did the same; and the two armies stood facing one
                        another in order of battle, with a small valley between them. </p>

                        army: for Caesar having granted him his liberty, he had retired into <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>. Curio had brought over with him
                        from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> the very same legions, who had
                        revolted some time before to Caesar at the siege of <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName>: so that excepting a few
                        centurions who had been changed, the officers and companies were the same as
                        had formerly served with this very Quintilius. He made use of this handle to
                        debauch the army of Curio; "and began with putting the soldiers in mind of
                        their former oath to Domitius, and to himself, that general's questor; he
                        exhorted them not to carry arms against the old companions of their fortune,
                        who had shared with them in all the hazards of that siege; nor fight in
                        defence of that party, who treated them ignominiously, and as deserters." To
                        these considerations, he added offers of a liberal recompense, if they would
                        follow his fortune and that of Attius. But his speech made no impression
                        upon Curio's troops, so that both armies retired to their respective camps.

					<p>But an uncommon panic soon spread itself over Curio's camp, which the various
                        discourses of the soldiers served only to increase. For every one had his
                        opinion, and added the suggestions of his own fear to that which he heard
                        from others. These reports spreading from one to many, and receiving
                        additions in every new relation, there appeared to be several authors of the
                        same notions "That in a civil war it was lawful for every soldier to choose
                        what side he pleased; that the same legion, who a little before had fought
                        on the side of the enemy, might, without scruple, return again to the same
                        cause, since Caesar's conferring favours upon his enemies, ought not to
                        render them unmindful of prior and greater obligations: that even the
                        municipal towns were divided in their affection, and sided some with one
                        party, some with another." These discourses proceeded not from the Marsi and
                        Peligni alone, but ran like a torrent through the whole camp. However, some
                        of the soldiers blamed their companions for this so great freedom of talk
                        and others, who affected to appear more diligent than the rest, enlarged in
                        their accounts of it to the officers. </p>

					<p>For these reasons,Curio summoning a council of war, began to deliberate were
                        for attacking, at all hazards, the camp of Varus, in order to find
                        employment for the soldiers, whose idleness they considered as the cause of
                        all the present alarms. Besides, it was better, they said, to trust to
                        valour, and try the fortune of a battle, than see themselves abandoned by
                        their men, and delivered up to the barbarity of the enemy. Others were for
                        retiring, during the night, to the Cornelian camp, where they would have
                        more time to cure the infatuation of the soldiers; and whence, in case of a
                        disaster, they could, with more safety and ease, make good their retreat

					<p> Curio relished neither of these notions: the one, he thought, argued
                        cowardice; the other, a rash boldness: to retreat, would have all the
                        appearance of a shameful flight; to attack, they must resolve to fight in a
                        place of disadvantage. "With what hope," said he, "can we attack a camp
                        fortified by nature and art? And what advantage can we draw from an attempt,
                        whence we shall be obliged to retire with loss ? Does not success always
                        secure to a general the affection of his troops, whereas ill fortune is
                        evermore followed with contempt ? And what would a decampment imply but an
                        ignominious flight, an absolute despair of all things, and an unavoidable
                        alienation of the whole army? That we ought not to let the modest think we
                        distrust them, nor the insolent that we fear them; because the knowledge of
                        our fear only augments the presumption of the one, and an apprehension of
                        being suspected, abates the zeal of the other. But if what is reported of
                        the discontent of the army be true, which I am yet unwilling to believe, at
                        least to the degree some pretend; we ought, for that reason, rather to hide
                        and dissemble our fears, than by an unreasonable discovery of them, to add
                        strength to the evil: that, as in some cases, it was necessary to conceal
                        the wounds of the body, that the enemy might not conceive hope from our
                        misfortunes; so also ought we to hide the indisposition of an army: that by
                        retreating in the night, as some proposed, they would only furnish a fairer
                        occasion to the ill-affected to execute their purpose: for fear and shame
                        are powerful restraints by day, but night entirely divests them of their
                        force: that he was neither so rash, as to attack a camp without hopes of
                        success; nor so blinded by fear, as to be at a loss what measures to pursue:
                        that he thought it his duty to examine things to the bottom; and as he had
                        called them together to deliberate upon the present state of affairs,
                        doubted not, with their assistance, to take such measures as would be
                        attended with success." </p>

					<p>He then dismissed the council; and assembling the soldiers, put them in mind
                        of what advantage their steadiness and zeal had been to Caesar at <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName>, and how serviceable
                        towards the conquest of the greatest part of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. " It was you," said he, "that gave
                        the example, and all the municipal towns soon followed: their submission to
                        Caesar was your work; and therefore it is not without reason, that he is so
                        particularly attached to you, and that Pompey hates you sincerely. It was
                        you that obliged him to quit <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, without being forced to it by the
                        loss of a battle. Caesar, who ranks me in the number of his dearest friends,
                        has committed my safety to your care, with <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, without which it would be
                        impossible to defend either <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. You are now in the presence of
                        those who exhort you to abandon us: and indeed what could be more desirable
                        to them, than at the same time to ensnare us, and fix upon you the stain of
                        an infinite crime? What worse opinion could an enraged enemy testify of you,
                        than to suppose you capable of betraying those, who own themselves indebted
                        to you for all; and of throwing yourselves into the power of a party, who
                        consider you as the authors of all their misfortunes? Are you strangers to
                        Caesar's exploits in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>? Two armies defeated! Two generals
                        overcome! Two provinces brought under subjection! And all this in the space
                        of forty days, is it likely that those, who, with forces unbroken, could not
                        stand their ground, will be able to resist, now they are vanquished? And
                        will you who followed Caesar before fortune declared in his favour, now
                        return to the vanquished, when fortune has already decided the quarrel, and
                        you are upon the point of obtaining the reward of your services? They charge
                        you with having abandoned and betrayed them, contrary to the faith of oaths.
                        But is it indeed true, that you abandoned Domitius? Or did he not rather
                        meanly abandon you, at a time when you were ready to suffer every thing for
                        his sake? Did he not, unknown to you, resolve to seek his safety in flight?
                        And were you not, after being thus basely betrayed by him, indebted to
                        Caesar's goodness for your preservation? How could your oath bind you to
                        one, who, after throwing away the ensigns of his authority, and divesting
                        himself of his office, surrendered himself a private man and a captive into
                        the power of another? The new engagement you were then brought under alone
                        subsists at present, and ought quite to obliterate that, which the surrender
                        of your general, and his loss of liberty, have made void. But though I doubt
                        not of your being satisfied with Caesar, you may perhaps have taken offence
                        at me. And, indeed, I have no thought of mentioning any services I may have
                        done you: which, as yet, come far short of my intentions, and your
                        expectations: but you are not ignorant, that the rewards of military service
                        come not till after the conclusion of the war; and I believe you little
                        doubt what the issue of this will be. Nor need I, on this occasion, decline
                        taking notice of the diligence I have used, the progress already made, and
                        the good fortune that has hitherto attended me. Are you dissatisfied that I
                        have landed my army safe in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, without the loss of a single ship
                        ? That I dispersed the enemy's fleet at the first onset ? That within the
                        space of two days I have twice defeated their cavalry? That I forced two
                        hundred of their merchantmen to quit the port of <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName> and join me? And that I have reduced
                        them to a situation where it is impossible for them to receive any supplies
                        either by land or sea? Can you think of abandoning a cause conducted by such
                        leaders, and attended with such success; to followthe fortune of those who
                        so ignominiously delivered up <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName>, relinquished <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, surrendered <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and have already sustained
                        considerable losses in the African war? I never pretended to more than being
                        a follower of Caesar: it was you that honoured me with the title of
                        Imperator, which I am ready this moment to resign, if you think me unworthy
                        of the favour. Restore me my former name, that it may not be said I was
                        honoured, to be covered afterwards with the greater ignominy." </p>

				<div2 n="33" id="b2c33" type="chapter">
					<p>These remonstrances made such an impression upon the soldiers, that they
                        frequently interrupted him while he was speaking, and appeared deeply
                        touched at his suspecting their fidelity. As he retired, they all gathered
                        round him, exhorting him not to be discouraged, or scruple to hazard a
                        battle, and make trial of their fidelity and bravery. This behaviour of the
                        troops wrought so great a change in the minds of the officers, that Curio,
                        with the joint concurrence of them all, resolved to give battle the first
                        opportunity that offered. Accordingly, drawing out his men next day, in the
                        same place he had done for some time past, he ranged them in order of
                        battle. Attius Varus did the same; that if an opportunity offered, either of
                        corrupting the soldiers, or fighting to advantage, he might be in readiness
                        to lay hold of it. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="34" id="b2c34" type="chapter">
					<p>Between the two armies lay a valley, as we have observed above, not indeed
                        considerable for its breadth, but steep and difficult of ascent. Both
                        sideswaited till the other should pass it, that they might engage to more
                        advantage. Curio observing that all the horse on Varus's right wing,
                        together with the lightarmed foot, had ventured down into this valley,
                        detached his cavalry against them, with two cohorts of Marrucinians; whose
                        first shock the enemy were not able to sustain, but returned full speed to
                        their own men, leaving the light-armed foot behind, who were surrounded and
                        cut to pieces in the sight of Varus's army; which, fronting that way, was
                        witness to the flight of the one, and the slaughter of the other. Upon this
                        Rebilus, one of Caesar's lieutenants, whom Curio had brought with him from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, on account of his consummate
                        knowledge in the art of war; "Why," says he, "do you delay seizing the
                        favourable moment? You see the enemy struck with terror." Curio made no
                        answer, only desired his soldiers to remember what they had promised the day
                        before, and marching the first, commanded them to follow him. The valley was
                        so steep and difficult, that the first ranks could not ascend, but with the
                        assistance of those that came after. But the Attinian army was so dispirited
                        with fear, and the flight and slaughter of their troops, that they never
                        thought of making resistance, fancying themselves already surrounded by our
                        cavalry; so that before we could arrive within reach of the dart, the whole
                        army of Varus fled and retreated to their camp. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="35" id="b2c35" type="chapter">
					<p>In this flight, one Fabius Pelignus, a centurion of the lowest rank in
                        Curio's army, as he was pursuing the fugitives, called with a loud voice to
                        Varus as if he had been one of his own men, who wanted to admonish him of
                        something. Varus hearing himself named several times, turned and stood
                        still, demanding who he was, and what he wanted. Fabius would certainly have
                        killed him, had not Varus warded it off with his shield. Fabius himself was
                        soon after surrounded and slain. Meanwhile, the multitude of fugitives so
                        closed up the gates of the camp, and pressed upon one another in such a
                        manner, that more were crowded to death, than fell either in the battle or
                        pursuit. Nay, the camp itself was very near being taken; because great
                        numbers, instead of stopping there to defend it, made directly for the town.
                        But both the nature of the ground, and the fortifications themselves,
                        prevented the assault; and the rather, as Curio's soldiers being armed only
                        for battle, had brought with them none of the necessary tools to force a
                        camp. Curio brought back his army without the loss of a man, Fabius
                        excepted. Of the enemy, about six hundred were killed, and a thousand
                        wounded. After Curio had drawn off his men, all the wounded quitted the
                        camp, and retired into the city, as did a great many others, who, overcome
                        by fear, sheltered themselves there also under the same pretence. Varus
                        observing this, and that a universal dread had seized the army, left only a
                        trumpet in the camp, with a few tents for show, and, about midnight,
                        silently entered the town with all his forces. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="36" id="b2c36" type="chapter">
					<p>Next day Curio resolved to besiege <placeName key="tgn,7018163">Utica</placeName>, and draw a line ofcircumvallation
                        round it. There was in the town a multitude of men unfit for the fatigues of
                        war, through a long enjoyment of peace. The inhabitants themselves were
                        strongly attached to Caesar, for ancient favours received from him. The
                        senate was composed of people greatly differing in their tempers, and the
                        losses already sustained spread terror through all ranks. A surrender was
                        publicly talked of, and all concurred in soliciting Varus not to ruin them
                        by his obstinacy and perverseness. While these things were in agitation,
                        messengers sent by king <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName> arrived, who informed them of the
                        approach of his army, and exhorted them to defend the city; which
                        contributed not a little to confirm their wavering minds. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="37" id="b2c37" type="chapter">
					<p>Curio received the same news, but for some time would not believe it, so
                        greatly did he confide in his good fortune. Besides, Caesar's success in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> was already known in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>; whence he concluded it improbable
                        that <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName> would attempt any thing against him.
                        But when he was for certain informed with his whole army, he retired from
                        before the town to the Cornelian camp, laid in great quantities of corn and
                        wood, began to fortify himself, and sent directly to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> for the cavalry, and the two
                        legions he had left there. The camp itself was very advantageous for
                        protracting the war, being strong both by nature and art, near the sea, and
                        abounding in water and salt, great quantities of which had been carried
                        thither from the neighbouring saltpits. Neither ran he any hazard of being
                        straitened for wood and corn, as the country abounded in trees and grain. He
                        resolved, therefore, with the consent of the whole army, to wait here the
                        arrival of the rest of the troops, and make preparation for continuing the
                        war. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="38" id="b2c38" type="chapter">
					<p>This resolution being taken, and meeting with general approbation, some of
                        the townsmen, who had deserted to Curio, informed him, that the war in which <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName> was engaged with the Leptitani,
                        having obliged him to return into his own kingdom, he had only sent his
                        lieutenant Sabura, with a small body of forces, to the assistance of the
                        Uticans. Upon this intelligence, to which he too hastily gave credit, he
                        changed his design, and resolved to give battle. The fire of youth, his
                        courage, good success, and self-confidence, contributed greatly to confirm
                        him in this resolution. Urged by these considerations, about the beginning
                        of the night, he sent all his cavalry towards the enemy's camp, which was
                        upon the river Bagradas, and where Sabura, of whom we have spoken before,
                        commanded in chief. But the king followed with all his forces, and was not
                        above six miles behind him. The cavalry which Curio had detached, marched
                        all night, and coming unexpectedly upon the enemy, attacked them before they
                        were ready to receive the charge: for the Numidians, according to the custom
                        of that barbarous country, were encamped without order or rule. Falling upon
                        them therefore, in this confusion, and oppressed with sleep, they slew great
                        numbers, and obliged the rest to fly in the utmost consternation; after
                        which they returned to Curio with the prisoners they had taken. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="39" id="b2c39" type="chapter">
					<p>Curio had set out with all his forces about the fourth watch of the night,
                        leaving only five cohorts to guard his camp. After a march of six miles he
                        was met by his cavalry, who informed him of all that had passed. He asked
                        the prisoners, who commanded at Bagradas? They answered, Sabura. Upon this,
                        without making any further inquiries, for fear of being detained too long,
                        he turned to the troops next to him, and said, "Do you not see,
                        fellow-soldiers, that the report of the prisoners corresponds exactly with
                        the intelligence given by the deserters? <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName> is not with the army. It must consist
                        of but a few troops, since they were not able to withstand the charge of a
                        small body of horse. Haste, therefore, in the pursuit of glory, booty, and
                        victory. " What the cavalry had done was indeed considerable, because they
                        were but few in number in comparison of the Numidians; but as vanity always
                        makes us believe our merit to be greater than it is, they themselves boasted
                        immoderately of the action, and endeavoured to enhance the value of it. They
                        made a mighty parade of the booty. The prisoners too, as well infantry as
                        cavalry, marched in procession before them. And indeed the whole army
                        imagined, that to delay the battle, was no other than to delay the victory;
                        so that the ardour of the troops perfectly seconded Curio's hopes. He
                        therefore hastened his march, ordering the horse to follow, that he might as
                        soon as possible come up with the frighted enemy. But as they were fatigued
                        with their late march, they found themselves unable to keep pace with the
                        army; but stopped, some in one place, some in another; which, however,
                        retarded not Curio's hopes. </p>

					<p><placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName> having notice from Sabura of the
                        action in the night, detached to his assistance two thousand Spanish and
                        Gallic horse, of his ordinary guard, with that part of the infantry in which
                        he put the greatest confidence. Himself followed leisurely with the rest of
                        the troops, and about forty elephants, suspecting that Curio, who had sent
                        the cavalry before, could not be far off with his army. Sabura drew up his
                        horse and foot, ordering them to give ground upon the enemy's attack, and,
                        as through fear, counterfeit a flight. Meanwhile he told them, that he would
                        give the signal of battle when he saw proper, and direct their motions as
                        the case might require. </p>
					<p>Curio, flattered with new hopes, and imagining, by the enemy's motions, that
                        they were preparing for flight, made his troops come down from the mountain
                        into the plain; </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="41" id="b2c41" type="chapter">
					<p>and advancing still farther, though his army was already very much fatigued,
                        halted at last to give the men breath. That moment Sabura sounded the
                        charge, led on his men in order of battle, and went from rank to rank to
                        animate the troops; but he suffered only the cavalry to come to blows,
                        keeping the infantry at a distance within sight. Curio was not wanting on
                        his side, but exhorted his men to place all their hopes in their valour. And
                        indeed neither the infantry, though fatigued with their march, nor the
                        cavalry, though few in number, and spent with toil, showed any want of
                        valour, or backwardness to fight; though the last in particular did not
                        exceed two hundred, the rest having stopped by the way. These, wherever they
                        attacked the enemy, obliged them to give ground, but they could neither
                        pursue far, nor drive their horses on with impetuosity, On the other hand,
                        the Numidian cavalry began to surround our men, and charge them in the rear.
                        When the cohorts advanced against them, they fell back, and by the quickness
                        of their retreat, eluded the charge, but immediately returning, they got
                        behind our men, and cut them off from the rest of the army. Thus it was
                        equally dangerous for them to maintain their ranks, or advance to battle.
                        The enemy's forces increased continually, by the reinforcements sent from
                        the king; ours, on the contrary, were disabled by fatigue. Neither could our
                        wounded men retire, or be sent to any place of safety, the whole army being
                        invested by the enemy's horse. These despairing of safety, as is usual for
                        men in the last moments of life, either lamented their own fate, or
                        recommended their relations to their fellow-soldiers, if any should be so
                        fortunate as to escape that danger. The whole army was filled with
                        consternation and grief. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="42" id="b2c42" type="chapter">
					<p>Curio perceiving the general alarm, and that neither his exhortations nor
                        prayers were regarded, ordered the troops to retire with the standards to
                        the nearest mountains, as the only resource in the present exigence. But the
                        cavalry detached by Sabura had already seized them. All hope being now lost,
                        some were slain while endeavouring to fly; others threw themselves upon the
                        ground, partly in despair, partly unable to make any efforts for their own
                        safety. At this moment, Cn. Domitius, who commanded the horse, addressing
                        Curio, encavalry that remained, promising not to abandon him. "Can I," says
                        Curio, "look Caesar in the face, after having lost an army he had committed
                        to my charge?" So saying, he continued fighting till he was slain. Very few
                        of the cavalry escaped, those only excepted who had stopped to refresh their
                        horses; for perceiving at a distance the rout of the whole army, they
                        returned to their camp. All the infantry were slain to a man. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="43" id="b2c43" type="chapter">
					<p>When this disaster was known, M. Rufus the questor, whom Curio had left to
                        guard the camp, entreated his men not to lose courage. They begged and
                        requested him to reconduct them into <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; which he promised, and ordered the
                        masters of the transports to have their ships in readiness at night along
                        the shore. But fear had so universally seized the minds of the soldiers,
                        that some cried out <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName> was arrived with his troops; some
                        that Varus approached with the legions, the dust of whose march they
                        pretended to discern; and others, that the enemy's fleet would be upon them
                        in an instant; though there was not the least ground for these reports The
                        consternation thus becoming general, each man thought only of his own sailed
                        immediately, and their flight drew after it that of the transports; so that
                        only a very few small frigates obeyed the summons, and came to the general
                        rendezvous. The disorder was so great upon the shore, every one striving who
                        should first embark, that many boats sunk under the crowd, and others were
                        afraid to come near the land. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="44" id="b2c44" type="chapter">
					<p>Thus only a few soldiers and aged men, who either through interest or
                        compassion were received on board, or had strength enough to swim to the
                        transports, got safe to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. The rest, deputing their
                        centurions to Varus by night, surrendered to him. <placeName key="tgn,1094266">Juba</placeName>, coming up next day, claimed them as
                        his property, put the greater number to the sword, and sent a few of the
                        most considerable, whom he had selected for that purpose, into <placeName key="tgn,7016752">Numidia</placeName>. Varus complained of this
                        violation of his faith; but durst not make any resistance. The king made his
                        entrance into the city on horseback, followed by a great number of senators,
                        among whom were Servius Sulpicius, and Licinius Damasippus. Here he stayed a
                        few days, to give what orders he thought necessary; and then returned, with
                        all his forces, into his kingdom. </p>

					<p>Caesar, as dictator, holding the Comitia, Julius Caesar, and P. Servilius,
                        were chosen consuls; for this was the year in which he could be elected to
                        that magistracy, consistent with the laws. This affair being despatched, as
                        Caesar saw public credit at a stand over all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, because nobody paid their debts; he
                        ordered that arbiters should be chosen, who should make an estimate of the
                        possessions of all debtors, and should convey them in payment to their
                        creditors, at the price they bore before the war. This regulation he thought
                        best calculated to restore public credit, and prevent the apprehension of a
                        general abolition of debts, which is but too common a consequence of wars
                        and civil dissensions. At the same time, in consequence of an address to the
                        people, he reestablished the praetors and tribunes, who had been deprived
                        upon a charge of bribery, at a time when Pompey awed the city by his
                        legions. These decisions were so little conformable to law, that sentence
                        was often pronounced by a party of judges different from those who attended
                        the pleadings. As these had made him an offer of their service in the
                        beginning of the war, he accounted the obligation the same as if he had
                        actually accepted of their friendship; but thought it better their

                        and other barbarous nations in those parts, he drew <placeName key="tgn,1054432">Issa</placeName> to revolt from Caesar. But finding
                        that the council of <placeName key="tgn,7017320">Salona</placeName> was neither to be moved by promises
                        nor threats, he resolved to invest the town. <placeName key="tgn,7017320">Salona</placeName> is built upon a hill, and
                        advantageously situated for defence; but as the fortifications were very
                        inconsiderable, the Roman citizens, residing there, immediately surrounded
                        the place with wooden towers; and finding themselves too few to resist the
                        attacks of the enemy, who soon overwhelmed them with wounds, betook
                        themselves to their last refuge, by granting liberty to all slaves capable
                        of bearing arms, and cutting off the women's hair, to make cords for their
                        engines. Octavius perceiving their obstinacy, formed five different camps
                        round the town, that they might at once suffer all the inconveniences of a
                        siege, and be exposed to frequent attacks. The Salonians, determined to
                        endure any thing, found themselves most pressed for want of corn; and
                        therefore sent deputies to Caesar to solicit a supply, patiently submitting
                        to all the other hardships they laboured under. When the siege had now
                        continued a considerable time, and the Octavians began to be off their
                        guard, the Salonians, finding the opportunity favourable, about noon, when
                        the enemy were dispersed, disposed their wives and children upon the walls,
                        that every thing might have its wonted appearance; and sallying in a body
                        with their enfranchised slaves, attacked the nearest quarters of Octavius.
                        Having soon forced these, they advanced to the next; thence to a third, a
                        fourth, and so on through the rest; till having driven the enemy from every
                        post, and made great slaughter of their men, they at length compelled them,
                        and Octavius their leader, to betake themselves to their ships. Such was the
                        issue of the siege. As winter now approached, and the loss had been very
                        considerable; Octavius, despairing to reduce the place, retired to <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, and joined Pompey. </p>

				<div2 n="10" id="b3c10" type="chapter">
					<p>We have seen that L. Vibullius Rufus, Pompey's chief engineer, had fallen
                        twice into Caesar's hands, and been as often set at liberty; the first time
                        at <placeName key="perseus,Corfinium">Corfinium</placeName>, the next in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>. Having been therefore twice
                        indebted to him for his life, and being also much in Pompey's esteem, Caesar
                        thought him a proper person to negotiate between them. His instructions
                        were; "That it was now time for both to desist from their obstinacy, and lay
                        down their arms, without exposing themselves any more to the precarious
                        events of fortune. That the losses they had already sustained ought to serve
                        as lessons and cautions, and fill them with just apprehensions with regard
                        to the future. That Pompey had been forced to abandon <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, had lost <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003121">Sardinia</placeName>, the two Spains, with about a
                        hundred and thirty cohorts of Roman citizens, who had perished in these
                        countries. That himself too had been a considerable sufferer by the death of
                        Curio, the destruction of the African army, and the surrender of his forces
                        at <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName>. That it was therefore incumbent
                        on them to show some regard to the sinking state of the commonwealth, having
                        sufficiently experienced, by their own misfortunes, how prevalent fortune
                        was in war. That the present moment was the most favourable in this respect;
                        because, not having yet tried one another's strength, and considering them
                        as equals, there would be more likelihood of agreeing on terms: whereas, if
                        one of them once got the superiority, he would exact every thing from the
                        other, and give up nothing. That as hitherto they had been unable to settle
                        the conditions of peace, they ought to refer them to the decision of the
                        senate and people of <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>; and, in the meantime, to obtain a
                        free and unbiassed judgment, both swear to disband their armies in three
                        days' time. That when they were once divested of their national and
                        auxiliary forces, in which their whole confidence lay, they would find
                        themselves under a necessity of submitting to the decree of the senate and
                        people. In fine, that to give Pompey a proof of his readiness to perform
                        these proposals, he would give immediate orders for the discharge of all his
                        forces, both in garrison and in the field." </p>

                        carried into the castle, fortified it with great care, and demanded hostages
                        of the townsmen. They refused to comply; declaring they would not shut their
                        gates against the consul of the Roman people, nor presume to act in
                        contradiction to the judgment of the senate, and of all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Staberius finding it in vain to
                        resist, privately left the place; upon which, the Apollonians sent deputies
                        to Caesar, and received him into the town. Bullidenses, Amantiani, with the
                        rest of the neighbouring countries, and all <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, followed their example;
                        acquainting Caesar, by their ambassadors, that they were ready to execute
                        his commands. </p>

					<p>Meanwhile Pompey, having notice of what passed at Oricum and <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>, and being apprehensive
                        for <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, marched day and night to
                        reach the place. At the same time it was reported that Caesar was not far
                        off; which meeting with the more credit, because of their hasty march, put
                        the whole army into such consternation, that many abandoning their colours
                        in <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName> and the neighbouring states, and
                        others throwing down their arms, every thing had the appearance of a
                        precipitate flight. But upon Pompey's halting near <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, and ordering a camp to be
                        formed; as the army had not even then recovered its fright, Labienus
                        advanced before the rest, and swore never to abandon his genshould assign
                        him. The other lieutenants did the same, as likewise the military tribunes
                        and centurions, whose example was followed by the whole army. Caesar,
                        finding that he was prevented in his design upon <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, pursued his march more
                        leisurely, and encamped on the river Apsus, in the territories of the
                        Apollonians; that he might protect the possessions of a state, which had so
                        warmly declared in his favour. Here he resolved to pass the winter in tents,
                        and wait the arrival of the rest of his legions out of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Pompey did the like, and having
                        encamped on the other side of the Apsus, assembled there all his legions and
                        auxiliaries. </p>

                        sailed very far till he was met by letters from Caesar, informing him that
                        all the Grecian coasts were guarded by the enemy's fleet. Upon this, he
                        recalled his ships, and returned again into the harbour. Only one continued
                        its route, which carried no soldiers, nor was subject to the orders of
                        Kalenus, but belonged to a private commander. This vessel arriving before
                        Oricum, fell into the hands of Bibulus, who, not sparing the very children,

					<p>Bibulus, as we have related above, lay at Oricum, with his fleet; and as he
                        deprived Caesar of all supplies by sea, so was he, in like manner, greatly
                        incommoded by Caesar at land; who, having disposed parties along the coast,
                        hindered him from getting water or wood, or coming near the shore. This was
                        attended with many inconveniences, and threw him into great straits;
                        insomuch that he was obliged to fetch all his other necessaries, as well as
                        wood and water, from the island of <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName>; and once, when foul weather
                        prevented his receiving refreshments from thence, the soldiers were
                        necessitated, for want of water, to collect the dew, which, in the night,
                        fell on the hides that covered their ships. Yet he bore all these
                        difficulties with surprising firmness, and continued resolute in his design
                        of not unguarding the coast. But at last, being reduced to the
                        above-mentioned extremity, and Libo having joined him, they called from two
                        of Caesar's lieutenants, one of whom guarded the walls of Oricum, and the
                        other the sea-coasts; that they wanted to confer with Caesar about affairs
                        of the greatest consequence, if they could but have an opportunity. To gain
                        the more credit, they let fall some expressions that seemed to promise
                        accommodation; and in the meanwhile demanded and obtained a truce; for
                        Marcus and Acilius believing their proposals to be serious, knew how
                        extremely grateful they would be to Caesar, and doubted not but Vibullius
                        had succeeded in his negotiation. </p>

					<p>Caesar was then at <placeName key="perseus,Buthrotum">Buthrotum</placeName>, a town over against <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName>; whither he was gone, with one
                        legion, to reduce some of the more distant states, and supply himself with
                        corn, which then began to be scarce. Here, receiving letters from Acilius
                        and Marcus, with an account of <placeName key="tgn,1069800">Libo</placeName> and Bibulus's demands, he left the
                        legion, and returned to Oricum. Upon his arrival, he invited them to a
                        conference. <placeName key="tgn,1069800">Libo</placeName> appeared, and made an apology for
                        Bibulus: "That being naturally hasty, and bearing a personal grudge to
                        Caesar, contracted during the time of his edileship and questorship, he had,
                        for that reason, declined the interview; to prevent any obstructions from
                        his presence to the success of so desirable and advantageous a design: that
                        Pompey was, and ever had been inclined to lay down his arms, and terminate
                        their differences by an accommodation; but as yet had not sent him
                        sufficient powers to treat; which, however, he doubted not soon to receive,
                        as the council had intrusted him with the whole administration of the war:
                        that if he would therefore make known his demands, they would send them to
                        Pompey, who would soon come to a resolution upon their representations. In
                        the meantime, the truce might continue, and both parties abstain from acts
                        of hostility, till an answer could be obtained." He added something about
                        the justice of their cause, and their forces, both natural and
                        auxiliary;</p>

					<p> to which Caesar neither at that time returned any answer, nor do we now
                        think it of importance enough to be transmitted to posterity. Caesar's
                        demands were: "That he might have leave to send ambassadors to Pompey; and
                        that they would either stipulate for their return, or undertake themselves
                        to convey them in safety: that with regard to the truce; such were the fleet
                        kept back his supplies and transports, and his forces deprived them of water
                        and access to the shore. If they expected any abatement on his side, they
                        must likewise abate in guarding the coast; but if they still persisted in
                        their former vigilance, neither would he yield in what depended on him:
                        that, notwithstanding, the accommodation might go forward without any
                        obstruction from this mutual denial." <placeName key="tgn,1069800">Libo</placeName> declined receiving Caesar's
                        ambassadors, or undertaking for their safe return, and chose to refer the
                        whole matter to Pompey; yet insisted on the truce. Caesar perceiving, that
                        the only aim of the enemy was to extricate themselves out of their present
                        straits and danger, and that it was in vain to entertain any hopes of peace,
                        turned all his thoughts to the vigorous prosecution of the war. </p>

					<p>Bibulus having kept at sea for many days, and contracted a dangerous illness

                        last sunk under the weight of his distemper. After his death, nobody
                        succeeded in the command of the whole fleet; but each squadron was governed,
                        independently of the rest, by its particular commander. </p>
					<p>When the surprise occasioned by Caesar's sudden arrival was over, Vibullius,
                        in presence of <placeName key="tgn,1069800">Libo</placeName>, L. Lucceius, and Theophanes, who
                        were among Pompey's most intimate counsellors, resolved to deliver the
                        commission he had received from Caesar. But scarce had he begun to speak,
                        when Pompey interrupted him, and ordered him to proceed no further. "What,"
                        says he, "is my life or country to me, if I shall seem to be beholden to
                        Caesar for them? And will it be believed that I am not indebted to him for
                        them, if he, by an accommodation, restores me to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>?" Caesar was informed of this
                        speech, after the conclusion of the war, by those who were present when it
                        was delivered: he still continued, however, by other methods, to try to
                        bring about an accommodation. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="19" id="b3c19" type="chapter">
					<p>As the two camps were only separated by the river Apsus, the soldiers had
                        frequent discourse among themselves; and it was settled by mutual consent,
                        that no act of hostility should pass during the conferences. Caesar taking
                        advantage of this opportunity, sent P. Vatinius, one of his lieutenants, to
                        forward to the utmost an accommodation; and to demand frequently with a loud
                        voice, "Whether it might not be permitted to citizens, to send deputies to
                        their fellow citizens about peace: that this had never been denied even to
                        fugitives and robbers, and could much less be opposed, when the only design
                        was to prevent the effusion of civil blood." This and much more he said,
                        with a submissive air, as became one employed to treat for his own and the
                        common safety. He was heard with great silence by both parties, and received
                        this answer from the enemy: "That A. Varro had declared he would next day
                        appear at an interview, whither the deputies of both parties might come in
                        perfect security, and mutually make known their demands." The hour of
                        meeting was likewise settled; which being come, multitudes on both sides
                        flocked to the place; the greatest expectations were formed; and the minds
                        of all seemed intent upon peace. T. Labienus, advancing from the crowd,
                        began in a low voice to confer with Vatinius, as if to settle the articles
                        of the treaty. But their discourse was soon interrupted by a multitude of
                        darts that came pouring in on all sides. Vatinius escaped the danger, by
                        means of the soldiers, who protected him with their shields; but Cornelius
                        Balbus, M. Plotius, L. Tiburtus, centurions, and some private men, were
                        wounded. Labienus then lifted up his voice, and cried: "Leave off prating of
                        an accommodation; for you must not expect peace, till you bring us Caesar's
                        head." </p>

					<p>About the same time, M. Caelius Rufus, pretor at <placeName key="tgn,7000874">Rome</placeName> for foreign affairs, having
                        undertaken the cause of the debtors, on his entrance into his office,
                        ordered his tribunal to be fixed near that of the city pretor, C. Trebonius,
                        and promised to receive the complaints of such as should appeal to him, in
                        regard to the estimation and payments, made in consequence of Caesar's late
                        regulation. But such was the equity of the decree, and the humanity of
                        Trebonius, who, in so nice and critical an affair, thought it necessary to
                        conduct himself with the utmost clemency and moderation, that no pretence of
                        appeal could be found. For to plead poverty, personal losses, the hardness
                        of the times, and the difficulty of bringing their effects to sale, is usual
                        enough even with reasonable minds: but to own themselves indebted, and yet
                        aim at keeping their possessions entire, would have argued a total want both
                        of honesty and shame. Accordingly not a man was found who had made any such
                        demand. Caelius's whole severity, therefore, was pointed against those, to
                        whom the inheritance of the debtor was adjudged; and having once embarked in
                        the affair, that he might not seem to have engaged himself to no purpose in
                        an unjustifiable cause, he published a law, by which he allowed the debtors
                        six years for the discharge of their debts, wihch they were to clear at
                        equal payments, without interest.</p>

					<p>But the consul Servilius, and the rest of the magistrates opposing the law,

                        that design; and in the view of inflaming the people, proposed two new laws;
                        the one, to exempt all the tenants in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> from paying rents; the other, for a
                        general abolition of debts. This bait took with themultitude, and Caelius at
                        their head, came and attacked C. Trebonius on his tribunal, drove him
                        thence, and wounded some about him. The consul Servilius reported these
                        things to the senate, who interdicted to Caelius the functions of his
                        office. In consequence of this decree, the consul refused him admittance
                        into the senate, and drive him out of his tribunal, when he was going to
                        harangue the people. Overwhelmed with shame and resentment, he openly
                        threatened to carry his complaints to Caesar; but privately gave notice to
                        Milo, who had been banished for the murder of Clodius, to come into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and join him with the remains of
                        the gladiators, which he bought formerly to entertain the people with, in
                        the shows he gave them. With this view he sent him before to Turinum, to
                        solicit the shepherds to take arms, and went himself to <placeName key="tgn,7004529">Casilinum</placeName>: where hearing that his arms and

                        increased every moment, because the citizens had taken arms, and began to

                        on the walls. Caelius giving out that he was gone to Caesar, came to <placeName key="tgn,6005942">Thurium</placeName>, where endeavouring to debauch the
                        inhabitants, and corrupt by promises of money the Spanish and Gaulish horse,
                        whom Caesar had sent thither to garrison the place, they slew him. Thus
                        these dangerous beginnings, that by reason of the multiplicity of affairs
                        wherewith the magistrates were distracted, and the ticklish situation of the
                        times, threatened great revolutions, and alarmed all <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, were brought to a safe and speedy
                        issue. </p>

					<p>Libo leaving Oricum, with the fleet under his command, consisting of fifty
                        sail, came to <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>, and possessed himself
                        of an island directly facing the harbour, judging it of more consequence to
                        secure a post, by which our transports must necessarily pass, than guard all
                        the coasts and havens on the other side. As his arrival was unexpected, he
                        surprised and burned some transports, and carried off a vessel loaded with
                        corn. The consternation was great among our men, insomuch that having landed
                        some foot, with a party of archers, in the night, he defeated our guard of
                        cavalry, and had so far the advantage, by the commodiousness of his post,
                        that he wrote Pompey word, he might draw the rest of the navy on shore, and
                        order them to be careened; for he alone, with his squadron, would undertake
                        to cut off Caesar's supplies. </p>

					<p>Antony was then at <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>, who confiding in the
                        valour of the troops, ordered some boats belonging to the fleet to be armed
                        with hurdles and galleries, and having filled them with chosen troops,
                        disposed them in several places along the shore. At the same time, he sent
                        two three-benched galleys, which he had caused to be built at <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>, to the mouth of the
                        harbour, as if with design to exercise the rowers. Libo perceiving them
                        advance boldly, and hoping he might be able to intercept them, detached five
                        quadriremes for that purpose. At their approach, our men rowed towards the
                        harbour, whither the enemy, eager of the pursuit, inconsiderately followed
                        them; for now Antony's armed boats, upon a signal given, came pouring upon
                        them from all parts, and on the very first onset took a quadrireme, with all
                        the soldiers and sailors on board, and forced the rest to an ignominious
                        flight. To add to this disgrace, the cavalry, which Antony had posted ail
                        along the coast, hindered the enemy from watering; which reduced them to
                        such straits that Libo was forced to quit the blockade or <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>, and retire with his
                        fleet. </p>

					<p>Several months had now passed; the winter was almost over; meantime, neither
                        the ships nor legions were yet arrived, which Caesar expected from <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>. He could not help
                        thinking that some opportunities had been lost, as it was certain the wind
                        had many times offered fair, and there was a necessity of trusting to it at
                        last. The longer the delay in sending over the troops, the more vigilant and
                        alert were the enemy in guarding the coast, and the greater their confidence
                        to hinder the passage; nay, Pompey, in his letters, frequently reproached
                        them, that as they had not prevented the first embarkation, they ought at
                        least to take care that no more of the troops got over; and the season
                        itself was becoming less favourable, by the approach of milder weather, when
                        the enemy's fleet would be able to act and extend itself. For these reasons,
                        Caesar wrote sharply to his lieutenants at <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>, charging them not to
                        omit the first opportunity of sailing, as soon as the wind offered fair, and
                        to steer for the coast of <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>, which they could approach
                        with less danger, as it was not so strictly guarded by the enemy, who were
                        afraid of venturing on a coast so ill provided with havens. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="26" id="b3c26" type="chapter">
					<p>The lieutenants, roused and emboldened by these letters, and encouraged by
                        the exhortations of the troops themselves, who professed they were ready to
                        face any danger for Caesar's sake, embarked under the direction of M. Antony
                        and Fufius Kalenus, and setting sail with the wind at south, passed <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName> next day. Being descried from
                        the continent, C. Coponius, who commanded the Rhodian squadron at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, put out to sea, and the wind
                        slackening upon our fleet, it was near falling into the hands of the enemy;
                        but a fresh gale springing up at south, saved us from that danger. Coponius
                        however desisted not from the pursuit, hoping by the labour and perseverance
                        of the mariners, to surmount the violence of the tempest; and though we had
                        passed <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName> with a very hard gale, still
                        continued to follow us. Our men, apprehensive of an attack, should the wind
                        again chance to slacken, seized an advantage fortune threw in their way, and
                        put into the port of Nyphaeum, about three miles beyond <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName>. This port is sheltered from the
                        south-west wind, but lies open to the south; but,they preferred the hazard
                        they might be exposed to by the tempest, to that of fighting. At that
                        instant, by an unusual piece of good fortune, the wind, which for two days
                        had blown from the south, changed to the south west. This was a sudden and
                        favourable turn: for the fleet so lately in danger from the enemy, was
                        sheltered in a safe commodious port; and that whichthreatened ours with
                        destruction, was in its turn exposed to the utmost peril. </p>

					<p>By this unexpected
                        change, the storm, which protected our fleet, beat so furiously on the
                        Rhodian galleys, that they were all, to the number of sixteen, broken to
                        pieces against the shore. Most of the soldiers and mariners perished among
                        the rocks: the rest were taken up by our men, and sent by Caesar's orders to
                        their several homes. </p>

					<p>Two of our transports, unable to keep up with the rest, were overtaken by the
                        night: and not knowing where the fleet had put in, cast anchor over against <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName>. Otacilius Crassus, who commanded
                        in the place, sent out some boats and small vessels to attack them: at the
                        same time he urged them to surrender, promising quarter to such as would
                        submit. One of these vessels carried two hundred and twenty new-raised
                        soldiers; the other less than two hundred veterans. On this occasion
                        appeared, how great a defence against danger results from firmness of mind.
                        The new levies, frighted at the number of their adversaries, and fatigued
                        with sea-sickness, surrendered on promise of their lives. But when they were
                        brought to Otacilius, regardless of the oath he had taken, he ordered them
                        all to be cruelly slain in his presence. The veterans, on the contrary,
                        though they hadboth the storm and a leaky vessel to struggle with, abated
                        nothing of their wonted bravery: but having spun out the time till night
                        under pretence of treating, obliged the pilot to run the vessel ashore,
                        where finding an advantageous post, they continuedthe remainder of the
                        night. At day-break, Otacilius detached against them part of the coast, and
                        pursued them sword in hand; but they defendedthemselves with great bravery,
                        and having slain some of the enemy, rejoined, without loss, the rest of the
                        troops. </p>

					<p>Upon this the Roman citizens inhabiting <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName>, to whom Caesar had before made a
                        grant of the town, after fortifying it with great care, opened their gates
                        to Antony, and furnished him with every thing he stood in need of.
                        Otacilius, dreading the consequences of this revolution, quitted the place,
                        and fled to Pompey. Antony having landed his troops, which consisted of
                        three veteran legions, one new raised, and eight hundred horse, sent most of
                        the transports back again to <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>, to bring over the rest
                        of the foot and cavalry; retaining, nevertheless, some ships of Gaulish
                        structure, that if Pompey, imagining <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> destitute of troops, should attempt
                        to run thither, as was commonly rumoured, Caesar might be able to follow
                        him. At the same time he gave Caesar speedy notice of the number of forces
                        he had brought over with him, and the place where he had landed. </p>

				<div2 n="30" id="b3c30" type="chapter">
					<p>This intelligence reached Caesar and Pompey much about the same time; for
                        both had seen the fleet pass <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, and had in consequence
                        directed their march that way; but neither knew, for some days, into what
                        harbour it had put. On the first news of Antony's landing, the two generals
                        took different resolutions; Caesar, to join him as soon as possible; Pompey,
                        to oppose his march, and, if possible, draw him into an ambuscade. Both
                        quitted their camps on the Apsus about the same time; Pompey, privately,
                        during the night; Caesar, publicly, by day. But Caesar, who had the river to
                        cross, was obliged to fetch a compass, that he might come at a ford. Pompey,
                        on the other hand, having nothing to obstruct his march, advanced by great
                        journeys against Antony; and, understanding that he was not far off, posted
                        his troops on an advantageous ground, ordering them to keep within their
                        camp, and light no fires, that his approach might not be perceived. But
                        Antony being informed of it by the Greeks, would not stir out of his lines,
                        and sending immediate notice to Caesar, was joined by him next day. On
                        advice of Caesar's arrival, Pompey, that he might not be shut up between two
                        armies, quitted the place, and coming with all his forces to Asparagium, a
                        town belonging to the Dyrrhachians, encamped there on an advantageous
                        ground. </p>

					<p>About the same time Scipio, notwithstanding some checks he had received near
                        Mount Amanus, assumed the title of emperor; after which he exacted great
                        sums of money from the neighbouring states and princes; obliged the farmers
                        of the revenue to pay the two years' taxes, which lay in their hands, and
                        advance a third by way of loan, and sent orders to the whole province; for
                        levying cavalry. Having got a sufficient number together, he quitted the
                        Parthians, his nearest enemies who not long before had slain M. Crassus, and
                        held Bibulus invested; and marched out of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> with his legions and cavalry. When
                        he arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName>, he found the whole country
                        filled with terror on account of the Parthian war; and the soldiers
                        themselves declared, that they were ready to march against an enemy, but
                        would never bear arms against a consul, and their fellow-citizens. To stifle
                        these discontents, he made considerable presents to the troops, quartered
                        them in <placeName key="tgn,7016140">Pergamus</placeName> and other rich towns, and gave up

					<p> Meanwhile the money demanded of the province was levied with great rigour,
                        and various pretences were devised, to serve as a ground to new exactions.
                        Slaves and freemen were subject to a capitation tax. Imposts were laid upon
                        pillars and doors of houses. Corn, soldiers, mariners, arms, engines,
                        carriages, in a word, every thing that had a name, furnished a sufficient
                        handle for extorting money. Governors were appointed not only over towns,
                        but over villages and castles; and he that acted with the greatest rigour
                        and cruelty, was accounted the worthiest man and best citizen. The province
                        swarmed with lictors, overseers, and collectors, who, besides the sums
                        imposed by public authority exacted money likewise on their own account,
                        colouring their iniquitous demands with a pretence that they had been
                        expelled their country and native homes, and were in extreme want of every
                        thing. Add to all these calamities, immoderate usury, an evil almost
                        inseparable from war; for so great sums are then exacted, beyond what a
                        country is able to furnish, they are obliged to apply for a delay, which at
                        any price is still accounted a favour. Thus the debts of the province
                        increased considerably during these two years. Nor were the Roman citizens
                        the only sufferers on this occasion; for certain sums were demanded of every
                        state and corporation, as a loan upon the senate's decree; and the farmers
                        of the revenue were ordered to advance the next year's tribute, in like
                        manner as when they first entered upon office.</p>

					<p> Besides all this, Scipio gave orders for seizing the treasures of the temple

                        goddess. But when he came to the temple, attended by many persons of
                        senatorian rank, he received letters from Pompey, desiring him to lay aside
                        all other concerns, and make what haste he could to join him, because Caesar
                        had passed into <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> with his whole army. In consequence
                        of this order, he sent back the senators who had been summoned to attend him
                        at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, made preparations for passing
                        into <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, and began his march a few days

					<p>Caesar having joined Antony's army, and recalled the legion he had left at

                        the country, and possess himself of the more distant provinces. At the same
                        time,deputies arrived from <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName> with assurances of submission from

                        Accordingly he despatched L. Cassius Longinus, with a legion of new levies,
                        called the twenty-seventh, and two hundred horse, into <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>; and C. Calvissius Sabinus, with

                        care to furnish him with corn. He likewise ordered Cn. Domitius Calvinus,
                        with the eleventh and twelfth legions, and five hundred horse, to march into <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>: for Menedemus, the principal
                        man of that country, having come ambassador to Caesar, had assured him of
                        the affection of the province. </p>

					<p>Calvisius was well received by the Aetolians, and having driven the enemy's
                        garrisons from Calydon and Naupactum, possessed himself of the whole
                        country. Cassius arriving in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> with his legion, found the state
                        divided into two factions. Egesaretus, a man in years, and of established
                        credii, favoured Pompey; Petreius, a young nobleman of the first rank,
                        exerted his whole interest in behalf of Caesar. </p>

				<div2 n="36" id="b3c36" type="chapter">
					<p>About the same time Domitius arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>; and while deputies were
                        attending him from all parts, news came that Scipio approached with his
                        legions, which spread a great alarm through the country; as fame, for the
                        most part, magnifies the first appearances of things. Scipio, without
                        stopping any where in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, advanced by great marches
                        towards Domitius; but being come within twenty miles of him, suddenly
                        changed his route, and turned off to <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, in quest of Cassius Longinus.
                        This was done so expeditiously, that he was actually arrived with his
                        troops, when Cassius received the first notice of his march: for to make the
                        more despatch, he had left M. Favonius at the river Haliacmon, which
                        separates <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, with eight cohorts, to guard the
                        baggage of the legions, and ordered him to erect a fort there. At the same
                        time, king Cotus's cavalry, which had been accustomed to make inroads into <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, came pouring upon Cassius's
                        camp; who, knowing that Scipio was upon his march, and believing the cavalry
                        to be his, retired in a fright to the mountains that begirt <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, and thence directed his course
                        towards <placeName key="perseus,Ambracia">Ambracia</placeName>. Scipio preparing to follow
                        him, received letters from M. Favonius, that Domitius was coming up with his
                        legions, nor would it be possible for him to maintain the post he was in,
                        without his assistance. Scipio, upon his intelligence, changed his
                        resolution, gave over the pursuit of Cassius, and advanced to the relief of
                        Favonius. As he marched day and night without intermission, he arrived so
                        opportunely, that the dust of Domitius's army, and his advanced parties,
                        were descried at the same time. Thus Domitius's care preserved Cassius, and
                        Scipio's diligence Favonius. </p>

					<p>Scipio continued two days in his camp upon the Haliacmon, which ran between
                        him and the army of Domitius, put his troops in motion on the third, and by
                        day-break forded the river. Early next morning he drew up his troops in
                        order of battle at the head of his camp. Domitius was not averse to an
                        engagement; but as between the two camps there was a plain of six miles, he
                        thought that the fittest place for a field of battle, and drew up his men at
                        some distance from Scipost; yet hardly could Domitius restrain his men from
                        advancing to attack him though a rivulet with steep banks, that ran in the
                        front of the enemy's camp, and opposed their passage. Scipio observing the
                        keenness and alacrity of our troops, and fearing that next day he should
                        either be forced to fight against his will, or ignominiously keep within his
                        camp; after great expectations raised, by too hastily crossting the river,
                        he saw all his projects defeated; and decamping in great silence during the
                        night, returned to his former station, beyond the Haliacmon, and posted
                        himself on a rising ground, near the river. A few days after, he formed an
                        ambuscade, of cavalry, by night, in a place where our men were wont to
                        forage: and when Q. Varus, who commanded the horse under Domitius, came next
                        day, according to custom; suddenly the enemy rose from their lurking holes:
                        but our men bravely sustained the attack, soon recovered their ranks, and in
                        their turn vigorously charged the enemy. About fourscore fell on this
                        occasion; the rest betook themselves to flight; and our men returned to
                        their camp, with the loss of only two of their number. </p>

					<p>After this rencounter, Domitius, hoping to draw Scipio to a battle, feigned
                        to decamp for want of provisions; and having made the usual signal for
                        retreating, after a march of three miles, drew up his cavalry and legions in
                        a convenient plain, shrouded from the enemy's view. Scipio, preparing to
                        follow, sent the horse and light-armed infantry before to explore his route,
                        and examine the situation of the country. When they were advanced a little
                        way, and their first squadrons had come within reach of our ambush;
                        beginning to suspect something from the neighing of the horses, they wheeled
                        about, in order to retreat; which the troops that followed observing,
                        suddenly halted. Our men, finding that the ambush was discovered, and
                        knowing it would be in vain to wait for the rest of the army, fell upon the
                        two squadrons that were most advanced. M. Opinius, general of the horse to
                        Domitius, was amongst these, but somehow found means to escape. All the rest
                        were either slain, or made prisoners. </p>

					<p>Caesar having drawn off his garrisons from the sea-coast, as we have related

                        transport in the mouth of the haven, behind which another rode at anchor, on
                        whose deck a tower was erected, facing the entrance of the port, and filled
                        with troops, to be ready in case of surprise.</p>

					<p> Young Pompey, who commanded the Egyptian fleet, having notice of this, came
                        to Oricum; weighed up the vessel that had been sunk in the mouth of the
                        harbour; and, after an obstinate resistance, took the other, which had been
                        placed there by Acilius, to guard the haven. He then brought forward his
                        fleet, on which he had raised towers, to fight with the greater advantage;
                        and having surrounded the town on all sides, attacked it by land with
                        scaling ladders, and by sea from the towers, sending fresh men continually
                        in the place of those that were fatigued, and thereby obliging us to yield,
                        through weariness and wounds. At the same time he seized an eminence, on the
                        other side of the town, which seemed a kind of natural mole, and almost
                        formed a peninsula over against Oricum; and by means of this neck of land,
                        carried four small galleys, upon rollers, into the inner part of the haven.
                        Thus the galleys, that were made fast to the land, and destitute of troops,
                        being attacked on all sides, four were carried off, and the rest burned.
                        This affair despatched, he left D. Laelius, whom he had taken from the
                        command of the Asiatic fleet, to prevent the importation of provisions from <placeName key="tgn,1038514">Biblis</placeName> and Amantia; and sailing for <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName>, attacked and burned the thirty
                        transports which Antony had left in that haven. He endeavoured likewise to
                        take the town; but the Roman citizens of that district, aided by the
                        garrison Caesar had left, defended it so well, that at the end of three
                        days, he retired without effecting his purpose, having lost some men in the
                        attempt. </p>

					<p>Caesar being informed that Pompey was at Asparagium, marched thither with his
                        army; and having taken the capital of the Parthinians by the way, where
                        Pompey had a garrison; arrived the third day in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, and encamped at a small
                        distance from the enemy. The next day he drew out all his forces, formed
                        them before his camp, and offered Pompey battle. Finding that he kept within
                        his lines, he led back his troops, and began to think of pursuing other
                        measures. Accordingly, on the morrow, by a long circuit, and through very
                        narrow and difficult ways, he marched, with all his forces, to <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>; hoping either to oblige
                        Pompey to follow him thither, or cut off his communication with the town,
                        where he had laid up all his provisions, and magazines of war; which
                        happened accordingly. For Pompey, at first, not penetrating his design,
                        because he counterfeited a route different from what he really intended,
                        imagined he had been obliged to decamp for want of provisions: but being
                        afterwards informed of the truth, by his scouts, he quitted his camp next
                        day, in hopes to pre vent him by taking a nearer way. Caesar, suspecting
                        what might happen, exhorted his soldiers to bear the fatigue patiently; and
                        allowing them to repose during only a small part of the night, arrived next
                        morning at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, where he immediately formed a
                        camp, just as Pompey's van began to appear at a distance. </p>

				<div2 n="42" id="b3c42" type="chapter">
					<p>Pompey, thus excluded from <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, and unable to execute his
                        first design, came to a resolution of encamping on an eminence, called <placeName key="perseus,Petra">Petra</placeName>, where was a tolerable harbour,
                        sheltered from some winds. Here he ordered part of his fleet to attend him,
                        and corn and provisions to be brought him from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and the other provinces subject to
                        his command. Caesar, apprehending the war would run into length, and
                        despairing of supplies from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, because the coasts were so strictly
                        guarded by Pompey's fleet; and his own galleys, built, the winter before, in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, were not yet arrived; despatched L.
                        Canuleius, one of his lieutenants, to <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, for corn. And because that country
                        lay at a great distance from his camp, he built granaries in several places,
                        and wrote to the neighbouring states to carry their corn thither. He
                        likewise ordered search to be made for what corn could be found in <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName>, the country of the Parthinians,
                        and the other principalities in those parts. This amounted to very little;
                        partly occasioned by the soil, which is rough and mountainous, and obliges
                        the inhabitants often to import grain; partly because Pompey, foreseeing
                        Caesar's wants, had, some days before, ravaged the country of the
                        Parthinians, plundered their houses, and, corn. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="43" id="b3c43" type="chapter">
					<p>For these reasons, Caesar formed a project, which the very nature of the
                        country suggested. All round Pompey's camp, at a small distance, were high
                        and steep hills. Caesar took possession of those hills, and built forts upon
                        them; resolving, as the nature of the ground would allow, to draw lines of
                        communication from one fort to another, and inclose Pompey within his works.
                        His views herein were; first, to facilitate the passage of his convoys,
                        which the enemy's cavalry, which was very strong and fine, would no longer
                        cut off; next. to distress this very cavalry, for want of forage; and
                        lastly, to lessen the great reputation and high idea entertained of Pompey,
                        when it should be reported all over the world, that he had suffered himself
                        to be blockaded, and, as it were, imprisoned by Caesar's works; and durst
                        not hazard a battle to set himself at liberty. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="44" id="b3c44" type="chapter">
					<p>Pompey would neither leave the sea and <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, where he had all his
                        magazines and engines of war, and whence he was supplied with provisions by
                        means of his fleet; nor could prevent the progress of Caesar's works,
                        without fighting, which, at that time, he was determined against. He could
                        do nothing therefore but extend himself, by taking as many hills, and as
                        large a circuit of country as possible, to give his adversary the more
                        trouble, and divide his forces. This he did, by raising twenty-four forts,
                        which took in a circumference of fifteen miles, wherein were arable and
                        pasture lands, to feed his horses and beasts of burden. And as our men had
                        carried their circumvallation quite round, by drawing lines of commuication
                        from fort to fort, to prevent the sallies of the enemy, and guard against
                        the attacks in the rear; in like manner, Pompey's men had surrounded
                        themselves with lines, to hinder us from breaking in upon them, and charging
                        them behind. They even perfected their works first, because they had more
                        hands, and a less circuit to inclose. When Caesar endeavoured to gain any
                        place, Pompey, though determined not to oppose him with all his forces, nor
                        hazard a general action, failed not, however, to detach parties of archers
                        and slingers; who wounded great numbers of our men, and occasioned such a
                        dread of their arrows, that almost all the soldiers furnished themselves,
                        with coats of danger. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="45" id="b3c45" type="chapter">
					<p>Both parties disputed every post with great obstinacy: Caesar, that he might
                        inclose Pompey within as narrow a space as possible; and Pompey, that he
                        might have liberty to extend himself; which occasioned many sharp
                        skirmishes. In one of these, Caesar's ninth legion having possessed
                        themselves of an eminence, which they began to fortify, Pompey seized the
                        opposite mount, with a resolution to hinder their works. As the access on
                        one side was very easy, he sent first some archers and slingers, and
                        afterwards a strong detachment of light-armed foot, plying us, at the same
                        time, with his military engines; which obliged our men to desist; as they
                        found it impossible at once to sustain the enemy's charge, and go forward
                        with their works. Caesar, perceiving that his men were wounded from all
                        sides, resolved to quit the place and retire. But as the descent, by which
                        he must retreat, was pretty steep, the Pompeians charged him briskly in
                        drawing off, imagining he gave way through fear. Pompey went so far as to
                        say, That he consented to be accounted a general of no merit, if Caesar's

					<p>Caesar, concerned about the retreat of his men, ordered hurdles to be fixed
                        on the ridge of the hill fronting the enemy: behind which he dug a moderate
                        ditch, and rendered the place as inaccessible as he could, on all sides.
                        When this was done, he began to file off the legionary soldiers, supporting
                        them by some light-armed troops, posted on their flanks, who, with arrows
                        and stones, might repulse the enemy. Pompey's troops failed not to pursue
                        them, with great outcries and fierce menaces, overturned the hurdles, and
                        used them as bridges to get over the ditch. Which Casar observing, and
                        fearing some disaster might ensue, should he seem to be driven from a post,
                        which he quitted voluntarily; when his forces were got half down the hill,
                        encouraging them by Antony, who had the command of that legion, he gave the
                        signal to face about, and fall on the enemy. Immediately the soldiers of the
                        ninth legion, forming themselves into close order, launched their darts; and
                        advancing briskly up the hill against the enemy, forced them to give ground,
                        and at last betake themselves to flight; which was not a little incommoded
                        by the hurdles, palisades, and ditch, Caesar had thrown up to stop to secure
                        their retreat, having killed several of the enemy, and lost only five of
                        their own number, retired without the least disturbance, and inclosing some
                        other hills within their lines, completed the circumvallation. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="47" id="b3c47" type="chapter">
					<p>This method of making war was new and extraordinary; as well in regard to the
                        number of forts, the extent of the circumvallation, the greatness of his
                        works, and the manner of attack and defence, as on other accounts. For
                        whoever undertakes to invest another, is, for the most part, moved thereto,
                        either by some previousdefeat he has sustained, the knowledge of his
                        weakness, to take advantage of his distress, to profit by a superiority of
                        forces; or, in fine, to cut off his provisions, which is the most ordinary
                        cause of. these attempts. But Caesar, with an inferior force, besieged
                        Pompey, whose troops were entire, in good order, and abounded in all things.
                        For ships arrived every day, from all parts, with provisions; nor could the
                        wind blow from any quarter, that was not favourable to some of them; whereas
                        Caesar's army, having consumed all the corn round about, was reduced to the
                        last necessities. Nevertheless the soldiers bore all with singular patience
                        ; remembering, that though reduced to the like extremity the year before, in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, they had yet, by their assiduity
                        and perseverance, put an end to a very formidable war. They called to mind
                        too their sufferings at <placeName key="tgn,7008213">Alesia</placeName>, and their still greater distresses
                        before <placeName key="tgn,7017415">Avaricum</placeName>, by which, however, they
                        triumphed over mighty nations. When barley or pulse was given them instead
                        of corn, they took it cheerfully; and thought themselves regaled when they
                        got any cattle, which <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName> furnished them with in great
                        abundance.</p>

				<div2 n="48" id="b3c48" type="chapter">
					<p> They discovered in the country a root, called chara, which they pounded and
                        kneaded with milk, so as to make a sort of bread of it. This furnished a
                        plentiful supply; and when their adversaries reproached them with their
                        want, by way of answer to their insults, they threw their loaves at them.

					<p>By this time, the corn began to ripen, and the hopes of a speedy supply
                        supported the soldiers under their present wants. Nay, they were often heard
                        to say one to another, that they would sooner live on the bark of trees,
                        than let Pompey escape. For they were informed from time to time, by
                        deserters, that their horses were almost starved, and the rest of their
                        cattle actually dead; that the troops themselves were very sickly; partly
                        occasioned by the narrow space in which they were inclosed, the number and
                        noisesome smell of dead carcases, and the daily fatigue to which they were
                        unaccustomed, partly by their extreme want of water. For Caesar had either
                        turned the course of all the rivers and brooks that ran into the sea, or
                        dammed up their currents. And as the country was mountainous, intermixed
                        with deep valleys, by driving piles into the earth, and covering them with
                        mould, he stopped up the course of the waters. This obliged the enemy to
                        search for low and marshy places, and to dig wells, which added to their
                        daily labour. The wells too, when discovered, lay at a considerable distance
                        from some parts of the army, and were soon dried up by the heat. Caesar's
                        army, on the contrary, was very healthy, abounded in water, and had plenty
                        of all kinds of provisions, corn excepted, which they hoped to be soon
                        supplied with, as the season was now pretty far advanced, and harvest
                        approached. </p>

					<p>In this method of making war, new stratagems were every day put in practice
                        by both generals. Pompey's soldiers, observing by the fires the place where
                        our cohorts were upon guard, stole thither privately by night, and pouring
                        upon them a flight of arrows, retired instantly to their camp, which obliged
                        our men to have fires in one place, and keep guard in another. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="51" id="b3c51" type="chapter">
					<p>Meanwhile P. Sylla, whom Caesar at his departure had left to command the
                        camp, being informed of what passed, came to the assistance of the cohort,
                        with two legions. His arrival soon put the Pompeians to flight, who could
                        not stand the very sight and shock of his troops; but seeing their first
                        ranks broken, took to their heels, and quitted the place. Sylla checked the
                        ardour of his men, whom he would not suffer to continue the pursuit too far;
                        and it was the general belief, that had he pursued the enemy warmly, that
                        day might have put an end to the war. His conduct, however, cannot be justly
                        censured; for the difference is great between a lieutenant and a general;
                        the one is tied up to act according to instructions; the other, free from
                        restraint, is at liberty to lay hold of all advantages. Sylla, who was left
                        by Caesar to take care of the camp, was satisfied with having disengaged his
                        own men, and had no intention to hazard a general action, which might have
                        been attended with ill consequences, and would have looked like arrogating
                        the part of a general. The Pompeians found it no easy matter to make good
                        their retreat; for having advanced from a very disadvantageous pest to the
                        summit of the hill, they had reason to fear our men would charge them in
                        descending, and the rather, as it was very near sunset, for they had
                        protracted the affair almost till night, in hopes of accomplishing their
                        design. Thus Pompey, compelled by necessity, immediately took possession of
                        an eminence, at such a distance from our fort, as to be secure from darts
                        and military engines. Here he encamped, threw up an intrenchment, and drew
                        his forces together to defend the place. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="52" id="b3c52" type="chapter">
					<p>At the same time we were engaged in two other places; for Pompey attacked
                        several castles together to divide our forces, and hinder the forts from
                        mutually sucouring one another. In one of these, Volcatius Tullus, with
                        three cohorts, sustained the charge of a whole legion, and forced them to
                        retire. In the other, the Germans, sallying out of their intrenchments, slew
                        several of the enemy, and returned again without loss. </p>

				<div2 n="53" id="b3c53" type="chapter">
					<p>Thus there happened no less than six actions in one day; three near <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, and three about the lines. In
                        computing the number of the slain, it appeared that Pompey lost about two
                        thousand men, with several volunteers and centurions, among whom was
                        Valerius Flaccus, the son of Lucius, who had formerly been praetor of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. We gained six standards, with the
                        loss of no more than twenty men in all the attacks; but in the fort, not a
                        soldier escaped being wounded; and four centurions belonging to one cohort,
                        lost their eyes. As a proof of the danger they had been exposed to, and the
                        efforts they had sustained, they brought and counted to Caesar about thirty
                        thousand arrows that had been shot into the fort, and showed him the
                        centurion Scaeva's buckler, which was pierced in two hundred and thirty
                        places. Caesar, as a reward for his services both to himself and the
                        republic, presented him with two hundred thousand asses, and advanced him
                        directly from the eighth rank of captains to the first; it appearing that
                        the preservation of the fort was chiefly owing to his valour. He also
                        distributed military rewards among the other offithem double pay, and a
                        double allowance of corn. </p>

                        part of his camp with mantelets. Five days after, taking advantage of very
                        dark night, he walled up the gates of his camp, rendered all the avenues
                        impracticable; and drawing out his troops in great silence about midnight,

                        both, whom he had taken into his service upon Scipio's recommendation. At
                        his departure, he charged him with letters and instructions to this effect:
                        "That he had tried all ways to bring about a peace; but believed he had
                        hitherto miscarried, through the fault of those to whom his proposals were
                        addressed, because they dreaded presenting them to Scipio's authority to be
                        such, as not only privileged him to advise freely, but even to enforce his
                        counsels, and compel the obstinate to hearken to reason: that he was
                        possessed of an independent command, and had an army at his disposal to give
                        weight to his interposition: that in employing it for so desirable an end,
                        he would gain the indisputable praise of having restored quiet to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, peace to the provinces, and saved
                        the empire." Clodius reported this commission to Scipio, and at first met
                        with a favourable reception, but was afterwards denied audience: for
                        Favonius having sharply reprimanded Scipio, as we learned after the
                        conclusion of the war, the negotiation was discontinued, and Clodius

                        strong works, and raised forts to defend them. Pompey finding his cavalry
                        rendered by this means unserviceable, conveyed them some days after by sea
                        to his camp again. Forage was so scarce, that they were forced to have

                        signal service to Caesar in all his Gallic wars. For these reasons he had
                        raised them to the highest offices in their own country, got them chosen

                        hopes by the experience of what he had already done for them. This rebuke,
                        however, disgusted them greatly, and very much lessened their credit with
                        the whole army, which they easily perceived, as well from the raillery they
                        were often forced to bear, as in consequence of the secret reproaches and
                        sense of their own minds. Thus prompted by shame, and perhaps imagining they
                        were not cleared, but reserved to a more favourable opportunity, they
                        resolved to desert, to try their fortunes elsewhere, and search for new
                        friendships. Having imparted their design to a few of their clients, whom
                        they judged fit instruments for so black a treason, they first attempted to
                        murder C. Volusenus, general of the cavalry (as was afterwards known, when
                        the war was over), that by so signal a piece of service they might the more
                        effectually recommend themselves to Pompey's favour. But finding that design
                        attended with great hazard, and that no favourable opportunity offered for
                        putting it in execution, they borrowed all the money they could, under
                        pretence of reimbursing the troops, and making restitution; and having
                        bought up a great number of horses, went over to Pompey, with those whom
                        they had made acquainted with their design.</p>

					<p> As they were persons of noble birth, liberally educated, came with a great
                        train of horses and servants, had been highly honoured by Caesar, and were
                        universally esteemed on account of their valour, Pompey carried them
                        ostentatiously over all the camp, triumphing in this new and unusual
                        acquisition; for till then, neither horse nor foot-soldier had deserted from
                        Caesar to Pompey; whereas scarce a day passed without some desertion from
                        Pompey's army, especially among the new levies in <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>, and those countries that had
                        declared for Caesar. The brothers being well acquainted with the condition

                        foible of the lines lay, the particular times, distance of places, strength

                        who commanded in every post, made an exact report of all to Pompey. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="62" id="b3c62" type="chapter">
					<p>Upon this intelligence, having already formed the design of forcing Caesar's
                        lines, he ordered the soldiers to make coverings of osier for their helmets,
                        and provide themselves with fascines. This done, he embarked by night, in
                        boats and small barks, a great number of light-armed troops and archers,
                        with the fascines for filling up Caesar's trenches; and having drawn
                        together sixty cohorts from the greater camp and forts, led them about
                        midnight towards that part of the enemy's lines nearest the sea, a good
                        distance from the main camp. Thither likewise he despatched the barks, on
                        board of which were the light-armed troops and fascines, together wih all
                        the galleys that lay at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, giving each their particular
                        instructions. Lentulus Marcellinus the questor, with the ninth legion, had
                        charge of this part of the fortifications: and as his health was but infirm,
                        Caesar had joined Fulvius Posthumus with him in tilhcommand. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="63" id="b3c63" type="chapter">
					<p>This place was guarded by a ditch, fifteen feet broad, with a rampart towards
                        the enemy, ten feet high, and of equal thickness. Behind this, at the
                        distance of six hundred feet, was another rampart, somewhat lower than the
                        former, and fronting the contrary way. Caesar, apprehending an attack from
                        the sea, had raised this double rampart, some days before, that he might be
                        able to defend himself against the enemy, should they charge him on both
                        sides at once. But the extent of the circumvallation, and the continued
                        labour of so many days, in inclosing a space of eighteen miles, had not
                        allowed us time to finish the work. Accordingly, the line of communication,
                        which ran along the sea-side, and was to have joined these two ramparts, was
                        not yet completed. This Pompey was informed of by the Allobrogian brothers,
                        which proved of fatal consequence to us. For upon guard, near the sea,
                        suddenly the Pompeians arrived about day-break, and surprised them with
                        their unexpected appearance. At the same time the troops that came by sea,
                        launched their darts against the outward rampart and began to fill up the
                        ditch with fascines; while the legionary soldiers, planting their
                        scaling-ladders against the inner works, and plying those that defended them
                        with darts and engines, spread a general terror over that part of the camp,
                        which was still increased by the multitude of archers that came pouring upon
                        them from all sides. The osiers they had bound round their helmets,
                        contributed greatly to defend them from the stones thrown down from the
                        rampart, which were the only weapons we had. At last, all things going
                        against us, and our resistance becoming every moment more languid, the enemy
                        discovered the defect before spoken of in our lines; and landing their men
                        between the two ramparts, where the line of communication towards the sea
                        remained unfinished, they attacked our soldiers in the rear, and obliged
                        them to abandon both sides of the works. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="64" id="b3c64" type="chapter">
					<p>Marcellinus hearing of this disorder, detached some cohorts to sustain the
                        flying troops: but as the rout was become general, they could neither
                        persuade them to rally, nor were able themselves to withstand the enemy's
                        charge. The like happened to a second detachment; insomuch that the several
                        supplies sent, by catching the general terror, served only to add to the
                        confusion and danger; for the multitude of runaways rendered the retreat the
                        more difficult. In this action, the eaglebearer of the ninth legion finding
                        himself dangerously wounded, and that his strength began to fail, called to
                        some troopers who passed by, and said: "I have preserved to the last moment
                        of my life, with the greatest care, this eagle, with which I have been
                        intrusted; and, now I am dying, I return it to Caesar, with the same
                        fidelity. Carry it to him, I beseech you; nor suffer Caesar's arms to
                        experience, in losing it, an ignominy, with which they have been hitherto
                        unacquainted." Thus the eagle was preserved ; but all the centurions of the
                        first cohort were slain, except the first of the Principes. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="65" id="b3c65" type="chapter">
					<p>And now the Pompeians, having made great slaughter of our men, approached the
                        quarters of Marcellinus, to the no small terror of the rest of the cohorts;
                        when Mark Antony, who commanded in the nearer redoubts, upon notice of what
                        passed, was seen descending from the higher ground, at the head of twelve
                        cohorts. His arrival put a stop to the enemy's progress, and by enabling our
                        men to recover from their extreme terror, restored them to their wonted
                        courage. Soon after Caesar arrived in person, with some troops, being
                        apprised of the attack by the smoke of the forts, the usual signal on these
                        occasions; and perceiving the loss he had sustained, and that Pompey had
                        forced the lines, being able to forage, and having an easy communication
                        with the sea; he quitted his former project, which had proved unsuccessful,
                        and encamped as near Pompey as he could. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="66" id="b3c66" type="chapter">
					<p>When the intrenchments were finished, Caesar had notice from his scouts, that
                        a certain number of the enemy's cohorts, which to them appeared a complete
                        legion, were retired behind a wood, and seemed to be on their march to the
                        old camp. The situation of the two armies was this: some days before, when
                        Caesar's ninth legion was sent to oppose a body of Pompey's troops, they
                        thought proper to intrench themselves upon an opposite hill, and form a camp
                        there. This camp bordered upon a wood, and was not above four hundred paces
                        from the sea. But afterwards, for certain reasons, Caesar removed a little
                        beyond that post; and Pompey, a few days after, took possession of it. But
                        as his design was to place several legions there; leaving the inner rampart
                        standing, he surrounded it with greater works. Thus the smaller camp,
                        inclosed within one of larger circumference, served by way of a castle or
                        citadel. He likewise carried an intrenchment from the left angle of the camp
                        to the river, through a space of about four hundred paces, which enabled him
                        to water freely and without danger. But he too, soon after, changed his
                        mind, for reasons which it is not needful to repeat here; and abandoned the
                        place, which thereby was left several days without troops, though the
                        fortifications remained entire.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="67" id="b3c67" type="chapter">
					<p> Hither the scouts reported they saw the standard of a legion carried; which
                        was likewise confirmed by those who were stationed in the higher forts. The
                        place was about five hundred paces distant from Pompey's new camp. Caesar,
                        desirous to repair the loss he had sustained, and hoping he might be able to
                        surprise this legion, left two cohorts in his intrenchments, to prevent any
                        suspicion of his design; and with thirty-three more, amongst which number
                        was the ninth legion, which had lost many centurions and soldiers, marched
                        by a different rout, as privately as he could, against the legion which
                        Pompey had lodged in the lesser camp. Neither was he deceived in his first
                        conjecture: for he arrived before Pompey could have notice of his design;
                        and though the intrenchments were strong, yet charging the enemy briskly
                        with his left wing, where he himself commanded in person, he quickly drove
                        them from the rampart. But as the gates were secured by a barricade, they
                        still maintained the fight here for some time, our men endeavouring to break
                        in, and the enemy to defend the camp. T. Pulcia, who betrayed the army of C.
                        Antony, as we have related above, gave signal proofs of his valour on this
                        occasion. But our men, at last, prevailed; and having cut down the
                        barricade, broke first into the greater camp, and afterwards into the fort
                        within it, whither the legion had retired, some of whom were slain,
                        endeavouring to defend themselves. </p>

				<div2 n="68" id="b3c68" type="chapter">
					<p>But fortune, whose influence is very great, as in other things, so
                        particularly in war; often effects mighty changes from the most trifling
                        causes: as happened upon this occasion. For the cohorts of Caesar's right
                        wing being unacquainted with the situation of the camp, and mistaking the
                        rampart which led to the river for one of its sides, marched on that way in
                        quest of a gate; but perceiving at length their error, and that nobody
                        defend. ed the intrenchment, they immediately mounted the rampart, and were
                        followed by the whole cavalry.</p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="69" id="b3c69" type="chapter">
					<p> This delay saved the enemy: for Pompey, having notice of what passed,
                        brought up the fifth legion to sustain his party; so that at one and the
                        same instant, his cavalry approached ours, and his troops were seen
                        advancing in order of battle, by those who had taken possession of the camp:
                        which quickly changed the face of affairs. For Pompey's legion, encouraged
                        by the hope of speedy succours, sallied by the Decuman port, and briskly
                        charged our cohorts. On the other hand, Caesar's cavalry, who had entered,
                        by a narrow breach in the rampart, foreseeing that a retreat would be
                        extremely difficult, began betimes to think of flying. The right wing which
                        had no communication with the left, oberving the consternation of the
                        cavalry, and fearing they should be overpowered within the camp, retired the
                        same way they had entered. Many,to avoid being engaged in the narrow passes,
                        threw themselves from the rampart, which was ten feet high, into the ditch;
                        where the first ranks being trodden to death, their bodies afforded a safe
                        passage to those that followed. The left wing, who from the rampart whence
                        they had driven the enemy, saw Pompey advancing against them, and their own
                        men flyng; fearing to be entangled in the defiles, as they had the enemy
                        upon them, both within and without the camp, retreated the same way they
                        came. Nothing was to be seen but consternation, flying, and disorder:
                        insomuch that all Caesar's efforts to rally his troops were fruitless. If he
                        seized any by the arm, they struggled till they got away. If he laid hold of
                        the colours, they left them in his hands. Not a man could be prevailed on to
                        face about. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="70" id="b3c70" type="chapter">
					<p>In this calamity, what saved the army from entire destruction was, that
                        Pompey, apprehending an ambuscade (probably because the success was beyond
                        his hopes, as a little before he had seen his men worsted and put to
                        flight), durst not, for some time, approach the intrenchments; and his
                        cavalry were retarded in the pursuit by Caesar's troops, who were possessed
                        of all the gates and defiles. Be that as it will, a small matter proved of
                        very great consequence to both parties: for the intrenchment between the
                        camp and the river, stopped the course of Caesar's victory, when he had
                        already forced Pompey's lines: and the same, by retarding the pursuit of his
                        enemy, saved the army from destruction. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="71" id="b3c71" type="chapter">
					<p>In these two actions, Caesar lost nine hundred and sixty private men, thirty
                        officers, and several knights of note, as Flavius Tuticanus Gallus, a
                        senator's son; C. Felginus, of <placeName key="perseus,Placentia">Placentia</placeName>; A. Gravius, of <placeName key="perseus,Puteoli">Puteoli</placeName>; and M. Sacrativir, of <placeName key="perseus,Capua">Capua</placeName>. But the greatest part of these
                        died without wounds, being trodden to death in the ditch, about the works,
                        and on the banks of the river, occasioned by the flight and terror of their
                        own men. He lost also thirty-two colours. Pompey was saluted emperor on this
                        occasion; a title which he bore ever after, and suffered himself to be
                        accosted by: but neither in the letters which he wrote, nor in his consular
                        ensigns, did he think proper to assume the laurel. The prisoners were
                        delivered up to Labienus at his own request; and this deserter, brutal and
                        cruel as usual, diverted himself with insulting them in their calamity; and
                        asked them sarcastically, if it was usual for veterans to run away; after
                        which, he caused them all to be put to death. </p>

					<p>This success gave such confidence and spirit to the Pompeian party, that they
                        now no longer took any concern about the conduct of the war, but began to
                        consider themselves as already victorious. They never reflected on the
                        inconsiderable number of our troops, the disadvantage of the ground, the
                        narrow passes we were engaged in, by their having first possession of the
                        camp, the double danger, both within and without the fortification, and the
                        separation of the two wings of the army, which hindered them from mutually
                        succouring one another. They forgot that the advantage they had gained, was
                        not the effect of a brisk and vigorous attack; and that our men had suffered
                        more by crowding upon one another in the narrow passes, than by the sword of
                        the enemy. In fine, they never called to mind the uncertain chance of war,
                        and upon what minute causes good or bad success often depends; how a
                        groundless suspicion, a panic terror, or a religious scruple, has frequently
                        been productive ofthe most fatal events; when either by the misconduct of a
                        general, or the terror of a tribune, some false persuasion has been suffered
                        to take root in an army. But as if the victory had been purely the effect of
                        their valour, and no change of fortune was to be apprehended, they every
                        where proclaimed and made public the success of this day. </p>

					<p>Caesar, seeing all his former projects disconcerted, resolved to submit to
                        fortune, and entirely change the manner of the war. He therefore called in
                        all his forces from the forts, gave up the design of inclosing Pompey, and
                        having assembled his army, addressed them as follows: "That they ought not
                        to be discouraged, or give way to consternation, upon what had lately
                        happened, but oppose their many successful engagements to one slight and
                        inconsiderable check. That fortune had already befriended them greatly, in
                        the reduction of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> without bloodshed; in the conquest
                        of the two Spains, though defended by warlike troops, under the conduct of
                        skilful and experienced leaders; and in the subjection of the neighbouring
                        provinces, whence they could be plentifully supplied with corn. In fine,
                        they ought to call to mind, how happily they had passed into <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, through the midst of the enemy's
                        fleets, though possessed of all the coasts and havens. If they were not
                        successful in every thing, they must endeavour, by prudence, to overcome the
                        disappointments of fortune; and attribute their late disaster to the caprice
                        of that goddess rather than to any fault on their side. That he had led them
                        to an advantageous ground, and put them in the possession of the enemy's
                        camp, after driving them from all their works. If either some sudden
                        consternation, the mistaking their way, or any other mishap, had snatched an
                        apparent and almost certain victory out of their hands, they ought to exert
                        their utmost endeavours to repair that disgrace, which would turn their
                        misfortunes to a benefit, as happened at <placeName key="tgn,6002232">Gergovia</placeName>, where those who at first dreaded
                        to encounter the enemy, demanded earnestly in the end to be led to battle."

					<p> Having made this speech, he contented himself with stigmatizing, and
                        reducing to private men, some of the standard bearers; for the whole army
                        were so grieved at their loss, and so desirous of expunging the stain their
                        glory had received, that there was no occasion either for the tribunes or
                        the centurions to remind them of their duty; nay, they even undertook to
                        punish themselves by the severest impositions, and demanded with great
                        outcries to be led against the enemy; being seconded by some centurions of
                        the first rank, I who, touched with their remonstrances, were for continuing
                        in the post they then possessed, and putting all to the hazard of a battle.
                        But Caesar did not think it prudent to expose to an action troops that had
                        been just worsted, and in whom might remain too deep impressions of their
                        late fright. He was for allowing them time to recover themselves; and having
                        quitted his works, thought it needful to provide for the security of his
                        convoys. </p>

					<p>Accordingly, after proper care taken of the sick and wounded, and as soon as
                        night approached, he sent all the baggage privately towards <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>, under a guard of one
                        legion, with orders not to halt till they had reached the place. This affair
                        despatched, he made two legions remain in the camp, and marching out all the
                        rest about three in the morning at several gates, ordered them to follow the
                        same route the baggage had taken. Soon after, that his departure might not
                        have the appearance of a flight, and yet be known to the enemy as late as
                        possible, he ordered the usual signal to be given, and setting out with the
                        rest of his forces, lost sight of the camp in a moment. Pompey hearing of
                        his retreat, prepared to follow him without delay, and hoping to surprise
                        the army in its march, whilst encumbered with baggage, and not yet removed
                        from its consternation, drew out all his troops, and sent out all his
                        cavalry before to retard our rear, which, however, he could not overtake,
                        because Caesar marching without baggage, had got a great way before him. But
                        when we came to the river Genusus, we found the banks so steep and
                        difficult, that before all the men could get over, Pompey's cavalry came up,
                        and fell upon our hindmost battalions. Caesar sent his horse to oppose them,
                        intermixed with some light-armed troops; who charged with that vigour and
                        success, as to put them all to rout, and leave a considerable number dead
                        upon the field, and return without loss to the main body of their army. </p>

					<p>Having completed the intended march of that day, and brought his army over
                        the Genusus, he took up his quarters in his old camp at Asparagium,
                        suffering none of the soldiers to stroll without the rampart, and charging
                        the cavalry, who had been sent out under pretence of foraging, to return
                        immediately to the Decuman port. Pompey likewise having completed that day's
                        march, encamped at his old post at Asparagium, where the troops having
                        nothing to do, because the works were still entire; some made long
                        excursions in quest of wood and forage; others who had come almost without
                        any baggage, by reason the march was undertaken on a sudden, enticed by the
                        nearness of their former camp, laid down their arms in their tents, quitted
                        the intrenchments, and went to fetch what they had left behind them. This
                        rendering them unable to pursue, as Caesar had foreseen; about noon, he gave
                        the signal for decamping, led forth his troops, and doubling that day's
                        march, gained eight miles upon Pompey, who could not follow him by reason
                        his troops were dispersed. </p>

				<div2 n="77" id="b3c77" type="chapter">
					<p>Next day Caesar decamped again at three in the morning, having sent away his
                        baggage over night, that if he should find himself under a necessity of
                        fighting, he might have his army clear of all encumbrance. The same he did
                        the following days; by which means, though he had very difficult ways to
                        pass, and some great rivers to cross, he suffered no loss during the whole
                        march. For Pompey, after the first day's hinderance, endeavouring in vain by
                        long and forced marches to overtake Caesar, gave over the pursuit on the
                        fourth, and began to think of taking other measures. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="78" id="b3c78" type="chapter">
					<p>Caesar was under a necessity of going to <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>, to leave his wounded
                        there, to pay his army, confirm his friends in their duty, and garrison the
                        towns that had submitted. But he took no longer time to these affairs, than
                        the importance of his other engagements would allow. For fearing that Pompey
                        might surprise Domitius Calvinus, he put himself in full march to join him.
                        The scheme he proceeded on was this: that if Pompey took the same route, he
                        must leave the sea, the forces he had at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, with all his ammunition and
                        provision; which would bring them upon equal terms: if he passed into <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, Caesar purposed to join Domitius,
                        and march to its defence by the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7016683">Illyricum</placeName>: in fine, should he fall upon <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName> and Oricum, and endeavour
                        to exclude him from the sea coast; in that case he reckoned to oblige him,
                        by attacking Metellus Scipio, to leave every thing to succour him. Caesar
                        therefore despatched couriers to Domitius, to acquaint him with his design;
                        and leaving four cohorts at <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>, one at <placeName key="tgn,7010760">Lissus</placeName>, and three at Oricum, with the sick
                        and wounded, began his march through <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>. Pompey, on his side, guessing
                        Caesar's design, made what haste he could to join Scipio, that if Caesar
                        should march that way, he might prevent his being overpowered; but should he
                        still keep near <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName>, and the sea, because of the
                        legions and cavalry he expected from <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; in that case, he purposed to fall
                        upon Domitius with all his forces. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="79" id="b3c79" type="chapter">
					<p>For these reasons both generals studied despatch, as well to afford timely
                        succour to their friends, as not to miss an opportunity of distressing their
                        enemies. But Caesar had turned off to <placeName key="perseus,Apollonia">Apollonia</placeName>; whereas Pompey took the
                        nearest way through Candavia for <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>. It happened, too, very days had
                        been encamped near Scipio, quitted that station for the convenience of
                        provisions, and was upon his march to Heraclea Sentica, a city of the
                        Candavians; so that chance seemed to throw him directly in Pompey's way,
                        which Caesar had not then the least knowledge of. Pompey, too, having sent
                        letters through all the states and provinces, relating to the action at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, with representations that far
                        exceeded the truth; a rumour began to prevail, that Caesar had been defeated
                        with the loss of almost all his forces, and was forced to fly before Pompey.
                        These reports raised him many enemies on his march, and induced some states
                        to throw off their allegiance; whence it happened, that the couriers
                        mutually sent by Caesar and Domitius, were all intercepted. But the
                        Allobrogians in the train of Aegus and Roscillus, who, as we have seen
                        before, had deserted from Caesar to Pompey, meeting some of Domitius's
                        scouts; either out of ancient custom, because they had served together in
                        the Gallic wars; or from a motive of vain-glory; informed them of all that
                        had passed; of Pompey's victory, and Caesar's retreat. Advice being given of
                        this to Calvinus, who was not above four hours' march from the enemy, he
                        avoided the danger by a timely retreat, and joined Caesar near Aeginium, a
                        town on the borders of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="80" id="b3c80" type="chapter">
					<p>After the junction of the two armies, Caesar arrived at Gomphi, the first
                        town of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, as you come from <placeName key="tgn,7002705">Epirus</placeName>. A few months before, the
                        inhabitants had of their own accord sent ambassadors to Caesar, to make an
                        offer of what their country afforded, and petition for a garrison. But the
                        report of the action at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, with many groundless
                        additions, had by this time reached their ears. And therefore Androsthenes,
                        pretor of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, choosing rather to be the
                        companion of Pompey's good fortune, than associate with Caesar in his
                        adversity, ordered all the people, whether slaves or free, to assemble in
                        the town; and having shut the gates against Caesar, sent letters to Scipio
                        and Pompey to come to his assistance, intimating, "That the town was strong
                        enough to hold out if they used despatch, but by no means in condition to
                        sustain a long siege." Scipio, on advice of the departure of the armies from
                        Dyrrhacium, was come to Larissa with his legions; and Pompey was yet far
                        enough distant from <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>. Caesar having fortified his
                        camp, ordered mantelets, hurdles, and scaling-ladders to be prepared for a
                        sudden attack; and then exhorting his men, represented, "Of how great
                        consequence it was to render themselves masters of an opulent city,
                        abounding in all things needful for the supply of their walls, and by the
                        terror of whose punishment other states would be awed into submission; and
                        this, he told them, must be done quickly, before any succours could arrive."
                        Accordingly, seizing the opportunity offered by the uncommon ardour of the
                        troops, he attacked the town the same day about three in the afternoon; and
                        having made himself master of it before sun-set, gave it up to be plundered.
                        From Gomphi, Caesar marched directly to Metropolis, and arrived before they
                        were acquainted with the misfortune of their neighbours. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="81" id="b3c81" type="chapter">
					<p>The Metropolitans at first following the example of Gomphi, to which they
                        were moved by the same reports, shut their gates and manned the walls. But
                        no sooner came they to understand the fate of their neighbour city, by some
                        prisoners whom Caesar had produced for that end, than immediately they
                        admitted him into the town. He suffered no hostilities to be committed, nor
                        any harm to be done them; and so powerful was the example from the different
                        treatment of these two cities, that not a single state in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> refused to submit to Caesar, and
                        receive his orders, except Larissa; which was awed by the numerous army of
                        Metellus Scipio. As the country was good and covered with corn, which was
                        near ripe, Caesar took up his quarters there, judging it a proper place to
                        wait for Pompey in, and render the theatre of the war. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="82" id="b3c82" type="chapter">
					<p>A few days after, Pompey arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, and joining Metellus Scipio,
                        harangued both armies. He first thanked his own for their late services, and
                        then turning to Scipio's troops, exhorted them to put in for their share of
                        the booty, which the victory already obtained gave them the fairest prospect
                        of. Both armies being received into one camp, he shared all the honours of
                        command with Scipio, ordered a pavilion to be erected for him, and the
                        trumpets to sound before it. This increase of Pompey's forces, by the
                        conjunction of two mighty armies, raised the confidence of his followers,
                        and their assurance of victory to such a degree, that all delays were
                        considered as a hinderance of their return to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; insomuch that if Pompey on any
                        occasion acted with slowness and circumspection, they failed not to cry out,
                        "That he industriously protracted an affair, for the despatch of which one
                        day was sufficient, in the view of gratifying his ambition for command, and
                        having consular and pretorian senators amongst the number of his servants."
                        Already they began to dispute about rewards and dignities, and fixed upon
                        the persons who were annually to succeed to the consulship. Others sued for
                        the houses and estates of those who had followed Caesar's party. A warm
                        debate arose in council in relation to L. Hirrus, whom Pompey had sent
                        against the Parthians, whether, in the next election of pretors, he should
                        be allowed to stand candidate for that office in his absence; his friends
                        imploring Pompey to make good the promise he had made him at his departure,
                        and not suffer him to be deceived by depending on the general's honour;
                        while such as aspired to this office complained publicly,that a promise
                        should be made to any one candidate, when all were embarked in the same
                        cause, and shared the like dangers.</p>

					<p> Already Domitius, Scipio, and Lentulus Spinther, were openly quarrelling
                        about the high priesthood, which Caesar was in possession of. They even
                        descended to personal abuse, and pleaded their several pretensions; Lentulus
                        urging the respect due to his age; Domitius, his dignity, and the interest
                        he had in the city; and Scipio his alliance with Pompey. Attius Rufus
                        impeached L. Afranius before Pompey, charging him with having occasioned the
                        loss of the army in <placeName key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>. And L. Domitius moved in council,
                        that after the victory, all the senators in Pompey's army and camps, should
                        be appointed judges, and empowered to proceed against those who had stayed
                        in <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, or who had appeared cool, or shown
                        any indifference to the cause; and that three billets should be given to
                        these judges, one for acquittance, another for condemnation, and a third for
                        a pecuniary fine. In a word, nothing was thought on but honours, or profit,
                        or vengeance; nor did they consider by what methods they were to conquer,
                        but what advantage they should make of victory. </p>

					<p>Caesar having provided for the subsistence of his troops, who were now no
                        longer fatigued, and had sufficiently recovered from the consternation the
                        different actions at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName> had thrown them into; thought
                        it high time to make trial how Pompey stood affected to an engagement.
                        Accordingly he drew out his men, and formed them in order of battle; at
                        first near his own camp, and somewhat distant from the enemy: but perceiving
                        this had no effect upon Pompey, who still maintained his post on the
                        eminences, he each daydrew nearer, and by that conduct animated and gave
                        fresh courage to his soldiers. His cavalry being much inferior to the
                        enemy's in number, he followed the method already mentioned; of singling out
                        the strongest and nimblest of his foot-soldiers, and accustoming them to
                        fight intermixed with the horse; in which way of combat they were become
                        very expert by daily practice. This disposition, joined to constant
                        exercise, so emboldened his cavalry, that though but a thousand in number,
                        they would upon occasion sustain the charge of Pompey's seven thousand, even
                        in an open plain, and appear not greatly dismayed at their multitude: nay,
                        they actually got the better in a skirmish that happened between them, and
                        killed Aegus the Allobrogian, one of the two brothers who deserted to
                        Pompey, with several others of his party. </p>

					<p>Pompey, whose camp was on an eminence, drew up his army at the foot of the
                        mountain, expecting, as may be presumed, that Casar would attack him in that
                        advantageous situation. But Caesar despairing to draw Pompey to battle on
                        equal terms, thought it would be his best course to decamp, and be always on
                        the march; in hopes, that by frequent shifting his ground, he might the
                        better be supplied with provisions; and that as the enemy would not fail
                        following him, in the frequent marches he should make, he might perhaps find
                        an opportunity of attacking them, and forcing them to fight: at least he was
                        sure of harassing Pompey's army, little accustomed to these continued
                        fatigues. Accordingly the order for marching was given, and the tents
                        struck; when Caesar perceived that Pompey's army, which had quitted their
                        intrenchments, had advanced farther towards the plain than usual, so that he
                        might engage them at a less disadvantage: whereupon, addressing himself to
                        his soldiers, who were just ready to march out of their trenches: "Let us no
                        longer think," says he, "of marching; now is the time for fighting, so long
                        wished for; let us therefore arm ourselves with courage, and not miss so
                        favourable and opportunity." This said, he immediately drew out his forces.

					<p>Pompey likewise, as was afterwards known, had resolved to offer battle, in
                        compliance with the repeated importunities of his friends. He even said in a
                        council of war, held some days before, that Caesar's army would be defeated
                        before his infantry came to engage. And when some expressed their surprise
                        at this speech: "I know," says he, "that what I promise appears almost
                        incredible; but hear the reasons on which I ground my confidence, that you
                        may advance to battle with the greater assurance. I have persuaded the
                        cavalry, and obtained their promise for the performance, that as soon as the
                        armies are formed, they shall fall upon Caesar's right wing, which they will
                        easily be able to outflank and surround. This must infallibly occasion the
                        immediate rout of that wing, and consequently of the rest of Caesar's
                        troops. without danger or loss on our side. Nor will the execution be
                        attended with any difficulty, as we are so much superior to them in horse.
                        Be ready therefore for battle; and since the so much desired opportunity of
                        fighting is come, take care not to fall short of the good opinion the world

					<p> Labienus spoke next, highly applauding this scheme of Pompey, and expressing
                        the greatest contempt of Caesar's army: "Think not," says he, addressing
                        himself to Pompey, "that these are the legions which conquered <placeName key="tgn,1000070">Gaul</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>. I was present in all those
                        battles, and can, of my own knowledge, affirm, that but a very small part of
                        that army now remains: great numbers have been killed, as must of necessity
                        happen, in such a variety of conflicts: many perished during the autumnal
                        pestilence in <placeName key="tgn,7010380">Apulia</placeName>: many are returned to their own
                        habitations: and not a few were left behind to guard <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. Have you not heard, that the
                        cohorts in garrison, at <placeName key="perseus,Brundusium">Brundusium</placeName>, are made up of invalids
                        ? The forces, which you now behold, are composed of new levies, raised in <placeName key="tgn,7003237">Lombardy</placeName>, and the colonies beyond the Po:

                        all in the two defeats at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>." Having finished this speech,
                        he took an oath, which he proffered to all that were present, never to
                        return to camp otherwise than victorious. Pompey commended his zeal, took
                        the oath himself, and the rest followed his example, without hesitation.
                        After these endeparted, full of joy and expectation; considering themselves
                        as already victorious, and relying, entirely on the ability of their
                        general; who, in an affair of that importance, they were confident would

					<p>When Caesar approached Pompey's camp, he found his army drawn up in this
                        manner: In the left wing were the two legions delivered by Caesar, at the
                        beginning of the quarrel, in consequence of a decree of the senate; one of
                        which was called the first, the other the third legion: and here Pompey
                        commanded in person. Scipio was in the centre, with the legions he had
                        brought out of <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>. The Cilician legion, joined to the
                        Spanish cohorts, brought over by Afranius, formed the right wing. These
                        Pompey esteemed his best troops, distributing the less expert between the
                        wings and the main body. He had in all a hundred and ten cohorts, amounting
                        to five and forty thousand; besides two cohorts of volunteers, who had
                        served under him in former wars; and who, out of affection to their old
                        general, though their legal time was expired, flocked to his standard on
                        this occasion, and were dispersed amongst the whole army. His other seven
                        cohorts were left to guard the camp and the adjoining forts. As the Enipeus,
                        a river with very steep banks, covered his right wing, he placed all his
                        horse, slingers, and archers in the left. </p>

					<p>Caesar observing his ancient custom, placed the tenth legion in the right,
                        and the ninth in the left wing. As this last had been considerably weakened
                        by the general actions at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrhachium</placeName>, he joined the eighth to it in
                        such manner, that they formed as it were but one legion, and had orders
                        mutually to relieve each other. His whole army amounted to fourscore
                        cohorts, making in all twenty-two thousand men; besides two cohorts left to
                        guard the camp. Domitius Calvinus was in the centre, Mark Antony on the
                        left, and P. Sylla on the right. Caesar took his post opposite to Pompey, at
                        the head of the tenth legion. And as he had observed the disposition of the
                        enemy contrived to out-flank his right wing, to obviate that inconvenience,
                        he made a draught of six cohorts from his rear line, formed them into a
                        separate body, and opposed them to Pompey's horse; instructing them in the
                        part they were to act; and admonishing them, that the success of that day
                        would depend chiefly on their courage. At the same time, he charged the
                        whole army, and in particular the third line, not to advance to battle
                        without orders; which, when he saw it proper, he would give, by making the
                        usual signal. </p>

                        witnesses of his earnest endeavours after peace; that he had employed
                        Vatinius to solicit a conference with Labienus, and sent A. Clodius to treat
                        with Scipio; that he had pressed Libo, in the warmest manner, at Oricum, to
                        grant him a safe conduct for his ambassadors; in a word, that he had left
                        nothing unattempted to avoid wasting the blood of his soldiers, and to spare
                        the commonwealth the loss of one of her armies." After this speech,
                        observing his soldiers ardent for the fight, he ordered the trumpets to
                        sound a charge.</p>

					<p> Among the volunteers in Caesar's army was one Crastinus, a man of
                        distinguished courage, who the year before, had been first centurion of the
                        tenth legion. This brave officer, as soon as the signal was given, calling
                        to those next him: "Follow me," said he, "you that were formerly under my
                        command, and acquit yourselves of the duty you owe to your general. This one
                        battle more will crown the work, by restoring him to his proper dignity, and
                        us to the enjoyment of our freedom." At the same time, turning to Caesar:
                        "General," says he, "this day you shall be satisfied with my behaviour, and
                        whether I live or die, I will take care to deserve your commendations." So
                        saying he marched up to the enemy, and began the attack at the head of a

					<p>Between the two armies, there was an interval sufficient for the onset: but
                        Pompey had given his troops orders to keep their ground, that Caesar's army
                        might have all that way to run. This he is said to have done by the advice
                        of C. Triarius, that the enemy's ranks might be broken and themselves put
                        out of breath, by having so far to run; of which disorder he hoped to make
                        an advantage. He was besides of opinion, that our javelins would have less
                        effect, by the troops continuing in their post, than if they sprung forward
                        at the very time they were launched; and as the soldiers would have twice as
                        far to run as usual, they must be weary and breathless by the time they came
                        up with the first line. But herein Pompey seems to have acted without
                        sufficient reason; because there is a certain alacrity and ardour of mind,
                        naturally planted in every man, which is inflamed by the desire of fighting;
                        and which an able general, far from endeavouring to repress, will, by all
                        methods he can devise, foment and cherish. Nor was it a vain institution of
                        our ancestors, that the trumpets should sound on every side, and the whole
                        army raise a shout, in order to animate the courage of their own men, and
                        strike terror into the enemy.</p>

					<p>Caesar's soldiers entirely defeated Pompey's hopes, by their good discipline
                        and experience. For, perceiving the enemy did not stir, they halted, of
                        their own accord, in the midst of their career; and having taken a moment's
                        breath, put themselves, a second time, in motion; marched up in good order,
                        flung their javelins, and then betook themselves to their swords. Nor did
                        Pompey's men act with less presence of mind: for they sustained our attack,
                        kept their ranks, bore the discharge of our darts: and having launched their
                        own, immediately had recourse to their swords. At this instant, Pompey's
                        horse, accompanied by the archers and slingers, attacked Caesar's; and
                        having compelled them to give ground, began to extend themselves to the
                        left, in order to flank the infantry. Whereupon Caesar gave the appointed
                        signal to the six cohorts, who fell on the enemy's horse with such fury,
                        that they not only drove them from the field of battle, but even compelled
                        them to seek refuge in the highest mountains. The archers and slingers,
                        deprived of their protection, were soon after cut to pieces. Meanwhile the
                        six cohorts, not content with this success, wheeled round upon the enemy's
                        left wing, and began to charge it in the rear:</p>

					<p> whereupon Caesar, perceiving the victory so far advanced, to complete it,
                        brought up his third line, which till then had not engaged. Pompey's
                        infantry being thus doubly attacked, in front by fresh troops, and in rear,
                        by the victorious cohorts, could no longer resist, but fled to their camp.
                        Nor was Caesar mistaken in his conjecture, when, in exhorting his men, he
                        declared that victory would depend chiefly on the six cohorts, which formed
                        the body of reserve, and were stationed to oppose the enemy's horse; for by
                        them were their cavalry defeated, their archers and slingers cut to pieces,
                        and their left wing surrounded and forced to fly. </p>
					<p>Pompey seeing his cavalry routed, and that part of the army on which he
                        chiefly depended put into disorder, despaired of being able to restore the
                        battle, and quitted the field. Repairing immediately to his camp, he said
                        aloud, to the centurions, who guarded the pretorian gate, so as all the
                        soldiers might hear him: "Take care of the camp, and defend it vigorously in
                        case of an attack. I go to visit the other gates, and give orders for their
                        defence." This said, he retired to his tent, despairing of success, yet
                        waiting the event.</p>

					<p> Caesar, having forced the Pompeians to seek refuge in their camp, and not
                        willing to allow them time to recover From their consternation, exhorted his
                        troops to make the best of their present victory, and vigorously attack the
                        enemy's intrenchments. Though the battle had lasted till noon, the weather
                        being extremely hot; yet, prepared to encounter all difficulties, they
                        cheerfully complied with his orders.</p>
					<p> The camp was bravely defended, for some time, by the cohorts left to guard

                        who made a very stout resistance; for as to such troops as had there sought
                        refuge from the field of battle, they were in too great a consternation to
                        think of any thing more than a safe retreat. It was not, however, possible
                        for the troops posted on the rampart, long to stand the multitude of darts
                        continually poured upon them ; which, in the end, obliged them to retire
                        covered with wounds, and under the conduct of their tribunes and centurions,

                        highest luxury, and an assured expectation of victory; whence it was easy to
                        see, that they little dreamed of the issue of that day, since, intent only
                        on voluptuous refinements, they pretended, with troops immersed in luxury,
                        to oppose Caesar's army accustomed to fatigue, and inured to the want of

                        ready to obey, he began a line of circumvallation round the mountain. The
                        Pompeians quickly abandoned a post, which, for want of water, was not
                        tenable, and endeavoured to reach the city of Larissa: whereupon Caesar,
                        dividing his army, left one part in Pompey's camp, sent back another to his
                        own camp, and having, with four legions, taken a nearer road than that by
                        which the enemy passed, he found means to intercept them, and, after six
                        miles march, drew up in order of battle. But the Pompeians once more found
                        protection from a mountain, at the foot of which ran a rivulet. Though
                        Caesar's troops were greatly fatigued, by fighting the whole day, before
                        night he had flung up some works, sufficient to prevent the enemy from
                        having any communication with the rivulet. As by this step they were cut off
                        from all hopes of relief, or of escaping, they sent deputies to treat about
                        a surrender. Affairs continued in this situation all that night, of which
                        some few senators, who had accompanied them, took the advantage to make

                        Caesar spoke to them with great mildness, and to alleviate their
                        apprehensions, cited various instances of his clemency, which he had, on so
                        many occasions, made evident. In fact, he gave them their lives, and forbade
                        his soldiers to offer them any violence, or to take any thing from them. He
                        then sent for the legions, which had passed the night in camp, to relieve
                        those that had accompanied, him in the pursuit; and being determined to

					<p>This battle cost Caesar no more than two hundred soldiers: but he lost thirty
                        centurions, men of singular courage. Among these latter was Crastinus, whose

                        the mouth, from a sword. Nor was he deceived in promising himself Caesar's
                        approbation, who was thoroughly sensible of his merit, and greatly applauded
                        his behaviour in this action. On Pompey's side, there fell about fifteen
                        thousand: but upwards of four and twenty thousand were taken prisoners: for
                        the cohorts that guarded the forts, surrendered to Sylla; though many
                        escaped into the adjacent countries. One hundred and eighty colours were
                        taken, and nine eagles. L. Domitius, flying towards the mountains, and
                        growing faint through the fatigue, was overtaken and killed by some

                        Cilician fleets. And as Caesar's fleet was divided into two parts, in one of
                        which P. Sulpicius the pretor commanded at Vibo, in the straits; in the
                        other M. Pomponius at <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>; Cassius was arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName> with his fleet before Pomponius
                        had notice of his coming. And finding him unprepared, without guards, order,
                        or discipline, he took the opportunity of a favourable wind, and sent
                        several fire-ships against him, which consumed his whole fleet, thirty-five
                        in number, twenty of which were decked. The terror occasioned by this blow
                        was so great, that though there was an entire legion in garrison at <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messana</placeName>, they durst scarce look the enemy
                        in the face; and would doubtless have delivered up the town, had not the
                        news of Caesar's victory reached them, by means of the cavalry stationed
                        along the coast. Cassius then sailed for Sulpicius's fleet at Vibol, which
                        finding at anchor near the shore by reason the consternation was become
                        general over the whole island; he put the same stratagem in practice as
                        before. For taking the advantage of a favourable wind, he made forty
                        fire-ships advance against them, and the flame catching hold on both sides,
                        quickly reduced five galleys to ashes. The conflagration continuing to
                        spread, roused the indignation of some veteran soldiers, who had been left
                        to guard the ships. Accordingly they went on board, weighed anchor, and,
                        attacking the enemy, took two quinqueremes, in one of which was Cassius
                        himself; but he escaped in a boat. Two three-benched galleys were sunk; and
                        soon after he was informed of the defeat at Pharsalia, by some of Pompey's
                        own followers; for hitherto he had regarded it as a false report, spread
                        about by Caesar's lieutenants and friends. Upon this intelligence he quitted <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and retired with his fleet. </p>

                        cavalry he had with him could hold out, and was followed, by shorter
                        marches, by a single legion. Pompey had issued a proclamation at <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName>, enjoining all the youth

					<p>Caesar, after a short stay in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, hearing that Pompey had been seen at <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, and thence conjecturing that he
                        was for <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, because of the interest he had in
                        that kingdom, and the advantages it would afford him, left <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodes</placeName>, with a convoy of ten Rhodian
                        galleys, and a few others from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, having on board two legions, one of
                        which he ordered to follow him from <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, the other detached from Fufius's
                        army in <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaia</placeName>; and eight hundred horse. In these
                        legions were no more than three thousand two hundred men: the rest, fatigued
                        with the length of the march, or weakened with wounds, had not been able to
                        follow him. But Caesar depending on the reputation of his former exploits,
                        scrupled not to trust the safety of his person to a feeble escort,
                        believingno place would dare to attempt any thing against him. At <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName> he was informed of
                        Pompey's death: and upon landing, was accosted in a clamorous manner by the
                        soldiers, whom Ptolemy had left to garrison the city: and he observed that
                        the mob appeared dissatisfied to see the fasces carried before him, which
                        they interpreted a degradation of the sovereign authority. Though this
                        tumult was appeased, yet each day produced some fresh disturbance, and many
                        of the Roman soldiers were murdered in all parts of the city. </p>

					<p>For these reasons he sent into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> for some of the legions which he had
                        raised out of the remains of Pompey's army: being himself necessarily
                        detained by the Etesian winds, which are directly contrary to any passage by

                        the difference between Ptolemy and his sister, as subject to the cognizance

                        alliance with Ptolemy, the father, had been contracted during his former
                        consulship; he gave the king and Cleopatra to understand, that it was his
                        pleasure they should dismiss their troops, and instead of having recourse to
                        arms, come and plead their cause before him. </p>

					<p>Pothinus the eunuch, governor to the young king, had the chief management of
                        affairs during his minority. This minister complained bitterly to his
                        friends, that the king should be summoned to plead his cause before Caesar:
                        afterwards finding among those that sided with the king, some who were
                        disposed to enter into his views, he privately sent for the army from <placeName key="tgn,6004608">Pelusium</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, and conferred the chief
                        command upon Achillas, the same we have spoken of before: inciting him by
                        letters and promises, both in the king's name and his own to execute such
                        orders as he should receive from him. Ptolemy, the father, by his will had
                        appointed the eldest of the two sons, and his elder daughter, joint heirs of
                        the kingdom. For the more certain accomplishment of his design, he in the
                        same will implored the protection of the Roman people; adjuring them by all
                        the gods, and the treaties he had made at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to see it put in execution. A copy
                        of this will was sent by ambassadors to <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, to be deposited in the public
                        treasury; but the domestic troubles preventing it, it was left in the hands
                        of Pompey. The original, signed and sealed, was kept at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>. </p>

					<p>While this affair was debated before Caesar, who passionately desired to
                        terminate the matter amicably, and to the satisfaction of both parties, he
                        was informed that the king's army, with all the cavalry, were arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>. Caesar's forces were by
                        no means sufficient to give them battle without the town; and therefore the
                        only course left was to secure the most convenient posts within the city,
                        till he should get accquainted with Achillas's designs. Meantime he ordered
                        all the soldiers to their arms, and admonished the king, to send some
                        persons of the greatest authority to Achillas, to forbid his approach.
                        Discorides and Serapion, who had both been ambassadors at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, and in great credit with Ptolemy,
                        the father, were deputed to this office. But no sooner did they come before
                        Achillas, than without giving them a hearing, or enquiring after the message
                        they brought, he ordered them to be seized and put to death. One was killed
                        upon the spot; and the other, having received a dangerous wound, was carried
                        off for dead by his attendants. Upon hearing this, Caesar took care to
                        secure the king's person, the authority of whose name would authorise his
                        proceedings, and occasion Achillas and his associates to be esteemed
                        seditious and rebellious. </p>

					<p>Achillas's army was far from being contemptible, whether we regard their
                        number, courage, or experience in war. It amounted to twenty thousand
                        effective men, many of whom were originally Romans, brought into the country
                        by Gabinius, when he came to settle Auletes on the throne; and who, having
                        afterwards married and settled in <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, were devoted to the
                        Ptolemean interest. There were also some brigades raised in <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>, together with a considerable
                        number of renegade slaves, who had deserted their masters, and found
                        protection in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, by entering into the service. If
                        any of these was seized by his master, their companions flocked to his
                        rescue, regarding his safety as a common cause, because they were all
                        embarked in the like guilt. These would often take upon them to put to death
                        the king's ministers, to plunder the rich, for the sake of increasing their
                        pay, to invest the royal palace, to banish some, and send for others home,
                        with other liberties of the like nature, which the Alexandrian army claims
                        by a kind of prescription. Besides these, he had likewise two thousand
                        horse, who, during the late troubles, and the wars that ensued, had arms.
                        These had restored Ptolemy the father to his kingdom, killed Bibulus's two
                        sons, warred against the Egytians with success, and acquired a thorough
                        experience in military affairs. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="111" id="b3c111" type="chapter">
					<p>Achillas trusting to the valour of his troops, and despising the handful of
                        men that followed Caesar, quickly made himself master of <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, the palace only
                        excepted, where Caesar thought proper to make his stand, and which he
                        attacked briskly, though without effect. But it was on the side of the
                        harbour that the greatest efforts were made. On that, in effect, the victory
                        depended. Besides two and twenty constant guard-ships, there were in the
                        port fifty galleys, from three to five banks of oars, which the year before
                        'had been sent to Pompey's assistance, and were returned since the battle of
                        Pharsalia. Had Achillas been once master of these vessels, he might have cut
                        Caesar off from all communication with the ocean, and consequently from all
                        hopes of receiving supplies of victuals or forces. Thus the Egyptians, in
                        hopes of a complete victory, and the Romans to avoid a certain ruin, exerted
                        themselves with incredible vigour. At length Caesar carried his point, and
                        not only set fire to the vessels abovementioned, but to all that were in the
                        arsenals, after which he passed some troops into the Isle of Pharos. </p>
				</div2>
				<div2 n="112" id="b3c112" type="chapter">
					<p>The Pharos is a tower of prodigious height and wonderful workmanship, built
                        in an island, from whence it takes its name. This island, lying over against <placeName key="perseus,Alexandria">Alexandria</placeName>, makes a haven, and is
                        joined to the continent by a causeway of nine hundred paces, and by a
                        bridge. Here dwell several Egyptians, who have built a town, and live by
                        pillaging the ships that are thrown upon their coast, either by mistake or
                        tempest. As it is situate at the entrance of the port, which is but narrow,
                        it absolutely commands it. Caesar knowing the importance of this post,
                        whilst the enemywere engaged in the assault, landed some troops there,
                        seized the tower, and put a garrison into it; thereby securing a safe
                        reception for the supplies he had sent for on allsides. In the other
                        quarters of the town, the fight was maintained with equal advantage, neither
                        party losing ground, because of the narrowness of the passes, which enabled
                        them easily to support themselves. After a few men killed on necessary
                        places, fortified them in the night. In this quarter was a small part of the
                        king's palace, where Caesar was lodged upon his first arrival; and adjoining
                        thereto a theatre, that served instead of a citadel, and had a communication
                        with the port and other arsenals. These works he increased afterwards, that
                        they might serve instead of a rampart, to prevent his being obliged to fight
                        against his will. Meantime Ptolemy's youngest daughter, hoping the throne
                        would be vacant, fled from palace to Achillas, and joined with him in the
                        prosecution of the war. But they soon disagreed about the command, which
                        increased the largesses to the soldiers, each party endeavouring to gain
                        them by large presents. During these transactions, Pothinus, Ptolemy's
                        governor, and regent of the kingdom, being discovered in a clandestine
                        correspondence with Achillas, whom he encouraged to the vigorous prosecution
                        of his enterprise, Caesar ordered him to be put to death. Such was the
                        beginning of the Alexandrian war. </p>
