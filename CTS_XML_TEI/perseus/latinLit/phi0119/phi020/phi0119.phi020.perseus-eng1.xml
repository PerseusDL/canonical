<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>

<p>PHRONESIUM, a Courtesan, has three admirers-Dinarchus, a dissipated young Athenian; Strabax, a young man from the country; and Stratophanes, an officer in the Babylonian army. To impose upon the last, she palms off a child upon him, pretending that it is hers, and that he is the father of it. In the first part of the Play, Dinarchus returns from abroad, and is admitted by the servant Astaphium into the house of Phronesium. After this, Astaphium goes to the house where Strabax lives, to invite him to visit Phronesium, but is roughly repulsed by Stratilax, his servant. Dinarchus quits the house of Phronesium, not having been allowed to see her, on the excuse that she is at the bath. Phronesium at length comes out, and, in their conversation, tells Dinarchus that she is pretending to have been pregnant by the Captain Stratophanes, and has procured a child to pass off as his. She also begs Dinarchus to make her a present, which he promises to do, and then takes his leave. She then gets everything in readiness to look as though she had just lain in. The Captain arrives from abroad, and produces his presents; but as ready money does not form a part of them, Phronesium expresses extreme dissatisfaction and contempt. At this moment <placeName key="tgn,1031281">Geta</placeName>, the servant of Dinarchus, come's with his present, in money and provisions. A quarrel ensues between the Captain and Geta, who at last takes to his heels, on which Phronesium goes into her house. Strabax then arrives from the country with some ready money, and is admitted to visit Phronesium. Stratilax comes to look for him, and after some parley falls a prey to the allurements of Astaphium. Dinarchus then arrives, but, despite of his recent generosity, suffers a repulse. Before he quits the stage, Callicles, an old gentleman, comes with two female-servants, whom he examines as to what they have done with a female child that his daughter has been recently delivered of. They confess that they have carried it to Phronesium to be passed off as her own, and that Dinarchus is really the father of it. Dinarchus, in great alarm, overhears this conversation, and then accosts Callicles, and, confessing his fault, offers to marry his daughter forthwith. His offer is accepted; on which he revisits Phronesium, to request her to restore to him the child. She, however, prevails upon him to lend it to her for a few days, that she may fully carry out her design of imposing upon the Captain. After this, Stratophanes appears again, and brings fresh presents. He then has a quarrel with Strabax, and the Play ends by Phronesium promising to divide her favours between them both. The text of this Play is in a most corrupt state.

<head>THE PROLOGUE.</head>
<sp><speaker>PROLOGUS</speaker><p>A VERY small portion of room does Plautus ask from out of your vast and pleasant city within the walls, whither, without builders, he may transport <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. What then? Will you give it or not? They nod assent. I fancied, indeed, that I should obtain it of you without hesitation. What if I were to ask something of your private means? They shake their heads. Only see, i' faith, how the ancient habit still indwells among you, to keep your tongues ever ready for a denial. But let's to the point, on account of which I came hither. Let this be <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, just as this is our stage, only for the while that we perform this Play. Here <stage>pointing to her house</stage> dwells a female whose name is Phronesium; she has in herself the manners of the present age; she never asks of her lover that which has been given; but what is left, she does her best that it mayn't be left, by begging for it and carrying it off, as is the habit of the women; for all of them do this when they discover that they are loved. She is pretending to a Captain that she has been brought to bed, that the more speedily she may sweep away his property from him every atom. Why say more? If the life of this woman should only last, he will be sweeping off his substance with his very life into her hands. * * * * * * * * * *

<stage>Enter DINARCHUS.</stage>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage> Not a whole life is sufficient for a lover thoroughly to learn, until he has become full well aware of this, in how many modes he may come to ruin; nor does Venus herself, in whose hands lie the sum and substance of lovers, ever instruct us in that art of reckoning--in how many ways one in love may be deluded, in how many modes he may come to ruin, and with how many modes of entreaty he may be entreated. How many blandishments are there in it, how many pettish ways in it, how many perils must be courted! Ye Gods! by our trust in you! Hey! what ground for perjury as well, besides the everlasting presents! In the first place then, there's the yearly allowance; that's her first haul<milestone n="31" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Her first haul</lemma>:  "Bolus." This is a metaphorical expression alluding to the casting of the net in fishing.</note>. For that the favour of three nights is granted. In the meantime she's trying for either money, or wine, or oil, or corn, to prove whether you are lavish or thrifty. Just like the person that throws a casting-net into a fish-pond; when the net has gone and sunk, then he contracts the folds; but if he has rightly thrown it, he takes care that the fish may not escape; then in this direction and that does he enfold the fish netted well, until he has taken them out of the water: just so is the lover. If he gives that which is asked for, and is lavish rather than thrifty, nightly favours are given in addition. Meanwhile he swallows down the hook. If once he has partaken of the cup of love unmixed, and that draught has made its way within his breast, forthwith both himself is ruined, and his fortune, and his credit. If the mistress is angry with her lover perchance, doubly is the lover ruined, both in fortune and in mind; but if one man is preferable to another in her eyes, just as much is he ruined; if he enjoys but few of her favours, in mind is he ruined; if he enjoys them in abundance, he himself is joyous, his fortunes are ruined. * * * Thus is it in the houses kept by procurers; before you've given a single thing, she's preparing a hundred to ask for; either a golden trinket's lost, or a mantle has been torn, or a female servant bought; or some silver vessel, or some vessel of brass, or expensive couch, or a Grecian cabinet, or there's always something to be lost and for the lover to be replacing for his mistress. And with one common earnestness do we conceal these losses while we are losing our fortunes, and our credit, and ourselves, lest our parents or our relatives should know something; whom, while we conceal it from them, if we were to make acquainted with it, for them in time to restrain our youthful age, we should be giving what has been received from them before to our descendants in reversion; I'd be for causing, that as there are now more procurers and harlots, there should be fewer and fewer of spendthrift fellows than there are at present; for now-a-days there are almost more procurers and harlots than flies at the time when it is most hot. For, if they are nowhere else, the procurers with their harlots are around the bankers' shops each day as though on siege. That score is the principal one; inasmuch as I know for certain, that now-a-days there are more harlots ready for the money than there are weights for weighing it. And I really don't know what purpose to say it is to serve that these procurers are thus keeping them at the bankers' shops, except as in the place of account-books, where the sums lent on loan may be set down--the sums received I mean, those expended let no one take count of. In fine, in a great nation, amid numberless persons, the state being tranquil and in quiet, the enemy vanquished, it befits all to be in love who have anything to give. Now, this Courtesan <stage>pointing to the house</stage> Phronesium, who dwells here, has totally expelled from my breast her own name. Phronesium, for Phronesis is wisdom<milestone n="81" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Phronesis is wisdom</lemma>:  He alludes to the resemblance of the name of Phronesium to the Greek word <foreign lang="greek">fronhdi\s,</foreign> "prudence," or "forethought." This line, however, is thought by some to be spurious, and to be a mere gloss or explanation.</note>. For I confess that I was with her first and foremost; a thing that's very disastrous to a lover's cash. The same woman, after she had found another out, a greater spendthrift, who would give more, a Babylonian Captain<milestone n="87" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Babylonian Captain</lemma>:  He does not mean an officer, a native of <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, but probably a Greek, serving for pav in the Babylonian army. Thus Xenophon and the Ten Thousand were Greeks in the pay of the Younger Cyrus.</note>, whom the hussy said was troublesome and odious to her, forthwith banished me from the spot. He now is said to be about to arrive from abroad. For that reason has she now cooked up this device; she pretends that she has been brought to bed. That she may push me out of doors, and with the Captain alone live the life of a jovial Greek, she pretends that this Captain is the father of the child; for that reason does this most vile hussy need a palmed-off child. She fancies that she's deceiving me! Does she suppose that she could have concealed it from me, if she had been pregnant? Now I arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> the day before yesterday from <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, whither I have been on an embassy from this place on the public service. But who's this woman? It's her servant-maid Astaphium. With her too as well I've had some acquaintanceship. <stage>Stands aside.</stage></p></sp></div1>

'Give me back my property!' full oft do the plundered damsels cry; 'give me back my property!' the whole Forum resounding with their cries."</note>.

Upon my faith, this is the case, and some of the Spectators <stage>to the AUDIENCE</stage>, i' faith, you know full well that I tell no lie in this. There with them is the struggle and the valour, to carry oft a booty from the plunderers.

<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> But, pray, tell me, Astaphium who is this person? A new lover?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> I think that you are a gentleman too much at his ease.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Why now do you think so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Because you trouble yourself about things that don't concern your own clothing and food.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> It's yourselves have made me a gentleman at ease.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Why so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> I'll explain it to you. I've lost my property; with my property you've robbed me of occupation. If I had preserved my property, there had been something with which I might have been occupied.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> And do you suppose that you can possibly well manage the affairs of state, or those of love, on any other terms without being a gentleman at ease?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> It was she held a public employment, not I; you misinterpret me. But, against the law, in spite of my tax paid for pasturage<milestone n="146" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Tax paid for pasturage</lemma>:  "Scripturam." This passage is somewhat difficult to be understood. Dinarchus seems to say that he is reduced to idleness from having squandered his property upon Phronesium, and retorts upon Astaphium, by saying that he himself has no public office, but that Phronesium is a publican, alluding to her calling as a public courtesan; and he then proceeds to accuse her of letting the public pasture, for which he had paid the rent or tax ("scripturam"), to another. Part of the Roman revenue arose from the letting of the uncultivated lands, through the medium of "publicani," or "farmers of the public revenue," who used to sublet them to private persons. He therefore means to say, that Phronesium has undertaken the duties of a publican, but has failed in duly performing them. It is possible that a pun may be intended on the word "scriptura," which also signifies a "writing" or "deed," and may allude to some preceding compact which had been made between Phronesium and himself.</note>, she has received other cattle beside myself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Most persons who manage their property badly, do the same as you are doing; when they haven't wherewith to pay the tax, they blame the farmers of the taxes.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> My pasturage contract with you turns out but badly; now in its turn, I wish to have, according to my narrow circumstances, a little bit of arable land here with you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Here is no arable, but the field is pasture land. If you desire some ploughing, you had better go to those<milestone n="152" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Go to those</lemma>:  The whole of this passage has been somewhat modified in the translation, as the meaning of Astaphium is gross in the extreme, and so much to the discredit of Dinarchus, that any compassion for the ill-treatment he afterwards experiences would be quite thrown away upon him.</note> who are in the habit of ploughing; we hold this public emolument, the right of pasturage; those are farmers of other taxes.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Full well enough do I know both sides.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> I' troth, it's that way you are a gentleman at ease, since you've been going wrong both in that direction and in this. But the acquaintance of which do you like the best?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> You are the more exacting, but they are perjured. Whatever's given to them is lost outright, nor with themselves is there any show at all of it; you, if you gain anything, do at least drink and feast it away. In short, they are unprincipled; you are good-for-nothings, and full of airs.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> All this abuse which, Dinarchus, you are uttering against us and them, you utter against yourself, both as respects us and them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> How's that? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> I'll tell the reason; because he who accuses another of dishonesty, him it behoves to look into himself. You who are so prudent, have got nothing from us; we, who are good-for-nothings, have got all out of you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> O Astaphium! you were not in the habit of speaking to me in that fashion formerly, but courteously, when I myself possessed that which is now in your possession.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> While he's alive, you may know a person; when he's dead, you may keep yourself quiet. I used to know you when you were alive.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Do you consider me to be dead?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Prithee, how can it be plainer? He who formerly was esteemed a first-rate lover, for him to be bringing to his mistress nought but lamentations<milestone n="169" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Nought but lamentations</lemma>:  "Meras querimonias" Literally, "mere complaints."</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> I' faith, through your own faults it was done, who in former days were in haste to plunder me. You ought to have done it leisurely, that, unscathed, I might last the longer for you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> A lover is like an enemy's fortress.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> On what ground? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> The sooner the lover can be taken by storm, the better it is for the mistress.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> I confess it; but far different is the friend from the lover. I' faith, for sure, the oldest friend's the best one possible for a man. I' faith, my lands and tenements are not yet all gone.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Why then, prithee, are you standing before the door as a stranger and an alien? Do go in-doors. Really you are no stranger; for, upon my faith, not one person this day does she more love in her heart and soul--<stage>aside</stage> if, indeed, you've got land and tenements.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Your tongues and talk are steeped in honey; your doings and dispositions are steeped in gall and sour vinegar. From your tongues you utter sweet words; you make your lovers of bitter heart if any don't give you presents.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> I've not learnt to say what's false.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> It was not this liberality of mine that taught you to say what's false, but those niggardly fellows who are struggling against their appetites. You are a sly one, and the same artful coaxer that you used to be.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> How ardently longed for have you returned from abroad! But, prithee, do come, my mistress wants to see you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> How so, pray?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> You alone of all mankind does she love.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Well done, lands and tenements; you have come to my aid in good time. <stage>To ASTAPHIUM.</stage> But how say you, Astaphium----?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> What do you want?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Is Phronesium in-doors just now?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> To you at all events she's in-doors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Is she well?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Aye, faith, and I do believe she'll be still better when she sees you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> This is our greatest fault: when we're in love, then we are undone; if that which we wish is told us, when manifestly they are telling lies, in our folly we believe it to be true; verily as though with a tide we fluctuate.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Heyday now--such is not the fact.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Do you say that she loves me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Aye, you only, alone.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> I heard that she was brought to bed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Oh, prithee, Dinarchus, do hold your tongue.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DIN,</speaker><p> Why so?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> I shudder in my alarm, as often as mention is made of childbirth, with such difficulty has Phronesium survived for you. Prithee, do come in-doors now; do go to see her and wait there a little. She'll be out just now; for she was at the bath.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> What do you say? She who was never pregnant, how could she be brought to bed? For really, I never, that I am aware of, perceived her to be in a breeding state.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> She concealed it from you and was afraid, lest you should persuade her to have recourse to abortion<milestone n="203" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Recourse to abortion</lemma>:  The practice of procuring abortion was not deemed criminal either at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> or <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; though at the latter place there was a law which imposed a penalty on any person who administered a potion to a woman for that purpose.</note>, and so destroy the child.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Troth then, who's the father of this child?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> A Babylonian Captain, whose arrival she is now expecting. So much so, indeed, that, according as was reported, they say that he'll be here just now. I wonder he has not arrived by this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Shall I go in, then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Why not? As boldly as at home, into your own house; for even still are you now one of us, Dinarchus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> How soon are you on your return?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> I'll be there this instant; it's close at hand where I was going.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> But do return directly; meanwhile I'll wait for you at your house. <stage>He goes into the house of PHRONESIUM.</stage>

<stage>ASTAPHIUM, alone.</stage>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> <stage>laughing</stage>. Ha, ha, ha! I'm at rest, since my plague has gone in-doors; now, indeed, I shall speak according to my own inclination, freely, as I please. My mistress has sung a funeral dirge<milestone n="213" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A funeral dirge</lemma>:  "N&aelig;nia" was a funeral song among the Romans, recited or chanted by hired female mourners, called "pr&aelig;fic&aelig;."</note>at our house for this fellow, her lover, over his estate; for his lands and tenements are mortgaged for his treats in his amour. But with him does my mistress speak freely upon the objects of her plans, and so he is rather a friend by way of counsel to her than by way of maintenance. While he had it, he gave; now he has got nothing; what he did have, we have got; what we had, he has now got the same. The common course of things has happened. For. tunes are wont to change upon the instant. Life is checquered. We remember him as rich, and he us as poor; our reminiscences have shifted places. He must be a fool to wonder at it. If he is in want, it's necessary that he should allow us to make a living; that's proper to be done. 'Twere a disgrace for us to have compassion on men that squander away their fortunes. A clever Procuress ought to have good teeth; to smile upon whoever comes, to address him in flattering terms; to design mischief in her heart, but to speak fairly with her tongue. A Courtesan it befits to be like a briar; whatever man she touches, for either mischief or loss certainly to be the result. A Courtesan ought never to listen to the plea of a lover, but, when he has nothing to give, do you pack him off home from service as a deserter<milestone n="229" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">As a deserter</lemma>:  "Infrequente," a soldier "negligent of his duty"--"a deserter." She alludes to a custom among the Romans of dismissing bad soldiers from the service; sometimes, however, they merely secluded them from the other soldiers or as we say "sent them to <placeName key="tgn,7011012">Coventry</placeName>."</note>; and never is any gallant good for anything unless he's one who is the enemy of his own fortune. It's trifling, if, when he has just given, he doesn't take a pleasure in giving afresh. That person's esteemed with us who forgets that that has been given which he has given. As long as he has anything, so long let him go on loving; when he has got nothing, then let him look out another employment; if he himself has got nothing, let him, with a contented mind, make way for others who have. He's a proper lover who, neglecting his affairs, squanders away his property. But among themselves the men declare that we act ill, and are greedy. Prithee, do we in fact at all act ill? For, by my troth, never did any lover whatever give enough to his mistress; nor, i' faith, have we ever received enough, nor has any woman ever asked for enough. For when a gallant is barren with his gifts * * * * * If he denies that he has anything to give, alone * * * * * Nor do we receive enough, when a person has not enough to give us. It is ever our duty to look after fresh givers, who take from untouched treasures, and make presents to us. Just like this young man from the country, who dwells here <stage>pointing to the house where STRABAX lives</stage>, i' faith, a very pleasant creature, and a very bounteous giver. But he, without the knowledge of his father, even this very last night, leapt over the wall by way of the garden, and came to our house. I wish to meet with him. But one servant has he, a very great savage, who, when he sees any one of us near the door, if you approach that way, drives us off just as he scares the geese away with his noise from the corn; he's such a bumpkin. But come what may, I'll knock at the door. <stage>Knocks at the door, and calls.</stage> Who, I wonder, has the keeping of this door? Is anybody coming out from in-doors?</p></sp></div1>

But from the fact of his being introduced as a perfect specimen of a rude clown, there can be little doubt that on the stage he speaks the Latin language with the burr or patois of a countryman. In the translation, an attempt has been made to denote this probable peculiarity of speech, by making him to substitute "thee "for "thou," before verbs in the second person singular. Warner, in his version, represents him throughout as speaking in a sort of <placeName key="tgn,7012032">Somersetshire</placeName> dialect.</note>, that's so sturdily plying his batteringram against our door?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> Why, what is it? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> In the first place, that you've been blessed with children, and that you've safely got over it, I'm delighted.</p></sp>

Go you away from there into the house, and shut the door. <stage>They go in, and shut the door.</stage> You now alone are left to be present at my communication; to you I've ever entrusted my designs. For my own part, I've neither had any child nor have I been pregnant; but I've pretended that I was pregnant; I wasn't though.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> For what reason, O my life?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> On account of a Babylonian Captain, who kept me as though his wife for a year, while he was here.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> That I knew. But what means this? For what purpose was your design in pretending this?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> That there might be a certain bond and tie<milestone n="393" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">And tie</lemma>:  "Redimiculum." The "redimicula" were, properly strings or ribbons which fell on the shoulders from the "mitra" or headdress of females, and were probably used for the purpose of tying it under the chin.

If I should raise and bring up the child which I should bear, that then I should have all his property.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> I listen with pleasure. In fine, what is it you are contriving?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> My mother ordered the servant-maids, since now the tenth month is arriving close at hand, each to go in some different direction, to seek out and bespeak a boy or a girl, to be passed off as my own.

<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p>I know her. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> She, with the utmost care, went about among the families, and secretly found out a child, and brought it to me. She said it was given to her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> O shocking traffic! She then hasn't borne this child who at first did bear it, but you who come afterwards.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> You have the whole matter in its order. Now, as the Captain has sent a message before to me, he'll be here no long time hence.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Now, in the mean time, you are treating yourself here as though one who had just lain in?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> Why not, when, without trouble, the matter can be nicely managed? It's proper that every one should be alive at his own trade.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> What's to become of me when the Captain comes? Forsaken, can I live without you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> When I've got from him that which I want, I shall easily find a way how to create discord and a separation between us; after that, my delight, I shall be always at your side.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> I think you ought. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> Can't you venture to give me some trifling present?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Upon my faith, my delight, I seem to be making a gain for myself when you ask anything of me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. And I, when I've got it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> I'll take care it shall be here just now. I'll send my servant hither. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> Do so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> But whatever it shall be, do take it in good part.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> I troth, I'm sure that you'll give all attention to your present, of which I shan't be ashamed so long as you send it to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Do you wish anything else of me? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> That, when you have leisure, you'll come again to see me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Fare you well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> Farewell. <stage>Goes into her house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. O immortal Gods! 'twere the part not of a woman in love, but of a partner of kindred feelings and confiding, to do what she just now has done for me, in disclosing to me the palming of the child upon the Captain,--a thing that a sister entrusts not to her own born sister. She discloses herself now to me from her very soul, that she will never prove faithless to me so long as she exists. Ought I not to love her? Ought I not to wish her well? I'll rather not love myself, than that love should be wanting for her. Shall I not send her a present? This instant, then, I'll order five min&aelig; to be brought to her from my house, besides catering to the amount of a mina at least. Much rather shall kindness be shown to her who wishes kindly to me, than to myself, who do every mischief to myself. <stage>(Exit.)</stage>

I'm now speaking of what, but lately, for the first time, I've been taught at home; how great is my anxiety of mind, what pangs I do feel in my heart, lest through the death of the child the plot should fail. Because I'm styled its mother, for that reason am I the more anxious for its life, who have ventured thus secretly to attempt a stratagem so great.

How very few are tired who have commenced to do what's wrong; how very few carry it out, if they have commenced to do anything aright. To a female it is a much less burden to do bad than good.

<sp><speaker>STRATOPHANES</speaker><p> <stage>to the AUDIENCE</stage>. Don't you be expecting, Spectators, that I should recount my combats; with my hands in battle I'm wont to recount them, and not in words. I know that many a soldier have told lies; both the Homeric poetlings<milestone n="483" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Homeric poetlings</lemma>:  By.

<sp><speaker>STRATOPHANES</speaker><p> Is it like me at all?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Do you ask the question? Why, the moment it was born, it asked for a sabre and shield for itself.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Why really, it was only born five days ago.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRATOPHANES</speaker><p> What then, after it was born? After so many days, i' faith, something really ought by this time to have been done. What business had it to leave the womb before it could go forth to battle?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Follow me, and wish her joy, and congratulate her.</p></sp>

If it is not, her meaning seems to be, that the Captain didn't care much about his child, but took care about its support for a very short period, and no longer. Perhaps, as "jentaculum" meant "an early meal, taken before daylight," she may intend to hint that the Captain, on hearing of her pregnancy, interested himself in her offspring, and contributed to her support and that of the child in the embryo state; but that after it came to light, and required a meal (to speak figuratively), beyond the period of the "jentaculum," he took no notice of it, but was ready to allow it to starve.</note>.

<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> <stage>to his SERVANT</stage>. Do I use ill language to you, or do I wish you so very ill? According to my ideas, you have both pretty well experienced how mild and gentle a person I am. I interrogated you both, as you were lashed and hanging up by the arms; I well remember it; the way in which you quite confessed each point, I know. Here now, I wish in the same way to learn; do you confess without a punishment. Although you are both of you of the serpent nature, I tell you beforehand, you mustn't be having double tongues, lest with your two tongues I should be putting you to death; unless, perhaps, you wish to be taken to the men who go clink, clink<milestone n="778" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Men who go clink, clink</lemma>:  " Tintinnaculos." The executioners or torturers are so called, either from their putting fetters on the persons to be punished, or else from their fastening bells (tintinnabula) upon them, to prevent their running away.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A MAID-SERVANT of Callicles.</speaker><p> Violence forces me to confess the truth; the thongs do so gall my arms. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> But, if you confess the truth to me, you shall be relieved from the chains.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Even now, what's the matter, I'm at a loss to know and uncertain; except that still I'm afraid.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRA</speaker><p> What I've done wrong I know not.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> First of all, then, you stand apart. <stage>They stand apart.</stage> Aye, so; that's what I mean; that you mayn't be making signs between you, I'll be a party-wall. <stage>To his MAID-SERVANT.</stage> Speak you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A MAID-SERVANT of Callicles.</speaker><p> What am I to speak about?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> What was done with the child that my daughter was delivered of? My grandchild, I mean? Tell me the circumstances of the case.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A MAID-SERVANT of Callicles.</speaker><p> I gave it to her. <stage>Pointing to SYRA.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> <stage>to the MAID-SERVANT</stage>. Now hold your tongue. <stage>To SYRA.</stage> Did you receive the child from her?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRA</speaker><p> I did receive it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> <stage>to SYRA</stage>. Hold your tongue; I want no more; you've confessed enough.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRA</speaker><p> I'm not going to deny it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> By this you've now caused some relief for your shoulder-blades. So far, the account of each of them tallies.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Ah wretched me! my doings are now being disclosed, which I hoped would be concealed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> <stage>to the MAID-SERVANT</stage>. Speak, you. Who bade you give the child to her?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A MAID-SERVANT of Callicles.</speaker><p> My elder mistress. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> <stage>to SYRA.</stage>. What say you? Why did you receive it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRA</speaker><p> My young mistress entreated me that the child might be brought, and that all this might remain secret.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> <stage>to SYRA</stage>. Speak, you. What did you do with this child? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRA</speaker><p> I took it to my mistress.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> What did your mistress do with this child?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRA</speaker><p> Gave it at once to my mistress.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> Plague on it, to what mistress?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A MAID-SERVANT of Callicles.</speaker><p> There are two of them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> <stage>to the MAID</stage>. Take you care, unless I ask you anything, only to answer that which I ask of you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRA</speaker><p> The mother, I say, made a present of it to the daughter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> You are saying more than you did just now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRA</speaker><p> You are asking more.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> Answer me quickly; what did she do, to whom it was given? Tell me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRA</speaker><p> She passed it off as---- </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> Whose?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYRA</speaker><p> As her own son. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> As her own son? Ye Gods, by my trust in you I do appeal to you, how much more easily does another than she to whom it belongs, bring forth another's child! She, by the labours of another, has brought forth this child without pain. A child blest indeed! two mothers it has got, and grandams two<milestone n="804" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">And grandams two</lemma>:  Plautus must, of course, mean two grandmothers by the mother's side alone; otherwise there was nothing wonderful in a child having two grandmothers.</note>. I'm now afraid how many fathers there may have been. Do see, please, the shocking deeds of women!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A MAID-SERVANT of Callicles.</speaker><p> I' troth, this fraud relates rather to the men than to the women. 'Twas a man, and not a woman, that caused her pregnancy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> I know that too. You were a trusty guardian for it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A MAID-SERVANT of Callicles.</speaker><p> He can do the most, who is strong the most. He was a man; he was the strongest; he prevailed; what he wanted, he carried off.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> And, i' faith, he too brought a heavy mishap, in fact, upon yourself. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A MAID-SERVANT of Callicles.</speaker><p> The thing itself experienced, I myself fully know that, even if you had held your tongue.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> Never, this day, have I been able to made you declare who he was.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A MAID-SERVANT of Callicles.</speaker><p> <stage>aside, on catching sight of DINARCHUS</stage>. I've held my tongue; but now I shan't hold my tongue, since he's here; it's necessary I should tell.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. I'm petrified; in my wretchedness, I dare not move myself; the matter's all out! The trial's now going on here for my life! These are my misdeeds, this is my folly. I'm in dread how soon I may be named.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> <stage>to the MAID-SERVANT</stage>. Speak out, who was it, debauched my maiden daughter?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A MAID-SERVANT of Callicles.</speaker><p> I see him near you. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> Hussy, who was it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. I'm neither alive nor dead, nor know I what I am now to do; neither know I how to go away hence, nor how to accost him; I'm numbed with fear.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> Will you tell me, or no? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A MAID-SERVANT of Callicles.</speaker><p> It is Dinarchus, to whom you first betrothed her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> <stage>looking round</stage>. Where is this person whom you mention?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>stepping forward</stage>. Here I am, Callicles. <stage>Falling on the ground.</stage> By your knees I do entreat you that you will bear with wisdom that which was done in folly; and that you will pardon me that, which, losing my senses, I did through the bad influence of wine.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> You please me not. You throw the blame on what is dumb<milestone n="825" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">On what is dumb</lemma>:  By throwing the blame on wine, that could not defend itself.</note>, that which cannot speak. But the wine, if it could speak, would defend itself. It's not wine that's in the habit of ruling men, but men wine; those, indeed, who are virtuous men; but he who is bad, although he drinks water, or if indeed he abstains from intoxicating liquors, still, by nature he's bad.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Well, I'm sensible that many reproaches must be heard by me, which I would prefer not. I confess that I've offended you, and am privy to the crime.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A MAID-SERVANT of Callicles.</speaker><p> Callicles, prithee beware that you do injury to no person; the accused is pleading his cause at large, the witnesses you are keeping in bonds.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> <stage>to his SLAVES</stage>. Release those women. <stage>They are unbound.</stage> Come <stage>to each of them in turn</stage>, do you be off home, and you home as well. <stage>To SYRA.</stage> Tell your mistress this. she must give up the child, if any one asks for it.

<stage>(SYRA goes into the house of PHRONESIUM, and exit the MAID-SERVANT.)</stage> You, Dinarchus, let's go before the judge.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Why do you wish me to go before the judge? You are the Pr&aelig;tor to me. But I entreat of you, Callicles, that you'll give me your daughter for a wife.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> I' faith, I find, indeed, that you've come to a decision on that point yourself; for you haven't waited till I gave her; you have helped yourself. Now keep her, as you've got her, but I'll fine you this grand haul; six great talents will I deduct from her dowry for this folly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> You act kindly towards me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLICLES</speaker><p> 'Twere best for you to demand your son back from thence. <stage>Pointing to the house of PHRONESIUM.</stage> But your wife, as soon as possible, take away from my house. I shall at once, therefore, send a messenger to that kinsman of mine by marriage, and tell him to look out for another match for his son. <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. But I'll demand back the child of her, lest by-and-by she should deny it. That's of no use; for she herself, of her own accord, has discovered the whole matter to me, how it happened. But see, right opportunely, i' faith, is she coming out of doors from her house. Assuredly, a far-darting sting has that woman, who even from that distance is wounding my heart. <stage>Stands aside.</stage></p></sp></div1>

<stage>Enter PHRONESIUM and ASTAPHIUM, from the house of the former.</stage>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> <stage>to herself</stage>. A woman is a spoony and a trolloping slut, if she hasn't a view to her own interests, even in her cups. If her other limbs are soaked in wine, at least let her head be sober. But it's a vexation to me that my hair-dresser has been thus badly treated.

<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>coming forward</stage>. Madam, here am I.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> It certainly is he. What's the matter, my love?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> No love; cease your trifling. I've nothing now to do with that subject.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> By my faith, I know what you want, and what you desire, and what you ask for. You want to see me; you desire to caress me; you ask for the child.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Immortal Gods! how plain she speaks. How, in a few words, has she hit upon the very point!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> As for me, I know that you are betrothed, and that you have a son by your betrothed, and that a wife is now going to be married by you; that now your thoughts are elsewhere, that myself you are going to consider as forsaken. But still consider, the little mouse, how sagacious an animal it is, which never entrusts its life to one hole only; inasmuch as, if one hole is blocked up, it seeks another as a place of refuge.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> When there's leisure, then I'll talk to you on those matters more at large; at present, give me up the child.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> No; do, there's a dear, let it be at my house the few next days.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Certainly not. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> Do, there's a dear.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> What occasion is there?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> It's for my interest. This for the next three days at least, until the Captain is circumvented somehow; for that same purpose. If I get anything, it shall be for your own advantage as well. If you take the child away, all hope in the Captain will evaporate from my heart.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> I would have that done; but, when it's taken home, to do it again<milestone n="873" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To do it again</lemma>:  "Refacere." This, in most of the Editions, is printed as "re facere," "to do in reality;" but that does not seem to be the proper reading. Dinarchus appears to mean, "You may keep the child for the present, in order to carry out your plans; for when I have once taken it home I shall not be able to do it again"--or, in other words, "lend it to you for your purposes."</note>, if I were to wish it, I have not the opportunity. Now make use of the child, and take care of it, because you have the means by which to take care of it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> Upon my faith, I do love you much for this matter. When you shall be afraid of a scolding at home, do you take shelter here in my house. At least, prove a friend, to help me to a profitable speculation.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>moving</stage>. Kindly farewell, Phronesium.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> Won't you any longer call me "apple of your eve?" </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> That name too, meanwhile, shall be repeated full oft.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> Do you wish for anything else?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DINARCHUS</speaker><p> Fare thee well; when I have leisure, I'll come to your house. <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> Well, he's gone away from here, and has taken his departure; we may say here whatever we please. 'Tis a true proverb that's quoted, "Where the friends are, there are the riches." Through him, there's still some hope that the Captain may be duped to-day; whom, by the powers, I love better than my own self,--so long as I get out of him what I want: since, when we have got much, not much of it is seen that has been given. Such are the brilliant prospects of Courtesans!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> Hush! hush! be quiet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> Prithee, what is it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ASTAPHIUM</speaker><p> The father of the child is coming.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> Well, let him come here. Let him, if it only is he, let him come himself straight up to me here just as he chooses. If he does come, for very sure, i' faith, I'll do him to-day with some cunning tricks. <stage>They go into the house.</stage>

<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> Upon my faith you are a funny mortal, my Strabax. Prithee, do proceed---- <stage>Aside.</stage> A fool and a madman are contending for their ruin; I'm all right.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRATOPHANES</speaker><p> Come, younker, do you offer something first.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRABAX</speaker><p> Why no; do you squander first, and come to ruin.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRATOPHANES</speaker><p> <stage>to PHRONESIUM</stage>. Well, here's a talent of silver for you. It's in Philippean coins. Take it for yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> <stage>taking the money</stage>. So much the better. Be one of our family, but live at your own expense.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRATOPHANES</speaker><p> <stage>to STRABAX</stage>. Where is that which you are going to give? Open your purse-strings<milestone n="950" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Open your purse-strings</lemma>:  "Solve zonam." Literally, "loosen your girdle." The girdle was sometimes used as the purse itself. At other times the purse was placed there for safety</note>.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> That's a challenge.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRATOPHANES</speaker><p> <stage>to STRABAX</stage>. What are you afraid of?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRABAX</speaker><p> You are from abroad<milestone n="951" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">You are from abroad</lemma>:  He alludes to the alleged service of Stratophanes in the Babylonian army, and implies that he hesitates to answer to the challenge because he does not know whether Stratophanes may not turn out to be a sharper.</note>. I live here <stage>points to his FATHER'S house</stage>. I am afraid. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRATOPHANES</speaker><p> I am not. Walk off, then.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRABAX</speaker><p> I'm bringing her some sheep fastened in a purse to my neck.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRATOPHANES</speaker><p> Because I gave that, how I did flounder the fellow<milestone n="953" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Flounder the fellow</lemma>:  Stratophanes plumes himself with the idea that, he having given the money to Phronesium, the other will not dare to answer his challenge.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRABAX</speaker><p> Why no, indeed, it's I, who am going to give.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> <stage>to STRATOPHANES</stage>. Come in-doors now, prithee, and <stage>to STRABAX</stage> do you then stay with me here.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRATOPHANES</speaker><p> You will give me your company then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRABAX</speaker><p> <stage>to PHRONESIUM</stage>. What say you? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> What?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRABAX</speaker><p> What do you say? What, with this fellow? Am I to be postponed?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRATOPHANES</speaker><p> I have made my present.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> <stage>to STRATOPHANES</stage>. You have given; <stage>pointing to STRABAX</stage> he's going to give just now; the one I've got, the other I expect. But each of the two shall be indulged to his heart's content.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRABAX</speaker><p> So be it. As I see the matter stands, that must be taken that's offered. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRATOPHANES</speaker><p> Indeed, I shall assuredly not be letting you take possession of my couch.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHRONESIUM</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. I' faith, I've cleverly netted them, and quite to my satisfaction. <stage>To the AUDIENCE.</stage> And as I see my affairs successfully managed, yours likewise<milestone n="960" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Yours likewise</lemma>:  There has been some doubt as to the meaning of this and the next two lines; but, on examination, it is clear that they have an indecent signification.</note> would I successfully manage. I'll caress you in reality. If you are disposed to be doing anything, take care, will you, and let me know at once. For the sake of Venus, applaud; this Play is in her honor. Spectators, kindly farewell; grant applause, and then rise up<milestone n="964" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Then rise up</lemma>:  Cicero, in his Treatise "On Old Age," informs us that this Play was a favourite one of Plautus. It is difficult to see for what reason, as, compared with many of the others, it seems to be deficient in plot, and the Churl. from whom it takes its name has scarcely, any part in the business of it.</note>.
