<head>THE SUBJECT</head>

<p>PLIEUSICLES, a young Athenian, is in love with Philocomasium, a Courtesan of Athens, who returns his affection. Being sent on public business to <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>, a certain Captain of <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, Pyrgopolinices by name, comes to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and insinuates himself into the good graces of her mother, in order that he may get Philocomasium into his power. Having deceived the mother, he places the daughter on board ship and carries her off to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>. On this, Palaestrio, a faithful servant of Pleusicles, hastens to embark for <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>, with the view of telling his master what has happened. The ship being taken by pirates, he is made captive, and by chance is presented as a gift to Pyrgopolinices. He recognises the mistress of Pleusicles in the Captain's house; but he carefully conceals from the Captain who he himself is. He then privately writes to Pleusicles, requesting him to come to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>. On arriving, Pleusicles is hospitably entertained by Periplecomenus, a friend of his father, an old gentleman who lives next door to the Captain. As Philocomasium has a private room of her own in the Captain's house, a hole is made through the partition wall, and by this contrivance she meets Pleusicles in the house of his entertainer, who gives his sanction to the plan.</p>
<p>At this juncture, the play begins. A servant of the Captain, named Sceledrus, has been appointed to be the keeper of Philocomnasium. Pursuing a monkey along the roof of the house, he looks down the skylight of the house next door, and there sees Pleusicles and Philocomasium conversing and toying with each other. When this has been discovered to be the case, a plan is arranged, by which Sceledrus shall not only not divulge to the Captain what he has seen, but shall even be made to believe that he has not actually seen it himself. Palaestrio, therefore, persuades him that the twin-sister of Philocomasium has arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, and with her lover is staying at their neighbour's house. To forward their designs, Palaestrio then invents another plan. He persuades the Captain to believe that the wife of his neighbour, Periplecomenus, is in love with him. Through his agency, a Courtesan, named Acroteleutium, pretends that she is the wife so desperately in love with the Captain. he believes this story, and, that he may the more conveniently receive her in his house, by the advice of Palaestrio, he sends Philocomasium away, and gives her into the charge of Pleusicles, who is disguised in the dress of a master of a ship. They go to the harbour and set sail, accompanied by Palaestrio, whom the Captain has given to Philocomasium at her request. The Captain, then, at the invitation of the maid of Acroteleutium, goes to the house next door, to visit her mistress. On this, Periplecomenus, with his servants, sallies forth upon him, and, having first threatened to cut him in pieces, and then having beaten and stripped him, they let him go, after they have exacted from him a confession that he has been rightly served, and a promise that he will molest no one in return for the treatment he has received.

<stage>Enter PYRGOPOLINICES <note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Pyrgopolinices</lemma>:  The literal meaning of the name of the swaggering Captain is "the much-conquering tower," or something similar. "Artotrogus" means "bread-eater." The word "Parasite" properly denotes "one person who dines with another." The name was originally given to persons who were assistants to the priests and high magistrates, and, consequently, had a respectable signification. The hangers-on, who are called "Parasites" by the Comic writers of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, first received that name from Alexis, the Greek Comedian. It has been well remarked, that their chief characteristics were "importunity, love of sensual pleasures," and "the desire of getting a good dinner without paying for it." They may be subdivided into the jesting, the officious, and the flattering Parasite (<foreign lang="la">assentator</foreign>), of which latter kind Artotrogus is an admirable specimen.  From ancient writers we find that it was their method to frequent the Courts of justice, market-places, baths, places for exercise, and other objects of public resort, with the view of obtaining a dinner, at the price of being the butt of their entertainer, and cheerfully submitting to the greatest humiliations.</note>, ARTOTROGUS, and Soldiers.</stage>

But where is Artotrogus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTOTROGUS</speaker><p> Here he is; he stands close by the hero, valiant and successful, and of princely form. Mars could not dare to style himself a warrior so great, nor compare his prowess with yours.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> Him you mean whom I spared on the Gorgonidonian<milestone n="13" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Gorgonidonian</lemma>:  These three crackjaw names are coined by Plautus much in the style of the names of the characters in Bombastes Furioso. They are mere gibberish, though the two latter are derived from Greek or Latin words; the first of which signifies "a son of a fighter at the sound of the trumpet."</note> plains, where Bumbomachides Clytomestoridysarchides, the grandson of Neptune, was the chief commander?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTOTROGUS</speaker><p> I remember him; him, I suppose, you mean with the golden armour, whose legions you puffed away with your breath just as the wind blows away leaves or the reed-thatched roof.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> Where are you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> How?--the fore-leg? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTOTROGUS</speaker><p> I meant to say this--the thigh.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> I struck the blow without an effort.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTOTROGUS</speaker><p> Troth, if, indeed, you had put forth your strength, your arm would have passed right through the hide, the entrails, and the frontispiece of the elephant.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> I don't care for these things just now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTOTROGUS</speaker><p> I' faith, 'tis really not worth the while for you to tell me of it, who know right well your prowess. <stage>(Aside)</stage> 'Tis my appetite creates<milestone n="33" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">My appetite creates</lemma>:  He now addresses the Spectators, and honestly confesses why he is a Parasite.</note> all these plagues.

<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> What was it I was saying?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> What was that? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTOTROGUS</speaker><p> Whatever it was you were going to say.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYBG.</speaker><p> Have you got your tablets<milestone n="38" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Got your tablets</lemma>:  The "<foreign lang="la">tabulae</foreign>," or "<foreign lang="la">tabellae</foreign>," used by the ancients for the purpose of writing, were pieces of wood, mostly of an oblong shape, covered with wax, on which an impression was made with the "<foreign lang="la">stylus</foreign>," or iron pen. They were sometimes made of ivory, but more frequently of citron-wood, beech, or fir The inside only of the tablet was covered with wax, the outer consisting of wood. The leaves were fastened at the back with wires, and opened and shut like the books of the present day. There was a raised margin to each leaf of the tablet, for the purpose of preventing the wax of the one from rubbing against the other. From two to five, six, or even more of these leaves were joined together, which were accordingly called "diptycha," "triptycha," and so on. Those tablets which contained legal documents were pierced through the outer edges with holes, through which a triple thread or string was passed, on which a seal was placed, in order to prevent forgery and to show that the deed was duly executed.</note>? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTOTROGUS</speaker><p> Are you intending to enlist<milestone n="36" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Intending to enlist</lemma>:  <foreign lang="la">Rogare</foreign>. Soldiers, when enlisted, were asked (<foreign lang="la">regabantur</foreign>) whether they would take the oath. Hence the word "<foreign lang="la">rogare</foreign>" means something tantamount to our word "enlist," or "recruit." The Parasite asks him if he is going to enlist, as the tablets would be wanted in the "Forum," or "Court of justice," for the purpose of taking down the oaths, and entering the names as the parties were sworn.</note>? I have them, and a pen as well.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> How cleverly you do suit your mind to my own mind.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> What is the sum total of those men?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTOTROGUS</speaker><p> Seven thousand. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> It must be as much: you keep the reckoning well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTOTROGUS</speaker><p> Yet I have none of them written down; still, so I remember it was.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> By my troth, you have a right good memory.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> So long as you shall do such as you have done hitherto, you shall always have something to eat: I will always make you a partaker at my table.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTOTROGUS</speaker><p> Besides, in <placeName key="tgn,6003016">Cappadocia</placeName>, you would have killed five hundred men altogether at one blow, had not your sabre been blunt.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> I let them live, because I was quite sick of fighting.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTOTROGUS</speaker><p> Why should I tell you what all mortals know, that you, Pyrgopolinices, live alone upon the earth, with valour, beauty, and achievements most unsurpassed? All the women are in love with you, and that not without reason, since you are so handsome. Witness those girls that pulled me by my mantle yesterday.

<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> What was it they said to you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTOTROGUS</speaker><p> They questioned me about you. "Is Achilles here?" says one to me. "No," says I, "his brother is." Then says the other to me: "By my troth, but he is a handsome and a noble man. See how his long hair becomes him Certainly the women are lucky who share his favours."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYBG.</speaker><p> And pray, did they really say so?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ARTOTROGUS</speaker><p> They are quite a nuisance to me; they are praying, entreating, beseeching me, to let them see you; bidding me be fetched to them; so that I can't give my attention to your business.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> It seems that it is time for us to go to the Forum, that I may count out their pay to those soldiers whom I have enlisted of late.

Give your attention, for now I will begin the argument. A very worthy young man at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> was my master. He was in love with a Courtesan, brought up at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, and she on the other hand loved him; such affection is most worthy to be cherished. In the public service, he was sent to <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName><milestone n="102" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U"><placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName></lemma>:  This was a city situated on the sea-coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>.</note> as Ambassador on behalf of that mighty republic. In the mean time, by chance, this Captain came to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. He introduced himself to this lady of my master, began to cajole her mother with presents of wine, trinkets, and costly treats; and so the Captain made himself on intimate terms with the procuress. As soon as ever an opportunity was presented for this Captain, he tricked this procuress, the mother of the damsel, whom my master loved. For, unknown to her mother, he put the daughter on board ship, and carried this woman, against her will, hither to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>. Soon as I knew that the lady of my master was carried off from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, as quickly as ever I was able, I procured for myself a ship: I embarked, that I might carry tidings of this matter to my master at Naupactum. When we had got out to sea, some pirates, as they had hoped to do, took that ship on board of which I was; thus I was undone before I reached my master, for whom I had commenced to proceed on my voyage.  <milestone n="120" unit="TLN line"/>He that took me, gave me as a present to this same Captain. After he had taken me home to his own house, I saw there that favorite of my master who lived at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. When, on the other hand, she perceived me, she gave me a sign with her eyes not to address her by name. Afterwards, when there was an opportunity, the damsel complained to me of her hard fate. She said that she wished to escape to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> from this house, that she was attached to him, that master of mine who lived at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and that she had never hated any one more thoroughly than this same Captain. As I discovered the feelings of the damsel, I took tablets, sealed them in private, and gave them to a certain merchant to carry to him (my master, I mean, who was at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and who had so loved her), in order that he might come hither. He did not slight the message, for he both is come, and is lodging here next door, with his host, a friend of his father's, a nice old man. He, too, gives every assistance to his guest in his amour, and encourages and seconds us with his help and his advice. Therefore, here <stage>(pointing to the CAPTAIN'S house)</stage>, in-doors, I have found a grand contrivance, by which to cause these lovers, each, to meet the other. For one room, which the Captain gave to his mistress for no one but herself to set foot in, in that same room I have dug a hole through the party-wall, in order that there may secretly be an ingress for the damsel from the one house to the other. And this I have done with the knowledge of the old gentleman; 'twas he that gave the advice. But my fellow-servant, whom the Captain has given as a keeper to his mistress, is a person of no great worth. By clever contrivances and ingenious devices, we will throw dust<milestone n="148" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">We will throw dust</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Glaucomam obiiciemus</foreign>;" literally, "we will throw a malady in his eyes."

And that you may not hereafter make mistakes, this damsel to-day, in this house and in that, will perform in turn a double part, and will be the same, but will pretend to be another, person. Thus will the keeper of the damsel be gulled.

<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> <stage>speaking to his servants within</stage>. Faith, if you don't in future smash his ankle-bones for any stranger that you see on my tiles, I will cut you so with lashes as to make thongs of your sides. My neighbours, i' faith, are overlookers of what is going on in my own house; so often are they peeping down through the skylight<milestone n="159" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Through the skylight</lemma>:  The "<foreign lang="la">atrium</foreign>," or middle hall, of the houses of the Romans was a large apartment, roofed over, with the exception of an opening in the centre, which was called "<foreign lang="la">impluvium</foreign>," or "<foreign lang="la">compluvium</foreign>," towards which the roof sloped, so as to throw the rain-water down through pipes into a cistern below. Vitruvius says that the "<foreign lang="la">impluvium</foreign>" was from a fourth to a third of the size of the "<foreign lang="la">atrium</foreign>," or hall below. It was probably glazed, and thus would form a sort of sloping skylight. In the present instance, it would seem to have overlooked the upper chamber, into which Philocomasium passed through the wall of the next house, to meet Pleusicles.</note>. And now, therefore, I give you all notice, whatever person of this Captain's household you shall see upon our tiles, except Palaestrio only, push him headlong here into the street. Suppose he says that he is following some hen, or pigeon, or monkey; woe be to you, if you don't badly maul the fellow even to death. And so, that they may commit no infringement against the laws of dice<milestone n="164" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The laws of dice</lemma>:  Commentators are much divided as to what is the meaning here of "<foreign lang="la">lex alearia</foreign>," or, as some editions have it "<foreign lang="la">lex talaria</foreign>." Some suppose that it simply means "the rules of the game with the '<foreign lang="la">tali</foreign>,' or 'dice;'" while others think that Plautus alludes to some recent enactment at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> against games of chance. Such laws were repeatedly promulgated, but immediately became a mere dead letter. "<foreign lang="la">Talus</foreign>" means either a person's "anklebone," or the "knuckle-bone" of an animal, which latter was marked with numbers on four sides, and used by the Greeks and Romans in sets of four for the purpose of dice. The old man puns on the two meanings, and says, "I'll take care that your '<foreign lang="la">tali</foreign>' (or ankle-bones) are broken, so that" (if we adopt the first meaning) "you shall not cheat at dice in future," or (if we take the second interpretation) "you shall not have an opportunity of infringing the public laws." "<foreign lang="la">Simia</foreign>," which is translated "monkey," is. strictly speaking, "a she-ape;" probably a present from the Captain to Philocomasium.</note>, do you take good care that they keep holiday at home without any ankle-bones at all.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Something amiss,--what, I know not, has been done him by our family so far as I can hear, inasmuch as the old man has ordered the ankles of my fellow-servants to be broken.

<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> What thing's discovered?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> Some one just now of your household was looking in from the tiles through our skylight at Philocomasium and my guest as they were toying together.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> What person saw it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> Your fellow-servant. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Which person was it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> I don't know; he took himself off so suddenly--in an instant.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> I suspect I'm ruined. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> When he went away, I cried: "Hallo! you sir!" said I, "what are you doing upon the tiles?" As he went away he replied to me in these terms, that he was following a stray'd monkey.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Woe to wretched me! that I must be ruined for a worthless beast. But is Philocomasium there with you even still?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> When I came out, she was there.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> If she is, then bid her return to our house as soon as ever she can, that the servants may see that she is at home; unless, indeed, she wishes that we, who are slaves, her fellow- slaves<milestone n="184" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Her fellow-slaves</lemma>:  He seems to use the word "<foreign lang="la">contubernales</foreign>," "comrades," or "fellow-slaves," as applying to the relation between Philocomasium and the other slaves in the house; since, falling into the hands of the Captain, she had become reduced to the condition of a slave. The cross was the instrument of a punishment among the Romans, which was especially inflicted upon slaves. It was usually in shape like the letter T or X, but there were various other forms of it. The condemned carried his own cross, and, being first stripped, was either nailed or bound to it, and in the latter ase was generally left to die of hunger. It must be remembered that in the time of the Roman Republic the laws did not protect the person or life of the slaves, who were sometimes very barbarously treated.</note>, should all be given up together to tortures by the cross on account of her courting.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> I bade her do so; unless you would aught else.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> I would. Tell her this: that, by my troth, she must not hesitate at all to bring in play her skill and cleverness.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> In what way? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> That by her words she may persuade him who saw her here at your house, that he did not see her. Should he accuse her, on the other hand let her convince him with her oath.

Some Commentators fancy that he means literally to say that women have always at hand plenty of poisonous plants for the purposes of mischief, and that they need not the assistance of the gardener or nurseryman when they wish to carry out their designs. Such an interpretation seems, however, to be very far-fetched.</note> to the gardener for material, she has a garden at home and a stock of her own for all mischievous contrivances; at home she has impudence<milestone n="192" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Impudence</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Os</foreign>," literally," "face; similar to a common expression it use with us.</note>, a lying tongue, perfidiousness, malice, and boldness, self-conceit, assurance, and deceitfulness,--at home she has wiles,--at home captivating contrivances,--stratagems at home.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> I'll tell her this, if she shall be in-doors here <stage>pointing to his house</stage>. But what is it, Palaestrio, that you are considering with yourself in your mind?</p></sp>

He strikes his breast with his fingers I fancy he's about to call his heart outside. See, he shifts his posture; again he places his left hand upon his left thigh.

His right hand is moving rapidly<milestone n="201" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Is moving rapidly</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Mico</foreign>" strictly means, "to have a tremulous motion imparted."

It is generally supposed that Plautus here refers to the Roman poet Naevius, who had a habit of using this posture, and was, as is thought, at that moment in prison for having offended, in one of his Comedies, the family of the Metelli. He was afterwards liberated on having apologised in his plays called <title lang="la">Hariolus</title> (the Wizard) and <title lang="la">Leo</title> (the Lion).

Come--to the business you're about: keep wide awake, think not of sleep; unless, indeed, you wish to be keeping your watch here all checquered o'er with stripes. 'Tis T, that am talking to you; schemer, don't you know that I am speaking to you? Palaestrio! awake, say; arouse yourself, I say; 'tis daylight now, I say.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> I hear you. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> Don't you see that the enemy is upon you, and that siege is being laid to your back? Take counsel, then; obtain aid and assistance in this matter; the hastily, not the leisurely, is befitting here. Get the start of them in some way, and in some direction this moment lead around your troops. Close round the enemy in siege; prepare the convoy for our side. Cut off the enemy's provision, secure yourself a passage, by which supplies and provision may be enabled in safety to reach yourself and your forces. Look to this business; the emergency is sudden. Invent--contrive--this instant give us some clever plan; so that that which has been seen here within, may not have been seen; that which has been done, may not have been done. There, my man, you undertake a great enterprise; lofty the defences which you erect. If you yourself alone but say you undertake this, I have a certainty that we are able to rout our foes.

<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> But, friend, do you impart to me the plan which you have devised.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Be silent, then, while I am inducting you in the direction of my devices; that you may know as well as my own self my plans.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> The same you shall receive safe from the same spot where you have deposited them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> My master is surrounded with the hide of an elephant, not his own, and has no more wisdom than a stone.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> I myself know the same thing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Now, thus I would begin upon my plan; this contrivance I shall act upon. I shall say that her other own twin-sister has come here from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, with a certain person, her lover, to Philocomasium, as like to her as milk is to milk.

<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> So that, if my fellow-servant should accuse her before the Captain, and say that he has seen her here at your house, toying with another man, I shall assert, on the other hand, that my fellow-servant has seen the other one, the sister, at your house, fondling and toying with her own lover.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> Aye, most excellent. I'll say the same, if the Captain shall inquire of me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> But do you say that they are extremely alike; and this must be imparted in time to Philocomasium, in order that she may know; that she mayn't be tripping if the Captain should question her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> A very clever contrivance. But if the Captain should wish to see them both in company together, what shall we do then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> That's easy enough.

The "<foreign lang="la">prandium</foreign>," which is here translated "breakfast," is supposed to have been a hasty meal, and to have been taken from twelve to one o'clock in the day.

There are as many of these put-offs as you like, if I can only persuade him at the very outset to believe that to be true which shall be contrived.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> I like what you say. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Go in-doors then; and if the damsel's there, bid her return home directly, and instruct and tutor her thoroughly in this plan, that she may understand our scheme, as we have begun it, about the twin-sister.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> I'll have her right cleverly tutor'd for you. Is there anything else?</p></sp>

The Captain gave me to her as her keeper. Now, if I make a discovery, I'm undone; if I am silent, still I am undone, if this should be discovered. What is there more abandoned or more daring than a woman? While I was upon the tiles, this woman betook herself out of doors from her dwelling. By my troth, 'twas a brazen act she did.

<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> What did you dream? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILOCOMASIUM</speaker><p> I'll tell you; but, I pray you, give attention. Last night, in my sleep, my twin-sister seemed to have come from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName> with a certain person, her lover.

<sp><speaker>PHILOCOMASIUM</speaker><p> I seemed to be delighted because my sister had come, and on her account I seemed to be incurring a most grievous suspicion. For, in my sleep, my own servant seemed to accuse me, as you are now doing, of being caressed by a strange young man, whereas it was that own twin-sister of mine, who had been toying with her own friend. Thus did I dream that I was wrongfully accused of a crime.</p></sp>

How he does so is somewhat of a mystery to the Commentators. <placeName key="tgn,1030877">Thornton</placeName>, in his translation, suggests that he calls through the window, where it is natural to imagine that Philocomasium might be stationed within hearing to observe all that passed. He could hardly, however, call "through" the window of the ground floor, as these were generally more than six feet from the ground; and, indeed, there were rarely any windows at all on the basement. It is most likely that Philocomasium is hidden behind the "<foreign lang="la">clatri</foreign>" or "lattice" of the window in her room on the first-floor, whence she observes all that passes. In a future line we find Acroteleutium and Milphidippa owning that they had been watching from the window what was going on outside. Schmieder thinks that the whole plan having been prearranged between Periplecomenus and Philocomasium, he merely on this occasion makes a sign to her, the meaning of which is here expressed in words, and he supposes, what it does not deem necessary to suppose, that his servants have been ordered to delay Sceledrus, so as to give time to the damsel to pass through into his house.</note>! pass instantly, with all speed, into my house; 'tis absolutely necessary.

Why, really, I am not more than four-and-fifty years old; I see clearly with my eyes, I'm ready with my hands, I'm active with my feet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> If he is seen by you to have white hair, he is by no means an old man in mind; in him the natural strength of his mind is unimpaired.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> By my troth, for my part, I have found it to be so as you say, Palaestrio; for, in fact, his kindness is quite that of a young man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> Yes, my guest, the more you make trial of it, the more you will know my courtesy towards you in your love.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> What need to know what's known already?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> I'll show you more amiability on my part than I'll make mention of * * * * * * * that you may have instances for proving it at home, and not have to seek it out of doors. For unless one has loved himself, with difficulty he sees into the feelings of one in love. But I have some little love and moisture in my body still, and not yet am I dried up for the pursuits of merriment and pleasure. Either the merry banterer likewise, or the agreable boon-companion will I be; no interrupter of another am I at a feast. I bear in mind how properly to keep myself from proving disagreable to my fellow-guests; and how to take a due share with my conversation, and to be silent as well in my turn, when the discourse belongs to another. Far from being a spitter or hawker am I, far from being a dirty-nosed old fellow, too. And never do I take liberties with any person's mistress when out in company; I don't snatch up the dainty bits before another, nor take the cup before my turn; nor, through wine, do dissensions ever arise on my account at the convivial board. If there is any one there that is disagreable, I go off home; I cut the parley short. Stretched at my ease, I devote myself to pleasure, love, and mirth. In fine, at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName> was I born, not among the Apulians, not at Animula<milestone n="654" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">At Animula</lemma>:  The people of <placeName key="tgn,7010380">Apulia</placeName>, in the south of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, were noted for their clownish manners. Animula, as we learn from Festus, was a little town in that country; probably its inhabitants were the most remarkable of all for their rusticity. Absurdities and anachronisms not unfrequently occur in our author. There is something absurd in a merry old gentleman of <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName> going all the way to Animula for a simile.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> O what a most delightful old man, if he possesses the qualities he mentions! Why, troth, surely now, he was brought up in the very rearing of Venus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Why, in fact, you will not find another person who is of his years, more accomplished in every respect, or who is more a friend to his friend.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> By my troth, your whole manners really do show marks of first-rate breeding. Find me three men of such manners against a like weight in double-distilled gold<milestone n="660" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Double distilled gold</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Aurichalco</foreign>" probably signifies here, as in some other passages, a fabulous metal of more value than even gold. "<foreign lang="la">Orichalcum</foreign>," however, properly means either one of the ores of copper, or a metallic compound much used by the ancients, which was probably brass, formed by the combination of zinc ore and copper. Supposing gold to be one of its constituents, they corrupted its original name, "<foreign lang="la">orichalcum</foreign>," into "<foreign lang="la">aurichalcum</foreign>." The former word is supposed by the author of the article "<foreign lang="la">orichalcum</foreign>," in Dr. Smith's Dictionary, to have been a compound of <foreign lang="greek">o)/ros</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">xalko\s,</foreign> "mountain bronze," so called from fusing copper with an ore as found in the mountains. "<foreign lang="la">Contra</foreign>," in this sentence, has the meaning of "to" or "against," in staking for a bet: "three men against their weight in gold;" "a horse to a hen," as the betting men sometimes say.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> I'll make you confess that I really am a youngster in my manners; so abounding in kindnesses will I prove myself to you in every respect. Should you have need of an advocate, severe or fierce? I am he. Have you need of one that is gentle?

<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> <stage>to PLEUSICLES</stage>. What could you wish added to these accomplishments, if the option were given you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> That thanks could be returned by me to him in degree equal to his deserts, and to yourself, to both of whom I feel that I am now the cause of extreme anxiety. But it is grievous to me to be the cause of so great expense to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> You are a simpleton. For, if you lay anything out on a bad wife and upon an enemy, that is an expense; that which is laid out on a deserving guest and a friend is gain; as that, which is expended upon sacred rites, is a profit to the wise man. By the blessing of the Gods, I have enough, with which to receive you with hospitality in my house. Eat, drink, indulge your tastes with me, and surfeit yourself with enjoyments; my house is at your service, myself likewise do I wish to be at your service. For, through the blessing of the Gods, I may say that, by reason of my wealth, I could have married a dowered wife of the best family; but I don't choose to introduce an everlasting female barker at me into my house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> Why don't you choose? For 'tis a delightful thing to be the father of children [<foreign lang="la">liberos</foreign>].</p></sp>

For a good wife, if it is possible for her to be married anywhere on earth, where can I find her?

These and many other expenses of the women like to these frighten me from a wife, to be uttering speeches to me like to this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> In good sooth, the Gods are propitious to you; for so soon as you lose this liberty, you will not easily reinstate yourself in the same condition.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> You are a person who are able to counsel wisely both for another and for yourself. But 'tis some merit for a man of noble family and of ample wealth to rear children--a memorial of his race and of himself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> Since I have many relations, what need have I of children? Now I live well and happily, and as I like, and as contents my feelings. For I shall bequeath my property to my relations, and divide it among them. These, like children, pay attentions to me; they come to see how I do, or what I want; before it is daybreak they are with me; they make inquiry how I have enjoyed my sleep in the night. Them will I have for children who are ever sending presents to me. Are they sacrificing--they give a greater part of it to me than to themselves; they take me home with them to share the entrails<milestone n="712" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To share the entrails</lemma>:  It was the custom, after their portions had been sacrificed to the Gods, to reserve a part of the entrails for the persons who sacrificed. These invited their dearest and most intimate friends to partake of them, or, if they could not attend, were in the habit of sending their share to them. The old man here flatters himself that he is a general favorite, although, bye and bye, he hints a suspicion that, being a rich old bachelor, the love of his friends is not quite disinterested.</note>; they invite me to their houses to breakfast and to dinner. He thinks himself most unfortunate, who has sent but very little to me. They vie with one another with their presents; I say in a low voice to myself: "They are gaping after my property; while, in their emulation, they are nourishing me and loading me with presents."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Upon right good grounds and right well do you fully understand yourself and your own interests, and if you are happy, sons twofold and threefold have you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> Troth, if I had had them, enough anxiety should I have had from my children. * * * * * * I should have been everlastingly tormented in mind; but if perchance one had had a fever, I think I should have died. Or if one, in liquor, had tumbled anywhere from his horse, I should have been afraid that he had broken his legs or neck on that occasion.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> 'Tis right that riches should come, and that long life should be granted to this man, who both husbands his property and yet enjoys himself and has kind wishes for his friends.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> O what a delightful person! So may the Gods and Goddesses prosper me, 'twere right the Deities should so ordain that all should not live after one rule as to the duration of life. Just as he who is a trusty market-officer<milestone n="727" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Market-officer</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Agoranomus</foreign>" was the name of a public officer among the Greeks, who, like the "<foreign lang="la">aedilis plebis</foreign>" at <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, had the inspection or the wares offered for sale in the public markets.</note> sets their prices on the wares; as that which is good or valuable is sold according to its excellence, and that which is worthless, according to the faultiness of the commodity, deprives its owner of its price; so were it right that the Gods should. portion out the life of man, so as to give to him who is kindly disposed a long life, and speedily to deprive of existence those who are reprobate and wicked. If they had provided this, bad men would both have been fewer, and with less hardihood would they do their wicked deeds; and then, those who were good men, of them there would have been a more plenteous harvest.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> He who would blame the ordinances of the Gods must be foolish and ignorant. * * * At present we must at once have an end of these matters; for new I want to go to market, that, my guest, according to your own deserts and mine, I may entertain you hospitably at my house, heartily and with right hearty cheer.</p></sp>

For no guest can be thus hospitably entertained by a friend, but that when he has been there three days running, he must now become a bore; but when he is prolonging his stay for ten successive days, he is a nuisance to the household. Although the master willingly allows it, the servants grumble.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> I have trained up the servants that are in my service, my guest, not to rule over me, or for me to be obedient to them. If that is disagreable to them which is agreable to me, I steer my own course<milestone n="747" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Steer my own course</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Meo rem remigio gero</foreign>;" literally, "I carry on my own business with my own staff of rowers." The rowers were frequently slaves, and of course were kept in strict subordination. He alludes to the regularity of his household, where everything is done in its proper time and place, and the promptness with which he is in the habit of being obeyed. We need hardly remark that most of the "<foreign lang="la">servi</foreign>," or "servants," were slaves.</note>; that which they don't like must still be done at their peril, and whether they like it or no.

For they are in the habit of saying, when they have taken their places, when dinner is put on table: "What necessity was there for you to go to this great expense on out account? Surely you were mad, for this same dinner was enough for ten persons." What has been provided on their account they find fault with; they eat it up, however.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Troth, in that self-same fashion 'tis generally done. How clever and shrewd is his discernment.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> But these same persons never say, although such an abundance has been provided, "Do order that to be taken off; do take away this dish; remove this gammon of bacon, I'll have none of it; put aside that piece of pork; this conger's good<milestone n="760" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">This conger's good</lemma>:  Lampreys and conger eels were very much esteemed by the Romans.

<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> The business, then, that we are about--to that we ought first to turn our thoughts. Do you both, now, give me your attention.

But I am convinced full well that it is as you say. For that reason, Palaestrio, do compress your words in as short a compass as ever you possibly can.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> I consider that a matter of indifference, so that you find one who is greedy for gain, who supports her body by her charms, who has, too, her senses all awake; as for her heart, that cannot be so, as none of them have one.</p></sp>

It was not worn by women of light character, or even by the "<foreign lang="la">libertinae</foreign>," or liberated female slaves; so that it was not only deemed an emblem of chastity, but of freedom also.

<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> We have need of her as well; so give your instructions to the damsel and her maid, to pretend that she is your wife and is doting upon this Captain; and as though she had given this ring to her maid, then she to me, that I might deliver it to the Captain; and I must be as though it were a go-between in this matter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> I hear you; don't stun my ears as if I were deaf.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> I myself will go straightway to him; I'll say that it has been brought and delivered to me from your wife, in order that I might introduce her to him.

Each maniple had two centurions, whose duty it was to drill their men, inspect their arms, clothing, and food, visit the sentinels, and regulate the conduct of the privates both in the camp and in the field. They sat as judges in minor offences, and had the power of ordering corporal punishment, whence their badge of office was a vine sapling.

<sp><speaker>LUCRIO</speaker><p> He's snoring, 'twas that I meant to say: but, because 'tis very like gulping when you are snoring---- * * * * * * *</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> What ! Is Sceledrus asleep in-doors?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LUCRIO</speaker><p> Not with his nose, in fact; for with that he is calling out loud enough.</p></sp>

The Romans used many articles for flavouring their wines. Spikenard, an Eastern aromatic, is here referred to. Horehound, squills, wormwood, and myrtle-berries were used for making medical wines. Cornels, figs, medlars, roses, asparagus, parsley, radishes, laurels, junipers, cassia, cinnamon, and saffron, with many other particulars, were also used for flavouring wines.</note>. Oho! you rascal, you are his deputy-butler<milestone n="825" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">His deputy-butler</lemma>:  Some Commentators take this passage to mean, that Sceledrus really was the "<foreign lang="la">promus</foreign>," or "butler;" but it seems more probable that Palaestrio says, by way of accusation, "Sceledrus has not only been acting the butler on this occasion, but you have been acting as his deputy, in secretly helping him to draw it." Lucrio was the "<foreign lang="la">subcustos</foreign>" of Sceledrus, the "deputy-keeper" of Philocomasium, and the under-butler as well.</note>. Oho!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LUCRIO</speaker><p> What do you mean? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> How has he thought fit to go to sleep?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LUCRIO</speaker><p> With his eyes, I suppose. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> I don't ask you that, you vagabond. Step this way: you're undone now, unless I know the truth. Did you draw the wine for him?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LUCRIO</speaker><p> I did not draw it. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Do you deny it?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> And you didn't just drink as well? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LUCRIO</speaker><p> The Gods confound me if I did drink--if I could drink.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Why so? </p></sp>

Palaestrio grumbles on finding that while he is drinking vinegar and water his fellow-slave is enjoying himself on mulled wine.</note>. The cellar's trusted to an honest butler, as well as under-butler.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LUCRIO</speaker><p> I' faith, you'd be doing the same, if it was entrusted to you. Since you can't follow our example, you are envious now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Come, now, did he ever draw any wine before this? Answer me, you rascal. And, that you may understand it, I give you this notice: if you purposely tell me an untruth, you shall be put to the torture.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LUCRIO</speaker><p> Indeed so? That you may inform, forsooth, that I told you; and then I shall be turned out of my fattening post in the cellar, that you may find another under-butler to draw for your own self.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> On my honour, I will not; come, speak out boldly to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LUCRIO</speaker><p> By my troth, I never saw him draw any. But thus was it; he requested me, and then I drew it.</p></sp>

Probably by acting the Bacchanal he means to say that the pot got filled and was then emptied, just like the Bacchanals, who, doubtless, were not particular at vomiting a part of the enormous quantities of wine which they imbibed; and he naively tells the truth, by saying that the cask slipping was the result of the pot being emptied, and so laying the fault more upon the pot than the drinker.</note> have stood so very badly there. But there happened to be in the cellar a bit of a slippery spot; a two-pint pot was placed there, near the casks, in this fashion <stage>shows the way</stage>.

<sp><speaker>PERIPLECOMENUS</speaker><p> But no one, unaided, is sufficiently perfect; for full oft have I seen many a person lose the road to good advice before they had found it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> If a woman has anything to do mischievously and maliciously, in that case her memory is immortal at remembering it for everlasting; but if anything is to be done for a good purpose, or honestly, it will fall out that those same women will become oblivious that instant, and be unable to remember.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> I suppose you wish the Captain, your master, to be gulled.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> You've said what's true.</p></sp>

<stage>Enter ACROTELEUTIUM, MILPHIDIPPA, and PLEUSICLES from the house of PERIPLECOMENUS.</stage>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> Follow me; at the same time look around, that there may be no overlooker.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> Faith, I see no one, only him whom we want to meet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Just as I want you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> How do you do, our master-plotter?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> I, the master-plotter? Nonsense.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Because, in comparison with yourself, I am not worthy to fix a beam in a wall.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> Aye, indeed so. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> She's a very fluent and a very clever hand at mischief. How charmingly she did polish off the Captain.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> But still, not enough. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Be of good courage all the business is now prospering under our hands. Only do you, as you have begun, still give a helping hand; for the Captain himself has gone in-doors, to entreat his mistress to leave his house, with her mother and sister, for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> Very good--well done. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Besides, all the gold trinkets and apparel which he himself has provided for the damsel, he gives her to keep as a present for herself--so have I recommended him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> Really, it's easily done, if both she wishes it, and he desires it as well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Don't you know that when, from a deep well, you have ascended up to the top, there is the greatest danger lest you should thence fall back again from the top. This affair is now being carried on at the top of the well. If the Captain should have a suspicion of it, nothing whatever of his will be able to be carried off. Now, most especially, we have need of clever contrivances.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> I see that there is material enough at home for that purpose--three women, yourself the fourth, I am the fifth, the old gentleman the sixth.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> What an edifice of stratagems has been erected by us! I know for certain. that any town seems as though it could be taken by these plans: only do you lend your assistance.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> For that purpose are we come to you, to see if you wish for anything.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> You do what's &agrave; propos. Now to you do I assign this department<milestone n="1159" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">This department</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Impero provinciam</foreign>." This term was properly applied to the Senate when bestowing a province upon a Proconsul or Propraetor.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> General, you shall assign me whatever you please, so far as I am capable.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> I wish this Captain to be played off cleverly and adroitly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> I' faith, you're assigning me what's a pleasure to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> But do you understand how? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> You mean that I must pretend that I am distracted with love for him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Right--you have it. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> And as though by reason of that love I had fcregone<milestone n="1164" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">I had foregone</lemma>:  To account for the facility with which the pretended divorce appears to take place, we must remember that among the Romans either party was at liberty to dissolve the tie of marriage. Where a husband divorced his wife, the wife's "<foreign lang="la">dos</foreign>," or marriage-portion, was in general restored to her; and the same was the case where the divorce took place by mutual consent. This will account for Acroteleutium asserting that she had been divorced from Periplecomenus, and that she had retained possession of the house as having formed her marriage-portion. As a loss of affection on either side was thought to constitute a good ground for divorce, is is not to be wondered at if the Captain should believe the story that his neighbour's wife had obtained a divorce on account of her passion for himself.</note> my present marriage, longing for a match with him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Everything exactly in its due order; except only this one point; you must say that this house <stage>pointing to the house of PERIPLECOMENUS</stage> was your marriage-portion; that the old man had departed hence from you after you had carried out the divorce, lest he should be afraid just now to come here into the house of another man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> You advise me well. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> But when he comes out from in-doors, I wish you--standing at a distance there--so to make pretence, as though in comparison with his beauty you despised your own, and as though you were struck with awe at his opulent circumstances; at the same time, too, praise the comeliness of his person, the beauty of his face. Are you tutored enough?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> I understand it all. Is it enough that I give you my work so nicely finished off that you cannot find a fault with it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> I'm content. Now <stage>addressing PLEUSICLES</stage>, in your turn, learn what charge I shall give to you So soon as this shall be done, when she shall have gone in, then do you immediately take care to come here dressed in the garb of a master of a ship.

The "<foreign lang="la">culcita</foreign>" here alluded to was a little cushion padded with wool, which was placed before weak or diseased eyes to absorb the moisture. It is supposed to have been either bound against the part affected, or else to have been held in the hand and applied every now and then. Commentators seem to think that here Pleusicies holds it up to his eye with his hand when addressing the Captain. They are at a loss to know why Palaestrio recommends this, as the Captain has never seen Pleusicles, who was at <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> when Philocomasium was carried off. Still, though it is not mentioned, it may be, because the Captain had seen Pleusicles before he went to <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName>; or, what is more probable, that, affecting to have weak eyes, Pleusicles may not appear so comely as he really is, and not thereby excite any suspicion in the Captain's mind as to his intentions.</note> before your eyes; have on an iron-grey cloak<milestone n="1179" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">An iron-grey cloak</lemma>:  Some think that the "<foreign lang="la">ferrugineus</foreign>," or iron colour, here called "<foreign lang="la">colos thalassinus</foreign>," or "the sea-colour," was dark blue, but dark grey seems more probable, as the shades of blue were too expensive for common wear.</note> (for that is the seaman's colour); have it fastened over the left shoulder, your right arm projecting out<milestone n="1180" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Right arm projecting out</lemma>:  This no doubt was the way in which the "<foreign lang="la">pallium</foreign>" was usually worn by seafaring men, for the sake of expedition, and in order to give free play to the right arm when aboard ship.</note>, * * * * * * your clothes some way well girded up, pretend as though you are some master of a ship. And all these requisites are at the house of this old gentleman, for he keeps fishermen.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> Well, when I'm dressed out, why don't you tell me what I'm to do then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Come here, and, in the name of her mother, bring word to Philocomasium, that, if she would return to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, she must go with you to the harbour directly, and that she must order it to be carried down to the ship if she wishes anything to be put on board; that if she doesn't go, you must weigh anchor, for the wind is favourable.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> I like your plan much: do proceed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> The Captain will at once advise her to go speedily that she may not delay her mother.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> Every way you are clever. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> I shall tell him that she asks for me as a helper to carry her baggage down to the harbour. I shall go, and, understand you, I shall immediately be off with you straight to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> And when you have reached there, I'll never let you be ashore three days before you're free.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Be off speedily and equip yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> Is there anything besides? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Only to remember all this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> I'm off. <stage>Exit.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> And do you <stage>to ACROTELEUTIUM and MILPHIDIPPA</stage> be off hence in-doors this instant, for I'm quite sure that he'll just now be coming out hence from in-doors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> With us your command is as good as law.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Come, then, begone. But see, the door opens opportunely. <stage>The women go into the house of PERIPLECOMENUS.</stage></p></sp></div1>

<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> For what reason am I to say that you have been so long in-doors?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> I never was so sensible that I was beloved by that woman as now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Why so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> How many words she did utter! How the matter was protracted! But in the end I obtained what I wanted, and I granted her what she wanted and what she asked of me. I made a present of you also to her.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> Come, be of good heart; I'll make you free from exit, too. But I used all endeavours, if I could by any method persuade her to go away, and not take you with her, she forced me, however.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> In the Gods and yourself I'll place my trust. Yet, at the last, although it is bitter to me that I must be deprived of an excellent master, yourself, at least it is a pleasure to me that, through my means, by reason of the excellence of your beauty, this has happened to you with regard to this lady neighbour, whom I am now introducing to you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> <stage>in a low voice</stage>. Where is he?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> Only look to the left. Eye him askance, that he mayn't perceive that we are looking at him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> I see him. Troth, now's the time, in our mischief, for us to become supremely mischievous.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> 'Tis for you to begin. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> <stage>aloud</stage>. Prithee, did you see him yourself? <stage>Aside.</stage> Don't spare your voice, so that he may hear.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> <stage>aloud</stage>. By my troth, I talked with his own self, at my ease, as long as I pleased, at my leisure, at my own discretion, just as I wished.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> <stage>to PYRGOPOLINICES</stage>. I hear. How delighted she is because she had access to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> <stage>aloud</stage>. O happy woman that you are!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> How I do seem to be loved!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> You are deserving of it. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> <stage>aloud</stage>. By my troth, 'tis passing strange what you say, that you had access to him and prevailed. They say that he is usually addressed, like a king, through letters or messengers.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> <stage>aloud</stage>. But, i' faith, 'twas with difficulty I had an opportunity of approaching and beseeching him.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> <stage>aloud</stage>. I hope it may be so; although many ladies are seeking to win him for themselves, he disdains them and estranges himself from all but you alone.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> <stage>aloud</stage>. Therefore this fear torments me, since he is so disdainful, lest his eyes, when he beholds me, should change his sentiments, and his own gracefulness should at once disdain my form.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> <stage>aloud</stage>. He will not do so; be of good heart.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> <stage>to PALAESTRIO</stage>. How she does slight herself!</p></sp>

If I shall be unable to prevail on him, in some way or other, I'll put myself to death. I'm quite sure that without him I cannot live.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> By no means; for you will be making yourself cheap if you lavish yourself away of your own accord. Let her come spontaneously, seek you, court you, strive to win you. Unless you wish to lose that glory which you have, please have a care what you do. For I know that this was never the lot of any mortal, except two persons, yourself and Phaon of <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName><milestone n="1247" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Phaon of <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName></lemma>:  Sappho, the poetess, was enamoured of Phaon the Lesbian.

<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> <stage>aloud</stage>. By my troth, I do know it easily; for my nose would scent him if he were within.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> <stage>to PALAESTRIO</stage>. She is a diviner. Because she is in love with me, Venus has made her prophesy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> <stage>aloud</stage>. He is somewhere or other close at hand whom I do so long to behold. I'm sure I smell him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> <stage>to PALAESTRIO</stage>. Troth, now, she really sees better with her nose than with her eyes.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> <stage>to PYRGOPOLINICES</stage>. She is blind from love. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ACROTELEUTIUM</speaker><p> <stage>aloud</stage>. Prithee, do support me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> And we with you. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> I have brought my mistress out of the house, as you requested me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> So I see. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> Request her, then, to approach.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> Since you have entreated it, I have prevailed upon my mind not to detest her just like other women.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> I' faith she wouldn't be able to utter a word if she were to come near you; while she was looking at you, her eyes have in the meantime tied her tongue.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> I see that this woman's disorder must be cured.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> See how terrified she is since she beheld you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> Even armed men are the same; don't wonder at a woman being so. But what does she wish me to do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> You to come to her house; she wishes to live and to pass her life with you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> What!--I come home to her, when she is a married woman? Her husband is to be stood in fear of.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIDIPPA</speaker><p> Why,--for your sake, she has turned her husband out of her house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> How? How could she do so?</p></sp>

But I shall call for this Philocomasium. I'll knock at the door then. Hallo! is there any one here? <stage>Knocks at the CAPTAIN'S door.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Young man--what is it? What do you want? Why are you knocking?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> I'm come to inquire for Philocomasium; I'm come from her mother. If she's for going, let her set off. She is delaying us all; we wish to weigh anchor.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> Her things have been some time in readiness. Hearkye, Palaestrio, take some assistants with you to carry to the ship her golden trinkets, her furniture, apparel, all her precious things. All the articles are already packed up which I gave her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> I'll go. <stage>Goes into the house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> Troth now, prithee, do make haste.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> There shall be no delay. Pray, what is it that has been done<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">That has been done</lemma>:  He asks "what has been done with" or "become of," his eye? On which Pleusicles tells him, by way of a quibble, that he has got his eye, alluding to the right one, while the Captain refers to the left, against which the "<foreign lang="la">lectica</foreign>" is placed.</note> with your eye?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> Troth, hut I have my eye. <stage>Points to the right one.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> But the left one I mean.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PLEUSICLES</speaker><p> I'll tell you. On account of the sea, I use this eye less; but if I kept away from the sea<milestone n="1309" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">From the sea</lemma>:  There is a pun here, which cannot be preserved in the translation. "<foreign lang="la">Si abstinuissem a mare</foreign>" "If I kept away from the sea," may also be read, "<foreign lang="la">Si abstinuissem amare</foreign>," "If I refrained from loving." The Captain understands him in the former sense, thinking that he means that he has got a disease in his eye, which may be increased by leading a seafaring life.</note>, I should use the one like the other. But they are detaining me too long.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PALAESTRIO</speaker><p> Consider every now and then how faithful I have been to you. If you do that, then at last you'll know who is honest towards you and who dishonest.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> Be off; I'll be content then, whatever happens.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PYRGOPOLINICES</speaker><p> Before this affair, I had always thought that he was a most rascally servant; still, I find that he is faithful to me.
