<head>THE SUBJECT</head>

<p>THERE were two cousins, citizens of Carthage; the daughters of one of them named Hanno, were stolen in their childhood, and being carried off to Calydon, were there purchased by Lycus, a Procurer. In the same place there is living Agorastocles, the son of the cousin of Hanno, who, having been stolen in his infancy, was sold to a wealthy old man, and finally adopted by him. Here, without knowing their relationship, Agorastocles falls in love with Adelphasium, the elder of the sisters, while Anthemonides, a military officer, entertains a passion for Anterastylis, the younger sister. The Procurer being at enmity with Agorastocles, the latter, with the assistance of his servant Milphio, devises a plan for outwitting him. Collybiscus, the bailiff of Agorastocles, is dressed up as a foreigner, and, a sum of money being given him for the purpose, pretends to take up his abode in the house of Lycus. On this being effected, by previous arrangement Agorastocles comes with witnesses, and accuses the Procurer of harbouring his slave, and encouraging him to rob his master. At this conjuncture, Hanno arrives at Calydon in search of his daughters. He discovers them, and finds that Agorastocles is the son of his deceased cousin. The play ends with the removal of the damsels from the house of Lycus, who is brought to task for his iniquities; and Adelphasium is promised by her father in marriage to Agorastocles.

<sp><speaker>PROLOGUE</speaker>
<p>I HAVE a mind
<note anchored="yes">Title <lemma targOrder="U">The young Carthaginian</lemma>:  Cicero uses the word "P&oelig;nulus," as signifying merely "a Carthaginian." It is difficult to say whether the Play is so styled in reference to Hanno, merely as a citizen of Carthage, or whether the word refers to the young man Agorastocles, in the sense of the "young Carthaginian." From an expression used in the Fifth Act, "a man's great toe," it would appear that Hanno was represented on the stage as a person of diminutive stature; in consequence of which, it has been suggested that the meaning is "the little Carthaginian." Lipsius thinks that this Prologue was not written by Plautus, and indeed some scholars suspect the whole Play to be spurious.</note> to imitate the Achilles of Aristarchus
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Achilles of Aristarchus</lemma>:  Aristarchus was a Tragic Poet, the contemporary of Euripides, and flourished about 250 years before the time of Plautus. His Tragedy of Achilles no longer exists. We are informed by Festus that it was translated into Latin by the Poet Eunius.</note> from that Tragedy I'll take for myself the opening: "Be silent, and hold your tongues, and give attention." The head-manager it is who bids you listen, that with a good grace they may be seated on the benches, both those who have come hungry and those <hi rend="ital">who have come</hi> well filled. You who have eaten, by far the most wisely have you done: you who have not eaten, do you be filled with the Play. But he who has something ready for him to eat, 'tis <hi rend="ital">really</hi> great folly in him, for our sakes, to come here to sit fasting. Rise up, cryer! bespeak attention among the people: I'm now waiting <hi rend="ital">to see</hi> if you know your duty. Exercise your voice, by means of which you subsist and find your clothes; for unless you do cry out, in your silence starvation will be creeping upon you. Well, now sit down again, that you may earn double wages. Heaven grant success<milestone n="16" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Heaven grant success</lemma>:  "Bonum factum est." Literally, "it is a good deed." This was a stated form, placed at the commencement of Roman edicts and proclamations, as ensuring a good omen.</note>! do you obey my commands. Let no worn-out debauchee<milestone n="17" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Worn-out debauchee</lemma>:  "Scortum exoletum." As the word "scortum" may apply to either sex, it is not improbable that this is intended as a notice to the old and battered debauchees, that they are not to take the liberty of occupying the front of the stage, as perhaps, in their effrontery, they had lately been in the habit of doing.</note> be sitting in the front of the stage, nor let the lictor or his rods<milestone n="18" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Or his rods</lemma>:  These "virg&aelig;" were used by the lictors for the purposes of punishment, and if stiff and hard, would be likely to make a noise when struck against any object.</note> be noisy in the least; and let no seat-keeper<milestone n="19" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">No seat-keeper</lemma>:  "Designator." It was the duty of this officer to point out to persons their seats.</note> be walking about before <hi rend="ital">people's</hi> faces, nor be showing any to their seats, while the actor is on the stage. Those who have been sleeping too long at home in idleness, it's right for them now to stand contentedly, or else let them master their drowsiness. Don't let slaves be occupying the seats<milestone n="23" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Occupying the seats</lemma>:  It has been previously remarked that only standing room was provided in the theatres for the slaves.</note>, that there may be room for those who are free; or else let them pay down the money for their places<milestone n="24" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The money for their places</lemma>:  "&AElig;s pro capite." The meaning of this term, as here used, is not exactly known. Some think that it means, that if the slaves want seats, let them pay down money for their freedom, on which they will be entitled to them. It is not improbable that the phase means, "let them pay money for their seats;" and Muretus supposes that the right of letting out certain seats was reserved by the actors as their own perquisite.</note>; if that they cannot do, let them be off home, <hi rend="ital">and</hi> escape a double evil, lest they be variegated both here with scourges, and with thongs at home, if they've not got things in due order when their masters come home. Let nurses keep children, baby-bantlings, at home, and let no one bring them to see the Play; lest both they themselves may be athirst<milestone n="30" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">May be athirst</lemma>:  This is not the only place where Plautus refers to the love which the Roman nurses had for the bottle.</note>, and the children may die with hunger; and that they mayn't be squealing about here, in their hungry fits, just like kids. Let the matrons see the piece in silence, in silence laugh, <hi rend="ital">and</hi> let them refrain from screaming here with their shrill voices; their themes for gossip let them carry off home, so as not to be an annoyance to their husbands both here and at home. And, as regards the managers of the performance, let not the palm <hi rend="ital">of victory</hi> be given to any player wrongfully, nor by reason of favour let any be driven out of doors, in order that the inferior may be preferred to the good ones. And this, too, besides, which I had almost forgotten: while the performance is going on, do you, lacqueys, make an onset on the cookshops; now, while there's an opportunity, now, while the tarts<milestone n="43" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">While the tarts</lemma>:  "Scriblit&aelig;." These were a kind of tarts or cakes which had letters stamped upon them, and were probably so called from <foreign lang="la">scribo</foreign>, "to write."</note> are smoking hot, hasten there. These injunctions, which have been given as the manager's command, Heaven prosper them! troth now, let every one remember for himself. Now, in its turn, I wish to go back to the plot, that you may be equally knowing with myself. Its site, its limits, its boundaries I'll now lay down; for that purpose have I been appointed surveyor. But, unless it's troublesome, I wish to give you the name of this Comedy: but if it is an annoyance, I'll tell you still, since I have leave from those who have the management. This Comedy is called the "Carthaginian<milestone n="53" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The Carthaginian</lemma>:  "Carchedonius," the old Roman name for "Carthaginian," from <foreign lang="greek">*karxhdw\n,</foreign> the Greek for "Carthage."</note>;" in the Latin, Plautus has called it "the Pulse-eating Kinsman<milestone n="54" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Pulse-eating Kinsman</lemma>:  "Patruus pultiphagonides." The Roman "puls," or "pottage," was composed of meat, water, honey, cheese, and eggs. There was a particular sort of "puls," called "puls Punica," or "Punic pottage." As this Play was written at the period of the second Carthaginian war, Plautus would not object to hold their enemies up to contempt as mere "porridge-eaters."</note>." You have the name, then; now hear the rest of the story; for here will this plot be judged of <hi rend="ital">by you.</hi> Its own stage is the <hi rend="ital">proper</hi> place for every plot; you are the critics; I pray you lend attention. There were two cousins-german<milestone n="59" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Two cousins- german</lemma>:  "Fratres fratrueles." "Sons of brothers." This clears up all the confusion that otherwise seems to exist in the Play, by reason of Agorastocles continually calling Hanno his "patruus," which Warner (to avoid confusion, as he says) translates "uncle." It is pretty clear that "patruus" was a term extending not only to uncles, but to other collateral relatives of the father; not only father's brothers, but father's cousins.</note>, Carthaginians, of a very high and very wealthy family. One of them is <hi rend="ital">still</hi> alive, the other's dead. The more confidently do I inform you <hi rend="ital">of this,</hi> because the undertaker<milestone n="62" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The undertaker</lemma>:  "Pollinctor." This was properly the servant of the "libitinarius," or "undertaker." See the Asinaria, l. 916, and the Note.</note> told me so, who anointed him <hi rend="ital">for the pile.</hi> But the only son there was of that old man who died, being separated from his father, was stolen at Carthage when seven years old, six years, in fact, before his father died. When he saw that his only son was lost to him, he himself, from grief, fell sick; he made this cousin-german of his his heir; he himself departed for Acheron without taking leave<milestone n="71" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Without taking leave</lemma>:  "Sine viatico." Literally, "without provisions for the journey." This, probably, simply means that he died suddenly and unexpectedly. Some think that it refers to the ceremony of placing a piece of money in the mouths of the dead, for payment to Charon, on ferrying them over the Styx. If so, the allusion here appears to be very purposeless.</note>. The person who stole the child, carried him off to Calydon, <hi rend="ital">and</hi> sold him here to a certain rich old man for his master, one desirous of children, <hi rend="ital">but</hi> a hater of women. This old man, without knowing it, bought the son of his host, that same child, and adopted him as his own son, and made him his heir when he himself departed this life. This young man is dwelling here in this house. <stage>Pointing to the house of AGORASTOCLES.</stage> Once more do I return to Carthage. If you want to give any commission, or <hi rend="ital">anything</hi> to be managed--unless a person<milestone n="86" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Unless a person</lemma>: --<bibl n="Pl. Poen. prologue.0">Ver. 81-2</bibl>. These two lines also occur almost verbatim in the Men&aelig;chmi, l. 54-5.</note> gives the money, he will be mistaken; but he who does give it will be very much more <hi rend="ital">mistaken.</hi> But this father's cousin of his at Carthage, the old man who is still alive, had two daughters. The one when in her fifth year, the other in her fourth, were lost, together with their nurse, from the walks in the suburbs
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In the suburbs</lemma>:  "Magalia," or "magara," was a name given to the huts or cottages peculiar to the neighbourhood of Carthage. The word, probably, here means a suburb of that city, which received its name from these huts, and was used by the inhabitants as a public walk.</note>. The person who kidnapped them, carried them off to Anactorium<milestone n="87" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Anactorium</lemma>:  This was a town of Acarnania, in Greece.</note>, and sold them all, both nurse and girls, for ready money, to a man (if a Procurer is a man) the most accursed of men, as many as the earth contains; but do you yourselves now form a conjecture what sort of man it is whose name is Lycus<milestone n="92" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Name is Lycus</lemma>:  From the Greek word <foreign lang="greek">luko\s,</foreign> "a wolf."</note>. He removed, not long ago, from Anactorium, where he formerly lived, to Calydon<milestone n="94" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To Calydon</lemma>:  Calydon was a city of &AElig;tolia, which was situate in the centre of Greece.</note> here, for the sake of his business. Be dwells in that house. <stage>Pointing to the house of LYCUS.</stage> This young man is dying distractedly in love with one of them, his kinswoman, not knowing that fact; neither is he aware who she is, nor has he ever touched her (so much does the Procurer hamper him); neither has he hitherto ever had any improper connexion with her, nor <hi rend="ital">ever</hi> taken her <hi rend="ital">home to his house;</hi> nor has that <hi rend="ital">Procurer</hi> been willing to send her <hi rend="ital">there.</hi> Because he sees that he is in love, he wishes to touch <hi rend="ital">this</hi> man for a <hi rend="ital">good</hi> haul. A certain Captain, who is desperately in love with her, is desirous to buy this younger one to be his mistress. But their father, the Carthaginian, since he lost them, has been continually seeking them in every quarter, by sea and land. When he has entered any city, at once he seeks out all the courtesans, wherever each of them is living; he gives <hi rend="ital">her</hi> gold, <hi rend="ital">and</hi> prolongs the night <hi rend="ital">in his enquiries;</hi> after that he asks whence she comes, of what country, whether she was made captive or kidnapped, born of what family, who her parents were. So diligently and so skilfully does he seek for his daughters. He knows all languages, too; but, though he knows them, he pretends not to know them: what need is there of talking? He is a Carthaginian all over<milestone n="113" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A Carthaginian all over</lemma>:  This is intended as a reflection upon the proverbial faithlessness of the Carthaginians. "Punica fides," "Punic faith,' was a common proverb with the Romans.</note>. He, in the evening of yesterday, came into harbour here on board ship. The father of these girls, the same is the father's cousin of this young man. Now d'ye take<milestone n="116" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">D'ye take</lemma>:  There seems to be an equivocal meaning here in the word "tenetis," which may mean either "to understand," or "to take hold with the hand." "Dirumpatis" also may mean either "break off" a rope or cord, or "interrupt." Though Lambinus thinks that some indecent allusion is intended, this much more probable that Scaliger is right in supposing that allusion is made to the boyish diversion of two parties pulling at the ends of a rope till it either breaks, or one side lets go.</note> this? If you do take it, draw it out: take care not to break it asunder; pray, let it proceed. <stage>Moving as if to go.</stage> Dear me! I had almost forgotten to say the rest. He who adopted this <hi rend="ital">young man</hi> as his own son, the same was the guest of that Carthaginian, this <hi rend="ital">old man's</hi> father. He will come here to-day, and discover his daughters here, and this person, his cousin's son, as indeed I've learnt. He, <hi rend="ital">I say,</hi> who'll come to-day, will find his daughters and this his cousin's son. But after this, farewell!--attend; I'm off; I now intend to become another man<milestone n="125" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Become another man</lemma>:  He will go to dress for a part in the Play; that of Agorastocles, as some have suggested.</note>. As to what remains, some others remain who'll explain <hi rend="ital">all to you.</hi> I'll go <hi rend="ital">and</hi> dress. With kindly feelings do you <hi rend="ital">then</hi> recognize me. Farewell! <hi rend="ital">and</hi> give me your aid, that Salvation may prove propitious to you.

<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> My shoulder-blades feel that.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> But I mean with this damsel, my neighbour Adelphasium, the elder Courtesan that belongs to this Procurer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> For my own part, I've heard that from yourself already.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> I'm on the rack with love for her. But than this Procurer Lycus, her master, not dirt <hi rend="ital">itself</hi> is more dirty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Do you wish now to present him with some mischief?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> I should like it. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Why look <hi rend="ital">then,</hi> present him with me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Go and be hanged! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> But tell me seriously, do you wish to present him with a plague?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> I should like it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Well then, present him with this selfsame me; I'd cause him to be having both a mischief and a plague.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> You are joking. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Should you like this very day, without risk to yourself, to make her free<milestone n="164" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To make her free</lemma>:  "Tuam libertam." "Your freed-woman;" you being the one to give her her liberty.</note>?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> I should like it, Milphio.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> I'll manage for you to make her so. You have indoors three hundred golden Philippean pieces<milestone n="166" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Philippean pieces</lemma>:  The Philippean piece had the head of Philip of Macedon on it, and was in value about two guineas of our money.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Six hundred even. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Three hundred are enough.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> To do what <hi rend="ital">with them?</hi></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Hold your peace. This day I'll make you a present of the Procurer, whole, with all his household.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> What to do? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> You shall soon know. Collybiscus, your bailiff, is in the city just now. The Procurer doesn't know him. Do you fully understand?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> I' faith, I understand <hi rend="ital">that;</hi> but what you are driving at I know not.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> You don't know? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Not <hi rend="ital">I,</hi> faith.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> But I'll soon let you know. The gold shall be given him, for him to take to the Procurer, and say that he's a stranger from another city; that he's amorously inclined, and wishes to gratify his inclinations; that he wants free range to be found him, where he may secretly indulge his appetite, so that there may be no overlooker. The Procurer, greedy for the gold, will at once take him into his house; he'll conceal the man and the gold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> The design pleases me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Do you <hi rend="ital">then</hi> enquire of him whether your slave hasn't come to him. He'll think that I am being sought for; immediately he'll say no to you. Have you any doubt but that the Procurer will at once have to double the gold for you, and be <hi rend="ital">considered</hi> to have stolen the man? Neither has he the means of raising it. When he comes to trial, the Pr&aelig;tor will award<milestone n="186" unit="TLN line"/>

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> The design pleases me. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Aye, when I've polished it up, you'll then say so still more even; now it's but in the rough.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> I'm going to the Temple of Venus, unless, Milphio, you wish for anything. It's the Aphrodisia<milestone n="191" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The Aphrodisia</lemma>:  The Aphrodisia were festivals periodically celebrated in honor of Venus or Aphrodite, in most of the towns of Greece. The worshippers were, however, mostly of the class of courtesans.</note> to-day.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> I know.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> I wish to amuse my eyes with the harlot finery.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Let's first proceed to this, the plan we have resolved upon. Let's go in-doors, that we may instruct Collybiscus, the bailiff, how to plant this cheatery.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Although Cupid has the sway in my heart, still I'll listen to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> I'll cause you to be glad it's done. <stage>AGORASTOCLES goes into his house.</stage> There is a speck of love upon this man's breast, which cannot by any means be washed out without great harm; this Lycus, too, the Procurer, is such a wicked person, against whom the engine of mischief is now well aimed, which before long I shall discharge from my battery<milestone n="202" unit="TLN line"/>

<stage>Enter ADELPHASIUM, ANTERASTYLIS, and an ATTENDANT.</stage>
<sp><speaker>ADELPHASIUM</speaker><p> The man who wants to find abundance of employment for himself--a woman and a ship, these two things, let him procure; for no two things do produce more trouble, if, perchance, you begin to equip them; neither are these two things ever equipped enough, nor is the largest amount of equipment sufficient for them. And as I mention these things, from experience at home do I now say thus; for we two, even from daybreak up to the present hour of the day, have never ceased either washing, or scrubbing, or rubbing, or dressing, smoothing, polishing, painting, trimming, with all our might, and at the same time the two maid-servants, that have been provided for each of us, have been giving us their assistance in washing <hi rend="ital">and</hi> cleaning; and in carrying water two men have become quite weary. Fie upon it! how great a plague there is in one female. But if <hi rend="ital">there are</hi> two, I know full well that they are able to give to any one, the mightiest nation whatsoever, more trouble than enough, in being night and day, always, at all hours, dressing, washing, rubbing, polishing. In fine, there's no moderation in women, nor do we understand how ever to set a limit to washing and scrubbing. But she who is washed clean, unless she is thoroughly dressed, in my notion at least, is just as though she were dirty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTERASTYLIS</speaker><p> I really wonder, sister, that you talk in this fashion; you who are so knowing, and discreet, and clever; for when with all care we have ourselves in trim, hardly and with difficulty do we find poor pitiful admirers.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADELPHASIUM</speaker><p> Such is the fact; but still reflect upon this one thing; a limit is best to be observed in all things, sister; all things in excess give too much trouble to mortals of themselves.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTERASTYLIS</speaker><p> Sister, prithee, do reflect that we are accounted just in the same way as pickled salt-fish<milestone n="240" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Pickled salt-fish</lemma>:  "Salsa muriatica." Literally. "the pickle of salt-fish," which is supposed by some to have been the thunny</note> is thought of--without any relish and without sweetness; unless full oft and long it is soaked in water, it smells badly, <hi rend="ital">and</hi> is salt, so that you cannot touch it. Just so are we. Women of this class are utterly tasteless, and devoid of grace, without dress and expense.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. She surely is a cook, Agorastocles, according to my notion; she knows how to soak pickled fish.</p></sp>

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADELPHASIUM</speaker><p> Sister, do, there's a dear, forbear. It's quite sufficient for others to say that to us, not to be ourselves as well proclaiming our foibles.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTERASTYLIS</speaker><p> I'll have done, then.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADELPHASIUM</speaker><p> I thank you: but now answer me this; are all things here which ought to be provided for propitiating the Gods?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTERASTYLIS</speaker><p> I've taken care of everything.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. How charming and joyous a day, and full of delight, worthy of Venus, by my troth, whose Aphrodisia are <hi rend="ital">celebrated</hi> to-day!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Any thanks <hi rend="ital">for me,</hi> for calling you out of doors? Oughtn't I now to be presented with a cask of old wine?

<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. I'll hold my peace.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. If you had held your peace, why then that "I'll hold my peace" would not have been in existence.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTERASTYLIS</speaker><p> Let's go, my sister. <stage>She moves.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADELPHASIUM</speaker><p> How now--why, prithee, are you now hastening that way?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTERASTYLIS</speaker><p> Do you ask me? Because our master is waiting for us at the Temple of Venus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADELPHASIUM</speaker><p> Let him wait, i' faith. Do you stay; there's a crowd just now at the altar.

<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Daubed over with grease</lemma>:  "Sch&oelig;no." This is, by some, thought to have been a rank oil extracted from rushes.

<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Away with you to utter perdition! Do you dare, then, to despise the slaves, you hussey? As if she was a beauty, as if kings were in the habit of making her their choice. A monstrosity of a woman! Diminutive as she is, she does spit out such mighty words--seven nights with whom I wouldn't purchase at a cupful of vapour.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Immortal and omnipotent Divinities, what is there among you more beauteous? What have you that I should deem you more immortal than I am myself. in beholding with my eyes these delights so great? But Venus is not Venus; for my own part, her will I worship as Venus; that she may love me and prove propitious. Milphio!--hallo! Milphio, where are you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. See, here I am with you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. But I want you boiled<milestone n="279" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">I want you boiled</lemma>:  He puns upon the word "assum," which Milphio uses. He intends it to signify "here am I." But as it may also mean the neuter of the participle "assus," "roasted," Agorastocles chooses to take the sentence in the latter sense, as meaning "here I am roasted;" and answers, "I'd rather you were boiled."</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Why really, master, you are making merry.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Why, it was from yourself I learnt all this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. What, even to be in love with her whom you have never touched? Really, that is nonsense.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. I' faith, the Gods as well do I love and fear from whom, nevertheless, I keep off my hands.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTERASTYLIS</speaker><p> Alas! upon my word, when I look at the dress of us both, I'm grieved at the way we are dressed out.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADELPHASIUM</speaker><p> Why really, it's quite in a proper style; for our master's gain and our own we are dressed quite well enough. For no profits can result, if the outlay exceeds them, sister; therefore, that is better to be had which is enough, than that which is more than enough.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. So may the Gods love me, may she love me (I had rather she than the Gods), Milphio; why, this woman has it in her power to force a flint-stone to be in love with her.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Upon my faith, in that you certainly tell no lie, for you are more senseless than a flint-stone to be in love with her.&lt;</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Why really, master, you challenge me at my own game, and <hi rend="ital">still</hi> you make fun of me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTERASTYLIS</speaker><p> At present, sister, I suppose you think yourself quite well enough drest; but when the instances of other courtesans are compared, then you will be having the heartache, if perchance you should see any one more nicely drest.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADELPHASIUM</speaker><p> Envy was never inbred in me, my sister, nor yet spitefulness: I had rather by far that I was adorned with a good disposition than with gold; gold is met with by luck, a good disposition <hi rend="ital">is found</hi> by nature. I very much prefer for myself to be called good than fortunate. It more befits a courtesan to show modesty than purple; and more does it become a courtesan to show modesty than golden <hi rend="ital">jewels.</hi> Evil habits soil a fine dress more than mud; good manners, by their deeds, easily set off a lowly garb.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> <stage>apart to MILPHIO</stage>. How now, you; would you like to play a merry and a frolicsome prank?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. I should like.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ADELPHASIUM</speaker><p> O, there's no need for doing that; those who have faces suited for the night <hi rend="ital">only,</hi> make haste to go and sacrifice by night; before Venus is awake, they are already hurrying with all haste to sacrifice; for if they were to come when Venus is awake, so ugly are they, upon my faith, I do believe they would drive Venus herself away from the Temple.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> You are too warm; really, I said this to you in joke.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> Consider it said in joke as well what we have said to you in answer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Troth now, prithee, do give me this aid of yours <hi rend="ital">like</hi> a fly-boat, not a merchant-ship. Do hobble along at least, for I do not ask you to hurry.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> If you wish to do anything quietly and leisurely, we lend our aid; if you are in a hurry, it would be better for you to hire runners<milestone n="544" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To hire runners</lemma>:  Cursores. See the Notes to the Trinummus, l. 1023.</note> <hi rend="ital">as your</hi> assistants.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> You understand (the matter I've informed you of), that I have need of your assistance with regard to this Procurer, who has so long trifled with me in my amour; that a scheme is to be planned against him about the gold and. my servant.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> All that we know already, if these Spectators know. For the sake of these Spectators it is that this Play is now being acted. 'Twere better for you to inform them, that when you do anything, they may know what it is you are doing. Don't you trouble about us; we know the whole matter; since we all learnt it together in company with yourself, so that we can answer you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Such really is the fact; but come, that I may be sure then that you know it, repeat the matter at length, and tell me what I told you just now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> Are you trying in this way whether we know? Do you suppose we don't remember how you have given three hundred Philippeans to Collybiscus your bailiff, for him to bring here to the Procurer, your enemy, and to pretend that he is a foreigner from a distance, from another city? When he has brought them, you'll go there to seek your servant together with the money.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> You remember it by heart; you have saved me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> He'll be for denying it; he'll suppose your Milphio is being looked for. He'll have to pay double all the money stolen; the Procurer will be adjudged to you. In this matter you wish us to be your witnesses.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> You've got the matter <hi rend="ital">fast.</hi></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> I' faith, hardly with the tips<milestone n="564" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Hardly with the tips</lemma>:  He plays upon the two meanings of "rem"--"the business in hand," or "money" or "property." Agorastocles means it in the former sense, but the assistants take it in the latter, and probably allude to the smallness of their pay.</note> of our fingers, indeed; it is so very small a one.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> This must be done quickly and with expedition. Make as much haste, then, as you can.

<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">You move very well</lemma>:  "Optume itis, pessume--dicitis."

<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Heyday! it's not for you to be angry at what I said in joke. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> Nor for you, indeed, to be speaking ill to your friends in joke.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Drop this. What I want to do, you understand.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> We know full well: to undo the perjured Procurer, it's that you wish.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> You've got the matter right. See, Milphio and the bailiff are opportunely coming out together. He's coming rigged out like a nobleman, and appropriately, for the plot.</p></sp></div1>

<stage>Enter LYCUS, from his house.</stage>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> <stage>speaking to ANTHEMONIDES, <hi rend="ital">within</hi></stage>. I'll return here this moment, Captain. I wish to find us some fitting guests, to join us. Meanwhile, they'll bring the entrails; and at the same time, the women, I suppose, will soon be making their appearance at home after the sacrifice. But why are such a number of people coming this way? I wonder what they are bringing? He, too, in the scarf, that's following at a distance, who is he, I wonder? He is not an &AElig;tolian.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> We greet you, Lycus. Although against our will, we give you this salutation, and although in a very moderate degree do we entertain good wishes for procurers.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> May you all be fortunate--a thing that I know for certain you neither will be, nor will Fortune permit it so to be.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> That is a treasure hoarded in the tongues of fools, to deem it gainful to speak amiss to their superiors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> He who knows not the road by which to arrive at the sea, him it befits to seek a river as his own companion. I know not the way of speaking abusively to you. Now you are the rivers to me; you I'm resolved to follow. If you speak blessings, along your banks I'll follow you; if you utter curses, along your track I'll go.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> To do good to the bad is a danger just as great as to do bad to the good.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> But why? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> You shall learn. If you do any good to the bad, the benefit is lost: if you do any bad to the good, it lasts for a length of time.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> Cleverly said! But what does that matter to me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> Because for the sake of your own well-doing we came hither, although in a very moderate degree do we entertain good wishes for procurers.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> If you bring anything that's good, I give you thanks.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> Of our own, we neither bring nor give you anything that's good, nor do we promise you, nor, in fact, do we wish to give it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> I' faith, I do believe yon; such is your kindly feeling. But what now do you wish?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> <stage>(pointing to COLLYBISCUS)</stage> This person in the scarf, whom you see, with him Mars is angered.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> We are now bringing him here, Lycus, to you, for tearing asunder<milestone n="645" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">For tearing asunder</lemma>:  "Ad diripiendum." This expression is purposely used, as being susceptible of a double meaning. It may either mean "for you to plunder," or "to plunder you." In the use of the word "dirip o," "to tear to pieces," allusion is made to the wolfish name of Lycus.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>COLLYBISCUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside, to himself</stage>. This huntsman, <hi rend="ital">myself,</hi> will be going home to-day with some spoil; the dogs are cleverly driving Lycus into the toils.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> Who is this person? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> We really don't know who he is, except that some time since, after daybreak, when we went down to the harbour, at the same moment we saw him landing from a merchant-ship. Disembarking, he came up to us at once--he saluted us; we answered him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>COLLYBISCUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. The artful fellows! how cleverly they do enter upon the plot!</p>
<p><hi rend="ital">LYC.</hi> What after that? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> Then he joined in discourse with us: he said that he was a foreigner, unacquainted with this city: that he wanted a convenient place to be found here, for him to indulge his appetite. We brought the man to you; if the Gods are favourable to you, it's an opportunity for you to ply your trade.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> Is he eager to that degree?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> He has got gold. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. That booty is mine.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> He wishes to drink <hi rend="ital">and</hi> wench.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> I'll find him a nice place.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> But still he wants to be quite private, in a quiet way, that no persons may know it, and that there may be no overlookers; for he has been a soldier in Sparta, as, indeed, he himself has told us, with King Attalus<milestone n="663" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With King Attalus</lemma>:  This is said merely for its absurdity; as Attalus was king, not of Sparta, but of Pergamus in Asia Minor</note>; from there he fled hither, when the town was surrendered.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> Aye, <hi rend="ital">and,</hi> as he himself has told us, that you may receive him the better, he has brought three hundred Philippean pieces as a provision.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> I'm a king if I can to-day entice this man to my house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> Nay but, he really is your own.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> By my troth, prithee, do persuade him to take up his abode at my house, <hi rend="ital">as</hi> the best lodging.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> It befit us neither to persuade nor to dissuade a person who is a foreigner; you'll transact your own business, if you are prudent. We have brought the ringdove for you, even to the trapping-ground; now it's better for yourself to catch him, if you wish him to be caught. <stage>They move as if going.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> Are you going now?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. At a distance there we shall be witnesses of that.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside, so as to be heard</stage>. The profit comes to me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> I'll speak the fellow fairly. <stage>To COLLYBISCUS.</stage> A stranger salutes a stranger; I'm glad that you have arrived in safety.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>COLLYBISCUS</speaker><p> May the Deities grant you many blessings, since you wish me well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> They say that you are in search of a lodging.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> If the Procurer comes out, do you think I ought to enquire of the fellow whether my slave has come to him or not?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Do you ask? Because a less sum will be named by one hundred pieces.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADVOCATI</speaker><p> You judge rightly. </p></sp>

So may the Gods bless me, I'd rather pass my life either in the stone quarries or at the mill, with my sides hampered with heavy irons, than pass this servitude with a Procurer. What a race this is! What corruptors of men they are! Ye Gods, by our hopes in you, every kind of men you may see there, just as though you had come to Acheron --horse <hi rend="ital">and</hi> foot, a freed-man, a thief, or a runaway, <hi rend="ital">if</hi> you choose, one whipped, chained, <hi rend="ital">or</hi> condemned <hi rend="ital">to slavery.</hi> He who has got <hi rend="ital">money</hi> to pay, whatever sort of person he is--all kinds are taken in; throughout all the house, in consequence, are darkened spots <hi rend="ital">and</hi> hiding-places: drinking <hi rend="ital">and</hi> eating are going on, just as though in a cookshop, <hi rend="ital">and</hi> in no less degree. There may you see epistles written in letters inscribed on pottery<milestone n="837" unit="TLN line"/>

These were stopped tight with wood or cork, made impervious to the atmosphere with pitch (as here mentioned), or with clay, or a composition of gypsum. On the outside the title of the wine was either painted, or inscribed in earthenware letters, which are here alluded to. The date of the vintage was denoted by the names of the Consuls then in office. When the vessels were of glass, small tickets, called "pittacia," were suspended from them stating to a similar effect.</note>, <hi rend="ital">and</hi> sealed with pitch: the names are upon them in letters a cubit long; such a <hi rend="ital">perfect</hi> levy on vintners<milestone n="838" unit="TLN line"/>

<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Upon my faith, it is quite wonderful, if his master doesn't make him his heir; for really, the way he soliloquizes, he's making a speech over him <hi rend="ital">as though</hi> dead and gone.

<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Moves one foot</lemma>:  "Calcem." By some this word is thought to be used for "calculum," a "chessman," and that reference is made to the use of the word "incitas" in the previous line, which was the mate or backgammon in the game of "duodecim scripta" (somewhat similar to our game of backgammon) and in which " calculi," "pieces" or "chessmen," were used</note>; 'tis so contrived <hi rend="ital">already.</hi></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> On the contrary, upon my faith, I'll cause you to be a free man with myself, if the Gods are willing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SYNCERASTUS</speaker><p> May the Gods grant it so! Do you detain me for anything else, Milphio?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Fare you well, and may happiness attend you.</p></sp>

The immortal Gods do will my master to be preserved, and this Procurer utterly ruined; a mischief so great is impending upon him. Is it not the fact, before one weapon has been launched, then another presses upon him? I'll go in-doors, that I may recount these matters to my master. For if I were to call him out hither before the house, and, what you've <stage>to the AUDIENCE</stage> just heard, if I were now here to repeat the same, it would be folly. I'd rather in-doors be an annoyance to my master singly, than be <hi rend="ital">so</hi> here to all of you. Immortal Gods, what misfortunes, what great calamities do this day await this Procurer. But now there's no reason why I should delay. This business is resolved upon; no pausing is allowed; for both this must be cleverly managed, which has just now been entrusted to me, and that plan as well which was formed at home must be attended to. If there's any delay, he who sends me a heavy mischance will be acting rightly. Now I'll off in-doors; until my master comes from the Forum, I'll wait at home. <stage>Goes into the house of AGORASTOCLES.</stage>

<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. Hyth alonim
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Hyth alonim</lemma>:  These eighteen lines (or, at least, the first ten) are in Punic, the native language of Hanno. The following is the meaning of them, as given by Plautus in the next eleven lines: "I worship the Gods and Goddesses who preside over this city, that I may have come hither with good omen as to this business of mine, on which I have come; and, <hi rend="ital">ye</hi> Gods, <hi rend="ital">lend</hi> me your aid, that you may permit me to find my daughters and the son of my cousin; <hi rend="ital">those</hi> who were stolen away from me, and his son from my cousin. But here lived formerly my guest Antidamas. They say that he has done that which he was doomed to do. They say that his son Agorastocles lives here. To him am I carrying with me this token of hospitality. He has been pointed as living in this neighbourhood. I'll make enquiry of these who are coming hither out of doors." The learned Bochart, in his Phaleg, considers that the first ten lines are Punic, and that the other eight are, possibly, Lybic, of which the sense had been previously given in Punic; and, in fact, he quite despaired of translating them His translation of the first ten very nearly agrees with that given by Plautus himself. Samuel Petit, in his Miscellanea, considers the whole to be Hebrew, and translates his version (which consists of sixteen lines) as follows: 1. Give ear and attend, O Gods and Goddesses, under whose protection are the men of this city. 2. Receive as acceptable my prayers and my integrity. TwO daughters did I beget, my strength. 3. Urged on by fate, I caused them on each feast-day of the Gods to go to the gardens. 4. With much rejoicing, and on the day of song, there was a void. 5. The girls, being stolen, forsook me. Whither shall I go, pacing all chambers? 6. Where is he who bore them away? that I may remove the helplessness of my sorrow which he produces for me like fruit, in being the father of, and rearing, children. 7. They have said that here, assuredly, Agorastocles lives. 8. I have a token of hospitality, the likeness of Saturn (I'm carrying it), 9. Between us. May there be some end for my journey, that rest at last may be afforded to my integrity. 10. So that alone and wretched and afflicted I may not wander to and fro but rather that I may meet with my children, and pay my vows and oblations 11. To the Gods and Goddesses whom I've invoked as my advisers and assistants, 12. To purify my house from the griefs with which I was affected when I praised them. But they heard not my words, and I am most afflicted and am despondent in mind. 13. O my hope, come hither, and whatever troubles await me, cause me to endure them. Take courage from the truth of oracles, and of the responses of the God <foreign lang="greek">Ta=v,</foreign> from divinations, and forewarnings, and prodigies. 14. Be thou speedily fulfilled; arouse thyself and pray. Would that they could hear: grief would depart from a devout parent, and I should recognize Aristocles, my brother's son. 15. Attentively hear this lamentation, O God, my power, make haste to the truth of thy promise of my exaltation, O God, and my evil odours shall cease. 16. Lo!  from henceforth will I to the best of my means show honor, sacrificing spelt to all the Gods, and singing praises!!!</note> vualonuth sicorathi si ma com sith, Chi mach chumyth mumys tyal mictibariim ischi, Lipho canet luth bynuthi ad &aelig;din bynuthii.

<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> I do say so; and if you were willing to act wisely, you'd at once assert their liberty by an action on their freedom. For it's a disgrace to you for you to allow your own country-people to be slaves before your eyes, who were free women at home.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> <stage>overhearing, apart</stage>. O ye immortal Gods, I do entreat your aid! What speech is this that my ears devour!

<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> If you've got witnesses of this matter, I'll do as you bid me.</p></sp>

Is he from the baths<milestone n="976" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">From the baths</lemma>:  He alludes to the practice of thieves making off with the cloaks of persons while bathing at the public baths.</note>, I wonder, enveloped in his cloak? I' faith, the countenance is surely Carthaginian. The man's a Gugga<milestone n="977" unit="TLN line"/>

<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Don't you see the fellows following, loaded with luggage? And, as I fancy, they've got no fingers on their hands.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Why so?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Why, because they go with their rings in their ears<milestone n="981" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Rings in their ears</lemma>:  The Carthaginians, no doubt, borrowed this custom from the Syrians and Ph&oelig;nicians, with whom, as also with the Jews, it was prevalent.</note>. I'll approach them, and address them in the Punic language: if they answer, I'll continue to speak in the Punic tongue if not, then I'll adapt my language to their usage. How say you, do you still remember anything of the Punic language?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Nothing at all, i' faith; for tell me, how could I know, who was but six years old when I was stolen away from Carthage?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. O ye immortal Gods! very many freeborn children have been lost from Carthage after this manner.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> What do you want?</p></sp>

<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Avo</lemma>:  "Hail."Milphio's knowledge of the Punic dialect was probably but limited, though in the sequel it appears that he does know something of it. The translation of these Punic expressions is from Warner's Translation, where the Punic is given in a form somewhat different from that found in the modern editions of the text.</note>  Of what country are you, or from what city?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> Hanno Muthumballe bacha&euml;dreanech.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> He intends to present you with some " donation" out of this; what, I don't know. Don't you hear him promise?

<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Mehar bocca</lemma>:  This passage has been rendered, "Oh! what a son of tears!" Milphio says he is talking about his "bucca," or "cheek," being in pain. An attempt has been made in the Translation to preserve in some slight degree the resemblance.</note>! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Be that for yourself rather than me!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> What does he say? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> He declares that his "box" for his teeth is painful. Perhaps he takes us to be doctors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> If it is so, tell him that we are not; I don't wish a stranger to be mistaken.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> <stage>to HANNO</stage>. You who have got no girdle<milestone n="1008" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Got no girdle</lemma>:  The Carthaginian tunic flowed loose, and was not fastened with a girdle. Milphio perhaps alludes to his being without a purse, which was generally supported by the girdle, and without which he might think that a stranger had no business in such a wealthy city as Calydon.</note>, why have you come to this city, or what is it you seek?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> Muphursa<milestone n="1010" unit="TLN line"/>

<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Moin lechianna</lemma>:  I beg an entrance for Saturn. Milphio plays upon the very slight resemblance of "muphursa" to "mures," "mice." Under the name of "African mice," he probably alludes to "panthers" or "leopards," which had perhaps been recently shown by the &AElig;diles, for the first time.</note>. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Why has he come?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Don't you hear? He declares that he is wishful to give African mice to the &AElig;diles as a show at the games.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> Lalech lachananim liminichot<milestone n="1013" unit="TLN line"/>

<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> He says he has brought latchets, water- channels<milestone n="1014" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Latchets, water-channels</lemma>:  Milphio plays upon the resemblance of the words "lalech lachananim," to "ligulos canales," which (if the reading is correct) will mean shoestrings and water-pipes--perfect nousense.</note>, and nuts; he's now begging that you'll lend him your assistance in having them sold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> He is a merchant, I suppose?

<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> What <hi rend="ital">is</hi> that to me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> He wishes you to be informed <hi rend="ital">of it,</hi> so that you mayn't suppose that he has taken anything secretly <hi rend="ital">and</hi> by stealth. He has really, I do believe, been sent here to your harvesting.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> Muphonium sucoraim<milestone n="1023" unit="TLN line"/>

<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> So there! do take care, please, how you do what he's begging of you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> What is he saying, or what is he begging? Explain it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> For you to order him to be placed beneath a hurdle<milestone n="1025" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Beneath a hurdle</lemma>:  Milphio says he is speaking of "crates," "a hurdle." This mode of stoning to death was practised among the Carthaginians.</note>, and for many stones to be heaped upon it, so as to put him to death.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> Gunebel balsamen ierasan!</p></sp>

But that you may know, now from this moment henceforth will I speak Latin. <stage>To MILPHIO.</stage> Upon my faith, you must be a worthless and bad servant, to be laughing at a person, a foreigner and a stranger.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> But, i' faith, at yourself a person that's both a swindler and a cheat, who have come here to take us in, you half-and-half Lybian, you double-tongue, just like a crawling reptile.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> <stage>to MILPHIO</stage>. Away hence with your abusiveness! do restrain your tongue. You'll keep it from uttering abuse, if you are prudent; I don't want you to be speaking harshly to my kinsmen. I was born at Carthage; do you remember that.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> O my fellow-countryman, greetings to you!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Now I adopt this plan, and prepare this contrivance, that we should. cite you; you are to affirm that they are your daughters, and that they were stolen when little from Carthage, and to maintain the cause of both in an action on their freedom, as though they were both your own daughters. Do you understand?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> On my faith, I do understand; for I likewise did have two daughters who were stolen away when little children, together with their nurse.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MILPHIO</speaker><p> Upon my word, you do feign it cleverly. At the very commencement this amuses me.</p></sp>

<stage>Enter ADELPHASIUM and ANTERBASTYLIS, from the Temple of Venus.</stage>
<sp><speaker>ADELPHASIUM</speaker><p> 'Twas worth the while, to-day, of him who has a taste for loveliness to afford a feast to his eyes, in coming hither to the Temple this day to see the sights. Upon my faith, I was charmed there to-day with the most elegant offerings of the courtesans, worthy of Venus, the most handsome Goddess; nor did I despise her worship this day; so great an abundance of beauteous objects was there there, each nicely arranged in its own place. The odours of Arabia and of myrrh filled everything. The festive day seemed to be affected with no gloom, Venus, nor did thy Temple; so great a throng of her dependants was there, who had come to Venus of Calydon.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTERASTYLIS</speaker><p> But certainly, as far indeed as regarded us two, sister, we were all-powerful <hi rend="ital">in our prayers,</hi> beauteous and gainers of her favour; neither were we there held in ridicule by the young men, which, i' faith, sister, happened to all the rest.</p></sp>

<stage>Enter ANTHEMONIDES, from the house of LYCUS.</stage>
<sp><speaker>ANTHEMONIDES</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. If I don't take full revenge for that mina which I gave to the Procurer, then really may the townspeople make a butt of me! This most rascally fellow even brought me to his house to breakfast. He himself went away out of doors, <hi rend="ital">and</hi> left me as his chamberlain<milestone n="1301" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">As his chamberlain</lemma>:  "Atriensi." The duties of this domestic are fully referred to in the Notes to the Asinaria.</note> in the house. When neither the Procurer nor these women came back, nor anything was given me to eat, for the best part of the breakfast I took a pledge<milestone n="1303" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">I took a pledge</lemma>:  It is
 not quite clear what he refers to, but he probably means to say that he has laid hold of something valuable in the Procurer's house, which will, at all events, procure a substitute in part for the prandium out of which he has been cheated</note>, <hi rend="ital">and</hi> came out of doors. This way I'll pay him. I'll touch up the rascally Procurer in the military way of payment<milestone n="1304" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Military way of payment</lemma>:  By the mention of "&aelig;s militare," some Commentators think that he alludes to his sword, and draws it. He seems to refer, however, to the stipend which the soldiers receive for their services, with full liberty to lay their hands on anything that belongs to the enemy.</note>. He did get hold of a person for him to bamboozle out of a mina of silver! But I wish that my mistress would now come in my way while <hi rend="ital">thus</hi> enraged. Then, by my troth, with my fists I'd make her <hi rend="ital">quite</hi> black all over; I'd cover her so with swarthiness, that she should be much more swarthy than the Egyptians, or <hi rend="ital">than those</hi> who carry the buckets<milestone n="1309" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Carry the buckets</lemma>:  He alludes to the slaves whose duty it was to hold the buckets to the horses in the Circus for them to drink from. Exposure to sun and dust would tend to render them swarthy.</note> at the games in the Circus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ADELPHASIUM</speaker><p> <stage>running to AGORASTOCLES</stage>. Do hold me fast, please, my love; I sadly fear the kites; this is an evil animal--lest perchance he may carry me off, your chick.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTERASTYLIS</speaker><p> <stage>embracing her FATHER</stage>. I cannot clasp you fast enough, my father!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTHEMONIDES</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. I'm delaying. <stage>Looking in his hand.</stage> I can now pretty nearly cater a breakfast for myself with this. <stage>Raising his eyes.</stage> But what's this? How's this? What's this? What's this I see? How now? What means this strange conjunction? What's this coupling together? Who's this fellow with the long skirts, just like a tavern-boy? Do I quite see with my eyes? Isn't this my mistress, Anterastylis? Why, surely it is she. For some time past I've perceived that I'm set at nought. Isn't the girl ashamed to be hugging a tawny fellow in the middle of the street? I faith, I shall give him up forthwith to the executioner to be tortured all over. Surely this is a womanish race<milestone n="1321" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A womanish race</lemma>:  "Muliersous" generally means "fond of women." It clearly however, in this passage means "womanish," or "womanlike."</note>, with their tunics hanging down to their heels. But I'm determined to accost this African female lover. <stage>To HANNO.</stage> Hallo! you woman, I say, are you not ashamed? What business have you with her, pray? Tell me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> Young man, greetings to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTHEMONIDES</speaker><p> I don't want <hi rend="ital">them;</hi> that's nothing to you. What business have you to touch her with a finger?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> Because I choose. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTHEMONIDES</speaker><p> You choose?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> I say so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTHEMONIDES</speaker><p> Away to utter perdition, you shoe-latchet! What, do you dare to be <hi rend="ital">acting</hi> the lover here, you great toe of a man<milestone n="1328" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">You great toe of a man</lemma>:  From this expression it has been conjectured that Hanno was a man of diminutive stature, and that the Play took its name of P&oelig;nulus, "the little Carthaginian," from that circumstance.</note>, or to be meddling with an object which masculine men are fond of, you skinnea pilchard, you <hi rend="ital">deformed image of</hi> Serapis<milestone n="1330" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Of Serapis</lemma>:  It is not fully known what the meaning of "Sarapis" is, as it occurs nowhere else. It has been conjectured, that, owing to the African features of Hanno, the Captain compares him to the little ugly images of Serapis, which were carried about in harvest-time by the priests of that God, for the purpose of collecting money.</note>, you half-apron, you sheepskin-jacket<milestone n="1331" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">You sheepskin-jacket</lemma>:  This garment, being worn with the wool on, was remarkable for its offensive smell. "Halagoras hama" is supposed to mean the pots of common sea-salt exposed for sale in the market-place.</note>, you pot of <hi rend="ital">stinking</hi> sea-salt; more crammed, too, to boot, with leeks and garlick than the Roman rowers?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Young man, do your jaws or <hi rend="ital">your</hi> teeth itch, that you are annoying this person, or are you in search of a heavy mishap?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTHEMONIDES</speaker><p> Why didn't you use a drum<milestone n="1335" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Use a drum</lemma>:  The priests of Cybele, who were either eunuchs, or persons of effeminate and worthless character, walked in their processions beating a "tympanum." a "drum" or "tambourine." The Captain, by his question, contemptuously implies that Agorastocles is such a character. See the Truer lentus, l. 608, and the Note.</note> while you were saying that? For I take you to be more of an effeminate wretch than a <hi rend="ital">real</hi> man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Do you understand what sort of effeminate wretch I am? <stage>Calling aloud.</stage> Servants, come out of doors, bring out some cudgels!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTHEMONIDES</speaker><p> Hark you, if I have said anything in a joke, don't you be for taking it seriously.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTERASTYLIS</speaker><p> Prithee, what pleasure have you, Anthemonides, in speaking rudely to our kinsman and father? For this is our father; he has just now recognized us, and him <hi rend="ital">as</hi> the son of his cousin.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTHEMONIDES</speaker><p> So may Jupiter kindly bless me, I heartily rejoice that it is so, and I am delighted, if, in fact, any great misfortune befalls this Procurer, and since a fortune awaits you equal to your merits.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTERASTYLIS</speaker><p> I' faith, he says what's worthy of belief; do believe him, my father. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> I do believe him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> And I believe him. But look <stage>pointing</stage>, I espy the Procurer Lycus, the worthy fellow; look, there he is--he's betaking himself homeward.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> Who is this?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> He's which you please, both the Procurer and Lycus. He has been keeping your daughters in servitude, and from myself he has stolen some gold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> A pretty fellow for you to be acquainted with!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Let's bring him to justice.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> By no means. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> For what reason?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> Because 'twere better for an action of damages to be brought against him<milestone n="1356" unit="TLN line"/>
<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Action of damages to be brought against him</lemma>:  "Multum dici" has been adopted as the reading, in preference to "multo induci," which seems capable of no translation consistently with sense. The passage may possbly mean that he prefers an action at law to summary proceedings.</note>.</p></sp></div1>

<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> <stage>stepping forward</stage>. Procurer, let's away to the court of justice.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> I do entreat you, Agorastocles, that I may be at liberty to hang myself.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LYCUS</speaker><p> But what have you to do with me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> <stage>pointing at his DAUGHTERS</stage>. Because I affirm that both of these are my daughters, free women, and free by birth, who, when little, were kidnapped together with their nurse.</p></sp>

<note anchored="yes">Many of the ancient MSS. contain this additional Scene, which is generally supposed not to have been the composition of Plautus.

<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> What is it you are about, Captain? Why does it please you to speak rudely to my relative? Don't be surprised that the damsels do follow after him; he has just now discovered that both of them are his own daughters.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> They are Carthaginians.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>HANNO</speaker><p> A pretty fellow for you to be acquainted with!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> Procurer, I always deemed you to be avaricious, but they know you to be a thief as well, who know more of you.</p></sp>

Indeed, already did I know them to be free women, and was waiting for some one to claim their freedom, for really they are none of mine. Then besides, I'll restore your gold that I've got in my house, and I'll make oath that I have done nothing, Agorastocles, with ill intent.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AGORASTOCLES</speaker><p> As it's right for me to do, I shall still consult my own notions. Let go of my knees.</p></sp>
