<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>

<p>The plot of this Play is of an involved nature. Periphanes, an aged Athenian, has a son, born in wedlock, named Stratippocles. By Philippa, a woman of Epidaurus, whom he has formerly seduced, he has had a daughter, named Telestis who has been residing with her mother at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. A war arising between the Athenians and Thebans, Stratippocles, on setting out for the army, commissions Epidicus, his father's servant, to purchase for him Acropolistis, a music-girl, of whom lie is enamoured. Epidicns, on this, persuades Periphanes that this girl is really his daughter by Philippa, whom he has not seen for many years, and that she has been taken captive at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, and brought to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. On this the old man gives Epidicus the requisite sum, and she is brought home and introduced to him as his daughter Telestis. In the meantime, Stratippocles meets with another damsel who has been taken captive, and agrees with a Banker to borrow forty mince, for the purpose of purchasing her. He returns to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and resolves not to meet his father until he has paid the money to the Banker and gained possession of the damsel, and Epidicus is threatened by him with a severe punishment, if he does not manage to raise the sum required. On this he accosts his aged master, and tells him that he must find a wife for his son, who is about to purchase a singing-girl of the name of Acropolistis. The old man is persuaded to give a sum of money to Epidicus for the purpose of buying Acropolistis, that she may be kept out of the way of his son. On receiving the money, Epidicus hands it over to Stratippocles, to be paid to the Banker. The old gentleman having that morning ordered a singing-girl to be hired to perform at a sacrifice at his house, she is brought to him as Acropolistis, having been instructed how to play her part. A Captain, who admires Acropolistis, having heard that Periphanes has purchased her, applies to him, and offers to give him a profit of ten min&aelig; if he will transfer her to him. Periphanes, thereupon, brings to him the music-girl who is assuming that character (while the real Acropolistis is taken for his daughter), on which the Captain discovers the deception, and Periphanes finds out that the girl is already free, and has been only brought to his house to perform at the sacrifice. At this conjuncture Philippa arrives, having heard that her daughter has been brought to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. Periphanes meets her, and assures her that her daughter is safe at his house. On this, Philippa is introduced to Acropolistis, and declares that she is not her daughter, and that Periphanes has been imposed upon. On being questioned,Acropolistis confesses that she has only called Periphanes her father because lie has called her his daughter. Epidicus, on being discovered to be guilty of this second fraud upon his master, is greatly alarmed; but just then he perceives the Banker, who has come for the money, leading the Theban captive. He immediately recognizes her as Telestis, the real daughter of Periphanes and Philippa, Stratippocles, somewhat to his sorrow, is informed that the captive is his half-sister, and therefore, most probably, consoles himself with Acropolistis. For making this discovery, Epidicus is not only pardoned by Periphanes, but receives his freedom.

<head>THE ACROSTIC ARGUMENT.<note anchored="yes" place="inline">[Supposed to have been written by Priscian the Grammarian.]</note></head>
<p>An old gentleman, thinking her his daughter, purchases (<foreign lang="la">Emit</foreign>) a music-girl, by the advice (<foreign lang="la">Persuasu</foreign>) of his servant, who, a second time (<foreign lang="la">Iterum</foreign>), substitutes for him, in place of <foreign lang="la">his son's</foreign> mistress, another one hired; he gives (<foreign lang="la">Dat</foreign>) to his master's son the money; with it the young man, not knowing it (<foreign lang="la">Imprudens</foreign>), purchases his sister. Soon afterwards, by the aid of a woman whom he has seduced, and of a Captain, the old man understands (<foreign lang="la">Cognoscit</foreign>) that he has been imposed upon, as (<foreign lang="la">Ut</foreign>) the one is in search of his mistress, the other of her daughter.

It will be seen that a fortunate discovery really does take place in the Fifth Act, where Periphanes not only finds his long-lost daughter, but Stratippocles is prevented from unknowingly being guilty of incest. That Plautus thought very highly of this Play, is evident from what is said in the Bacchides, l. 215, where Chrysalus is introduced as saying that he "loves the Epidicus as well as his own self."</note></stage>

<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> I'm less of a pilferer now than formerly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> I rob above-board<milestone n="10" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">I rob above- board</lemma>:  It has been suggested that this is an imitation of a passage in Aristophanes, Act II., Sc. 3, where Blepsidemus says, "<foreign lang="greek">ou)  keklofa/s a)/ll' h(/rpakas.</foreign>" "You have not pilfered, but plundered." The thought, however, is quite natural, without resorting to a previous author for it.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> May the immortal Gods confound you, with what huge strides you do walk! for when I caught sight of you at the harbour, I began to run at a rapid pace; I was hardly able to overtake you just now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> You are a town wit. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> I know that you, on the other hand, are a military gentleman.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> How say you? Have you been well all along?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> What do you wish me to tell you but that which is fact?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Stout as a boxer and an athlete.

<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> You've brought me joyous tidings on your arrival. But where is he?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> I came here together with him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Where is he then? Unless, perchance, you've brought him in your wallet, or, perhaps, in your knapsack.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> May the Gods confound you!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> I want to make enquiries of you. Lend me your attention; attention shall be lent you in return.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> You say what's law<milestone n="23" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">What's law</lemma>:  The words "operam da" and "operam dabo," used by Epidicus, were terms used in the Roman courts of law: therefore Thesprio says, "jus dicis," meaning, "you talk like a judge."</note>. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> It becomes me to do so.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> But still, Epidicus, one thing is wanting for your Pr&aelig;torship.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> What, pray? </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> <stage>shaking his fist at him</stage>. Woe unto you! But how say you----? THES. What is it you ask?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> I' faith, they've gone over to the enemy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> What, his arms? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Aye, and quickly too.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Do you say that seriously?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Seriously I say it; the enemy have got them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> By my troth, a disgraceful affair.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Still, before now, other persons have done the same. This affair will turn out to his honor<milestone n="31" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Will turn out to his honor</lemma>:  Schmieder thinks that in these words there is a covert allusion to the conduct of Terentius Varro, by whose bad management the Romans lost the battle of Cann&aelig;, when fighting against Hannibal. The Senate, however, received him with open arms, "because he had not despaired of the state."</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Because it has been so to others before.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Mulciber, I suppose, made the arms which Stratippocles had; they flew over to the enemy<milestone n="32" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Flew over to the enemy</lemma>:  Plautus seems here to fancy that the arms made by Mulciber or Vulcan, for Achilles, were taken by Hector from Patroclus, when, in fact, they were made at the request of Thetis, for the purpose of avenging his death. He probably did not care to represent a slave and A camp-follower as being particularly correct in their knowledge of Homer.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Why, then, e'en let this son of Thetis lose them; the daughters of Nereus will bring him others.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Only this must be looked to, that material may be found for the armourers, if in each campaign he yields a spoil to the enemy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Have done now with these matters.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> You yourself make an end of them when you please.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Cease your enquiries then. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Say, where is Stratippocles himself?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> There is a reason, for which reason he has been afraid to come together with me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Pray, what is it? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> He doesn't wish to see his father as yet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> For what reason? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> You shall hear; because he has purchased out of the spoil a young female captive of charming and genteel figure.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> What is it I hear from you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> That which I'm telling you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Why has he purchased her?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> To please his fancy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> How many fancies has this man? For assuredly, before he went away from home to the army, he himself commissioned me, that a music-girl whom he was in love with should be purchased of a Procurer for him. That I have managed to accomplish for him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Whichever way the wind is at sea, Epidicus, in that direction the sail is shifted.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Woe unto wretched me! He has utterly undone me!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> What's the meaning of this? What's the matter, pray?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Well now--she whom he has bought, at what sum has he purchased her?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> A very little. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> That I don't ask you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> What then? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> For how many min&aelig;?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> <stage>holding up all his fingers four times</stage>. For so many.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Forty min&aelig;? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> For that purpose, he borrowed the money on interest of a Banker at Thebes, at a didrachm for each silver mina per day.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Surprising!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> This Banker, too, has come together with him, and is dunning for his money.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Immortal Gods! now I'm fairly done for!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Why so, or.what's the matter, Epidicus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> He has proved my ruin!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Who?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Who? He who lost his arms.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> But why so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Because he himself was every day sending me letters from the army--but I shall hold my tongue; it's best to do so. It's best for a man in servitude to know more than he says; that's true wisdom.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> On my faith, I don't understand why you are alarmed. You are frightened, Epidicus; I see it by your countenance. You seem here, in my absence, to have got into some scrape or other.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Can't you cease annoying me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> I'll be off. <stage>Moves as if going.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Stand still; I'll not let you go from here. <stage>Holds him.</stage> THES. Why do you hold me back?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Is he in love with her whom he has purchased out of the spoil?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Do you ask me? He dotes to death upon her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> The hide will be stripped from off my back.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> He loves her, too, more than ever he loved you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> May Jupiter confound you!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Let me go now; for he has forbidden me to go to our house; he ordered me to come here <stage>pointing to the house</stage> to our neighbour's, Ch&aelig;ribulus; there he bade me wait; he's about to come there himself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Why so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> I'll tell you; because he doesn't wish to meet with or see his father, before he has paid down this money which is owing for her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> O dear! an involved business, i' faith.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> Do let go of me, that I may now be off forthwith.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> When the old gentleman knows this, our ship will fairly founder.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THESPRIO</speaker><p> What matters it to me in what way you come to your end?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Because I don't wish to perish alone; I'd like you to perish with me, well-wisher with well-wisher.</p></sp>

Unless you have some resources in your own self, you are done for. Ruination so great is impending over you--unless you support yourself stoutly, you cannot hold up; to such a degree are mountains of misfortune threatening to tumble on you. Neither does any plan just now please me by means of which to find myself disengaged from my entanglement. To my misfortune, by my trickeries I have forced the old man to imagine that he was making purchase of his own daughter; whereas he has bought for his own son a music-girl whom he was fond of, and whom on his departure he commissioned me about. He now, to please his fancy, has brought another one from the army. I've lost my hide, for when the old man finds out that he has been played tricks with, he'll be flaying my back with twigs. But still, do you take all precautions. <stage>He stands still and thinKs.</stage> That's of no use! clearly this head of mine is addled! You are a worthless fellow, Epidicus. <stage>In another tone.</stage> What pleasure have you in being abusive? Because you are forsaking yourself. What am I to do? Do you ask me the question? Why you yourself, in former days, were wont to lend advice to others. Well, well; something must be found out. But why delay to go meet the young man, that I may know how the matter stands? And here he is himself. He is in a grave mood. He's coming with Ch&aelig;ribulus, his year's-mate. I'll step aside here, whence at my leisure I'll follow their discourse. <stage>He steps aside.</stage>

<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Then, filly as many of the courtesans as there are in the whole city were going decked out each to meet her lover; they were going to trap them; that's the fact, inasmuch as I gave especial attention to it; several of these had with them nets beneath their garments.

<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> What was she drest in? Was it a royal robe, or was it a plain dress?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> A skylight one<milestone n="221" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A skylight one</lemma>:  "Impluviatam." Echard's Note to this passage is much to the purpose. "The word 'impluvium' signifies a square open place which the Romans had in their houses to receive rain for their use; or a square courtyard, that received the rain at four water-spouts; from whence a habit they had, made with four sides or four pieces, was called 'vestimentum impluviatum.' Here Epidicus takes occasion from this to admire at a woman's being able to wear a courtyard on her back. Periphanes, carrying on the humour, tells him 'tis no wonder, since they frequently wear whole houses and lands, meaning the value of them." The word "impluvium" has been previously rendered "skylight," in the present Translation. See the Notes to the Miles Gloriosus, l. 159, where Periplecomenus complains of Sceledrus looking down his "impluvium" from the top of the house. The garment may, however, not improbably have been called "impluviatum," from its being of a greyish, or rain colour.</note>, according as these women coin names for garments.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> What! was she dressed in a skylight?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> What's there wonderful in that? As though many women didn't go through the streets decked out with farms upon them.

Why, what new names every year these women are finding for their clothing--the thin tunic, the thick tunic, your fulled linen cloth, chemises, bordered shifts' the marigold or saffron-coloured dress, the under-petticoat or else the light vermilion dress, the hood, the royal or the foreign robe, the wave pattern<milestone n="230" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The wave pattern</lemma>:  "Cumatile," from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">ku=ma,</foreign> "a wave." These dresses were so called, probably, from their being undulated, or, as we call it, "watered." Ovid, in the Art of Love, B. 8, l. 177, speaks of dresses called "undulat&aelig;," "resembling the waves;" as also does Varro. Some Commentators think that "undulat&aelig;" means "sea-green," and Schmieder takes "cumatile" to mean the same. From its juxtaposition with "plumatile," "feather-pattern," it would seem that the pattern rather than the colour is alluded to. "Plumatile" is considered by some simply to mean embroidered; and "plumata" is clearly used in that sense by Lucan in the Pharsalia, B. 10, l. 125. For a list of the Roman ladies' dresses, see the Aulularia, l. 463, et seq.</note> or the feather-pattern, the wax or the apple-tint. The greatest nonsense! From dogs, too, do they even take the names.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> They call one the Laconian<milestone n="231" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The Laconian</lemma>:  Probably the garments had their name from their resemblance to the colour of this breed of dogs. They were imported from Laconia, and hence called "Laconici." From an expression in the Epodes of Horace, Ode VI., l. 5-6, they appear to have been used as shepherds' dogs; but Warner in a Note to his Translation, supposes them to have been of the greyhound species, So, in Shakspeare's Midsummer Night's Dream. <bibl n="Shak.

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> But do you say on as you commenced.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Two other women behind me began to speak thus between themselves; I, like my wont, went away a little distance from them; I pretended that I wasn't attending to their talk: I didn't quite hear all, and still I wasn't deceived in a word they said.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> I long to hear it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Then one of them said to the other with whom she was talking----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> What?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Be quiet then, that you may hear. After they had caught sight of her whom your son is dying for: "Prithee, how happily and luckily has it befallen that woman for her lover to be wishing to set her free." "Who is he?" said the other. She mentioned Stratippocles.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> Troth now, I'm undone; what is it I hear of you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> That which really took place. After this, I myself, when I heard them talking, began again to draw closer towards them little by little, as though the crowd of people was pushing me, whether I would or no.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> I understand. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Then the one asked the other, "How do you know?" "Why, because a letter has been brought her to-day from Stratippocles; that he has borrowed money on interest from a banker at Thebes; that it is ready, and he himself has brought it for that purpose."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> Tell on--I'm undone!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> She said that she had heard so from her and from the letter which she had seen.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> What am I to do now? I ask your advice, Ap&aelig;cides.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>APAECIDES</speaker><p> Let us find some clever, useful expedient; for he, indeed, will either be here just now, or is here already.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> If it were right for me to be wiser than you, I could give you some good advice, which you will praise, I fancy, both of you----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> Then where is it, Epidicus?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> But you'll laugh at me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>APAECIDES</speaker><p> On my word, we will not do so.

<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> I am ready to do anything, so long only as this may be brought about</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Well then, now there's an opportunity of doing so, before he comes into the city, as to-morrow he will be here; to-day he will not have come.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> How do you know?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> I do know, because another person told me, who came from there, that he would be here in the morning.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> Then say you what we are to do.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> I'm of opinion that you ought to do thus: you must pretend as though you were desirous to give her liberty to the music-girl for your own whim, and as though you were violently in love with her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> To what advantage does that tend?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Do you ask that? Why, that you may purchase her beforehand with money, before your son comes, and may say that you bought her to set her at liberty----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> I understand. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> When she's bought, you must remove her somewhere out of the city; unless your own feelings are any way opposed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> O no, skilfully suggested.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> But what say you, Ap&aelig;cides?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>APAECIDES</speaker><p> Why, what should I? Except that I think you've contrived it very cleverly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Then, in consequence, all thoughts of marriage with her will be removed from him, so that he will make no difficulties as to what you wish.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>APAECIDES</speaker><p> Long life to you, wise as you are, it really does please us. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Do you then skilfully do whatever you are going to do.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> I' faith, you speak to the purpose.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> I have found, too, how this suspicion may be removed from yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> Let me know it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> You shall know it; just listen.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>APAECIDES</speaker><p> He's come with a breast full of counsel.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> There's need of a person to carry the money there for the music-girl; but there's no equal necessity for yourself to do it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> Why so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Lest he should think you are doing it for the sake of your son----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> Cleverly thought of!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> By which means you'll keep him away from her; lest any difficulty might arise by reason of that suspicion.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> What person shall we find suited to this purpose?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> <stage>pointing to AP&AElig;CIDES.</stage> He will be the best; he will be able to take all due precautions, as he understands the laws and ordinances.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> Epidicus, receive my thanks. But I'll attend to this with all care.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> I'll find him and bring him here to you, to whom the music-girl belongs; and I'll take the money along with him. <stage>Pointing to AP&AElig;CIDES.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> For how much, at the lowest, can she be bought?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> What, she? Perhaps she might possibly be bought at the lowest for forty min&aelig;; but if you give me more, I shall return it. There's no trickery in this matter. This money, too, of yours won't be locked up ten days.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Why, because another young man is dying with love for this woman, one abounding in money, a great warrior, a Rhodian, a spoiler of his foes<milestone n="296" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A Rhodian, a spoiler of his foes</lemma>:  The Rhodians were considered wealthy, proud, and boastful.</note>, a boaster; he'll buy her of you, and give the money with pleasure. You only do it; there's a large profit for you here.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> I really pray the Gods it may be so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> You'll obtain your prayer. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>APAECIDES</speaker><p> Why then, don't you go in-doors and bring the money out here? I'll go visit the Forum. Epidicus, do you come thither.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> <stage>to AP&AElig;CIDES</stage>. Don't you go away from there before I come to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>APAECIDES</speaker><p> I'll wait till then.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> <stage>to EPIDICUS</stage>. Do you follow me in- doors.</p></sp>

For the common punishment of parricides was to put them into a sack with a cock, a serpent, and an ape, and then throw them into the river. Now the ward 'ductare' signifies equally 'to bring a man into punishment,' or 'to cheat him;' so that the phrase 'peratim ductare' is the same thing; only 'follis' was a much larger sack than 'pera.'" M. Guiet considers this passage to be spurious.</note>, but I'll chouse by bags full. For the procurer took away a whole lot of money for the music-girl (I paid it; with these hands I counted it out), her whom your father supposes to be his own daughter.

Not only for the sake of the face were it right for men to have a mirror for themselves wherein to look at their faces; but one with which they might be enabled to examine the heart of discretion, and therefore be able to examine the resources of the mind; when they had looked in that, they might afterwards consider how they had once passed their lives in youth. Just as myself, for instance, who, for the sake of my son, began to torment myself in mind, as though my son had been guilty of some offence against, me, or as though my own misdeeds had not been most heavy in my youth. In truth, we old fellows are out of our senses sometimes. This, in my own opinion at least, has proved advantageous. But my friend Ap&aelig;cides is coming with the spoil.

<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> In her senses, if she calls you her brother.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRATIPPOCLES</speaker><p> How's this? Have I just now become her brother while going in-doors and coming out?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> What good fortune there is, do you in silence keep your peace thereon and rejoice.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STRATIPPOCLES</speaker><p> Sister, you have both lost and found me!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> Simpleton, hold your tongue! Through my endeavours, there's ready for you at home, in fact, a Music-girl for you to make love to; I too, through my endeavours, have restored your sister to liberty.</p></sp>

Sceparnio only appears in the First and Second Acts of the Rudens, and the honest Grumio is lost sight of after the First Act of the Mostellaria. It is not a sufficient excuse to plead that Artotrogus and Thesprio are what were called "person&aelig; protatic&aelig;," characters whose business it is to introduce the plot, and do no more; even though this example is followed by Terence, who similarly introduces Sosia in the Andria, Davus in the Phormio, and Philotis in the Hecyra.</note> come across to you.

<sp><speaker>APAECIDES</speaker><p> I'll tell you now, that you may know it. It's best for you to seek another companion; so much, while I've been following you, has the congested blood, from weariness, come down into the knees of poor me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> In the first place, with what assurance did you presume to say that she who was bought the day before yesterday was my daughter?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> I confess that they were given, and that with that money I purchased this Music-girl, your son's mistress, instead of your daughter. As to those thirty min&aelig;, in fact, I imposed upon you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> I' faith, I really did do it, and I think it was rightly done.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> In the last place, what has been done with the silver I gave you?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PERIPHIANES</speaker><p> What's the matter? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIDICUS</speaker><p> The thing itself will tell you so at once. Only do go in-doors.</p></sp>
