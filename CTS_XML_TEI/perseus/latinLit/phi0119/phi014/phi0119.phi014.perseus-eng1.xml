<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>

<p>TOXILUS, who is left in charge of his master's house in his absence, is desirous of obtaining the liberty of his mistress Lemniselene, who belongs to the Procurer Dordalus. He applies to his friend Sagaristio to lend him the sum necessary for that purpose. Sagaristio has not the money himself, but succeeds in finding some for the use of his friend. With the view of getting back the money when paid to Dordalus, Toxilus prevails on the Parasite Saturio to allow his daughter to be sold by Sagaristio to Dordalus, as though she were a slave. While these arrangements are being made, Lemniselene sends her attendant Sophoclidisca with a letter to Toxilus, and he at the same time sends the boy P&aelig;gnium with a message to Lemniselene. On receiving the money from Sagaristio, Toxilus pays it to Dordalus, who sets Lemniselene at liberty. Immediately after this, Sagaristio, dressed as a Persian, brings the daughter of Saturio, also dressed as a Persian captive, and sells her to Dordalus, without warranty, for a large sum of money. Immediately upon the departure of Sagaristio, Saturio makes his appearance, and claiming his daughter, takes her away Toxilus and Sagaristio conclude with a feast, and make merry over the Procurer's misfortunes.

<stage>Enter TOXILUS and SAGARISTIO, on different sides.<note anchored="yes">Title <lemma targOrder="U">The Persian</lemma>:  As "Persa" signifies "a male Persian," the Play is evidently named from the character assumed by Sagaristio, who, as a, Persian, sells the daughter of Saturio, dressed up as a captive, to the Procurer Dordalus.</note></stage>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. He who, falling in love, destitute of means, has first entered upon the paths of love, has in his own labours exceeded all the labours of Hercules. For with the lion<milestone n="3" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With the lion</lemma>:  The. conquest of the Nem&aelig;an lion, the Hydra of <placeName key="perseus,Lerna">Lerna</placeName>, the brazen-footed stag, the Erymanthian boar, the birds of Lake Stymphalus, and the giant Ant&aelig;us, formed part of the labours of Hercules. See the Metamorphoses of Ovid, Books 9 and 10.</note>, and with the Hydra, with the stag, with the &AElig;tolian boar, with the birds of Stamphalus, with Ant&aelig;us, would I rather contend than with love. So wretched am I become with hunting after money to borrow; and yet, those whom I ask know of nothing to answer me, except "I have got none."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. The servant that is desirous faithfully to serve his master, i' troth, it surely does behove him to treasure up full many a thing in his breast which he may think will please his master, both present and abroad. I neither serve with cheerfulness, nor am I quite to my master's satisfaction; but, as though from a running eye, my master is still unable to keep his hands off me, in giving me his commands, in making me the support of his affairs.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Who's this that's standing opposite to me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Who's that that's standing opposite to me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> It's like Sagaristio.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Surely this is my friend Toxilus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Certainly it is he. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> I think it is he.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> I'll go meet him. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> I'll go up and accost him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> <stage>meeting him</stage>. O Sagaristio, may the Gods bless you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> O Sagaristio, the Gods grant you what you may desire. How fare you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Just as I can. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> What's the matter?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> I still live. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Quite then to your satisfaction?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> If the things come to pass which I desire, quite.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> You deal with your friends in a very silly fashion.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> How so?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Because you ought to give them your commands.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> As for myself, you were already dead to me, because I haven't seen you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Business, upon my faith----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> In the iron chain line, perhaps.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> For more than a twelvemonth I've been promoted in chains to be commanding officer in the basting line<milestone n="22" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In the basting line</lemma>:  " Tribunus vapularis." Literally, "a vapulary Tribune." By this droll expression he means, promoted above all others to the distinction of a flogging. The military Tribune was an officer high in rank in the Roman armies.</note> at the mill.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Why, that's your old line of service.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Have you been quite well all along?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Not very.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> I' faith, it's with reason then you are so pale.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> I've been wounded in the battles of Venus; Cupid has pierced my heart with his arrow.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Do servants then fall in love here?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Why, what could I do? Was I to be struggling against the Gods? Was I, like the sons of Titan, to be waging war with the Deities, with whom I am not quite able to cope?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Do you only take care that "catapult&aelig;" made of elm<milestone n="28" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Made of elm</lemma>:  He means the elm-twigs, which were especially used for the punishment of slaves.</note> don't pierce your sides.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> In right royal manner I'm celebrating the feast of Freedom<milestone n="29" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Feast of Freedom</lemma>:  "Agito Eleutheria." He is speaking of his enjoying full range in the absence of his master, and for that purpose borrows a figure from the Eleutheria, or "Feast of Liberty," a festival which the Greeks, after the battle of Plat&aelig;a, instituted in honor of Jupiter or Zeus Eleutherius, "The Deliverer." This festival was not only a mark of gratitude to the Deity, to whom they believed themselves indebted for their victory over the Persians, but employed as a bond of union among themselves. It was celebrated each year at Plat&aelig;a, and every fifth year with additional solemnities, and contests No slaves were allowed to minister on the occasion of this festival.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Because my master's gone abroad.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Do you say so? Is he gone abroad?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> If you can bear to be enjoying yourself, do you come: you shall live with me; you shall be treated with right royal entertainment.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Out upon it <stage>rubbing himself</stage>; my shoulder-blades are quite itching now, because I've heard you mention these things.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> But this one thing is torturing me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Why, what is it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> This day is the very last day, to determine whether my mistress is to be free, or whether she is to endure lasting servitude.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> What, then, do you now desire?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> You have it in your power to make me your friend for ever.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> In what way?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> In lending me six hundred didrachms, for me to pay the same for her freedom, which I will forthwith refund you in the next three or four days. Come, do be good-natured; give me your help.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> With what assurance, you impudent fellow, do you venture to ask so much money of me? Why, if I myself were to be sold all in one lot, it's hardly possible for as much to be received as you are asking me for; for now you are asking for water from a pumice-stone, which is all a-dry itself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Ought you to be treating me in this fashion?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> What am I to do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Do you ask the question? Beg it on loan from somebody.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> You do the same as you are asking me.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> I've been trying; I've found it nowhere.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> I really will try, if any one will trust me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Am I then to consider it<milestone n="47" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Am I then to consider it</lemma>:  "Nempe habeo in mundo?" Literally, "I have it in the world, I suppose?" implying that he presumes, that if possible, Sagaristio will comply with his request.</note> as a thing in possibility?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> If I had had it at home, I'd promise it at once. This is in my power, to use my best endeavours.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Whatever it is, come you home to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Still do you try to get it; I'll carefully do the same. If anything shall turn up, I'll let you know at once.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> I entreat you, and entreat over and over again, do give me your stanch help in this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> O dear! you are worrying me to death by your importunity.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> It's through the fault of love, and not my own, that I'm now become a silly prater to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Then, i' troth, I'll now be taking my leave of you <stage>Moving.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Are you going away, then? A good walk to you. But betake yourself back as soon as you can, and do take care that I haven't to seek you; I shall be close at home until I have cooked up a mishap for the Procurer. <stage>(Exit SAGARISTIO, and TOXILUS goes into the house.)</stage></p></sp></div1>

<stage>Enter SATURIO.</stage>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. The old and ancient calling of my forefathers do I follow, and hold, and cultivate with great care. For never was there any one of my forefathers, but that by acting the parasite they filled their bellies: my father, grandfather, great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather, his father, and his grandfather, just like mice, always fed on the victuals of others, and in love of good eating no one could excel them. Hard Heads<milestone n="62" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Hard Heads</lemma>:  "Duris capitonibus." Literally, "hard large heads." He probably alludes to the necessity which there was for Parasites to have particularly hard heads, in order to be proof against the ill-usage to which they were subjected. The expression would be more likely to catch a laugh from a Roman Audience, as there was a noble family at Rome of the surname of Capito.</note> was their surname. From them have I derived this calling, and the station of my forefathers; nor do I wish myself to turn informer<milestone n="64" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To turn informer</lemma>:  "Quadruplari." He seems to think that he is reduced to the alternative of getting a living either by being a Parasite or an informer, and prefers the first. Informers were called "quadruplatores" at Rome, because they received the fourth part of the fines paid by the persons against whom they informed.</note>, nor indeed does it become me, without risk of my own, to go seize upon the goods of other people; nor do those persons please who do so; I'm speaking out. For whoever does this, more for the sake of the public than of his own benefit, my mind can be induced to believe that he is a citizen both faithful and deserving; but if he should not prosecute to conviction the breaker of the laws, let him pay one half of the intended penalty to the public. And let this, too, be written in that law; when an informer has prosecuted any one, let the other in his turn<milestone n="73" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Let the other in his turn</lemma>:  In case of his not obtaining a conviction. It is not improbable that the practices of informers were an especial annoyance at the time when this Play was written.</note> sue him for just as much, and upon equal terms let them come before the Triumvirs<milestone n="74" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The Triumvirs</lemma>:  For an account of the magistrates called "Tresviri," or "Triumviri," see the Notes to the Aulularia and the Amphitryon.</note>. If that were done, assuredly I'd make those nowhere to be seen, who here with their whitened nets<milestone n="76" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Whitened nets</lemma>:  By the use of the word "albo," "white," Gronovius is led to think that the passage refers to the white book or paper upon which the rules and ordinances of the Pr&aelig;tor were written, and that the allusion is to the habit of informers hampering people, by repeated accusations of infringing the Pr&aelig;tor's rules. It seems, however, not improbable that he likens the accusations of the informers (who of course pretended that they were only actuated by a desire for the public good) to whitened nets, by reason of their speciousness, and the difficulty of avoiding the meshes which they spread in every direction.</note> lay siege to the property of others. But am I not a simpleton, to be taking care of the public interests when there are the magistrates, whose duty it is to take care of them? Now I'll in-doors here; I'll go look after the scraps from yesterday, whether they have rested well or not; whether they have had a fever<milestone n="80" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Had a fever</lemma>:  By this expression he probably means, "whether they have been warmed up again"</note>; whether they've been well covered up or not, so that no one could creep up to them.

These, according to some, were the fruit of a tree called by the same name; others take the word to mean a large kind of quince. As there is some doubt on the subject, a general name has been adopted in the Translation. Warner thinks that the word means "myrrh;" but it is pretty clear that he is mistaken. Quinces were used in the wines of the ancients, as we learn from Columella.</note>, that they may be nicely warmed upon the dishes, and throw in some scented calamus<milestone n="90" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Calamus</lemma>:  Supposed to be "sweet-scented rush."

<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. He's speaking the very fact; they are worth nothing raw, only if you swallow them warm. Then, unless the broth for the gravy-cakes is of a thick consistency, that miserable, thin, pale, transparent stuff, is worth nothing at all. The broth for a gravy-cake ought to be like a soup. I don't want it to be going into my bladder, I want it for my stomach.</p></sp>

As to eating fish cold, see the words of Periple- comenus, in the Miles Gloriosus, l. 760, and the Note.</note> when cold. But why do we delay to commence the engagement? While it's the morning, it befits all people to eat.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> It's almost too early in the morning.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> The business that you begin to do in the morning, that same lasts on throughout the day.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Prithee, do give your attention to this. For yesterday I mentioned it to you, and entreated you to lend me six hundred didrachms.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> I recollect it and am aware, both that you did ask me, and that I hadn't any to lend. A Parasite's good for nothing that has got money at home; he has a longing at once to begin upon an entertainment, and to gobble away at his own expense, if he has anything at home. A Parasite ought to be a right down needy Cynic; he ought to have a leather bottle<milestone n="126" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A leather bottle</lemma>:  "Ampullam." This was probably the bottle in which unguents were kept by the Parasite for the convenience of bathers. See the soliloquy of Gelasimus the Parasite, in the Stichus, l. 228.</note>, a strigil, an utensil<milestone n="126" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">An utensil</lemma>:  "Scaphium." If this word has not the same meaning here as "matula," it will probably signify a bottle, which he ought to be in the habit of carrying about with him, for taking home any wine left after the entertainment. The use of the "socci" would show that his avocations were more confined to in-doors than the street, where the use of them was considered effeminate. On the "strigil," see the Notes to the Stichus, l. 228.</note>, a pair of slippers, a cloak, and a purse; and in that a little of the needful, with which he may just cheer up the existence of his own household.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> I don't want money now; lend me your daughter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> By my troth, never to any person whatsoever have I lent her as yet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Not for that purpose which you are insinuating.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> Why do you want her then? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> You shall know; because she's of a pretty and genteel figure.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> Such is the fact. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> This Procurer <stage>pointing to the house of DORDALUS</stage> neither knows yourself nor your daughter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> How should any one know me, except him who finds me food?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Such is the fact. This way you can find some money for me. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> I' faith, I wish I could.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Then do you allow me to sell her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> You to sell her?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Why no, I'll depute another person to sell her, and to say that he is a foreigner; since it isn't six months since that Procurer removed hither from Megara<milestone n="139" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">From Megara</lemma>:  This was a city not far from Athens, on the confines of Attica.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> The remnants are spoiling; this, however, can be done afterwards.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Do you understand on what terms it can? Never, on my word, shall you eat here this day, so don't be mistaken, before you declare to me that you'll do this that I'm requesting; and unless you bring your daughter with you hither at once as soon as you can, by my faith, I'll cashier you from this squad. What now? What's the matter? Why don't you say what you will do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> I' troth, prithee sell even myself as well, if you like, so long as you sell me with my stomach full.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> If you are going to do this, do it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> For my part, I'll do what you desire,</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> You act kindly. Make haste, be off home; cleverly tutor your daughter beforehand, instruct her cunningly, what she is to say, where she is to declare she was born, who were her parents, how she was kidnapped. But let her declare that she was born at a distance from Athens; and let her shed tears when she makes mention of it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> Now won't you hold your tongue? Three times more artful is she than you would have her be.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> I' troth, you say what's excellent. But do you know what you are to do? Get a tunic and a girdle, and bring a scarf and a broad-brimmed hat for him to wear who is to sell her to this Procurer----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> Well-capital! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> As though he were a foreigner.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SATURIO</speaker><p> I approve of it----</p></sp>

The reason for his being advised by Toxilus to go the back way probably is, that he does not wish, by their walking in the main street, to attract attention to the fact that he has purchased her freedom. The Procurer, too, having to carry the money to the assayers, probably would not like to attract too much attention to his precious burden. As they are to come back the same way, Lemniselene is to enter the house where Toxilus lives at the back entrance, which accounts for her coming thence, in the Fifth Act, without having appeared on the stage since she went back, after speaking with Sophoclidisca, into the house of Dordalus.</note>; let this damsel pass through the same way to our house, through the garden.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> I'll have her here this moment.</p></sp>

Am I not a worthy man, am I not a courteous citizen, who this day have made the extensive state of Attica still larger, and increased it by a female citizen? But how obliging have I been to-day! To how many have I given credit, and have from no person taken surety; so readily did I give credit to all: and I don't fear that of those whom I've trusted to-day any one will forswear himself against me upon trial.

<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Will you, or will you not, hold your tongue? I never did believe you to be such a blockhead. What are you afraid of?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> I' faith, I really am afraid; I've experienced it now so many times, and it will not befall me without having already experienced it, to be getting stuck in such a quagmire.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> There seems to be no risk.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> I know that; but I'm afraid about myself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> It matters nothing whatever to me, so far as I'm concerned; it's for your sake I mentioned it, that I might at the earliest moment give you an opportunity of advantageously purchasing her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> I return you thanks; but it's a nicer thing for you to become wise through others, than for others through yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Surely no person can follow after her from the inmost parts of Arabia. Will you make purchase of her, then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> Only let me see the commodity.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> You say what's fair. But look, most &agrave; propos, the stranger is coming himself, who brought this letter hither.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DAU.</speaker><p> Why should I tell of him, wretched man, who he was? For the present 'twere proper for him to be called Miserable, and me Miserable.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> What kind of a person was he considered by the public?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DAU.</speaker><p> Not a person more acceptable; slaves and free persons all liked him.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> I shall purchase her, I think.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> You'll be off with your abuse from here, if you are wise.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> <stage>to LEMNISELENE</stage>. But, my worthy freed-woman, you knew of this, and concealed it from me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEMNISELENE</speaker><p> It's folly for a person who can enjoy himself to turn to brawling in preference. 'Twere more proper for you to arrange about those matters another time.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> My heart's in flames.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Give him a goblet, then; put out the fire, if his heart's in flames, that his head mayn't be burnt.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> You're making sport of me, I find.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Would you like<milestone n="807" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Would you like</lemma>:  This passage has been somewhat modified in the Translation.</note> a new playfellow for you, P&aelig;gnium? <stage>Pointing at DORDALUS.</stage> But sport on as you are wont, as this is a place of freedom. <stage>P&AElig;GNIUM struts about round DORDALUS.</stage> O rare! you do stalk in a princely style and right merrily.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>P&AElig;G.</speaker><p> It befits me to be merry, and I've a longing to play this Procurer some pranks, since he's deserving of it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> As you commenced, proceed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>P&AElig;G.</speaker><p> <stage>striking him</stage>. Take that, Procurer!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> I'm undone! he has almost knocked me down!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>P&AElig;G.</speaker><p> Hey--be on your guard<milestone n="814" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Be on your guard</lemma>:  In Weise's Edition, "servo," in this line, seems to be not so conformable to the sense of the passage as "serva," which has been adopted.</note> again. <stage>Strikes at him.</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> Sport on just as you please, while your master's away from here.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>P&AElig;G.</speaker><p> <stage>skipping around him</stage>. Don't you see how obedient I am to your request? But why, on the other hand, are not you obedient to my request as well, and why don't you do that which I advise you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> What's that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>P&AElig;G.</speaker><p> Do you take a stout rope for yourself, and go hang yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> <stage>shaking his stick</stage>. Take you care, will you, that you don't touch me, lest I give you a heavy return with this walking-stick. P&AElig;G. Make use of it; I give you leave.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Come, come, P&aelig;gnium, put an end to it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> By my faith, I'll utterly destroy you all.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> But he, who dwells above<milestone n="826" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Who dwells above</lemma>:  He alludes to Jupiter, the King of Heaven.</note> us, wishes you all ill, and will do you all ill. It's not they that tell you so, but I.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Come <stage>to the SLAVES</stage>, carry round the honied wine<milestone n="828" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The honied wine</lemma>:  He probably mentions "mulsum," because that was the draught with which soldiers were regaled after victory.</note>; give us drink in goblets quite full: it's a long time now since we last drank; we've been athirst too long.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> May the Gods grant that you may drink that which may never pass through you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>P&AElig;G.</speaker><p> I cannot forbear, Procurer, from at least dancing a hornpipe<milestone n="831" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A hornpipe</lemma>:  "Staticulum." This was probably danced, the performer not moving from the spot; and perhaps was something similar to our hornpipe dances. Of Hegea and Diodorus, the dancing masters, no records are left.</note> for you, which Hegea formerly composed. But just look if it quite pleases you. <stage>He dances.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> <stage>rising</stage>. I'd like also to repeat that one which Diodorus formerly composed in Ionia. <stage>Goes close to DORDALUS.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> I'll be doing you a mischief, if you are not off!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Still muttering, impudence? If you provoke me, I'll just now be bringing you the Persian again.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> I' faith, I'm silenced now. Why, you are the Persian that has been fleecing me to the quick!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Hold your tongue, simpleton; this is his twin-brother.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> Is it he? Tox. Aye, and a very twin of twins.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> May the Gods and Goddesses rack both yourself and your twin-brother.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Him, you mean, who has been ruining you; for I don't deserve anything.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> But still, what he deserves, I hope that that may prove to your undoing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> <stage>to SAGARISTIO</stage>. Come, if you like, let's have some sport with this fellow, unless he isn't deemed worthy of it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Just now it's right.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEMNISELENE</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. But it isn't proper for me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. For the reason, I suppose, that he made no difficulties when I purchased you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEMNISELENE</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. But still----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. No "still." Beware, then, of a mishap, will you, and obey me. It becomes you to be heedful of my orders; for, i' faith, had it not been for me and my protection, he would before long have made a street-walker of you. But such are some of those who have gained their freedom, unless they thwart their patron, they don't appear to themselves free enough, or wise enough, or honest enough, unless they oppose him, unless they abuse him, unless they are found ungrateful to him who has been kind.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEMNISELENE</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. I' troth, your kindnesses command me to pay obedience to your commands.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. I clearly am your patron, who paid the money for you to that man <stage>pointing to DORDALUS</stage>; in return for that, I choose that he shall be made sport of.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEMNISELENE</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. For my part, I'll do my utmost.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> For sure, these persons are consulting to do something, I know not what, to injure me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Hark you. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> What do you say?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> Is this person here, Dordalus the Procurer, who deals in free women? Is this he who was formerly st stalwart?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> What means this? <stage>P&AElig;GNIUM strikes him.</stage> Oh, oh! he has given me a slap in the face! I'll do you a mischief. <stage>Shakes his fist at him.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> But we have done you one, and shall do it again too.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> <stage>P&AElig;GNIUM pinching him</stage>. Oh, oh! he's pinching my behind.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>P&AElig;G.</speaker><p> Of course; it has been many a time twitched before this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> Are you still prating, you bit of a boy?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEMNISELENE</speaker><p> <stage>to DORDALUS</stage>. My patron, do, there's a dear, come in-doors to dinner.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> My lump of laziness, are you now scoffing at me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEMNISELENE</speaker><p> What, because I invite you to enjoy yourself?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> I don't want to enjoy myself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEMNISELENE</speaker><p> Then don't.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> How then? The six hundred didrachms, how are they? What disturbances they do cause.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. I'm utterly undone! They understand full well how to return the compliment to an enemy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> Have we now had satisfaction enough?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> I confess it; I hold up my hands<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Hold up my hands</lemma>:  "Manus dare," "to extend the hands," was a term applied to the gladiators in the Amphitheatres, who extended their hands for mercy, when they acknowledged themselves defeated.</note> to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> And, ere long, you shall be holding them beneath the bilboes<milestone n="861" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Beneath the bilboes</lemma>:  "Furca." This instrument, in shape of the letter V, was placed round the neck of offenders, and their hands tied to the ands of it.</note>. Be off in-doors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARISTIO</speaker><p> To perdition!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DORDALUS</speaker><p> <stage>to the AUDIENCE</stage>. Have these fellows here worked me in too slight a degree? <stage>Goes into his house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TOXILUS</speaker><p> <stage>calling after him</stage>. Keep in mind that you met with a Toxilus. <stage>To the AUDIENCE.</stage> Spectators, kindly fare you well. The Procurer is demolished. Grant us your applause.
