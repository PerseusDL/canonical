<head>THE SUBJECT</head>

<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS,</speaker><p> the son of Dem&aelig;netus, is violently in love with Philenium, a young woman, who is living with her mother, Cle&aelig;reta, a procuress. The latter has made an agreement with a Captain, of the name of Diabolus, to transfer Philenium to him for twenty min&aelig;, on condition, however, that if Argyrippus shall first pay that sum, he shall have her. Argyrippus, having exhausted all his own resources, applies to his father, Dem&aelig;netus, an over-indulgent and immoral old man, and requests him to furnish him with twenty min&aelig;. Dem&aelig;netus is married to Artemona, a rich woman, and is totally dependant on the will of herself and her favourite slave, the chamberlain Saurea. Being destitute of money, Dem&aelig;netus orders his servant, Libanus, by some means or other to cheat his mistress or the chamberlain out of that sum. Just then an ass-dealer arrives, to pay to Saurea twenty min&aelig;, the price of some asses which he has previously purchased. Libanus then arranges with his fellow-servant, Leonida, that the latter shall personate Saurea, and so receive the money from the ass-dealer. This is done, and the money is paid to Leonida, in the presence of Dem&aelig;netus, who assures the dealer that Leonida really is the person to whom the money is payable. This sum is then given to Argyrippus, but with the disgraceful stipulation that for one day his father shall enjoy the company of Philenium. This he submits to, and the three sit down to a banquet. The Captain discovers this, and sends his Parasite to inform Artemona of her husband's conduct. She accordingly accompanies the Parasite, and discovers her husband in the company of his son and the young woman; after soundly rating him, she leads him off; while Argyrippus remains in possession of Philenium.

Now I will tell you why I have come forward here, and what my intention is, that you may know the name of this play. For, so far as relates to the plot, it really is a short one.

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Troth now, prithee answer me seriously what I ask you; take care that you tell me no falsehood.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> I want you, even to the death----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> Take you care of a woful mishap, if you please.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Of your wife, I mean, not of yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> For that speech, I give you leave to be free from apprehension.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> May the Gods grant you whatever you desire.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> In return, give me your attention. Why should I ask this of you? Or why should I threaten you, because you have not made me acquainted with it? Or why, in fine, should I censure my son as other fathers do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> What new affair is this? <stage>Aside.</stage> I wonder much what it is, and I'm in dread what the upshot of it may be.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> In fact, I'm now aware that my son's in love with that Courtesan Philenium, that lives close by. Is not this as I say, Libanus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> You are upon the right track; such is the fact. But a dreadful malady has overtaken him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> What is the malady? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Why, that his presents don't equal his promises.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> Are you, then, one who assists my son in his amours?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> I really am, and our Leonida is another.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> I' faith, you do kindly, and you gain thanks from me. But this wife of mine, Libanus, don't you know what sort of a person she is?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> You are the first to experience it, but we give a guess beforehand.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> I confess that she is troublesome and not to be pleased.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> You say that later than I believed you in it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> All parents, Libanus, who listen to me, will show indulgence to their children, inasmuch as they will find their sons more kindly disposed and more affectionate; and that do I desire to do myself. I wish to be loved by mine; I wish myself to be like my father, who, for my sake, himself in the disguise of a ship-master, carried off from a procurer a female with whom I was in love; nor was he ashamed, at that time of life, to devise stratagems, and to purchase with good turns me, his son, for himself. These ways of my father have I resolved to imitate. For to-day my son Argyrippus has entreated me to give him a supply of money for his amours; and I very much wish in that to oblige my son. I wish to forward his amours; I wish him to be fond of myself, his father. Although his mother keeps him strictly, and with a tight rein, as fathers have been in the habit of doing, all that I dismiss. Especially as he has deemed me deserving, for him to entrust it to ire, I ought to pay all due regard to his feelings. Inasmuch as he has applied to me, as it is right that a respectful son should do, I wish him to have some money for him to give to his mistress * * * * *</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> You are desiring that which I find you are do siring to no purpose. Your wife brought her servant Saurea with her on her marriage<milestone n="87" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With her on her marriage</lemma>:  "Dotalem." The husband was master of the other slaves in the household; but the "dotalis" was under the sole control of the mistress. Aulus Gellius, in his Seventeenth Book, calls him "servus recepticius," probably, either because it was his business to receive whatever was due to his mistress, or from his being received into the house in preference to all other slaves.</note>, who has more in his control trol than you have.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> I received money with her, and for the portion I sold my authority. Now I'll compress into a few words what I want of you; my son is now in need of twenty silver min&aelig;: do you manage that it may be forthwith found for him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> From what place in the world? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> Cheat me of them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> You are talking downright nonsense. You are bidding me take the clothes from off a naked man. I, cheat you?--come now, fly you without wings, please. What, am I to cheat you who have nothing in your power for your own self? Unless you have first cheated your wife out of something.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> Impose upon or rob myself in any way you can, my wife in any way, my servant Saurea in any way. I promise you that it shall not prove to your detriment, if you effect it to-day.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> On the same principle you might bid me to fish in the air, and to hunt with a javelin in the midst of the sea.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> Take Leonida as your coadjutor<milestone n="103" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Your coadjutor</lemma>:  "Optio" was originally the name of the lientenant, or adjutant, who was chosen by the centurion in the Roman armies to assist him in the discharge of his duties.</note>; devise some plan or other, think of some expedient: bring it about that my son this day gets some money to give his mistress.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> What say you, Dem&aelig;netus * * * * * if the foe should intercept me, will you ransom me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> I will ransom you. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Then do you attend to something else, whatever you please.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> I'm off to the Forum, unless you wish for anything.</p></sp>

There is a distinction made between 'ire,' which, the grammarians tell us, is used to express walking fast, and 'ambulare,' 'to walk slowly,' or 'step by step.'"</note>?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> And do you hear, too----? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Well now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> If I want you for anything, where will you be?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Wherever it shall be agreable to my feelings. Really, there's not a person that I shall stand in dread of from this time forward, for fear he might be able to do me an injury, since in your discourse you have disclosed to me all your sentiments. Why, your own self even I don't stand much in awe of, if I carry this out. I'll go where I intended, and there I'll commune upon my plans.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> Do you hear me? I shall be with Archibulus, the banker.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> If any purchaser should come, he could not carry him away from me each single word of those for gold Philippean pieces. What you say wrongfully against us is good gold and silver. Your heart is locked up here with us, at the helm of Cupid. With oars and with sails make haste and fly as fast as you can; the further you betake yourself to sea, the more the tide will bring you back to harbour.</p></sp>

Cle&aelig;reta has just mentioned "portus," "the harbour," meaning her own house, to which, despite of himself, Argyrippus will, by his own passion, be brought back at last. He takes up the metaphor, and says that she, the landing-waiter (<foreign lang="la">portitor</foreign>), or custom-house officer, shall not, however, get her dues; meaning, that he is determined not to let her have any more of his money.</note> of his dues. From henceforth I'll persist in treating you as you have deserved of me and mine, since you have treated me not as I deserve, in excluding me from your house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> I know that that is rather said with the tongue, than that it will happen in deed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> I alone have brought you from obscurity and from want; if I alone patronize you, you can never return sufficient thanks.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> Do you still be the only one to patronize me, if you alone will always give me what I ask. Do you always keep what has been promised you, on this condition, that you surpass others in your presents.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> What limit is there to be to giving? For really you can never be satisfied; the moment that you've received something, not very long after, you are devising something for you to be asking for.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> What limit is there to be to your enjoying yourself, and to your indulging your amour? Can you never be satisfied? The moment that you have sent her home, that instant, you are directly asking me to send her back to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> In fact, I have given whatever you have demanded of me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> And I have sent the damsel to you. A requital has been given, like for like; a return for the money.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> You treat me badly. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> Why do you blame me if I do my duty? For nowhere is it either feigned in story or represented in pictures or written in poems, where a procuress, who wishes to thrive, treats any lover well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> Still, 'twere right for you to show favour to me at least, that I might last the longer for you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> Don't you know, the woman that shows favour to a lover, that same woman shows little favour to herself? Just like a fish, so is a lover to a procuress; he's good for nothing if ne isn't fresh. Then it has juice, then it has sweetness; in any fashion you like you may season it, either stewed or roasted; ill any way you will, you may turn it. So the lover; he's ready to give, he longs for something to be asked of him, for there it's taken from a full stock, nor does he know what he's giving, or what mischief he's doing. Of this matter does the new lover think; he wishes himself to please his mistress, he wishes to please me, he wishes to please her lady's maid<milestone n="187" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Her lady's maid</lemma>:  "Pedissequa" seems to have been the name of the female-servant, whose duty it was to be constantly in attendance on her mistress; and who probably followed her in the street, whence her name.</note>, he wishes to please the men-servants, he wishes to please the maid-servants as well, and even my dog does he caress, that when it sees him, it may be delighted. I tell the truth; it shows cleverness for every person to be fair-dealing for his own advantage.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> I've thoroughly learned that this is true, to my own great misfortune.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> I' faith, if you now had anything to give, you'd be uttering different remarks; now, since you've got nothing, you expect to be having her by means of harsh language.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> 'Tis not my way. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> Nor yet mine, indeed, i' faith, to be sending her to you for nothing; but this shall be done out of regard for your youthful age and your own sake, since you have rather been the cause of profit to us than of reputation to yourself.

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> What if I haven't it? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> I'll believe that you haven't it--still, she shall go to another.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> Where is that which I have given you already?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> Spent; for if it was remaining to me, the damsel should be sent to you, and I should never ask for anything. Daylight, water, the sun, the moon, the night, these things I purchase not with money; the rest, whatever we wish to enjoy, we purchase on Grecian trust<milestone n="203" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">On Grecian trust</lemma>:  The Greeks were so noted for their want of punctuality in their payments, that it became the general rule among them not to give credit. Consequently, "Grecian trust" became a proverbial saying for "ready money."</note>. When we ask bread of the baker, wine from the wineshop--if they receive the money, they give their wares; the same principle do I go upon. My hands always have eyes in them; they believe what they see. There's an old saying, "trusting is good for nought<milestone n="207" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Trusting is good for nought</lemma>:  "Nihili cocio est." The meaning of this passage is obvious, that "trusting is bad;" but the signification of the word "cocio" has puzzled the Commentators. Gronovius, with some probability, suggests that it is the old form of the word "cautio;" meaning "one who goes upon trust." It may either mean that, or "trusting," or "giving tick," as we familiarly term it; indeed, it is not improbable that the word "cocio" may have been a cant name for "credit." From the remark of Cle&aelig;reta, we may conclude that this was a proverbial expression, which had originated in being used by some famous person, or in some celebrated play of that day, all remembrance of which has now perished.</note>;" you know whose it is--I say no more.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> Now I'm clean stripped, you tell me another tale; a very different one, I say, you give me now from formerly, when I was making presents; a different one from formerly, when with kindness and good words you used to entice me to your house. Then did your house even smile upon me, when I used to come to you. You used to say that I alone of all loved you and her. When I had given anything, just like the young ones of a pigeon were you both upon my lips; and all your likings were according to my own liking. You always kept close to me; whatever I requested, whatever I wished, you used to do; what I didn't wish and forbade, that, with carefulness, you used to avoid, nor did you first venture to attempt to do it. Now, you jades, you don't much care either what I do wish or what I don't wish.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> Don't you know? This calling of ours is very like that of the fowler. The fowler, when he has prepared the spot, sprinkles the food about. The birds are accustomed to the spot. 'Tis necessary for him<milestone n="221" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">'Tis necessary for him</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Necesse est facere sumptum, qui qu&aelig;rit merum</foreign>." <placeName key="tgn,2008410">Louis</placeName> the Twelfth, the King of France, was always quoting this proverb; but it has been remarked, that he failed to make it his rule of conduct.</note> to make an outlay, who seeks for gain. They eat often; if they are caught once, they reimburse the fowler. So in like manner here with us. Our house is the spot, I am the fowler, the courtesan is the food, the couch is the decoy, the lovers the birds. By kindly welcoming them, by addressing them courteously, by dallying, and by chattering over the wine, and amusing conversation, they are won. If one of them has touched her bosom, that is not without advantage to the fowler. If he has taken a kiss, him you may take without a net. That you should be forgetful of these things, you who have been schooled so long!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> That's your own fault, in turning away from you a scholar half instructed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> Come back again without hesitation, if you've got the pay; for the present, be off. <stage>Pretends to go.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> Stay, stay; don't you hear me? Say what you think it fair that I should give you for her, that for this year she may be with no one else.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> What, you? Twenty min&aelig;. And on this condition: if any other person shall bring them first to me, to you--good-bye.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> But I---- There's still something that I wish to say to you before you go.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> Say what you please. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> I'm not entirely ruined yet; there's still something more left for me to come to ruin. I have wherewithal to give you what you ask; but I'll give it you on my own terms, that you may be enabled to understand that throughout all this year she is to be at my service, and that, in the meantime, she is to admit no other man whatever to her, besides myself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEAERETA</speaker><p> Why, if you choose, the male-servants that are at home, I'll make eunuchs of. In fine, take you care and bring articles of agreement that we will be as you wish. Impose conditions upon us as you wish, and as you shall choose. Do you only bring the money with you, I'll readily put up with the rest. The doors of procurers are very like those of a custom-house officer; if you bring anything, then they are opened; if there is nothing for you to give, then the doors are not opened. <stage>Goes into her house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. I'm undone, if I don't procure these twenty min&aelig;. And really, unless I make away with this much money, I must come to destruction. Now I'll go to the Forum, and make trial with my resources, with all my endeavours. I'll beg, I'll earnestly entreat each friend as I see him; both good and bad am I determined to apply to, and make trial of.

<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Upon my faith, Libanus, it really were better for you now to be waking, and to be devising some plan for procuring the money. A long time has now elapsed, since you parted with your master and went to the Forum. For that end that you might devise some plan for procuring the money, there till this time of day have you been sleeping at your ease. Why don't you away with all slothfulness from yourself, and remove all sluggishness, and betake yourself again to your former dexterous ingenuity. Preserve your master; take you care, too, how you do the same that other servants are wont, who employ a clever ingenuity in cheating their master? Whence shall I get it? Whom shall I diddle out of it? Whither shall 1 steer this fly-boat? 'Tis settled, 'tis confirmed by auspices; on each side do the birds give good omens. The woodpecker and the crow are on my right, the raven, as well, upon my left. They are persuading me to it: i' faith, I'm resolved to follow your advice. <stage>Starts and listens.</stage> But what means this, that the woodpecker is tapping the elm-tree? That's not for nothing. Troth, for certain, so far as I can gather omens from augury, the rods are in readiness for my own back, or for Saurea the chamberlain.

<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Upon my faith, I don't know. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> I know that you don't know; but, i' faith, I who have weighed you do know. Tied up naked, you were a hundred pounds in weight, when you were hanging with your feet downwards.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> On what evidence is that? </p></sp>

When you are tied up with a full hundred pounds to your feet<milestone n="307" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Hundred pounds to your feet</lemma>:  When slaves were hung up by the arms to be scourged, it was usual to fasten heavy weights to their feet, to prevent them from kicking those who scourged them. The peor wit of Leonida seems to have this meaning: punning upon the word "pendeo," which signifies either "to hang from" or "to weigh," he says, that when Libanus is tied up with the weight at his feet, he weighs just as much as the weight and no more; for, being a worthless fellow, he has no weight whatever as a good man.</note>, when the manacles are fastened to your hands, and tied to the beam, you are weighing neither more nor less, than as being a worthless and good-for-nothing fellow.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> That, Servitude bequeaths to you by her will.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> I wish this skirmishing of words to be cut short. What matter is this?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> Am I sure in trusting you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> You may, without hesitation. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> If you wish to assist our master's son in his amour, there is so much of a good opportunity on a sudden, but still mingled with evil--all the hangman's days will be rendered famous by ourselves. Libanus, now have we occasion to find some boldness and inventiveness. An exploit so great have I thought of just now, that we two may be pronounced the most deserving of all for torture to befall us.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> 'Twas on that account I was wondering why my shoulder-blades were aching just now, which were beginning to prognosticate that there was some danger for them at home. Whatever it is, speak out.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> 'Tis great booty with great risk.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> If indeed all persons by compact were to collect all the tortures, I have, I fancy, a back at home, so that I need not seek it out of doors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> If you maintain such firmness of resolve, then we are all right.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Why, if the matter were to be atoned for by my back, I could wish to seize the public money: I'll persist in my denial, and I'll endure all; in fine, I'll forswear myself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> Ah! that's true valour, when occasion is, for one to endure misfortune with boldness. He that endures misfortune with boldness, that man afterwards enjoys good fortune.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Why don't you tell the matter at once? I'm longing to tempt the scourge.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> <stage>breathing hard</stage>. Ask deliberately each particular then, that I may rest me. Don't you see that I'm still out of breath with running?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Well, well, I'll wait your pleasure, even, in fact, till you die.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> Where's our master, pray?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> The old one is at the Forum, the young one is here in-doors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> That's enough for me then. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Is it then that you've become a rich man?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> Leave off your raillery. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> I'll have done; for my ears are in expectation of what you are bringing me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> Give your attention, that equally with myself you may learn this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> I'm silent, then. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> You oblige me. Don't you remember that our chamberlain sold some <placeName key="tgn,2136419">Arcadian</placeName> asses to a dealer of <placeName key="tgn,7011026">Pella</placeName><milestone n="337" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Dealer of <placeName key="tgn,7011026">Pella</placeName></lemma>:  <placeName key="tgn,7011026">Pella</placeName> was a wealthy city of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, famed for the opulence of its merchants.

<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> I remember it; after that, what then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> Well, he has sent some money here then to be paid to Saurea, for the asses; a young man has just now come who has brought this money.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Where is this person?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> You think he ought to be devoured this instant, if you could see him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Aye, to be sure. But, however, you are speaking, I suppose, of those asses, aged and lame, whose hoofs were quite worn away to their very thighs?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> Those same ones, that carried the elm twigs hither from the country, for your use.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> I understand you; and the same ones carried you from here, bound, into the country<milestone n="345" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Bound, into the country</lemma>:  Namely, to the "ergastulum," of "puteus," the place to which refractory slaves were sent for hard labour, and which was generally at the country-house of the master.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> You say what's quite correct. But as I was sitting in the barber's shop, he began to make enquiries of me, whether I knew a certain Dem&aelig;netus, the son of Strato. At once I said that I knew him, and that I was his servant; and I pointed out our house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> After that, what then? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> He said that he was bringing the money for the asses to the chamberlain Saurea, twenty min&aelig; in amount; but that he himself didn't know the individual, who he was, but that he knew Dem&aelig;netus quite well. Since he spoke thus to this effect----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> What then? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> Listen then, and you'll know. At once I made myself courteous, and a person of consequence. I said that I was the chamberlain. Thus, in these terms did he answer me: "Upon my faith, I don't know Saurea, nor yet of what appearance he is. It isn't fair for you to blame me; but if you like, bring here Dem&aelig;netus, your master, whom I do know; I'll not prevent you taking the money then." I said that I would bring him, and that I should be at home immediately.

<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Why, I'm thinking of this, how to get between the money, and the stranger, and Saurea. At present this matter is rough-hewn; but if this stranger brings here the money first, then are we both at once shut out from it. But the old man to-day took me apart at a distance from the house, and threatened me and yourself that we should be tasters of the elm twigs, if Argyrippus didn't this very day get twenty mine of silver. He commanded that we should cheat either the chamberlain or his own wife, and said that he would give the aid he promised. Now, do you go to the Forum to our master, and tell him this, how we are going to manage; that you, from Leonida, are going to be the chamberlain Saurea, until the dealer has brought the money for the asses.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> I'll do as you request me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> In the meantime, I'll amuse him here, if by chance he should come first.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> But what say you----? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> What do you want?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> If I give you a blow on the cheek with my fist, by-and-by, while I'm personating Saurea<milestone n="375" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Personating Saurea</lemma>:  Saurea, as the "atriensis," "chamberlain" or "gentleman-usher," was the head of the slave family; and it was his privilege to beat the other slaves, if they offended him or neglected their duties.</note>, don't you be offended.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> I' faith, but you'll have a care not to be touching me, if you are wise; you'll surely have changed your name to day with a bad omen<milestone n="377" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Your name to-day with a bad omen</lemma>:  Limiers says that this is said in allusion to his having assumed the name of "Saurea," which meant "a lash" or "scourge."</note>.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Do you endure the cuff that I, too, shall be giving you in return.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> I speak as it's in the habit of being done.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> I' faith, and I speak, too, of how I'm likely to act.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> Don't refuse me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Why I promise, I tell you, to give you a like return, just as you deserve.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> I'm off; I know that you'll put up with it by-and-by. But who's this? 'Tis he--'tis the very man himself. I'll return here just now; in the meantime do you detain him here; I want to inform the old gentleman. <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p></sp>

How often have I forbidden you to speak to Argyrippus, the son of Dem&aelig;netus, or to touch him, or to hold discourse with him, or to look at him? What has he ever given? What has he ordered to be brought to our house? Or do you fancy to yourself that smooth words are gold?--that clever speeches are as good as presents? Of your own accord you fell in love with him; of your own accord you go after him; of your own accord you request him to be sent for to you. Those who are givers, those same you laugh at; those who are cheating us, you are dying for. If any one promises you that he'll make you rich when his mother dies, ought you to be waiting for that? I' faith, a great risk impends over ourselves and the household, that we may die of hunger while we are awaiting her death. Now therefore, unless he brings me here twenty min&aelig; of silver, upon my word, though profuse of his tears, he shall certainly be turned from here out of doors.

This, through the valour of this comrade of mine, and through my own courtesy, has been brought about.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> What man is there more firm than myself at enduring stripes?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> By the powers, you who can extol your exploits now, as I can do exploits, which in peace and in warfare you have so ---- villanously performed; verily, in troth, many in number may they be now recounted according to your deserts; where you have defrauded him that trusted you, where you have proved faithless to your master, where knowingly and wilfully you have on solemn oath been perjured, where you have bored through party walls, where you have been detected in theft, where you have full oft pleaded your cause, as you hung up, against eight clever, hardened fellows<milestone n="568" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Eight clever, hardened fellows</lemma>:  These were probably the eight Lictors who attended the "Tresviri" or "Triumviri," which magistrates had especial jurisdiction over slaves with the power of ordering summary punishment.</note>, sturdy stripers.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Certainly I do admit, Leonida, that it is true as you say. But verily, in troth, your many misdeeds, too, may be recounted as well and truly; where wilfully you have proved faithless to the trusting, where you have been detected in theft and scourged in public, where you have proved forsworn, where you have laid hands on sacred things, where to your masters you have full oft proved a loss, a trouble, and a disgrace, where you have stoutly denied that that was given to you which had been entrusted to you, where you have proved more faithful to your wench than to your friend, where through your hardihood you have frequently reduced to weariness eight sturdy lictors, armed with pliant twigs of elm. <stage>To the AUDIENCE.</stage> Is the compliment ill repaid in the way that I've praised my comrade?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> Just as befits both me and yourself, and our dispositions.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Let's listen in silence. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> Dear me, a thought, I' faith, has just come into my mind; I very much wish I had a long stick here.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Why, is there ever anything better for a man than Salvation?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> What if I do wish it? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> It shall come to pass.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> I wish for her to be devoted to me alone this whole year round.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> You have obtained it. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> Do you really say so?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> I do say so for certain. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> Come to me, in my turn, and make trial: wish ardently for that which you especially desire to happen to you; it shall be done.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> What other thing could I ardently wish for rather than that of which I am in want? Oblige me with twenty silver min&aelig; to give to her mother.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> They shall be given: take care and be of good courage, your wishes shall be fulfilled.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> Just as they are wont, Salvation and Fortune are deceiving mortals.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> I this day have been the head in finding this money for you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> I have been the foot. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> Why, neither head nor foot of your talking is visible; I can understand neither what you mean, nor why you are trifling with me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> I think that now you've been teased enough; now let's disclose the matter as it really stands. Give your attention, Argyrippus, if you please. Your father has ordered us to bring this money to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> How very &agrave; propos and opportunely you have brought it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> <stage>giving him the bag</stage>. Here, in this, there will be twenty good min&aelig;, obtained by bad means: these, on certain conditions, he bade us give you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> That you would grant him her favours and an entertainment.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> Bid him come, I beg. For him who deserves it right well, we'll do what he wishes, him who has brought these scattered loves of ours to a happy result.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LEONIDA</speaker><p> You'll permit your father then, Argyrippus, to caress her?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> She, by being restored to me, will easily cause me to permit it. Prithee, Leonida, run, and beg my father to come here. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LIBANUS</speaker><p> He has been in the house some time.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> Are you attending? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DIABOLUS</speaker><p> I'm all attention.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> <stage>reads the agreement</stage>. "Diabolus, the son of Glaucus, has made a present to Cle&aelig;reta, the procuress, of twenty silver min&aelig;, that Philenium may be with him night and day for this whole year."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DIABOLUS</speaker><p> Yes, and not with any other person.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> Am I to add that? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DIABOLUS</speaker><p> Add it, and take care and write it plainly and distinctly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> <stage>writes it down, and then reads</stage>. "And not admit any other man whatever, because either her friend or her patron, she may choose to call him----"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DIABOLUS</speaker><p> Not any one! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> "Or because she may say that he is the lover of a female friend of hers. The door must be closed to all men except to yourself. On the door she must write that she is engaged.

Such is not the fact. Portraits were taken among the Romans in profile, in wax, which was laid on a plane surface; and probably other pictures were similarly constructed. In his jealousy, Diabolus will not allow Philenium to keep any useless or valueless picture, for fear lest she may melt it, to use the wax for tablets, as a medium of correspondence with a paramour. To a portrait of this kind, Laodamia probably refers in her Epistle to Protesila&uuml;s, in the Heroides of Ovid, l. 133: "But while as a warrior thou shalt be wielding arms in a distant region, I have a waxen figure which represents thy features."</note>, let her sell it; if she does not part with it, within four days from the time when she has received the money of you, let it be considered as your own; you to burn it if you like; so that she may have no wax, with which she may be able to make a letter. She is to invite no guest; you are to invite them. On no one of them is she to cast her eyes: if she looks upon any other person, she must be blind forthwith<milestone n="775" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Must be blind forthwith</lemma>:  This is probably a polite way of saying, "Let her leave the room forthwith."</note>. Then she is to drink cup by cup equally with yourself. She is to receive it from you; she is to hand it to you for you to drink. She is not to have a relish for less or for more than yourself."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DIABOLUS</speaker><p> That's quite to my taste.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> <stage>reading</stage>. "She is to remove all causes of suspicion from her, nor is she to tread on any man's foot<milestone n="780" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Tread on any man's foot</lemma>:  From passages in Ovid's Amours and Art of Love, we learn that this was a favourite method of communication by intriguing parties.</note> with her foot; when she rises she is neither to step upon the next couch, nor when she gets down from the couch is she thence to extend her hand to any one; she is not to give to nor ask of any one a ring for her to look at; she is not to present dice to any man whatever except to yourself; when she throws<milestone n="785" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">When she throws</lemma>:  When throwing the dice, it was the custom to invoke some favourite object, which was thought to bring good luck to the thrower. See the Notes to the Captivi, Act I., Sc. 1. She is not to say, "You I invoke," lest, by the ambiguity, it should be intended to apply to another man and not to her protector</note> them, she is not to say, You I call upon,' she is to mention your name. She may call on any Goddess that she pleases as propitious to her, but on no God: if she should chance to be very full of devotion, she is to tell you, and you are to pray to him that he may be propitious. She is neither to nod at any man, wink, or make a sign. In fine, if the lamp goes out, she is not to move a single joint of herself in the dark."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DIABOLUS</speaker><p> That's very good; so, in fact, she must do: but expunge that about the chamber; for my part, I prefer that she should move. I don't wish her to have an excuse, and to say that it is forbidden her by her vow.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> I understand, you fear some quibble. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DIABOLUS</speaker><p> Just so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> Then as you bid me, I'll strike it out. <stage>Erases it.</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> Hear the rest.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DIABOLUS</speaker><p> Say on, I'm listening.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> <stage>goes on reading</stage>. "And she is not to use any shuffling words, nor is she to know how to speak in any tongue but the Attic. If perchance she should begin to cough, she is not to cough so as to expose her tongue to any one in coughing. But if she should pretend as though she had a running at the nose<milestone n="801" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A running at the nose</lemma>:  The meaning seems to be, that if her nose runs by reason of a catarrh, she is not to open her mouth to put her tongue out, but that Diabolus is, in common parlance, to wipe her nose for her.</note>, even then she is not to do so; you yourself must wipe her lips rather than that she should open her mouth before another person. And her mother, the procuress, is not to come in in the middle of the wine, nor is she to utter a word of abuse to any one; if she does so speak, let this be her fine, to go for twenty days without wine."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DIABOLUS</speaker><p> You have written it nicely; a clever agreement.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> "Then, if she bids her maid-servant carry chaplets, garlands, or unguents, to Venus or to Cupid, your servant is to watch whether she gives them to Venus or to a man.

<sp><speaker>DIABOLUS</speaker><p> Follow this way. Am I to put up with this, or shall I hold my tongue? I would rather die than not discover this to his wife. And say you so, old man?

And would you be presenting the money to the procuress, and be secretly pilfering it from your wife at home? You should hang me, rather than you should carry off these matters undiscovered. On my honor, I'll really go this instant hence to her whom I'm sure that you'll very soon be destroying, in order that you may be able to supply your extravagance, unless, indeed, she shall first prevent you.</p></sp>

<stage>Enter ARTEMONA and the PARASITE, from the house of DEM&AElig;NETUS, at the further side of the stage.<note anchored="yes">In the early part of this Scene, the wife and the Parasite do not see Dem&aelig;netus, who is carousing in the front of Cle&aelig;reta's house, at the other side of the stage. We must remember that the Roman stage was of vast extent--as much, according to some writers, as 180 feet in width. Perhaps a wall extended a little forward by the side of the house, which would preclude the view of what was going on behind it and near to the door until Artemona and the Parasite had traversed the stage.</note></stage>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> Prithee, do you say that my husband is carousing here, together with my son?--and that he has carried to his mistress twenty min&aelig; of silver?--and that, with the knowledge of my son, his father is perpetrating this wickedness?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> Trust me in nothing henceforth, either divine or human, Artemona, if you find me untruthful in this matter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> Wretched then am I, who have supposed that, beyond others, my husband was sober, decent, chaste, and especially fond of his wife.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> But now, henceforth, understand that he, before all men, is a person of the smallest worth--a drunkard, a good-for-nothing fellow, unchaste, and a contemner of his own wife.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> I' faith, if this wasn't true, he would never be doing the things that he is now doing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> Upon my word, I too always hitherto took him to be a decent person; but by this action he declares himself,--to be carousing, indeed, together with his son, and, a decrepit old man, toying with a mistress in his company.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> For this it is, i' faith, that he's going out to dinner every day. He says that he's going to Archidemus, Chereas, Ch&aelig;restratus, Clinius, Chremes, Cratinus, Dinias, Demosthenes: while he's thinking of debauchery, and public dens of infamy with his harlot.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> Why don't you bid your maid-servants carry him off home upon their shoulders?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> Do you only be quiet. By my troth, I'll surely give him some trouble.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> I'm sure of it, that so it will befall him, so long, indeed, as you shall continue married to him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> I was fancying that this fellow was still giving attendance either in the senate or to his dependants: that for that reason it was, that, worn out with fatigue, he snored the whole night through. Wearied with his labours out of doors he comes home at night. Another's farm he ploughs, his own he leaves untilled. Both he himself is corrupted, and he corrupts his son as well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> Do you only follow me this way, I'll make you just now to fall upon the man himself in the very fact.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> <stage>returning to her</stage>. If perchance you were to see your husband reclining, if you beheld him with a garland on, caressing a mistress, could you recognize him?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> I hear.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> <stage>to PHILENIUM</stage>. Ought I not to filch the mantle from my wife at home, which she is so fond of, and bring it to you? Though my wife's life should last a whole year in consequence, by my troth I could not be dissuaded from doing so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> <stage>to ARTEMONA</stage>. Do you suppose that he has been accustomed to frequent a brothel to-day for the first time?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> Upon my faith, it was he that was pilfering me; whereas I was suspecting my maid-servants, and was tormenting the wretched creatures who were innocent all the while.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> <stage>apart to ARTEMONA</stage>. This fellow is fond of you, according to what he says.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> On my word, he's surely laying out all this at interest; for if, this day, he returns home, I'll especially have my revenge in kissing him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> <stage>handing the dice-box</stage>. Father, throw the dice; that afterwards I may have a throw.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> By all means. You, Philenium, for myself, and death for my wife. <stage>He throws.</stage> 'Tis Venus's cast<milestone n="911" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Venus's, cast</lemma>:  "Venereus jactus" was the best throw on the set of four "tali," or knuckle-bone dice, used by the ancients. It is supposed to have been a combination of the numbers, the sum of which was fourteen. When trying to throw the "Venereus jactus," it was usual to mention the name of the mistress of the thrower; and Dem&aelig;netus&gt; throws in "death to his wife," by way of supplement. From the next line, he appears to have been successful in his throw.</note>. Lads, clap your hands, and give me some honeyed wine in my cup, in honor of my throw.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. I can hold out no longer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. If you haven't learned the fulling trade<milestone n="913" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Haven't learned the fulling trade</lemma>:  He intends a pun here upon the word "durare," which meant either "to endure," "bear," or "hold out;" as also "to full," "harden," or "thicken cloth," by the fuller's art. Artemona says that she cannot "durare" in the first sense; on which the Parasite quibbles, and says, "Because you have not learnt the fulling art." In the next line also a ploy upon words is intended, as "invadi in oculos" may mean either "present yourself before his eyes" or "attack his eyes," and claw them out. No doubt the Parasite would have relished the fun, if she had taken his advice in the latter sense.</note>, it's not to be wondered at; now it's quite fitting for you to beset his eyes. <stage>They make their appearance before the revellers.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> By heavens, I will live, and you this day have made that invocation to your own great misfortune.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> Will some one run to fetch the undertakers<milestone n="916" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The undertaker</lemma>:  The "pollinctores" were slaves, who belonged to the "libitinarii," or "undertakers," and whose duty it was to anoint the body with oil and perfumes before it was burnt.</note>?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> Health to you, mother. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> Health indeed after this fashion!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PARASITE</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Dem&aelig;netus is dead. 'Tis time to betake myself hence: this battle bravely waxes hot. I'll be off to Diabolus. I'll tell him his orders are performed as he desired them; and in the meantime I'll persuade him that we should take a meal, while these people are squabbling. Afterwards, in fine, I'll bring him here to-morrow, to the procuress, that he may give her the twenty mince, that, in his turn, he in his passion may be enabled to obtain this damsel. I hope that Argyrippus will be able to be prevailed upon to allow him to pass each alternate night with him in her company; for, unless I obtain that, I've lost my patron<milestone n="925" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">My patron</lemma>:  "Regem." Literally, "my king;" the name which Parasites bestowed upon their patrons.</note>; so great is the passion of the man by reason of his love. <stage>He quietly withdraws.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> <stage>addressing PHILENIUM</stage>. What business have you to give a retreat here in your house to my husband?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILENIUM</speaker><p> Troth, he really will this day be the death of wretched me, through sheer disgust.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> <stage>to DEM &AElig;NETUS</stage>. Rise, wencher, be off home.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> I'm undone. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> Yes, you are<milestone n="928" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Yes, you are</lemma>:  He says, "nullus sum," in the sense of "I'm undone;" but she chooses to take it as though he had meant "I am a worthless fellow," which meaning these words are capable of bearing.</note>; don't, i' faith, gainsay it, you most vile of all men. Why, the cuckoo's still on his nest<milestone n="929" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Cuckoo's still on his nest</lemma>:  The cuckoo takes possession of the nests of other birds. and lays its eggs there. Artemona probably alludes to that fact, on seeing her husband under such a disgraceful circumstances.</note>. Rise, wencher, be off home.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> Woe to me! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> You prophesy correctly. Rise, wencher, be off home.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> Step a little this way then.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> Rise, wencher, be off home. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> Now, prithee, wife----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> Do you remember now that I'm your wife? It was but just now, when you were heaping abuse upon me, that I wasn't your wife.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> I'm utterly ruined. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> Why, pray? Does the breath of your wife smell strong?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> It smells of myrrh. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> Have you filched my mantle then to be giving to your harlot?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> By the powers--what, did he promise that he would filch your mantle?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> Won't you hold your tongue?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> I was going to dissuade him, mother. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> <stage>to ARGYRIPPUS</stage>. A pretty son! <stage>To DEM&AElig;NETUS.</stage> Is it proper for a father to teach these morals to his children? Are you ashamed of nothing?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> I' faith, if there's nothing else, I'm ashamed of you, wife.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> With your hoary head, your wife is dragging you, you cuckoo, from dens of infamy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> The dinner's cooking; mayn't I stop, only to take my dinner?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARTEMONA</speaker><p> Faith, you'll dine to-day on a heavy mishap, as you deserve.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>DEMAENETUS</speaker><p> <stage>rising</stage>. I shall repose but uncomfortably; my wife is taking me home condemned.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> I told you, father, not to devise ill against my mother.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PHILENIUM</speaker><p> No, I'll go in, in preference. <stage>To ARGYRIPPUS.</stage> Follow me this way, my life.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ARGYRIPPUS</speaker><p> Yes, I follow. </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>The COMEDIANS.</speaker>
<p>If this old fellow, unknown to his wife, has been in any way indulging his own inclinations, he has been doing nothing new or wonderful, or otherwise than others are in the habit of doing. No one is there of a disposition so severe, or of a temper so firm, but that he will enjoy himself when he has any opportunity. Now if you wish to interpose in behalf of this old man, so that he be not punished, we think that it can be brought about if you give us loud applause.
