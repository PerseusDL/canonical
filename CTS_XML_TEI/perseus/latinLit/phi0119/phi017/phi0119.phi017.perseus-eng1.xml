<stage>Scene.--Near Cyrene, in <placeName key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>; not far from the sea-shore, and before the cottage of D&AElig;MONES and the Temple of Venus, which has, probably, a small court before it, surrounded with a low wall.</stage>

<head>THE SUBJECT</head>

<p>D&AElig;MONES, an aged Athenian, having lost his property, goes to live in retirement near the sea-shore of <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>, in the vicinity of the Temple of Venus. It so happens that Labrax, a Procurer, makes purchase of two damsels, Pal&aelig;stra and Ampelisca, and comes to reside at <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>. Plesidippus, a young Athenian, sees Pal&aelig;stra there, and falls in love with her; and making an arrangement with the Procurer, gives him a sum in part payment for her, on which occasion, Labrax invites him to a sacrifice in the Temple of Venus. A Sicilian guest of his, however, named Charmides, persuades him to carry the young women over to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, where he is sure to make a greater profit by them. On this, the Procurer, accompanied by his guest, sets sail with them. A tempest arises, and they are shipwrecked. The young women escape in a boat, and arriving ashore, are hospitably received by the Priestess of Venus. Labrax and Charmides also escape, and on discovering where the women are, the former attempts to drag them by force from the Temple. On this they are protected by D&aelig;mones and Plesidippus, who, through Trachalio, finds out where they are. In the wreck a wallet has been lost, which belongs to Labrax, and in which is a casket enclosing some trinkets belonging to Pal&aelig;stra. Gripus, a servant of D&aelig;mones, draws this up with the rope attached to his net; and by means of these trinkets it is discovered that Pal&aelig;stra is the daughter of D&aelig;mones, whom he had lost in her infancy; on which she is given in marriage to Plesidippus by her father, who becomes reconciled to Labrax.

<sp><speaker>ARCTURUS</speaker><p><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Arcturus</lemma>:  This is a star near the tail of the Great Bear, whose rising and setting was supposed to be productive of great tempests. The name is derived from its situation, from the Greek words <foreign lang="greek">arkto\s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ou)ra\,</foreign> "the Bear's tail." It rises in the beginning of October. Pliny mentions it as rising on the 12th, and Columella on the 5th of that month.   We may here remark, that the Play is called "the Fisherman's Rope" in consequence of the important part which, towards the close, the rope acts in bringing the wallet to shore in the net. The scenery of this Play must have been much more picturesque than that of those of Plautus in general. At the end of the stage is a prospect of the sea, interspersed with rocks in the distance, while others project upon the front of the stage. The City of <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> is also seen in the distance; while nearer to the Audience is the Temple of Venus, with an altar in front of it; and adjoining the Temple is the cottage of D&aelig;mones. Some other cottages are also seen at a distance. If the comparison may be made, it bears some slight resemblance to the <title>Tempest</title> of Shakspeare.</note>
</p>
<p>WITH him who sways all nations, seas, and lands, I am a fellow-citizen in the realms of the Gods. I am, as you see<milestone n="3" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">As you see</lemma>:  The actor is supposed here to point to a star placed on his forehead, or on the head-dress which he wears.</note>, a bright and shining star, a Constellation that ever in its season rises here on earth and in the heavens. Arcturus is my name. By night, I am glittering in the heavens and amid the Gods, passing among mortals in the day. Other Constellations, too, descend from the heavens upon the earth; Jove, who is the ruler of Gods and men--he disperses us here in various directions among the nations, to observe the actions, manners, piety, and faith of men, just as the means of each avail him. Those who commence villanous suits at law upon false testimony, and those who, in court, upon false oath deny a debt, their names written down, do we return to Jove. Each day does he learn who here is calling for vengeance. Whatever wicked men seek here to gain their cause through perjury, who succeed before the judge in their unjust demands, the same case adjudged does he judge over again, and he fines them in a penalty much greater than the results of the judgment they have gained. The good men written down on other tablets<milestone n="21" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Written down on other tablets</lemma>:  This is not unlike the words of the Psalmist, Psalm lvi., 8: "Thou tellest my wanderings; put thou my tears into thy bottle. Are they not in thy book?"</note> does he keep. And still these wicked persons entertain a notion of theirs, that they are able to appease <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> with gifts, with sacrifice; both their labour and their cost they lose. This, for this reason, is so, because no petition of the perjured is acceptable to Him. If any person that is supplicating the Deities is pious, he will more easily procure pardon for himself than he that is wicked. Therefore I do advise you this, you who are good and who pass your lives in piety and in virtue--still persevere, that one day you may rejoice that so you did. Now, the reason for which I've come hither, I will disclose to you. First, then, Diphilus<milestone n="32" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Diphilus</lemma>:  He was a Greek Comic Poet, from whom Plautus is supposed to have borrowed the plot of several of his Plays.</note> has willed the name of this city to be <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName><milestone n="33" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U"><placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName></lemma>:  This was a famous city of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, said to have been founded by Arist&aelig;us, the son of the Nymph Cyrene. It was situate in a fertile plain, about eleven miles from the Mediterranean, and was the capital of a district called "<placeName key="tgn,7000643">Pentapolis</placeName>," from the five cities which it contained.</note>. There <stage>pointing to the cottage</stage> dwells D&aelig;mones, in the country and in a cottage very close adjoining to the sea, an old gentleman who has come hither in exile from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, no unworthy man. And still, not for his bad deserts has he left his country, but while he was aiding others, meanwhile himself he embarrassed: a property honorably acquired he lost by his kindly ways. Long since, his daughter, then a little child, was lost; a most villanous fellow bought her of the thief, and this Procurer<milestone n="41" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">This Procurer</lemma>:  "<placeName key="tgn,7005775">Leno</placeName>." The calling of the "lenones" was to traffic in young female slaves, to whom they gave an accomplished education, and then sold them or let them out for the purposes of prostitution. The "lenones" were deservedly reckoned infamous.</note> brought the maiden hither to <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>. A certain Athenian youth, a citizen of this city, beheld her as she was going home from the music-school. He begins to love her; to the Procurer he comes; he purchases the damsel for himself at the price of thirty min&aelig;, and gives him earnest, and binds the Procurer with an oath. This Procurer, just as befitted him, did not value at one straw his word, or what, on oath, he had said to the young man. He had a guest, a fit match for himself, an old man of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, a rascal from <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName><milestone n="50" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U"><placeName key="tgn,7003808">Agrigentum</placeName></lemma>:  This was a town of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, on Mount Acragas, about two miles from the sea. Its inhabitants were famed for their luxurious mode of living.</note>, a traitor to his native city; this fellow began to extol the beauty of that maiden, and of the other damsels, too, that were belonging to him. On this he began to persuade the Procurer to go together with himself to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; he said that there the men were given to pleasure; that there he might be enabled to become a wealthy man; that there was the greatest profit from courtesans. He prevails. A ship is hired by stealth. Whatever he has, by night the Procurer carries it on board ship from his house; the young man who purchased the damsel of him he has told that he is desirous of performing a vow to Venus. This is the Temple of Venus, here <stage>pointing at it</stage>, and here, for that reason, has he invited the youth hither to a breakfast<milestone n="61" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To a breakfast</lemma>: -- This probably refers to the meal which took place after the sacrifice, for which certain portions of the victim, particularly the entrails, were reserved. See the Miles Gloriosus, l. 712.</note>. From there at once did he embark on board ship, and he carried off the courtesans. Some other persons informed the young man what things were going on, how that the Procurer had departed. When the young man came to the harbour, their ship had got a great way out to sea. When I beheld how that the maiden was being carried off, I brought at the same instant both relief to her and destruction to the Procurer; the storm I rebuked, and the waves of the sea I aroused. For the most violent Constellation of them all am 1, Arcturus; turbulent I am when rising, when I set, more turbulent still. Now, cast ashore there, both the Procurer and his guest are sitting upon a rock; their ship is dashed to pieces. But this maiden, and another as well, her attendant, affrighted, have leaped from the ship into a boat. At this moment the waves are bringing them from the rocks to land, to the cottage of this old man, who is living here in exile, whose roof and tiles the storm has stript off. And this is his servant who is coming out of doors. The youth will be here just now, and you shall see him, who purchased the maiden of the Procurer. Now, fare ye well, and may your foes<milestone n="82" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">May your foes</lemma>:  The Carthaginians are alluded to; this Play having been written during the second Punic war.</note> distrust themselves. <stage>(Exit.)</stage>

What need of words is there? It was no storm, but what Alcmena met with in Euripides<milestone n="86" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In Euridpids</lemma>:  He alludes to a Tragedy of Euripides so named, where a dreadful storm was so accurately represented that at length the Play became a proverbial expression for tempestuous weather. Madame Dacier observes, that it was not strange for Sceparnio to mention this, as he might often have seen it represented at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> upon the stage. This notion is somewhat far-fetched, as it is not likely that Plautns troubled himself about such a fine point, or that the Audience was gifted with any such nicety of perception as to note his accuracy, even if he had. It has been suggested, and not at all improbably, that Plautus borrowed the Scene of the thunder and lightning in his Amphitryon from this Play of Euripides.</note>; it has so knocked all the tiles from off the roof; more light has it given us, and has added to our windows.</p></sp></div1>

When the ancients were about to undertake any voyage, they used to make a sacrifice to <placeName key="tgn,2086286">Hercules</placeName> before they set off, which was for that reason called 'propter viam;' and the custom was to burn all they didn't eat.

The surge is driving the boat away from the rock towards the shore. Not a pilot could have ever done it better. I don't think that I ever saw billows more huge. They are saved, if they can escape those waves. Now, now's the danger; it has sent one overboard! See you that one whom the waves have thrown out of the boat? Still, she's in a shallow place; she'll easily wade through it now. O capital! now she's safe; she has escaped from the water; she's now on shore. But that other one has now sprung towards the land from the boat--from her alarm she has fallen into the waves upon her knees.

<sp><speaker>AMPELISCA</speaker><p> Woe to your head and life!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> To your own, my dear Ampelisca. I was sure that the Procurer would do that which he has done; I often said so. It were better I should let my hair grow<milestone n="377" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Let my hair grow</lemma>:  It is supposed to have been the custom of soothsayers and diviners to let their hair grow to a greater length than usual</note>, and set up for a soothsayer.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPELISCA</speaker><p> Did you not take care then, you and your master, that he shouldn't go away, when you knew this?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> What could he do? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPELISCA</speaker><p> If he was in love, do you ask what he could do? Both night and day he should have kept watch; he should have been always on his guard. But, by my troth, he has done like many others; thus finely has Plesidippus taken care of her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> For what reason do you say that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPELISCA</speaker><p> The thing is evident.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TEACH.</speaker><p> Don't you know this? Even he who goes to the bath to bathe, while there he carefully keeps an eye upon his garments, still they are stolen; inasmuch as some one of those that he is watching is a rogue; the thief easily marks him for whom he's upon the watch; the keeper knows not which one is the thief. But bring me to her; where is she?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPELISCA</speaker><p> Well then, go here into the Temple of <placeName key="tgn,2094077">Venus</placeName>; you'll find her sitting there, and in tears. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> How disagreable is that to me already. But why is she weeping?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPELISCA</speaker><p> I'll tell you; she's afflicting herself in mind for this; because the Procurer took away a casket from her which she had, and in which she kept that by which she might be enabled to recognize her parents; she fears that this has been lost.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Where was that little casket, pray?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPELISCA</speaker><p> There, on board the ship; he himself locked it up in his wallet, that there mightn't be the means by which she might recognize her parents.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> O scandalous deed! to require her to be a slave, who ought to be a free woman.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPELISCA</speaker><p> Therefore she now laments that it has gone to the bottom along with the ship. There, too, was all the gold and silver of the Procurer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Some one, I trust, has dived and brought it up.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPELISCA</speaker><p> For this reason is she sad and disconsolate, that she has met with the loss of them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Then have I the greater occasion to do this, to go in and console her, that she mayn't thus distress herself in mind. For I know that many a lucky thing has happened to many a one beyond their hopes.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMPELISCA</speaker><p> But I know too that hope has deceived many who have hoped.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Therefore a patient mind is the best remedy for affliction. I'll go in, unless you wish for anything. <stage>Goes into the Temple.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>AMP. GO.</speaker><p> <stage>To herself.</stage> I'll do that which the Priestess requested me, and I'll ask for some water here at the neighbour's; for she said that if I asked for it in her name, they would give it directly. And I do think that I never saw a more worthy old lady, one to whom I should think that it is more befitting for Gods and men to show kindness. How courteously, how heartily, how kindly, how, without the least difficulty, she received us into her home, trembling, in want, drenched, shipwrecked, half dead; not otherwise, in fact, than if we had been her own offspring. How kindly did she herself, just now, tucking up her garments, make the water warm for us to bathe. Now, that I mayn't keep her waiting, I'll fetch some water from the place where she requested me. <stage>Knocking at the door of D&AElig;MONES.</stage> <placeName key="tgn,2395733">Hallo</placeName>, there, is there any one in the cottage? is any one going to open this door?

It has been suggested that a double entendre is meant; and such may possibly be the case, though the pungency of the passage is lost by reason of the hiatus in the next line. The meaning may, however, be harmless, and he may intend to say that at present he is busy thatching the house, but that at nightfall he will have finished, when she may count upon being hospitably entertained.</note> to receive you, a damsel, thus early in the morning * * * But what have you to say, my smiling, pretty one. <stage>Chucks her under the chin.</stage></p></sp>

In a wondrous and incredible manner has this haul turned out prosperously for me, nor yet have I this day taken a single ounce weight of fish, but only that which I am here bringing with me in my net. For when I arose in the middle of the night, and without sloth, I preferred profit to sleep and rest; in the raging tempest, I determined to try how I might lighten the poverty of my master and my own servitude, not sparing of my own exertions. Most worthless is the man that is slothful, and most detestably do I hate that kind of men. It behoves him to be vigilant who wishes to do his duty in good time; for it befits him not to be waiting until his master arouses him to his duties.

<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> * * * * * There was a boisterous tempest yesterday; no fish have I, young man; don't you be supposing I have. Don't you see that I'm carrying my dripping net without the scaly race?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> I' faith, I'm not wishing for fish so much as I am in need of your conversation.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Then, whoever you are, you are worrying me to death with your annoyance.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> <stage>takes hold of him</stage>. I'll not allow you to go away from here; stop.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Take you care of a mishap, if you please; but why the plague are you dragging me back?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Listen. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> I won't listen.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> But, upon my faith, you shall listen.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Nay but, another time, tell me what you want.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Come now, it's worth your while at once to hear what I want to tell you. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Say on, whatever it is.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> See whether any person is following near us. <stage>Looks back.</stage> GRIP. Why, what reason is there that it should matter to me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> So it is; but can you give me some good advice?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> What's the business? Only tell me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> I'll tell you; keep silence; if only you'll give me your word that you won't prove treacherous to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> I do give you my word; I'll be true to you, whoever you are.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Listen. I saw a person commit a theft; I knew the owner to whom that same property belonged. Afterwards I came myself to the thief, and I made him a proposal in these terms: "I know the person on whom that theft was committed; now if you are ready to give me half, I'll not make a discovery to the owner." He didn't even give me an answer. What is it fair should be given me out of it? Half, I trust you will say.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Aye, even more; but unless he gives it you, I think it ought to be told to the owner.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> I'll act on your advice. Now give me your attention; for it is to yourself all this relates.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> What has been done by me?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> <stage>pointing at the wallet</stage>. I've known the person for a long time to whom that wallet belongs.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> What do you mean?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> And in what manner it was lost.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> But I know in what manner it was found; and I know the person who found it, and who is now the owner. That, i' faith, is not a bit the more your matter than it is my own. I know the person to whom it now belongs; you, the person to whom it formerly belonged. This shall no individual get away from me; don't you be expecting to get it in a hurry.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> If the owner comes, shan't he get it away?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> That you mayn't be mistaken, no born person is there that's owner of this but my own self--who took this in my own fishing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Was it really so?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Which fish in the sea will you say "is my own?" When I catch them, if indeed I do catch them, they are my own; as my own I keep them. They are not claimed as having a right to freedom<milestone n="973" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Claimed as having a right to freedom</lemma>:  "Manu asserere" was "to assert" or "claim the liberty of a slave by action at law." Gripus applies the term to the fish of the sea, and means to say that when he catches them, he sells them as his own "venales," or "slaves."</note> nor does any person demand a share in them. In the market I sell them all openly as my own wares. Indeed, the sea is, surely, common to all persons.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> I agree to that; prithee, then, why any the less is it proper that this wallet should be common to me? It was found in the sea.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Assuredly you are an outrageously impudent fellow; for if this is justice which you are saying, then fishermen would be ruined. Inasmuch as, the moment that the fish were exposed upon the stalls, no one would buy them; every person would be demanding his own share of the fish for himself; he would be saying that they were caught in the sea that was common to all.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> What do you say, you impudent fellow? Do you dare to compare a wallet with fish? Pray, does it appear to be the same thing?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> The matter doesn't lie in my power; when I've cast my hook and net into the sea, whatever has adhered I draw out. Whatever my net and hooks have got, that in especial is my own.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Nay but, i' faith, it is not; if, indeed, you've fished up any article that's made<milestone n="986" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Article that's made</lemma>:  "Vas." An utensil or article that is manufactured.</note> </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Philosopher, you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> But look now, you conjurer, did you ever see a fisherman who caught a wallet-fish, or exposed one for sale in the market? But, indeed, you shan't here be taking possession of all the profits that you choose; you expect, you dirty fellow, to be both a maker of wallets<milestone n="990" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Maker of wallets</lemma>:  "Vitor," or "vietor," was a maker of "viduli," or "wallets," which were made of osier, and then covered with leather of various colours.</note> and a fisherman. Either you must show me a fish that is a wallet, or else you shall carry nothing off that wasn't produced in the sea and has no scales.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> What, did you never hear before to-day that a wallet was a fish?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Villain, there is no such fish.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Yes, there certainly is; I, who am a fisherman, know it. But it is seldom caught; no fish more rarely comes near the land.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> It's to no purpose; you hope that you can be cheating me, you rogue. Of what colour is it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>looking at the wallet</stage>. Of this colour very few are caught: some are of a purple skin, there are great and black ones also.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> I understand; by my troth, you'll be turning into a wallet-fish I fancy, if you don't take care; your skin will be purple, and then afterwards black.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. What a villain this that I have met with to-day!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> We are wasting words; the day wears apace. Consider, please, by whose arbitration do you wish us to proceed?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> By the arbitration of the wallet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Really so, indeed? You are a fool.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> My respects to you, Mister <placeName key="tgn,2716103">Thales</placeName><milestone n="1003" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U"><placeName key="tgn,2716103">Thales</placeName></lemma>:  Thales of <placeName key="tgn,2511712">Miletus</placeName> was one of the seven wise men of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.

<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> <stage>holding him</stage>. You shan't carry that off this day, unless you find a place of safe keeping for it, or an umpire, by whose arbitration this matter may be settled.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Prithee, are you in your senses?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> I'm mad, in need of hellebore.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> But I'm troubled with sprites; still I shan't let this go. <stage>Hugs the wallet.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Only add a single word more, that instant I'll drive my fists smash into your brains. This instant on this spot, just as a new napkin is wont to be wrung, I'll wring out of you whatever moisture there is, if you don't let this go. <stage>Seizes the wallet.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Touch me; I'll dash you down on the ground just in such fashion as I'm in the habit of doing with a polypus fish<milestone n="1010" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With a polypus fish</lemma>:  The polypus not being eatable, the fishermen would throw it violently on the ground on finding it in the nets.</note>.

<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> What need is there? Nay, in preference, divide the booty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> You can't get anything from here but harm to yourself, so don't expect it. I'm taking myself off.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> But I'll turn aside your ship from that direction, that you mayn't be off anywhere--stop. <stage>Stands in front of him, and holds the rope.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> If you are the helmsman of this ship, I'll be the pilot. Let go of the rope now, you villain.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> I will let go; do you let go of the wallet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> I' faith, you shall never this day become a scrap the more wealthy from this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> You cannot convince me by repeatedly denying, unless either a part is given me, or it is referred to arbitration, or it is placed in safe keeping.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> What, that which I got out of the sea----?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> But I spied it out from the shore.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p>--With my own pains and labour, and net and boat.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> If now the owner, whose property it is, were to come, how am I, who espied from afar that you had taken this, a bit the less the thief than yourself?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> None whatever. <stage>Going.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> <stage>seizing the net</stage>. Stop, you whip-knave; just let me learn of you by what reasoning I am not the sharer, and yet the thief.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> I don't know; neither do I know these city laws of yours, only that I affirm that this is mine. <stage>Looks at the wallet.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> And I, too, say that it is mine.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Stay now; I've discovered by what method you may be neither thief nor sharer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> By what method?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Let me go away from here; you quietly go your own way, and don't you inform against me to any one, and I won't give anything to you. You hold your tongue; I'll be mum. This is the best and the fairest plan.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACE.</speaker><p> Well, what proposition do you venture to make?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> I've made it already; for you to go away, to let go of the rope, and not to be a nuisance to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Stop while I propose terms.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> I' faith, do, prithee, dispose<milestone n="1031" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Propose--dispose</lemma>: -2. He plays on the resemblance of the words <foreign lang="la">refero</foreign>, "to make a proposal," and <foreign lang="la">aufero</foreign>, "to betake one's self away,"</note> of yourself forthwith.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Do you know any one in these parts?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> My own neighbours I must know.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Where do you live here? </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> <stage>pointing to the cottage of D&AElig;MONES</stage>. The person that lives in that cottage, should you like it to be decided by his arbitration?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Let go of the rope for a moment while I step aside and consider.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Be it so. <stage>Lets go of the rope.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Capital, the thing's all right; the whole of this booty is my own. He's inviting me here inside of my own abode to my own master as umpire. By my troth, he never this day will award three obols away from his own servant. Assuredly, this fellow doesn't know what proposal he has been making. <stage>To TRACHALIO.</stage> I'll go to the arbitrator with you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> What then? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Although I know for sure that this is my own lawful right, let that be done rather than I should now be fighting with you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Now you satisfy me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Although you are driving me before an arbitrator whom I don't know, if he shall administer justice, although he is unknown, he is as good as known to me; if he doesn't, though known, he is the same as though entirely unknown.</p></sp></div1>

<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> For my part, I neither ask for a share of that wallet there, nor have I ever said this day that it is my own; but in it there is a little casket that belongs to this female <stage>pointing to PAL&AElig;STRA</stage>, whom a short time since I averred to be free born.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Say you so? To show it to them?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> He doesn't say unreasonably, Gripus, that the wallet should be shown.</p></sp>

Festus tells us that this kind of casket was made of wicker, and received its name from its resemblance to a horse's tail, "cauda;" others, however, perhaps with more probability, derive it from "caudex," "a piece of wood."</note> in that wallet, in which are tokens by means of which she may be enabled to recognize her parents, by whom, when little, she was lost at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, as I said before.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> May <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> and the Gods confound you. What do you say, you sorcerer of a fellow? What, are these women dumb, that they are not able to speak for themselves?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> They are silent for this reason, because a silent woman is always better than a talking one.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Then, i' faith, by your way of speaking, you are neither a man nor a woman to my notion.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Why, because neither talking nor silent are you ever good for anything. Prithee <stage>to D&AElig;MONES</stage>, shall I ever be allowed to-day to speak?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> If you utter a single word more this day, I'll break your head for you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> As I had commenced to say it, old gentleman, I beg you to order him to give up that casket to these young women; if for it he asks any reward for himself, it shall be paid; whatever else is there besides, let him keep for himself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Now at last you say that, because you are aware it is my right; just now you were asking to go halves.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> Aye, and even still I ask it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> I've seen a kite making a swoop, even when he got nothing at all however. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> <stage>to GRIPUS</stage>. Can't I shut your mouth without a drubbing?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>pointing to TRACHALIO</stage>. If that fellow is silent, I'll be silent; if he talks, allow me to talk in my own behalf.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Please now give me this wallet, Gripus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> I'll trust it to you; but for you to return it me, if there are none of those things in it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> It shall be returned. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Take it. <stage>Gives him the wallet.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Now then listen, Pal&aelig;stra and Ampelisca, to this which I say: is this the wallet, in which this Procurer said that your casket was?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRA</speaker><p> It is the same. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Troth, to my sorrow, I'm undone; how on the instant, before she well saw it, she said that it was it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRA</speaker><p> I'll make this matter plain to you, instead of difficult. There ought to be a casket of wicker-work there in that wallet; whatever is in there I'll state by name; don't you show me anything. If I say wrong, I shall then have said this to no purpose; then you shall keep these things, whatever is in there for yourselves. But if the truth, then I entreat you that what is my own may be restored to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> I agree; you ask for bare justice only, in my way of thinking, at least.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> But, i' faith, in mine, for extreme injustice; what if she is a witch or a sorceress, and shall mention exactly everything that's in it P Is a sorceress to have it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> She shan't get it, unless she tells the truth; in vain will she<milestone n="1141" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In vain will she</lemma>:  By this he clearly means to say that conjuring is all nonsense, and that she has no chance of telling what is in it merely by guessing.</note> be conjuring.

This, though not adopted by Fleckeisen, seems to be the right reading, and we have followed the conjecture of the learned Rost in adopting it. Gripus undoes the strap, then holds the wallet to his master, saying, "Take it, it's unfastened." D&aelig;mones takes it, and at once draws out the casket, on seeing which Girpus makes an exclamation of surprise and disappointment.</note>, it's unfastened. <stage>D&AElig;MONES takes out the casket.</stage> Alas, I'm undone; I see the casket.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> <stage>holding it up, and addressing PAL&AElig;STRA</stage>. Is this it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRA</speaker><p> That is it. O my parents, here do I keep you locked up; here have I enclosed both my wealth and my hopes of recognizing you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Then, by my faith, the Gods must be enraged with you, whoever you are, who fasten up your parents in so narrow a compass.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Gripus, come hither, your cause is being tried. <stage>To PAL&AElig;STRA.</stage> Do you, young woman, away at a distance there say what's in it, and of what appearance; mention them all. By my troth, if you make ever so slight a mistake, even if afterwards you wish, madam, to correct yourself, you'll be making a great mistake.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> You demand what's real justice. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TRACHALIO</speaker><p> By my troth, then, he doesn't demand yourself; for you are the opposite of justice.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Now then, say on, young woman. Gripus, give attention and hold your tongue.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRA</speaker><p> There are some trinkets. </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PALAESTRA</speaker><p> In the first place, there's a little sword of gold, with an inscription.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Just tell me, what the characters are upon that little sword.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRA</speaker><p> The name of my father. Next, on the other side, there's a little two-edged axe, of gold likewise, with an inscription: there on the axe is the name of my mother.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Stay; tell me, what's the name of your father upon the little sword?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRA</speaker><p> D&aelig;mones. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Immortal Gods! where in the world are my hopes?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Aye, by my troth, and where are mine?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Do proceed forthwith, I entreat you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Cautiously, or else <stage>aside</stage> away to utter perdition.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Say, what's the name of your mother, here upon the little axe?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRA</speaker><p> D&aelig;dalis. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> The Gods will that I should be preserved.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> But that I should be ruined.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> This must be my own daughter, Gripus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> She may be for me, indeed. <stage>To TRACHALIO.</stage> May all the Gods confound you who this day saw me with your eyes, and myself as well for a blockhead, who didn't look about a hundred times first to see that no one was watching me, before I drew the net out of the water.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRA</speaker><p> Next, there's a little knife of silver, and two little hands linked together, and then a little sow.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Nay, then, go and be hanged, you with your little sow and with your little pigs.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PALAESTRA</speaker><p> There's also a golden drop<milestone n="1171" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A golden drop</lemma>:  The "bulla" was a ball of metal, so called from its resemblance in shape to a drop or bubble of water. These were especially worn by the Roman children, suspended from the neck, and were generally made of thin plates of gold, of about the size of a walnut. The use of them was derived from the people of Etruria, and though originally used solely by the children of the Patricians, they were subsequently worn by all of free birth. The children of the "libertini," or "freed-men," wore "bull&aelig;," but made of leather. The "bulla" was laid aside at the same time as the "toga pr&aelig;texta," and was on that occasion consecrated to the Lares. It must be owned that the "little sow," mentioned in the line before, was rather a curious soit of trinket. Thornton thinks that the word "sucula" admitted of a double entendre, though of what nature is now unknown.</note>, which my father presented to me upon my birthday.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Undoubtedly there is; but I cannot restrain myself any longer from embracing you.

<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Come, then, let's go, my daughter, to your mother, who will be better able to enquire of you into this matter from proofs; who had you more in her hands, and is more thoroughly acquainted with your tokens.</p></sp>

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. Am I not a blockhead of a fellow, to have this day fished up that wallet? Or, when I had fished it up, not to have hidden it somewhere in a secret spot? By my troth, I guessed that it would be a troublesome booty for me, because it fell to me in such troublous weather. I' faith, I guess that there's plenty of gold and silver there. What is there better for me than to be off hence in-doors and secretly hang myself--at least for a little time, until this vexation passes away from me? <stage>Goes into the cottage.</stage></p></sp></div1>

And, by my troth, full often is a bait placed in them, which bait if any greedy person greedily snaps at, through his own greediness he is caught in the trap.

This booty seems to me<milestone n="1242" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">This booty seems to me</lemma>:  This passage is very obscure, and has been variously interpreted.

What, ought I to conceal what I know was brought to me as belonging to another? By no means will my friend D&aelig;mones do that. 'Tis ever most becoming for prudent men to be on their guard against this, that they be not themselves confederates with their servants in evil-doing.

<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> At times, I've seen the Comedians, when acting, in this fashion repeat sayings in a wise manner, and be applauded for them, when they pointed out this prudent conduct to the public.

Now I'll go look here, in the Temple of Venus, for that other female, that her at least I may take away, the only portion of my property that remains. <stage>He retires a little distance.</stage></p></sp></div1>

<stage>Enter GRIPUS, from the cottage of D&AElig;MONES, with a spit in his hand.</stage>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>calling to the PEOPLE within</stage>. By the powers, you shall never this day at nightfall behold Gripus alive, unless the wallet is restored to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> <stage>behind</stage>. I'm ready to die; when I hear mentior made anywhere of a wallet, I'm thumped, as it were with a stake, upon the breast.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>at the door, continuing</stage>. That scoundrel is free; I, the person that held the net in the sea, and drew up the wallet, to him you refuse to give anything.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> <stage>behind</stage>. O ye immortal Gods! by his talk this person has made me prick up my ears.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>continuing</stage>. By my troth, in letters a cubit long, I'll immediately post it up in every quarter, "If any person has lost a wallet with plenty of gold and silver, let him come to Gripus." You shan't keep it as you are wishing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> <stage>behind</stage>. I' faith, this person knows, as I think, who has got the wallet. This person must be accosted by me; ye Gods, aid me, I do entreat you.
<stage>Some one calls GRIPUS, from within.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Why are you calling me back in-doors? <stage>He rubs away at the spit.</stage> I want to clean this here before the door. But surely this, i' faith, has been made of rust, and not of iron; so that the more I rub it, it becomes quite red and more slender. Why surely this spit has been drugged<milestone n="1302" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Has been drugged</lemma>:  He alludes to the rust which has eaten into the spit and worn it away.</note>; it does waste away so in my hands.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> <stage>accosting him</stage>. Save you, young man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> May the Gods prosper you with your shorn pate<milestone n="1303" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Your shorn pate</lemma>:  Madame Dacier suggests that Labrax has had his hair cut off in consequence of having escaped from shipwreck, which, indeed, was often done during the continuance of a storm by those at sea.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> What's going on? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> A spit being cleaned.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> How do you do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> What are you? Prithee, are you a medicant<milestone n="1304" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A medicant</lemma>:  He plays upon the resemblance of the words "medicus" and "mendicus." To give effect to the pun, we have, with <placeName key="tgn,1136756">Thornton</placeName>, coined the word "medicant," in the sense of "doctor" or "physician."</note>?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> No, i' faith, I am more than a medicant by one letter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Then you are a "mendicant."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> You've hit it to a nicety<milestone n="1305" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Hit it to a nicety</lemma>:  "Tetigisti acu." Literally, "you've hit it with the point"--that is, "exactly."</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Your appearance seems suitable to it. But what's the matter with you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Troth, this last night I was shipwrecked at sea the vessel was cast away, and to my misfortune I lost there everything that I had.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> What did you lose?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> A wallet with plenty of gold and silver.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Do you at all remember what there was in the wallet which was lost? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> What matters for us now to be talking of it, if, in spite of it, it's lost?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> What if I know who has found it? I wish to learn from you the tokens.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Eight hundred golden pieces were there in a purse, besides a hundred Philippean min&aelig; in a wash-leather bag apart.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Troth, it is a noble prize; I shall be getting a handsome reward. The Gods show respect to mortals; therefore I shall come off bounteously rewarded. No doubt, it is this man's wallet. <stage>To LABRAX.</stage> Do you proceed to relate the rest.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> A large talent of silver of full weight was in a purse, besides a bowl, a goblet, a beaker, a boat, and a cup.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Astonishing! you really did have some splendid riches.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> A shocking expression is that, and a most abominable one. "You did have, and now have not."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> What would you be ready to give to one who should find these out for you, and give you information? Say, speedily and at once.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Three hundred didrachms. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Rubbish.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Four hundred. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Old thrums.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Five hundred. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> A rotten nut.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Six hundred.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> You are prating about mere tiny weevils.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> I'll give seven hundred.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Your mouth is hot, you are cooling it<milestone n="1326" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">You are cooling it</lemma>:  He is supposed here to allude to the act of drawing the breath into the mouth with the teeth half closed, which produces a sensation of coolness; meaning, that he doesn't speak out and offer with boldness.</note> just now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> I'll give a thousand didrachms.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> You are dreaming.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> I add no more; be off with you. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Hear me then; if, i' faith, I should be off from here, I shan't be here.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Would you like a hundred as well as the thousand?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> You are asleep.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Say how much you ask.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> That you mayn't be adding anything against your inclination, a great talent; it's not possible for three obols to be bated thence; then do you say either "yes" or "no" at once.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. What's to be done here? It's a matter of necessity, I see: <stage>to GRIPUS</stage> the talent shall be paid.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>going towards the altar</stage>. Just step this way; I wish Venus here to put the question to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Whatever you please, that command me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Touch this altar of Venus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> <stage>touching it</stage>. I am touching it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> By Venus here must you swear to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> What must I swear?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> What I shall bid you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Dictate in words just as you like. <stage>Aside.</stage> What I've got at home, I shall never beg<milestone n="1335" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">I shall never beg</lemma>:  He says this to himself, meaning that he has a sufficient stock of perjury at home, without going to another person for it.

<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Take hold of this altar.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> <stage>taking hold of it</stage>. I am taking hold of it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Swear that you will pay me the money on that same day on which you shall gain possession of the wallet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Be it so. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>speaking, while LABRAX repeats after him</stage>. Venus of Cyrene, I invoke thee as my witness, if I shall find that wallet which I lost in the ship, safe with the gold and silver, and it shall come into my possession----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> "Then to this Gripus do I promise;" say so and place your hand upon me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Then to this Gripus do I promise, Venus, do thou hear me----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>followed by LABRAX</stage>. "That I will forthwith give him a great talent of silver."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> If you defraud me, say, may Venus utterly destroy your body, and your existence in your calling. <stage>Aside.</stage> As it is, do you have this for yourself, when you've once taken the oath.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> If, Venus, I shall do anything amiss against this oath, I supplicate thee that all Procurers may henceforth be wretched.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. As it is, it shall be so, even if you do keep your oath. Do you wait here; <stage>going towards the cottage</stage>--I'll at once make the old gentleman come out; do you forthwith demand of him that wallet. <stage>Goes in.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. If ever so much he shall restore to me this wallet, I'm not this day indebted to him three obols even. It's according to my own intention what my tongue swears. <stage>The door opens.</stage> But I'll hold my peace; see, here he's coming out, and bringing the old man.</p></sp></div1>

<stage>Enter GRIPUS, followed by D&AElig;MONES, with the wallet.</stage>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Follow this way. Where is this Procurer? Hark you <stage>to LABRAX</stage>, see now; this person <stage>pointing at D&AElig;MONES</stage> has got your wallet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> I have got it, and I confess that it is in my possession; and if it's yours, you may have it. Everything, just as each particular was in it, shall in like manner be given safe to you. <stage>Holding it out.</stage> Take it, if it's yours.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Immortal Gods, it is mine. <stage>Takes it.</stage> Welcome, dear wallet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Is it yours? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Do you ask the question? If indeed, i' faith, it were in Jove's possession, still it is my own.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Everything in it is safe; there has only been one casket taken out of it, with some trinkets, by means of which this day I have found my daughter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> What person? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Pal&aelig;stra, who was your property, she has been discovered to be my own daughter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> By my troth, it has happily turned out so; since this matter has happened so fortunately for you according to your wishes, I'm rejoiced.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Aye, by my faith, that you may be sure that I'm rejoiced, you shan't give me three obols for her; I excuse you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> I' faith, you are acting kindly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> No, troth; it's really yourself, indeed, that's doing so. <stage>Going off with the wallet.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Hark you, you've got the wallet now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> I have got it. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Make haste.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Make haste about what? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> To pay me the money.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> By my troth, I'll neither give you anything nor do I owe you anything. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> What mode of proceeding is this? Don't you owe it me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Troth, not I indeed. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Didn't you promise it me upon your oath?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> I did take an oath, and now I'll take an oath, if it is in any way my own pleasure; oaths were invented for preserving property, not for losing it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Give me, will you, a great talent of silver, you most perjured fellow.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Gripus, what talent is it you are asking him for?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> He promised it me on oath.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> I chose to swear; <stage>turning to D&AElig;MONES</stage> are you the priest<milestone n="1377" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Are you the priest</lemma>:  The meaning of this passage is doubtful, but he seems to ask D&aelig;mones, "Are you the Priest of Venus, in whose presence I took the oath?"

<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> <stage>to GRIPUS</stage>. For what reason did he promise you the money?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> If I restored this wallet into his hands, he swore that he would give me a great talent of silver.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Find me a person with whom I may go to the judge, to decide whether you did not make the bargain with wicked fraudulence, and whether I am yet five-and-twenty years old<milestone n="1382" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Five-and- twenty years old</lemma>:  By the L&aelig;torian law (which is also referred to in the Notes to the Pseudolus), persons under the age of five-and- twenty were deemed minors, and free from all pecuniary obligations. As usual, in this allusion Plautus consults the usages of his Audience, and not of the place where the Scene is laid. Labrax is ready to say or swear anything; and Madame Dacier justly remarks, that it is amusing enough that he should call himself not five-and-twenty, when he is described, in the Second Scene of the First Act, as a person having grey hair. Gripus being a slave, could not try the question at law with Labrax.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>pointing to D&AElig;MONES</stage>. Go to the judge with him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> No; I must have some other person.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> <stage>to LABRAX</stage>. Then I shan't allow you to take it away from him, unless I shall have found him guilty. Did you promise him the money?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> I confess it. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> What you promised my slave must needs be my own. Don't you be supposing, Procurer, that you are to be using your pimping honesty here. That can't be.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>to LABRAX</stage>. Did you fancy now that you had got hold of a person whom you might cheat? It must be paid down here <stage>holding his hand</stage>, good silver coin; I shall, at once, pay it to him <stage>pointing to D&AElig;MONES</stage>, so that he may give me my liberty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Inasmuch, therefore, as I have acted courteously towards you, and by my means these things <stage>pointing to the wallet</stage> have been saved for you----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> I' faith, by my means, rather; don't say by yours.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> <stage>to GRIPUS</stage>. If you are prudent you'll hold your tongue. <stage>To LABRAX.</stage> Then it befits you in a like courteous manner kindly to return the obligation to myself, who so well merit the same.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> You are pleading, of course, for my right?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> <stage>ironically</stage>. It would be a wonder if I didn't, at a loss to myself, ask you to forego your right.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. I'm all right; the Procurer's giving way; my freedom is at hand.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> <stage>pointing to GRIPUS</stage>. He found this wallet; he is my slave. I therefore have preserved this for you, together with a large sum of money.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> I return you thanks, and with regard to the talent that I promised on oath to him, there's no reason that you shouldn't receive it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Hark you, give it me then, if you are wise.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> <stage>to GRIPUS</stage>. Will you hold your tongue, or not?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> You pretend to be acting on my side: I tell you * * * * * * by my troth, you shan't do me out of that, if I did lose the other booty<milestone n="1400" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The other booty</lemma>:  By this he means the wallet and its contents.</note>.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> For yourself, in fact, is he using his exertions; do hold your tongue.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> Step this way, Procurer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> Very well. <stage>They walk on one side.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GRIPUS</speaker><p> Proceed openly; I don't want any whisperings or mumblings to be going on.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> I paid down a thousand didrachms.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> By all means.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>D&AElig;M.</speaker><p> For that half I'll give his freedom to Gripus, by means of whom you found your wallet, and I my daughter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LABRAX</speaker><p> You act fairly; I return you many thanks. <stage>They return to GRIPUS.</stage></p></sp>
