<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>

<p>DEMIPHO, a merchant of <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, having ravished Phanostrata, a young woman of <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName>, she is brought to bed of a female child. This she gives to her servant Lampadiscus, to be exposed. On this being done, in the sight of Lampadiscus, a Procuress picks up the infant, and afterwards makes a present of it to her friend Mel&aelig;nis, by whom it is brought up, under the name of Silenium. Alcesimarchus, a young man of <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName>, falls violently in love with her, and takes her under his protection. In the meantime, Demipho, who has married another wife, after her death marries Phanostrata, and comes to live at <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName>. He and his wife are then anxious, if possible, to regain their lost child. The daughter of Demipho by his first wife is destined by her father to become the wife of Alcesimarchus; on hearing which, Mel&aelig;nis removes her foster-child from his protection. At this conjuncture Lampadiscus finds out the Procuress that had taken up the infant when exposed, and from her discovers that the child of his mistress is with Mel&aelig;nis. He informs his mistress of this, while Mel&aelig;nis is, unknown to them, standing by; upon which she determines to confess the truth, and to restore Silenium to her parents. While she is thinking upon this plan, Alcesimarchus lays hands on Silenium, and carries her off to his father's house. In the confusion attendant on this, Halisca, the servant of Mel&aelig;nis, drops a casket in the street, containing some trinkets which had been worn by Silenium at the time when she was exposed. Phanostrata and Lampadiscus find the casket, and on Halisca coming to search for it, they discover where Silenium is. They go into the house, and Phanostrata discover her long-lost child.

<stage>Enter SILENIUM, GYMNASIUM, and PROCURESS, from the house of SILENIUM.<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Title <foreign lang="la">Cistellaria</foreign></lemma>:  A word formed by Plautus from the diminutive of "cistella," "a casket."</note></stage>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> Inasmuch as hitherto I have loved you, and have deemed you to be my friend, my dear Gymnasium, and your mother as well; so have you shown it to me this day, both you and she. If you had been my own sister, how more you two could possibly have held me in esteem I know not; but, according as is my way of thinking, I conceive it could not possibly be, such ready assistance, all other things laid aside, have you given me. For this reason do I love you, and for it a vast obligation have you both conferred upon me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> I' faith, at such a price as this, indeed, it's easy for us to give you our attendance and to do you good offices; so handsomely and so elegantly have you entertained us at breakfast at your house, as we shall ever remember.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> It has been done with hearty good will by me, and will be done, to get those things which I shall think you are desirous of.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> As the man said, who was borne by a prospering breeze on a calm sea: "I rejoice that we came<milestone n="15" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">That we came</lemma>:  "Ventum." There is probably a poor pun intended on the other meaning of this word, as the accusative case of "ventus," "wind."</note> to you;" in such a delightful manner have we been here this day received; nor except in the management, was there anything there at your house but what pleased me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> How so, prithee?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> Too seldom did the servant give me something to drink, and, as it was, it clouded the colour of the wine.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> Pray, is that becoming to be mentioned here?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> It's both right and proper; there's no other person here. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> With reason do I love you both, who esteem and honor me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> I' faith, my dear Silenium, it befits this class to be kindly disposed among themselves, and carefully to keep up friendships, when you see these matrons of elevated rank, born of the noblest families, how they value friendship, and how carefully they keep it united between themselves. If we do that same thing, if we imitate the same example, still as it is, with difficulty do we exist with their extreme dislike. Of their own enjoyments they would have us to be in want, in resources of our own they would have us not to possess any power, and to stand in need of them in all matters, that we may be their humble servants<milestone n="32" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">May be their humble servants</lemma>:  "Ut simus sibi supplices." Literally, "that we may be suppliants to themselves."</note>. If you wait upon them, you'd rather be giving your room than your company. So very kind are they before the world to our class; in private, if ever there's the opportunity, underhandedly they pour cold water<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Pour cold water</lemma>:  Meaning, in other words, "They try to do us all the mischief they can."</note> upon us. They declare that we are in the habit of having commerce with their husbands; they say that we are their supplanters; they attempt to crush us. Because we are the free daughters of slaves<milestone n="38" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Free daughters of slaves</lemma>:  The "profess&aelig;," or "courtesans," at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, were mostly of the class of "libertin&aelig;"--" children of slaves who had been made free," or else freed-women themselves, who had been the mistresses of their former owners. From this circumstance, "to lead a libertine life" came to mean the same as "to pass a loose" or "unchaste life."</note>, both I and your mother, we became Courtesans; she brought up yourself, and I this girl <stage>pointing to GYMNASIUM</stage>, by chance-fathers. Nor yet for the sake of vanity have I driven her to the calling of a Courtesan, but that I mightn't starve.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> But it had been better to give her in marriage to a husband in preference.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> Heyday, now! Surely, faith, she's married to a husband every day; she has both been married to one to-day, she'll be marrying again to-night. I've never allowed her to go to bed a widow. For if she weren't to be marrying, the household would perish with doleful famine.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> It behoves me, mother, to be just as you wish I should be.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> I' troth, I don't regret it, if you will prove such as you say you'll be; for if, indeed, you shall be such as I intend, you'll never be a Hecale<milestone n="49" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A Hecale</lemma>:  "Hecala" seems a preferable reading here to "Hecata." Hecale was a very poor old woman, whom Plutarch mentions as having entertamed Theseus on one of his expeditions. "As poor as Hecale," became a proverb. Her poverty is mentioned by Ovid, in the Remedy of Love, in conjunction with that of the beggar Irus.</note> in your old age, and you'll ever keep that same tender age which you now have, and you'll prove a loss to many and a profit to myself full oft, without any outlay of my own.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> May the Gods grant it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> Without your own energies<milestone n="51" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Without your own energies</lemma>:  This is very similar to our provert, that "Providence helps those who help themselves."</note>, the Gods cannot possibly do anything in this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> I' faith, for my own part, I'll zealously devote my energies to it. But what mean you amid this conversation, apple of my eye, my own Silenium? (never did I see you more sad;) prithee, do tell me, why does mirth so shun you? And you are not so neat as you usually are. <stage>SILENIUM sighs.</stage> Do look at that, please, how deep a sigh she heaved. You are pale too. Tell us both what's the matter with you, and in what you want our aid; so that we may know. Prithee, don't by your tears be causing me anxiety.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> My dear Gymnasium, I'm sadly affected; I feel ill, I am shockingly distrest; I am pained in spirits, I feel pain in my eyes, I am in pain from faintness. What shall I say, but that my own folly drives me to sadness?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> Take you care, then, that you have your folly entombed in that very same place from which it takes its rise.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> What shall I do? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> Hide it in darkness, in the very deepest recesses of your breast. Take you care and have it so, that you yourself are alone sensible of your own folly, without any other witnesses.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> But I've got the heart-ache.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> Why so? For what reason have you the heartache, prithee, tell me, a thing that I neither have, nor any other woman whatever, according as the men say?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> If there's any heart to feel pain, it does feel pain; but if there isn't, still this pains me here. <stage>Pointing to her left-side.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> This woman's in love.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> Come now, to begin to be in love, is it bitter, prithee?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> Why, troth, love is most fruitful both in honey and in gall; inasmuch as it produces sweetness in a mere taste, but causes bitterness even to repletion.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> Of that character is the malady that afflicts me, my dear Gymnasium.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> Love is full of treachery.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> He's taking his spoils of me, then.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> Be of good courage, you'll get the better of this malady. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> I trust it will be so, if the physician comes that can administer the medicine to this malady.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> He will come. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> A hard expression is that to one in love, "He will come," unless he does come. But by my own fault and foolishness, am I, wretched creature, more afflicted, because for him alone have I longed for myself, with whom to pass my life.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> That is more suitable to a married woman, my dear Silenium, to love but one, and with him to pass her life, to whom she has once been married; but, indeed, a Courtesan is most like a flourishing city; she cannot alone increase her fortunes without a multitude of men.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> I want you to give heed to this matter; the thing on account of which you have been sent for to me, I'll disclose. Now, my mother, because I don't wish myself to be called a Courtesan, complied with my desire; in that matter she indulged myself who have been obedient to her; to allow me to live with him alone whom I so ardently loved.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> I' faith, she acted foolishly. But look, have you ever kept company with any man?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> With no one, indeed, except Alcesimarchus; nor has any other person whatever committed an infringement on my chastity. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> Prithee, by what means did this man gain your good graces?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> At the festival of Bacchus my mother took me to see the procession. While I was returning home, from a secret look-out he secretly traced me even to the door; after that, he insinuated himself into the friendship of my mother and myself as well, by endearments, presents, and gifts.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> I should like a man of that sort to be offered me. How I'd work him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> What need is there of words? Through intercourse, I on the other hand began to love him, and he myself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> O my dear Silenium----!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> What's the matter? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> You ought to pretend to be in love; for if you fall in love at once, you'll be much better consulting the interests of him whom you love than your own.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> But in solemn form he took an oath before my mother that he would take me as his wife. Now, another woman is about to be taken home by him, a Lemnian lady, his relation, who is living here hard by <stage>pointing to DEMIPHO'S house</stage>; for his father has compelled him. Now my mother is enraged with me, because I didn't return home to her, when I came to know of this matter, that he was about to take another as his wife.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> Nothing's unfair in love.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> Now, I entreat you that you'll let her <stage>pointing to GYMNASIUM</stage> be here only for the next three days, and keep house for me; for I've been sent for to my mother's house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> Although this will be a troublesome three days for me, and you'll be causing me a loss, I'll do so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIL,</speaker><p> You act kindly and like a friend. But you, my dear Gymnasium, if in my absence Alcesimarchus shall come, don't you chide him roughly; however he has deserved of myself, still he has my affections; but, prithee, act gently, so that you mayn't say anything that may cause him pain. Take the keys <stage>giving them to her</stage>; if you have need to take out anything for use, take it out. I wish to go----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> <stage>weeping</stage>. How you have drawn tears from me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> My dear Gymnasium, kindly, farewell.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> Take care of yourself, there's a dear. Prithee, will you go in this dishabille? <stage>Pointing to her dress.</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> It's right that such neglect should attend upon my prospects thus disarranged.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> At least do lift up that outer garment<milestone n="116" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Outer garment</lemma>:  "Amiculum" was a general name for the outer garment, such as the "pallium," "toga," or "chlamys," in contradistinction to the "tunica," or "under-clothing."</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> Let it be dragged, while I myself am being dragged down.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> Since so it pleases you, fare you well and prosper.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SILENIUM</speaker><p> If I could, I would. <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> Mother, do you wish anything of me, before I go indoors? Upon my faith, to me she does seem to be in love.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> For this reason, then, it is, that I'm repeatedly dinning it into your ears, not to be in love with any man. Go in-doors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GYMNASIUM</speaker><p> Do you wish anything of me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> That you may fare well. </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>A PROCURESS</speaker><p> <stage>to the AUDIENCE</stage>. It's the same fault with myself as with a great part of us women who are following this calling; who, as soon as ever we have got our load of food, are forthwith full of talk; more than is enough do.we say. Why, myself now, inasmuch as I'm filled to my heart's content, and because I've charged myself quite full of the choicest of wine, it pleases me to use my tongue more at freedom; to my misfortune I can't keep silent on that which it were necessary to be silent upon. But once upon a time, that girl, who has gone hence in tears, from a lane I carried off a little child exposed. There is here a certain youth, of the highest rank; his father, of a very high family, is living at <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName><milestone n="131" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Living at <placeName key="tgn,7011098">Sicyon</placeName></lemma>:  This was a very ancient city in the north of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, not far from <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>.

As soon as ever the opportunity befell me, I immediately granted her request in that which she had asked of me. After she had received this female child from me, at once she was brought to bed of the same female child which she had received from me, without the aid of a midwife and without pain, just as other women bring forth, who seek a trouble to themselves; but she said that her lover was a foreigner, and that by reason of that circumstance she was palming it off. This, we two alone are aware of, I who gave the child to her, and she who received it from me; <stage>to the AUDIENCE</stage> except yourselves, indeed.

Some time since, at <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName>,: there was the Festival of Bacchus; a merchant of <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName><milestone n="158" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Merchant of <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName></lemma>:  Demipho.</note> came hither to the games, and he, an ungovernable young man, ravished a maiden<milestone n="159" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A maiden</lemma>:  Phanostrata.</note> in the dark, in the street, at the dead of night. He, as he knew that he was deserving of a heavy punishment, at once found shelter with his heels, and made off for <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, where he then lived. She whom he had ravished, the ninth ensuing month completed, brought forth a daughter here<milestone n="164" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A daughter here</lemma>:  Silenium.</note>. Since she did not know the person guilty of this deed, who he was, she made the servant<milestone n="166" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The servant</lemma>:  Lampadiscus.</note> of her father partaker of her counsels, and gave to that servant the child to be exposed to death. He exposed it; this woman took up the child; that servant, who had exposed it, secretly took note whither or to what house she carried away the child. As you have heard her own self confess, she gave this child to the Courtesan Mel&aelig;nis; and she brought her up as being her own daughter, honestly and virtuously. But then, this Lemnian married a neighbour there, his relation, for his wife. She departed this life; there she was compliant to her husband. After he had performed the due obsequies to his wife, at once he removed hither; here he married for his wife that same woman<milestone n="179" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">That same woman</lemma>:  An exactly similar circumstance forms the groundwork of the plot in the Hecyra of Terence.</note> whom formerly,when a maid, he ravished. When he understood that it was she whom he had ravished, she told him that, in consequence of the violation, she had brought forth a daughter, and had at once given her to a servant to be exposed. He forthwith ordered this same servant to make enquiries, if anyhow he could discover who had taken it up. Now to that task is the servant always assiduously devoting his attention, if he can find out that Courtesan, whom formerly, when he himself exposed her, he from his hidingplace had seen take her up. Now, what remains unpaid, I wish to discharge, that my name may be struck out, so that I mayn't remain a debtor. A young man<milestone n="191" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A young man</lemma>:  Alcesimarchus.</note> is here at <placeName key="tgn,7011104">Sicyon</placeName>, his father is alive; with affection he distractedly dotes upon this exposed girl, who just now went hence in tears unto her mother; and she loves him in return, which is the most delightful love of all. As human matters go, nothing is granted for everlasting: the father is wishful to give the young man a wife. When the mother<milestone n="197" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">When the mother</lemma>:  Mel&aelig;nis.</note> came to know of this, she ordered her to be sent for home. Thus have these matters come to pass.

<sp><speaker>ALCESIMARCHUS</speaker><p> I do believe that Love was the first to invent torture among mankind. This conjecture do I form from myself at home, not to go seek it out of doors; I, who surpass all men, exceed them in the pangs of my feelings. I'm tossed, tormented, agitated, goaded, whirled on the wheel of love in my misery, I'm deprived of sensation, carried one way, carried another way, I'm torn and rent asunder; such clouded faculties of mind have I, where I am, there I am not; where I am not, there my thoughts are; to such a degree have I now all kinds of feelings in me; what I like, then all at once I like not the same; so much does love trifle with me changing my mind, drive me, pursue, desire, and seize for itself, retain, trepan, and promise; what it gives, it gives not; it deludes me; what this moment it has persuaded me, it now dissuades me from; what it has dissuaded me from, it now points out to me that same. After the manner of the sea is it experienced by me; so much does it distract my enamoured feelings; and only in that, in my misery, I do not sink utterly, is there any evil removed from me thus ruined; in such a way has my father detained me these six days running in the country, at his house there; nor has it been allowed me in the meantime to visit my mistress.

But still I'll go and follow him; there's necessity for caution, lest he, in love, should be doing some mischief. In fine, since with strict justice a poor person's not allowed to contend with a rich one, I'll lose my labour rather than lose my daughter.

<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> Ye Gods, I do adjure you by our trust in you! <stage>Opening the casket.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> Why do you call upon the Gods?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> Save us! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> What's the matter?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> These are the trinkets with which you exposed my little daughter to death. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> Are you in your senses?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> These certainly are. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> Do you persist?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> These are they.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> If any other woman were to speak to me after that fashion, I should say she was drunk.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> By heaven! I'm talking no nonsense. But prithee, whence in the world did these come, or what Deity placed this before our door? As though for a given purpose, at the very instant sacred Hope comes to my aid?</p></sp></div1>

<stage>Enter HALISCA, at a distance, from the house of the FATHER of ALCESIMARCHUS.</stage>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> <stage>to herself</stage>. Unless the Gods give me some aid, I'm utterly undone; nor do I know whence I am to seek for aid. To such a degree does carelessness possess wretched me in mind, which I sadly fear may be lighting upon my own back, if my mistress knows that I'm so negligent as I really am. The casket which I took and held in my hands here before the door, where it is I know not; except, as I fancy, it was dropt by me about this spot. <stage>Looks about on the ground.</stage> My good sirs <stage>to the AUDIENCE</stage>, my kind Spectators, do give me information if any one has seen it, if any one has taken it away, or any one picked it up; and whether in this direction or that he has taken his departure? <stage>She pauses for a reply.</stage> I'm none the wiser for asking these persons, or for worrying them, who are always delighted at a woman's mishaps. Now I'll mark if there are any footsteps here; for if no one had passed this way since I went in-doors, the casket would be lying here. Why say "here?" It's lost, I guess; it's done for. It's all over with unhappy and unlucky me! It's nowhere, and nowhere am I. This, by its loss, has proved my loss. But still, as I've begun, I'll e'en go on; I'll make search; for both within do I fear, and without I am afraid; so much, on either side, does fear agitate me now. In this are mortals intensely wretched. He is now joyous, whoever he is, that has found it, which is of no use at all to any person else; to myself it may be. But I cause delay to myself, while I'm doing this with remissness. Halisca, attend to what you are about: look down upon the ground, and look round about; search with your eyes; guess with shrewdness.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> <stage>apart, at a distance</stage>. Mistress!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Well, what's the matter?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. That's she. <stage>Pointing at HALISCA.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> <stage>apart</stage>. Who?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> <stage>apart.</stage> She who let fall the casket. Why surely she's tracing out that spot where it fell.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> <stage>apart.</stage> It seems so. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> <stage>to herself, looking on the ground</stage>. But that person has gone this way; this way I perceive the imprint of his shoe<milestone n="697" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Of his shoe</lemma>:  "Socci." The "soccus" was a loose shoe worn especially by the Comic actors. Its use was probably derived from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.</note>; this way I'll follow him. <stage>She moves along, still looking on the ground.</stage> In this spot now has he stopped, along with another person. Here now a circle<milestone n="699" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Here now a circle</lemma>:  "Turbo." Schmieder thinks that this means "a whirlwind," and that she intends to say that she has lost the track, in consequence of the wind blowing round the dust, and so obliterating the footmarks. Perhaps, however, she means, that just there the track is lost by its being all in confusion, without beginning or end, so far as she can see. Some would read "turba," a "multitude," as meaning that the throng in the street hinders her from clearly seeing the imprints of the feet.</note> presents itself to my sight, nor did he go straight forward this way; here he came to a pause. This way did he come out of that circle. Here was a conference with some one. It points to two persons now. Who are these? Heyday I see the footsteps of only one. But he has gone this way. I'll consider it: hither he went from thence; from hence he has never gone. I'm troubling myself to no purpose. What's lost is lost; my hide<milestone n="703" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">My hide</lemma>:  She alludes to the flogging which she may expect for her carelessness, which will cause her to lose her skin, or literally, as Plautus says (quite in accordance with our vulgar parlance), her "leather."</note> along with the casket. I'll go in-doors again. <stage>Going towards the house of the FATHER of ALCESIMARCHUS.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> <stage>calling out</stage>. Hallo, woman-stop; there are some persons who wish to meet with you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> Who's calling me back?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> A good female and a bad male want you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> Away with you, bad male; I want a good one. <stage>To herself.</stage> After all, he who calls knows better what he wants than I who am called; I'll return. <stage>Aloud.</stage> Prithee, have you seen any person hereabouts pick up a casket with some trinkets, which I, to my misfortune, have lost here? For when, just now, we were running into the house of Alcesimarchus, that he mightn't put an end to his life, at that moment I think that, through terror, the casket fell down from me here.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside to PHANOSTRATA</stage>. This woman's to our purpose; let's then give heed to her a little, mistress.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> To my sorrow, I'm utterly undone. What shall I say to my mistress, who bade me with such earnestness take care of it, through which Silenium might the more readily recognize her parents--who, when little, was adopted by my mistress as her own, and whom a certain Courtesan gave to her?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. She's talking about this matter of ours. According as she gives these indications by her talk, she must surely know where your daughter is.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> Now is she desirous of her own accord to restore her to her father and mother, whose daughter she is; prithee, my good sir, you are attending to something else; I commend my matter to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> I'm giving my attention to this, and this is as good as food to me, that you are talking of; but amid my attending to this matter, I was answering this mistress of mine what she was enquiring; now I return to you. If you have need of anything, say you, and give your orders. What were you looking, for?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> My good sir and my good madam, I greet you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> And we you. But what are you looking for?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> I'm tracing footsteps here, the way that something has escaped me here, I don't know how.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> What is it? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> What is it, pray?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> Something to bring a loss to another, and a calamity on our family.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside to PHANOSTRATA</stage>. A worthless baggage is this, mistress, and a crafty one.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. I' faith, and so she seems.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. She imitates a worthless animal and a mischievous.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Which one, prithee? LAM. <stage>aside</stage>. A caterpillar, which twisting about winds itself in the leaf of the vine; just in the same way does she begin a story that twists about. <stage>To HALISCA.</stage> What are you looking for?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> A casket, my good young man, has flown away from me here.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> You ought to have put it in a cage.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> I' faith, the booty was no great one.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> It's a wonder, if a whole troop of slaves<milestone n="733" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Troop of slaves</lemma>:  This is said in allusion to the runaway propensities of slaves.</note> isn't there in the casket.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> Do let her speak. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> If indeed she would speak.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> <stage>to HALISCA</stage>. Come say you, what was in it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> Trinkets only. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> There's a certain man, who declares that he knows where it is.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> But, by my faith, he'll confer an obligation on a certain woman if he'll discover it. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> But this certain man wishes a reward to be given to him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> But, by my faith, this certain woman, that has lost this casket, declares that she has nothing to give to this certain man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> But still this certain man looks for some money.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> But still he looks for it in vain.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> But, by my faith, good woman, in no matter does this certain man give his pains for nothing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> Lend me your conversation: it will now be for your own advantage. We confess that we have got the casket.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> Then may Salvation preserve you; where is it now?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> <stage>producing the casket</stage>. See, here it is, safe. But I wish to discourse with you upon a matter of importance to myself; I take you as a sharer with me in my own preservation.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> What matter is this, or who are you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> I am the mother of her who had these things with her, when exposed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> Do you live here then? <stage>Pointing to the house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> You are a diviner. But, prithee, good woman, do lay aside all mystification, and to the point; tell me at once, whence did you get these trinkets?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> This daughter of my mistress had them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> You tell a falsehood; for my own mistress's daughter had them, not yours.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> Don't interrupt. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> I'll be mum.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> Good woman, go on speaking. Where is she who had them?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> <stage>pointing to the house of ALCESIMARCHUS</stage>. Here, next door. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> By the powers, surely the son-in-law of my husband is living there.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> Surely---- </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> <stage>to LAMPADISCUS</stage>. Interrupting again? <stage>To HALISCA.</stage> Go on relating it. How many years old is she said to be?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> Seventeen. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> She is my own daughter then!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> 'Tis she, as the number of her years has proved.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> What you are seeking, you have found; I now seek what's mine. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> Why, faith, they've found what's their own, I'll seek for number three<milestone n="758" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">For number three</lemma>:  "Qu&aelig;ro tertiam." Literally, "I seek a third." This he says by way of joke; as one has been looking for her daughter another for the casket, he must look for something as well, a mistress, to wit.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> My daughter, the object which I was seeking, I have discovered.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> It's proper to keep in safety what has been entrusted in confidence, lest a kindness should turn out a detriment to the well-deserving. This fosterling of ours is assuredly your daughter, and my mistress is about to restore you your own, and for that purpose has she come from her house. But, prithee, enquire of her own self; I am but a servant.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> You ask what's just.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> To her rather do I choose this obligation to belong. But I beg that you'll restore me that casket.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> What's to be done, Lampadio?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> What's your own, keep as your own.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> But I feel compassion for her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LAMPADISCUS</speaker><p> This I think ought to be done; give her the casket, and go in-doors together with her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> I'll follow your advice. <stage>Giving it to HALISCA.</stage> Take you the casket. Let's go in-doors. But what's the name of your mistress?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HAL.</speaker><p> Mel&aelig;nis. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHANOSTRATA</speaker><p> Go first; I'll follow you at once. <stage>Exit LAMPADISCUS, and the others go into the house of the FATHER of ALCESIMARCHUS.</stage>
