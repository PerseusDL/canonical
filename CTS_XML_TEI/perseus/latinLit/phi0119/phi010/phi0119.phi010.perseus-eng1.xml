<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>

<p>MOSCHUS, a merchant of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, had two twin sons who exactly resembled each other. One of these, whose name was Menaechmus, when a child, accompanied his father to <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>, at which place he was stolen and carried away to <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, where in course of time he has married a wealthy wife. Disagreements, however, arising with her, he forms an acquaintance with the Courtesan Erotium, and is in the habit of presenting her with clothes and jewels which he pilfers from his wife. The original name of the other twin-brother was Sosicles, but on the loss of Menaechmus, the latter name has been substituted by their grandfather for Sosicles, in remembrance of the lost child. Menaechmus Sosicles, on growing to manhood, determines to seek his lost brother. Having wandered for six years, lie arrives at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, attended by his servant, Messenio. In consequence of his resemblance to his brother, many curious and laughable mistakes happen between him and the Courtesan Erotium, the wife of Menaechmus of <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, the Cook Cylindrus, the Parasite Peniculus, the father-in-law of Menaechmus of <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, and lastly Messenio himself. At length, through the agency of the latter, the brothers recognize each other; on which Messenio receives his liberty, and Menaechmus of <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName> resolves to make sale of his possessions and to return to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, his native place.

Literally, "propitious health."</note> to myself and to you.I bring you Plautus, with my tongue, not with my hand: I beg that you will receive him with favouring ears. Now learn the argument, and give your attention; in as few words as possible will I be brief. And, in fact, this subject is a Greek one; still, it is not an Attic<milestone n="7" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">It is not an Attic</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Graecissat, Atticissat, Sicelissat</foreign>." Perhaps these words might be more literally translated, "Graecize," "Atticize," and "Sicilicize."</note>, but a Sicilian one. But in their Comedies the poets do this; they feign that all the business takes place at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName><milestone n="10" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">At <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName></lemma>:  As the majority of the Greek Comic Poets were either natives of, or residents at, <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, they would naturally take that extensive, opulent, and bustling city as the scene of many of their Comedies. In the time of Plautus, Greek was yet the language of the Sicilians. In Cicero's time the language of the Sicilians was a mixture, partly Greek and partly Latin. Apuleius informs us that in his day they spoke Greek, Latin, and a language peculiar to themselves, called the Sicilian.</note>, in order that it may appear the more Grecian to you. I will not tell you that this matter happened anywhere except where it is said to have happened. This has been my preface to the subject of this play. Now will I give the subject, meted out to you, not in a measure, nor yet in a threefold measure<milestone n="15" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A threefold measure</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Trimodius</foreign>." This was a measure for corn, consisting of three "<foreign lang="la">modii</foreign>," which last contained about a peck of English measure.</note>, but in the granary itself; so great is my heartiness in telling you the plot.</p>
<p>There was a certain aged man, a merchant at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName><milestone n="17" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">At <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName></lemma>:  <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> was the principal city of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> famed for its commerce and opulence.</note>; to him two sons were born, twins, children so like in appearance that their own foster-mother<milestone n="19" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Foster-mother</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Mater</foreign>." Literally, "mother."</note>, who gave the breast, was not able to distinguish them, nor even the mother herself who had given them birth; as a person, indeed, informed me who had seen the children; I never saw them, let no one of you fancy so. After the children were now seven years old, the father freighted a large ship with much merchandize. The father put one of the twins on board the ship, and took him away, together with himself, to traffic at <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName><milestone n="27" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">At <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName></lemma>:  <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName> was a city of <placeName key="tgn,7007850">Calabria</placeName>, in the south of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. It was said to have been founded by the Lacedaemonians.</note>; the other one he left with his mother at home. By accident, there were games at <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName> when he came there: many persons, as generally happens at the games, had met together; the child strayed away there from his father among the people. A certain merchant of <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName> was there; he picked up the child, and carried it away to <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName><milestone n="33" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName></lemma>:  <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, or Epidamnum, was a town of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, situate on the Adriatic Sea. It was much resorted to for the purpose of transit to the opposite shores of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>. It received its original name from <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, one of its kings but on falling into the possession of the Romans, they changed its name, as we are informed by Pliny the Elder, into <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Dyrrachium</placeName>, from a superstitious notion that when hey were going to "Epidamnum," they were going "to their loss," as "<foreign lang="la">damnum</foreign>" is the Latin for "loss" or "destruction," and <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/</foreign> is the Greek preposition signifying "to."  Cicero was banished to this place.</note>. But its father, after he had lost the child, took it heavily to heart, and through grief at it he died a few days after at <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName>. Now, after news reached the grandfather of the children at home about this matter, how that one of the children had been stolen, the grandfather changed the name of that other twin. So much did he love that one which had been stolen, that he gave his name to the one that was at home. That you may not mistake hereafter, I tell you then this beforehand; the name of both the twin-brothers is the same. He gave the same name of Menaechmus to this one as the other had; and by the same name the grandfather himself was called. I remember his name the more easily for the reason that I saw him cried with much noise<milestone n="48" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Cried with much noise</lemma>:  Probably the word "<foreign lang="la">flagitarier</foreign>" means that the lost child was cried publicly by the "<foreign lang="la">praeco</foreign>," or "crier."</note>. Now must I speed back on foot to <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, that I may exactly disclose this matter to you. If any one of you<milestone n="51" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">If any one of you</lemma>:  This is said facetiously to the Audience for the purpose of catching a laugh.</note> wishes anything to be transacted for him at <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName>, command me boldly and speak out; but on these terms, that he give me the means by which it may be transacted for him. For unless a person gives the money, he will be mistaken; <stage>in a lower tone</stage> except that he who does give it will be very much more mistaken<milestone n="55" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Very much more mistaken</lemma>:  Because he will keep the money and not execute the commission.</note>. But I have returned to that place whence I set forth, and yet I am standing in the self-same spot. This person of Epidamnus, whom I mentioned just now, that stole that other twin child, had no children, except his wealth. He adopted as his son the child so carried off, and gave him a well-portioned wife, and made him his heir when he himself died. For as, by chance, he was going into the country, when it had rained heavily, entering, not far from the city, a rapid stream, in its rapidity<milestone n="65" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In its rapidity</lemma>:  He means to pun upon the words "<foreign lang="la">rapidus</foreign>," "rapid" or "carrying away," and "<foreign lang="la">raptor</foreign>," the "carrier away" or "ravisher."  "The stream carried away the carrier away"</note> it threw the ravisher of the child off his legs; and hurried the man away to great and grievous destruction. And so a very large fortune fell to that youth. Here <stage>pointing to the house</stage> does the stolen twin now dwell. Now that twin, who dwells at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, has come this day to <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName> with his servant to make enquiry for this own twin-brother of his. This is the city of <placeName key="tgn,7010750">Epidamnus</placeName> while this play is acting; when another shall be acted, it will become another town; just as our companies, too, are wont to be shifted about. The same person now acts the procurer, now the youth, now the old man, the pauper, the beggar, the king, the parasite, the soothsayer <gap/>

<stage>Enter PENICULUS.</stage>
<sp><speaker>PENICULUS</speaker><p> The young men have given me the name of Peniculus<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Name of Peniculus</lemma>:  This word means "a sponge" which was fastened to a stick, and was used for the purpose of cleansing tables. He says that the youths so called him from his own propensity for clearing the tables of their provisions. The tails of foxes and of oxen were also used as "<foreign lang="la">peniculi</foreign>." Colman and Warner, in their translations of Terence and Plautus, render the word "dishclout."</note>, for this reason, because when I eat, I wipe the tables clean. <gap/>  The persons who bind captives with chains, and who put fetters upon runaway slaves, act very foolishly, in my opinion at least. For if bad usage is added to his misfortune for a wretched man, the greater is his inclination to run away and to do amiss. For by some means or other do they release themselves from the chains; while thus fettered, they either wear away a link with a file, or else with a stone they knock out the nail; 'tis a mere trifle this. He whom you wish to keep securely that he may not run away, with meat and with drink ought he to be chained; do you bind down the mouth of a man to a full table. So long as you give him what to eat and what to drink at his own pleasure in abundance every day, i' faith he'll never run away, even if he has committed an offence that's capital; easily will you secure him so long as you shall bind him with such chains. So very supple are these chains of food, the more you stretch them so much the more tightly do they bind. But now I'm going directly to Menaechmus; whither for this long time I have been sentenced, thither of my own accord I am going, that he may enchain me. For, by my troth, this man does not nourish persons, but he quite rears and reinvigorates them; no one administers medicine more agreably. Such is this young man; himself with a very well-stocked larder, he gives dinners fit for <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName><milestone n="101" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Fit for <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName></lemma>:  As Ceres was the Goddess of corn and the giver of plenty, the entertainments in honor of her would of course he very bounteous.</note>; so does he heap the tables up, and piles so vast of dishes does he arrange, you must stand on your couch if you wish for anything at the top. But I have now had an interval these many days, while I've been lording it at home all along together with my dear ones<milestone n="105" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With my dear ones</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Cum caris meis</foreign>." When he says this, it might be supposed that he is meaning his family by these words of endearment. The next line shows that such is not the case. He has had a supply of victuals, purchased at his own cost; he has been consuming these victuals, and right dear (<foreign lang="la">carissimum</foreign>) has he found them. He is now coming out to look for Menaechmus, and to make up for lost time.</note>;--for nothing do I eat or purchase but what it is most dear. But inasmuch as dear ones, when they are provided, are in the habit of forsaking us, I am now paying him a visit. But his door is opening; and see, 1 perceive Menaechmus himself; he is coming out of doors.

<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> Come, look at me<milestone n="145" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Come, look at me</lemma>:  Saying this, he probably takes the "<foreign lang="la">palla</foreign>" from behind him, and putting it on, stalks about with it upon him. This he could do without the risk of being seen by his wife, as on the Roman stage a number of streets and lanes were seen to terminate, up which the actor would go a little way to escape observation from a house situate just at the end of another street.

<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> By my troth, you are not a person in his right senses, that I know for sure.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CYLINDRUS</speaker><p> I'll have these things cooked directly; there shall be no delay. Don't you be going after this anywhere at a distance from the house. Do you want anything?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> But I wonder how he came to know my name.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> I' faith, 'tis far from surprising: courtesans have this custom; they send servant-boys and servant-girls down to the harbour; if any foreign ship comes into port, they enquire of what country it is, and what its name is; after that, at once they set themselves to work, and fasten themselves upon him; if they inveigle him, they send him home a ruined man. Now in this harbour there stands a piratical craft, against which I really think that we must be on our guard.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> I' troth, you really counsel aright.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Then, in fine, shall I be sure that I've counselled aright, if you are rightly on your guard.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Be silent for a moment, then; for the door makes a noise. Let's see who's coming out from there.</p></sp>

It is more probable, however, that he is addressing some of the crew, perhaps the rowers who have carried the luggage from the ship. Others suggest that the luggage-porters, who awaited the arrival of ships with passengers and merchandize, are here referred to. This line, in Cotter's translation, is rendered, "Observe these things now, if you please. Behold the ship!" with this note, "<foreign lang="la">Navales pedes</foreign>, the oars of a ship, put for the ship itself."! De l'Oeuvre ingeniously suggests that "<foreign lang="la">paedes</foreign>" is the correct reading, and the word is the Greek <foreign lang="greek">paide/s</foreign> Latinized, and signifying, in the present instance, the "ship-boys" or "servants." </note>.

He did not, however, reign at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. We do not learn from history that Hiero received the government from Liparo, but, on the contrary, that his virtuous character was the sole ground for his election to the sovereignty. <placeName key="tgn,7008315">Lipara</placeName> was the name of one of the Aeolian islands (now called the Isles of <placeName key="tgn,7003912">Lipari</placeName>), not far from the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.

<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> By <placeName key="tgn,2075298">Jupiter</placeName> and all the Gods, I swear, wife (and isn't that enough for you?), that I did not give it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>THE WIFE OF MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> But, i' faith, for my part, I don't lend either your scarf or your cloak out of the house, to any one, to be made use of.

<sp><speaker>THE WIFE OF MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> For your own interest you'll do so, as I think; for you shall never enter the house to-day unless you bring the mantle with you. I'm going home.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Don't you know, madam, for what reason the Greeks used to say that Hecuba was a bitch<milestone n="714" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Hecuba was a bitch</lemma>:  Hecuba was the daughter of Cisseus or of Dymas, and the wife of Priam, King of <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>. In the distribution of the spoil, after the siege of <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>, she fell to the share of <placeName key="tgn,2093866">Ulysses</placeName>, and became his slave, but lied soon after in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>. Servius alleges, with Plautus, that the Greeks circulated the story of her transformation into a bitch, because she was perpetually railing at them to provoke them to put her to death, rather than condemn her to the life of a slave. According to Strabo and Pomponius Mela, in their time the place of her burial was still to be seen in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>. It was called <foreign lang="greek">ku/nos shma/</foreign>, "the Tomb of the bitch." Euripides, in his "Hecuba," has not followed this tradition, but represents her as complaining that the Greeks had chained her to the door of Agamemnon like a dog.</note>?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THE WIFE OF MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> I don't know, indeed. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Because Hecuba used to do the same thing that you are now doing. She used to heap all kinds of imprecations on every one she saw; and, therefore, for that reason she was properly begun to be called a bitch.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THE WIFE OF MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> I can't put up with this disgraceful conduct of yours; for I had rather see my life that of a widow, than endure this vile conduct of yours that you are guilty of.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> What is it to me, whether you are able to endure to live in the married state, or whether you will separate from your husband? Is it thus the fashion here to tell these stories to a stranger on his arrival?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THE WIFE OF MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> What stories? I say, I'll not endure it henceforth, but live separate rather than put up with these ways.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Troth, so far indeed as I'm concerned, do live separate, even so long as Jupiter shall hold his sway.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THE WIFE OF MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> By heavens, I'll certainly now send for my father, and I'll tell him your disgraceful conduct that you are guilty of. Go, Decio <stage>calling to a SERVANT</stage>, seek for my father, that he may come along with you to me; tell him that occasion has arisen for it.

<sp><speaker>OLD MAN</speaker><p> According as my age permits, and as there is occasion to do so, I'll push on my steps and make haste to get along. But how far from easy 'tis for me, I'm not mistaken as to that. For my agility forsakes me, and I am beset with age; I carry my body weighed down; my strength has deserted me. How grievous a pack upon one's back is age. For when it comes, it brings very many and very grievous particulars, were I now to recount all of which, my speech would be too long. But this matter is a trouble to my mind and heart, what this business can possibly be on account of which my daughter suddenly requires me to come to her, and doesn't first let me know what's the matter, what she wants, or why she sends for me. But pretty nearly do I know now what's the matter; I suspect that some quarrel has arisen with her husband. So are these women wont to do, who, presuming on their portions, and haughty, require their husbands to be obedient to them; and they as well full oft are not without fault. But still there are bounds, within which a wife ought to be put up with. By my troth, my daughter never sends for her father to come to her except when either something has been done wrong, or there is a cause for quarrelling. But whatever it is, I shall now know. And see, I perceive her herself before the house, and her husband in a pensive mood. 'Tis the same as I suspected. I'll accost her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THE WIFE OF MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> I'll go and meet him. May every happiness attend you, my father.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>OLD MAN</speaker><p> Happiness attend you. Do I find you in good spirits? Do you bid me be fetched in happy mood? Why are you sorrowful?

Say, in few words, which of the two is in fault: no long speeches, though.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THE WIFE OF MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> For my part, I've done nothing wrong; as to that point do I at once make you easy, father. But I cannot live or remain here on any account; you must take me away hence immediately.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>THE WIFE OF MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> How, my father, can I possibly guard against that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>OLD MAN</speaker><p> Do you ask me? <gap/> unless you don't wish. How often have I told you to be compliant to your husband. Don't be watching what he does, where he goes, or what matter he's about.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THE WIFE OF MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> Why, but he's in love with a courtesan here close by.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>OLD MAN</speaker><p>. He is exceedingly wise: and for this painstaking of yours, I would even have him love her the more.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>THE WIFE OF MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> He drinks there, too.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>OLD MAN</speaker><p> And will he really drink the less for you, whether it shall please him to do so there or anywhere else? Plague on it, what assurance is this? On the same principle, you would wish to hinder him from engaging to dine out, or from receiving any other person at his own house. Do you want husbands to be your servants? You might as well expect, on the same principle, to be giving him out his task, and bidding him sit among the female servants and card wool.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> 'Tis your image; 'tis as like as possible.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> <stage>catching sight of the other</stage>. Troth, it really is not unlike, so far as I know my own form.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> <stage>to MESSENIO</stage>. O young man, save you, you who preserved me, whoever you are.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> By my troth, young man, prithee, tell me your name, unless it's disagreable.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> I' faith, you've not so deserved of me, that it should be disagreable for me to tell what you wish. My name is Menaechmus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Why, by my troth, so is mine.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> I am a Sicilian, of <placeName key="tgn,7014561">Syracuse</placeName>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Troth, the same is my native country.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> What is it that I hear of you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> That which is the fact.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> <stage>To MENAECHMUS SOSICLES, by mistake</stage>. I know this person myself <stage>pointing to the other MENAECHMUS</stage>; he is my master, I really am his servant; but I did think I belonged to this other. <stage>To MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus, by mistake.</stage> I took him to be you; to him, too, did I give some trouble. <stage>To his master.</stage> Pray, pardon me if I have said aught foolishly or unadvisedly to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> You seem to me to be mad. Don't you remember that together with me you disembarked from board ship to-day?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Why, really, you say what's right--you are my master; <stage>to MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus</stage> do you look out for a servant. <stage>To his master.</stage> To you my greetings <stage>(to MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus)</stage> to you, farewell. This, I say, is Menaechmus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> But I say I am. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> What story's this? Are you Menaechmus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> I say that I'm the son of Moschus, who was my father.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Are you the son of my father?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> Aye, I really am, young man, of my own father. I don't want to claim your father, nor to take possession of him from you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Immortal Gods, what unhoped-for hope do you bestow on me, as I suspect. For unless my mind misleads me, these are the two twin-brothers; for they mention alike their native country and their father. I'll call my master aside--Menaechmus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BOTH OF THE MENAECHMI.</speaker><p> What do you want?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> I don't want you both. But which of you was brought here in the ship with me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> Not I. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> But 'twas I.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> You, then, I want. Step this way. <stage>They go aside.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> I've stepped aside now. What's the matter?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> This man is either an impostor, or he is your twin-brother. But I never beheld one person more like another person. Neither water, believe me, is ever more like to water nor milk to milk, than he is to you, and you likewise to him; besides, he speaks of the same native country and father. 'Tis better for us to accost him and make further enquiries of him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> I' faith, but you've given me good advice, and I return you thanks. Troth, now, prithee, do continue to lend me your assistance. If you discover that this is my brother, be you a free man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> I hope I shall. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> I too hope that it will be so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> <stage>to MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus</stage>. How say you? I think you said that you are called Menaechmus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> I did so indeed. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> <stage>pointing to his master</stage>. His name, too, is Menaechmus. You said that you were born at <placeName key="tgn,7014561">Syracuse</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>; he was born there. You said that Moschus was your father; he was his as well. Now both of you can be giving help to me and to yourselves at the same time.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> You have deserved that you should beg nothing but what you should obtain that which you desire. Free as I am, I'll serve you as though you. had bought me for money.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> I have a hope that I shall find that you two are twin-born brothers, born of one mother and of one father on the same day.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> You mention wondrous things. I wish that you could effect what you've promised.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> I can. But attend now, both of you, and tell me that which I shall ask.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> Ask as you please, I'll answer you. I'll not conceal anything that I know.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Isn't your name Menaechmus? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> I own it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Isn't it yours as well? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> It is.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Do you say that Moschus was your father?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> Truly, I do say so. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> And mine as well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Are you of <placeName key="tgn,7014561">Syracuse</placeName>? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> Certainly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> And you? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Why not the same?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Hitherto the marks agree perfectly well. Still lend me your attention. <stage>To MENAECHMUS.</stage> Tell me, what do you remember at the greatest distance of time in your native country?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> When I went with my father to <placeName key="tgn,7004100">Tarentum</placeName> to traffic; and afterwards how I strayed away from my father among the people, and was carried away thence.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Supreme Jupiter, preserve me!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> <stage>to MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</stage>. Why do you exclaim? Why don't you hold your peace? <stage>To MENAECHMUS.</stage> How many years old were you when your father took you from your native country?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> Seven years old; for just then my teeth were changing for the first time. And never since then have I seen my father.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Well, how many sons of you had your father then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> As far as I now remember, two.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Which of the two was the older--you or the other?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> Both were just alike in age.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> How can that be? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> We two were twins.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> The Gods wish to bless me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> <stage>to MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</stage>. If you interrupt, I shall hold my tongue.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Rather than that, I'll hold my tongue.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Tell me, were you both of the same name?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> By no means; for my name was what it is now Menaechmus; the other they then used to call Sosicles.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> <stage>embracing his brother</stage>. I recognize the proofs, I cannot refrain from embracing him. My own twin-brother, blessings on you; I am Sosicles.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> How then was the name of Menaechmus afterwards given to you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> After word was brought to us that you <gap/> and that my father was dead, my grandfather changed it; the name that was yours he gave to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> I believe that it did so happen as you say. But answer me this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Ask it of me. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> What was the name of our mother?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Teuximarcha. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> That quite agrees. <stage>He again embraces him.</stage> O welcome, unhoped-for brother, whom after many years I now behold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> And you, whom with many and anxious labours I have ever been seeking up to this time, and whom I rejoice at being found.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> <stage>to his master</stage>. It was for this reason that this Courtesan called you by his name; she thought that you were he, I suppose, when she invited you to breakfast.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> Why, faith, to-day I ordered a breakfast to be got ready here <stage>pointing to EROTIUM'S house</stage> for me, unknown to my wife; a mantle which a short time since I filched from home, to her I gave it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Do you say, brother, that this is the mantle which I'm wearing?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> How did this come to you? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> The Courtesan who took me here <stage>pointing to EROTIUM'S house</stage> to breakfast, said that I had given it to her. I breakfasted very pleasantly; I drank and entertained myself with my mistress; she gave me the mantle and this golden trinket. <stage>Showing the bracelet.</stage> <gap/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> I' faith, I'm glad if any luck has befallen you on my account; for when she invited you to her house, she supposed it to be me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Do you make any objection that I should be free as you commanded?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> He asks, brother, what's very fair and very just Do it for my sake.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> <stage>touching MESSENIO'S shoulder</stage>. Be thou a free man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> I am glad, Messenio, that you are free.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Why, better auspices<milestone n="1149" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Better auspices</lemma>:  He alludes to the pretended manumission which he has already received from Menaechmus of Epidamnus, when he took him to be his master</note> were required that I should be free for life. <gap/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Since these matters, brother, have turned out to our wishes, let us both return to our native land.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> Brother, I'll do as you wish. I'll have an auction here, and sell whatever I have. In the meantime, brother, let's now go in-doors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS SOSICLES</speaker><p> Be it so. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Do you know what I ask of you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> What? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> To give me the place of auctioneer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> It shall be given you. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> Would you like the auction, then, to be proclaimed at once? For what day?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MENAECHMUS of Epidamnus.</speaker><p> On the seventh day hence.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MESSENIO</speaker><p> <stage>coming forward, and speaking in a loud voice</stage>. An auction of the property of Menaechmus will certainly take place on the morning of the seventh day hence. His slaves, furniture, house, and farms, will be sold. All will go for whatever they'll fetch at ready money prices. His wife, too, will be sold as well, if any purchaser shall come. I think that by the entire sale Menaechmus will hardly get fifty hundred thousand<milestone n="1161" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Fifty hundred thousand</lemma>:  The sestertius, before the time of Augustus, was a silver coin of the value of twopence and one-half of a farthing; while after that period, its value was one penny three-farthings and a half.

It is, however, very doubtful if such is the fact. It is rendered doubly famous from the fact that Shakespeare borrowed the plot of his <title>Comedy of Errors</title> from it, through the medium of the old translation of the Play, published in the year 1595, which is in some parts a strict translation, though in others only an abridgment of the original work. It is thought to have been made by William Warner, who wrote a poem called "Albion's England," which he dedicated to Henry Cary, Lord Hunsdon, who was Lord Chamberlain to Queen Anne the wife of James the First.</note>.</p></sp>
