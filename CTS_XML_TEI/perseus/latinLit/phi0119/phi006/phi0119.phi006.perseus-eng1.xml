<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>

<p>A SERVANT, having obtained from a woman a female infant which was about to be exposed, brings it to his mistress, Cleostrata, who brings it up with the greatest care. The child is called <placeName key="tgn,1043953">Casina</placeName>; and when she grows up, both <placeName key="tgn,7012076">Stalino</placeName>, the husband, and Euthynicus, the son of Cleostrata, fall in love with her. Cleostrata, being aware of this, and favouring the passion of Euthynicus, is desirous to give <placeName key="tgn,1043953">Casina</placeName> in marriage to Chalinus, his armour-bearer, as a covert method of putting her in the power of Euthynicus. On the other hand, <placeName key="tgn,7012076">Stalino</placeName> wishes her to be married to Olympio, the bailiff of his farm, as a means of getting her into his own possession. It is at last arranged that the matter shall be decided by lot, which being drawn, Olympio is the winner. Cleostrata then resorts to a stratagem to defeat her husband's plan. With the assistance of Myrrhina and her own female servants, she dresses up Chalinus to represent Casina, who is taken by the bridegroom Olympio to a house in the vicinity, which has been secretly engaged by <placeName key="tgn,7012076">Stalino</placeName>. The Play concludes with Olympio and <placeName key="tgn,7012076">Stalino</placeName> rushing out of the house in dismay, after having been soundly beaten by Chalinus. <placeName key="tgn,7012076">Stalino</placeName> implores pardon of his wife, which, at the intercession of Myrrhina, is granted. It is then discovered that <placeName key="tgn,1043953">Casina</placeName> is really the daughter of Alcesimus, and the Audience is informed that she is to be given in marriage to Euthynicus.

<sp><speaker>THE PROLOGUE<milestone n="2" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The Prologue</lemma>:  This Prologue appears to have been written many years after the death of the author, and indeed bears internal marks of having been composed at a period nearer to the Augustan age than the time of Plautus. Judging, however, from the fourteenth line, there were, at the time when it was written, some persons still surviving who had been present at the original representation of the Play.</note></speaker><p>I bid you, most worthy Spectators, welcome; who most highly esteem the Goddess Faith<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Faith</lemma>:  She was worshipped under the name of Fides. Further reference is made to her in the Aulularia, where her Temple is represented.</note>, and Faith esteems you. If I have said the truth, then give me loud applause, that even now, from the very beginning forward, I may know that you are favourably disposed towards me. Those who make use of aged wine, I deem to be wise; and those as well, who, through choice, are the spectators of ancient Plays. Since antique works and words are pleasing to you, 'tis just that ancient Plays should in preference please you; for the new Comedies which come out now-a-days are much more worthless than the new-coined money<milestone n="10" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The new-coined money</lemma>:  He seems to refer to the circulation of some coin of a base or alloyed character, probably much to the annoyance of the public.</note>. We, since we have heard the report in public, that you ardently wish for the Plays of Plautus, have brought forward this ancient Comedy of his, which you, who are among the older ones, have formerly approved. But I am aware that those who are among the younger ones are not acquainted with it; still, that they may make acquaintance with it, we will carefully use our best endeavours. When this was first represented, it surpassed all other Plays. In those days there was the very &pound;elite of the poets, who have now departed hence to the place common to all. But though departed, yet do they prove of advantage to those who are still existing. All of you, with the greatest earnestness, I would have entreated that you'll kindly lend attention to this our company. Dismiss from your thoughts cares and monies due; let no man stand in dread of his duns. 'Tis a holiday this--to the bankers a holiday has been given. 'Tis now a calm; about the Forum these are Halcyon days<milestone n="26" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Halcyon days</lemma>:  "Alcedonia," "days of calm." This figure is derived from the circumstance that by the ancients the sea was supposed to be always calm when the female kingfisher (alcedo)  was sitting; and the saying became proverbial. Ovid, in the Metamorphoses, B. 11, speaking of Ceyx and Halcyon, who were changed into kingfishers, says, 1. 744 et seq., "Nor, when now birds, is the conjugal tie dissolved; they couple and they become parents; and for seven calm days, in the winter-time, does Halcyone brood upon her nest, floating on the sea. Then the passage of the deep is safe; &AElig;olus keeps the winds in, and restrains them from sallying forth, and secures a smooth sea for his descendants."</note>. Reasonably do they act: during the games<milestone n="27" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">During the games</lemma>:  The public games, or shows, at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, were represented on days that were "nefasti," when no law-suits were carried on, and no person was allowed to be arrested for debt.</note> they ask no man for money; but during the games to no one do they pay. If your ears are disengaged, give me your attention; I wish to mention to you the name of the Play. "Clerumen&aelig;<milestone n="31" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Clerumen&aelig;</lemma>:  The Greek word <foreign lang="greek">klhrou/menoi,</foreign> the "lot-drawers." This passage is considered by some Commentators to prove that the Greek <foreign lang="greek">oi</foreign> was pronounced like the Latin "&aelig;."</note>" this Comedy is called in Greek; in Latin, "Sortientes." Diphilus wrote it in Greek, and after that, over again, Plautus with the barking name<milestone n="34" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With the barking name</lemma>:  It is not fully ascertained whether the "barking name" alludes to that of Plautus or of <placeName key="tgn,1043953">Casina</placeName>; the former is, most probably, the case. Indeed, Festus tells us that "plautus" actually was the name of a species of dog with long, loose ears, which hung down. Some Commentators reject this explanation, and think that the "au" in "Plautus" suggested the notion, from its resemblance to the baying of a dog. This is, however, very problematical.</note> in Latin afresh. <stage>Pointing to the house of <placeName key="tgn,7012076">STALINO</placeName>.</stage> An old married man is living here; he has a son; he, with his father, is dwelling in this house. He has a certain slave, who with disease is confined--aye, faith, to his bed, he really is, that I may tell no lie. But sixteen years ago, it happened that on a time this servant, at early dawn, beheld a female child being exposed. He went at once to the woman who was exposing it, and begged her to give it to himself. He gained his request: he took it away, and carried it straight home. He gave it to his mistress, and entreated her to take care of it, and bring it up. His mistress did so; with great care she brought it up, as though it had been her own daughter, not much different. Since then she has grown up to that age to be able to prove an attraction to the men; but this old gentleman loves this girl distractedly, and, on the other hand, so does his son as well. Each of them now, on either side, is preparing his legions, both father and son, each unknown to the other. The father has deputed his bailiff to ask her as his wife; he hopes that, if she's given to him, an attraction out of doors will be, unknown to his wife, provided for him. But the son has deputed his armour-bearer to ask her for himself as a wife. He knows that if he gains that request, there will be an object for him to love, within his abode. The wife of the old gentleman has found out that he is gratifying his amorousness; for that reason, she is making common cause together with her son. But this father, when he found out that his son was in love with this same woman, and was a hindrance to him, sent the young man hence upon business abroad. His mother, understanding this, still lends him, though absent, her assistance. Don't you expect it; he will not, in this Play, to-day, return to the city. Plautus did not choose it: he broke down the bridge that lay before him in the way. There are some here, who, I fancy, are now saying among themselves, "Prithee, what means this, i' faith?--the marriage of a slave<milestone n="68" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Marriage of a slave</lemma>:  The ingenious <placeName key="tgn,1010231">Rost</placeName> suggests this explanation of the passage: The slaves at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> were not allowed to contract marriages petween themselves, or what was in legal terms called "matrimonium." They were, however, permitted to live together in "contubernium," or what was in common parlance called "quasi matrimonium." This he supposes to have in time come to be styled, in common parlance, "matrimonium" by the lower classes, and consequently to have given great offence to some martinets, who insisted on giving, on all occasions, the strict legal term to the unions of slaves. He therefore excuses this shock to their feelings, by pleading the example of the Greeks, Carthaginians, and Apulians.</note> Are slaves to be marrying wives, or asking them for themselves? They've introduced something new--a thing that's done nowhere in the world." But I affirm that this is done in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName><milestone n="71" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Done in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName></lemma>:  <placeName key="tgn,1010231">Rost</placeName> remarks, that in reality, "matrimonium," or "marriage," in the strict legal sense, was no more permitted by the Greeks to their slaves than it was by the Romans. He is of opinion, however. that Plautus here refers to the superior humanity and kindliness of the Greeks, who did not object to call the union of slaves by the name of marriage, in common parlance, although those unfortunate persons were denied all the immunities of married people. As to the usage among the Carthaginians and Apulians, with relation to the intermarriages of slaves, no account has come down to us.</note>, and at <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, and here in our own country, and in the Apulian country; and that the marriages of slaves are wont to be solemnized there with more fuss than even those of free persons. If this is not the fact, if any one pleases, let him bet with me a stake towards a jug of honied wine<milestone n="75" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Jug of honied wine</lemma>:  As he only ventures to wager a jug of "mulsum" on his correctness, it is not improbable that the speaker of the Prologue is not very careful in what he asserts as to the customs of other nations.</note>, so long as a Carthaginian is the umpire in my cause, or a Greek in fact, or an Apulian. <stage>A pause.</stage> What now? You don't take it? No one's thirsty, I find. I'll return to that foundling girl, whom the two slaves are, with all their might, contending for as a wife. She'll be found to be both chaste and free, of freeborn parents, an Athenian girl, and assuredly of no immodesty at all will she be guilty<milestone n="83" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Will she be guilty</lemma>:  Warner thinks that these words imply that in the Greek Comedy, from which the present one was taken, <placeName key="tgn,1043953">Casina</placeName> was introduced on the stage, and represented as acting immodestly.</note> in this Comedy at least. But i' faith, for sure, directly afterwards, when the Play is over, if any one offers the money, as I guess, she'll readily enter into matrimony with him, and not wait for good omens. Thus much I have to say. Farewell; be prosperous in your affairs, and conquer by true valour, as hitherto you've done<milestone n="88" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Hitherto you've done</lemma>:  The conclusion of this Play is similar to that of the Cistellaria.</note>.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> Because I'm resolved, just like your shadow, wherever you go, to follow you about.

Why are you creeping about in the city, you bailiff<milestone n="98" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">You bailiff</lemma>:  The "villicus" was an upper slave, who had the management of the country farm, and all the business on it, except that relative to the cattle. His duty was to watch over the other slaves; never to leave the farm but for the purpose of going to market; to take care of the implements of husbandry, keep an account of the stock, distribute food and clothing to the labourers, perform the sacrifices, buy what was necessary for the household, and sell the produce of the farm. Cato says that it was especially a part of his duty to avoid Soothsayers. Of course he would be of more use in the country than in town.</note>, so very valuable in this place?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>OLYMPIO</speaker><p> Because I choose. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> But why ain't you in the country, at your post of command? Why don't you rather pay attention to the business that has been entrusted to you, and keep yourself from meddling in city matters? Have you come hither to deprive me of my betrothed? Be off to the country--be off to your place of command, and be hanged to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>OLYMPIO</speaker><p> Chalinus, I have not forgotten my duty. I've given charge to one who will still take care that all's right in the country. When I've got that for which I came hither to the city, to take her as my wife whom you are dying for--the fair and charming <placeName key="tgn,1043953">Casina</placeName>, your fellow-servant--when I've carried her off with myself into the country as my wife, I'll then stick fast in the country, at my post of command.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> What, you marry her? By my faith, 'twere better I should die by a halter, than that you should be the winner of her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>OLYMPIO</speaker><p> She's my prize; do you put yourself in a halter at once. </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>OLYMPIO</speaker><p> What will I do to you? In the first place of all, you shall hold the lighted torch for this new-made bride of nine; that always, in future, you may be worthless<milestone n="118" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">May be worthless</lemma>:  It has been suggested by Muretus that this refers to some superstition among the ancients, that those who had carried a torch before the bride at a wedding were doomed to be unlucky in future life; perhaps, however, there is no ground for this supposition, beyond the present passage; as it is not likely that they would have found any free persons to undertake the duty of torchbearer, if they were to be afterwards considered as of such ominous character.</note>, and not esteemed. Then next after that, when you get to the country-house, a single pitcher<milestone n="121" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A single pitcher</lemma>:  To be "drawers of water," as well as "hewers of wood," was the lot of the unfortunate slave, from the earliest ages of the world.</note> shall be found you, and a single path, a single spring, a single brass cauldron, and eight casks; and unless these shall be always kept filled, I'll load you with lashes. I'll make you so thoroughly bent with carrying water, that a horse's crupper might be manufactured out of you. And then, in future, unless in the country you either feed on pulse, or, like a worm, upon the soil, should you require to taste of any better food, never, upon my faith, is hunger as full of hungriness as I'll make you to be in the country. After that, when you're tired out, and starved with famine, care shall be taken that, at night, you go to bed as you deserve.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> What will you do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>OLYMPIO</speaker><p> You shall be shut up fast in a nook with bars, where you can listen while I'm caressing her, while she is saying to me, "My soul, my own Olympio, my life, my sweet, my delight, do let me kiss your dear eyes, my love! do, there's a dear, let yourself be loved! my own day of happiness, my sparrow-chick, my own dove, my leveret!" When these expressions shall be being uttered to me, then will you, you villain, be wriggling about like a mouse in the middle of the wall. Now, that you mayn't be trying to give me an answer, I'll off in-doors; I'm tired of your talk. <stage>Goes into the house of <placeName key="tgn,7012076">STALINO</placeName>.</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> Myrrhina, good morrow. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MYRRHINA</speaker><p> Good morrow, my dear Cleostrata. But, prithee, why are you sad?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> So all are wont to be who are unfortunately married; at home and abroad, there's always enough to make them sad. But I was going to your house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MYRRHINA</speaker><p> And, troth, I was coming here to yours. But what is it that now distresses your mind? For the thing that distresses you, that same is a trouble to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> On my word, I do believe you. For with good reason no female neighbour of mine do I love better than yourself, nor any one with whom I have more ties of intimacy, to afford me pleasure.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MYRRHINA</speaker><p> I thank you kindly, and I long to know what this is.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> My husband has put slights upon me in a most unworthy manner.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MYRRHINA</speaker><p> Hah! What is it? Prithee, repeat that same again; for, on my word, I don't in my mind sufficiently comprehend your complaints.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> My husband has put slights upon me in a most unworthy manner, and I have not the advantage of enjoying my own rights.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MYRRHINA</speaker><p> 'Tis surprising, if you say the truth; for husbands can scarce obtain from their wives what's their own right.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> Why, against my will, he demands a female servant of me, who belongs to myself, and was brought up at my own expense, for him to give to his bailiff. But he is in love with her himself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MYRRHINA</speaker><p> Pray, do hold your tongue. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> <stage>looking round</stage>. But here we may speak at present; we are alone----
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MYRRHINA</speaker><p> It is so. But whence did you get her? For a good wife ought to have no property unknown to her husband; and she who has got any, it is not to her credit, for she must either have purloined it from her husband, or obtained it by unfaithfulness. Whatever is your own, all that I take to be your husband's.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> Surely, you're saying all this out of opposition to your friend.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MYRRHINA</speaker><p> Do hold your tongue, will you, simpleton, and attend to me. Do you forbear to oppose him, will you. Let him love on; that which he chooses let him do, so long as nothing's denied you at home.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> Are you quite in your senses? For really, you are saying these things against your own interest.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MYRRHINA</speaker><p> Silly creature, do you always take care and be on guard against this expression from your husband----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> What expression?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>MYRRHINA</speaker><p> What's the matter?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> Hush! <stage>Looks in a particular direction.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MYRRHINA</speaker><p> Who is it that you see?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> Why look, my husband's coming; go you in-doors. Make all haste; be off, there's a dear.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MYRRHINA</speaker><p> You easily prevail; I'm off.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> At a future time, when you and I shall have more leisure, then I'll talk to you. For the present, adieu!</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. I do believe that love excels all things and delights that are exquisite. It is not possible for anything to be mentioned, that has more relish and more that's delicious in it. Really, I do much wonder at the cooks, who employ sauces so many, that they don't employ this one seasoning, which excels them all. For where love shall be the seasoning, that I do believe will please every one; nor can there be anything relishing or sweet, where love is not mixed with it. The gall which is bitter, that same it will make into honey; a man from morose into one cheerful and pleasant. This conjecture do I form rather from myself at home than from anything I've heard; who, since I've been in love with <placeName key="tgn,1043953">Casina</placeName>, more than in my young days have excelled Neatness herself in neatness; I give employment to all the perfumers; wherever an unguent is excellent, I perfume myself, that I may please her.

<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> What is it that you know?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> That not one among all the old men is more worthless than yourself, an old man. Whence come you, good-for-nothing? Where have you been? In what den amusing yourself? Where have you been drinking? You are come, on my word; look at his cloak, how it's creased. <stage>Points at it.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> May the Gods confound both me and yourself, if I this day have put a drop of wine into my mouth.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> Very well then; just as you like: drink, eat, and squander away your property!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Hold, wife; there's now enough of it; you din me too much. Do leave a little of your talk, that you may wrangle with me to-morrow. But what say you? Have you by this time subdued your temper, so as to do that in preference which your husband wishes to be done, rather than strive against him?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> About what matter are you speaking?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Do you ask me? About the handmaid <placeName key="tgn,1043953">Casina</placeName>--that she may be given in marriage to our bailiff, an honest servant, where she'll be well off, in wood, warm water, food, and clothing, and where she may properly bring up the children which she may have, in preference to that rascally servant of an armour-bearer<milestone n="257" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">An armour-bearer</lemma>:  The "armiger" was a general "campservant," who was ready to hold the arms, pitch the tent, or run on the messages of his master.</note>, a good-for-nothing and dishonest, a fellow that hasn't this day a leaden dump of money his own.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> Upon my faith, I am surprised that in your old age you do not remember your duty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> Because if you were to act rightly or becomingly, you'd let me manage the maid-servants, which is my own province.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Why the plague do you wish to give her to a fellow that carries a shield?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> Because it's our duty to gratify our only son.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> But although he is an only one, not a bit the more is he my only son than I am his only father. It's more becoming for him to conform to me, than for me to him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> By my troth, sir, you're providing for yourself a serious piece of trouble.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. She suspects it, I find that. <stage>To his wife.</stage> What, I, do you mean?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> You; but why do. you stammer so?&gt; Why do you wish for this with such anxiety?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Why, that she may rather be given to a servant that's honest, than to a servant that's dishonest.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> What if I prevail upon, and obtain of the bailiff, that for my sake he'll give her up to the other one?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> But what if I prevail upon the armour-bearer to give her up to the other one? And I think that I can prevail upon him in this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> That's agreed upon. Should you like that, in your name, I should call Chalinus hither out of doors? Do you beg of him, and I'll beg of the bailiff.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> I'm quite willing.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> He'll be here just now. Now we'll make trial which of us two is the most persuasive. <stage>She goes into the house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. May Hercules and the Gods confound her!--a thing that now I'm at liberty to say. I'm wretchedly distracted with love; but she, as though on purpose, thwarts me.

<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> In the first place, I want you to speak to me with a more cheerful countenance.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> It would be folly for me to be morose toward you whose rule is the strongest.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Indeed! I consider you to be an honest fellow.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> So I find. But if you think so, why don't you give me my freedom?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Why so I wish to do; but it's of no use for me to wish a thing to be done, unless you aid me with your actions.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> What you wish, I only wish myself to be acquainted with it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Listen then; I'll tell you. I've promised to give <placeName key="tgn,1043953">Casina</placeName> as a wife to our bailiff. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> But your wife and your son have promised her to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> I know it; but whether now would you prefer yourself to be single and a free man, or, as a married man, to pass your lives, yourself and your children, in slavery? This choice is your own: whichever condition of these two you prefer, take it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> If I am free, I live at my own cost; at present I live at yours. As to <placeName key="tgn,1043953">Casina</placeName>, I'm resolved to give way to no born man.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> I' faith, in some way or other I'll now ward off this weapon of yours; for if, as it is, I shall not be able to prevail by persuasion, at least I'll try it by lot. There I shall take vengeance upon you and your abettors.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> By my troth, I could like her to burst in the middle.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>OLYMPIO</speaker><p> I' faith, I fancy she will, if indeed you manage cleverly. But your amorousness, i' faith, is a cause of trouble to me; your wife is at enmity with me, your son at enmity, my fellow-servants at enmity.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> What matters that to you? So long as <stage>pointing to himself</stage> this <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> only is propitious to you, do you take care and esteem the lesser Gods at a straw's value.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>OLYMPIO</speaker><p> That's great nonsense; as if you didn't know how suddenly your human Jupiters take to dying. So after all, if you, my Jupiter, are dead and gone, when your realm devolves upon the lesser Gods, who shall then come to the rescue of my back, or head, or legs?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Affairs will go with you better than you expect, if I obtain this--the enjoyment of my <placeName key="tgn,1043953">Casina</placeName>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>OLYMPIO</speaker><p> I' faith, I do not think it possibly can be; so earnestly is your wife striving that she shall not be given to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> But this way I'll proceed: I'll put the lots in an urn, and draw the lots for yourself and Chalinus. I find that the business has come to this pass; it's necessary to fight with swords hand to hand.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>OLYMPIO</speaker><p> What, if the lot should turn out different from what you wish? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Speak with good omen. I rely upon the Gods; we'll trust in the Gods.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> How's that? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Why, I'll tell you, my sweet. As to this <placeName key="tgn,1043953">Casina</placeName>, you must make a present of her to this bailiff of ours.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> But, i' faith, I neither do make it, nor do I in tend it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> In that case, then, I'll divide the lots between them.</p></sp>

And this now is not so much to be regretted, that the bailiff has got the better, as the fact that the old man so vehemently desired that she shouldn't be given me, and should marry him.

There is more reason, however, for believing that he has assumed it as his wedding-garment, according to the usual custom among the Romans, with whom the bridegroom, bride, and guests invited to the wedding, were drest in white. So in the Scripture, St. Matthew xxii., 11--12: "When the King came in to see the guests, he saw there was a man which had not on a wedding-garment,and he said unto him, 'Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding-garment?'"</note>, a very receptacle for stripes.

I have requested it, and my wife has said that she will do so. She'll be sleeping here: I'll take care her husband is away from home. You shall take your wife home into the country; that country shall be this house, for a period, until I've had my marriage with Casina.

Now, therefore, I shall by no means invite her, so that liberty of free range shan't be any way given to worn-out bell-wethers. <stage>ALCESIMUS is coming out of his house.</stage> But look, the pillar of the Senate's coming forward, the safeguard of the public, my neighbour, the person who is finding free range for my husband.

<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> Let it alone; I don't care; * * if she's busy. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ALCESIMUS</speaker><p> She's at leisure.</p></sp>

And upon my faith, it's a wonder if this female neighbour of mine hasn't already her suspicions of this. But yet, on the other hand, when I reflect with myself on this notion, if there were anything of that, there would have been enquiries of me.

Now I do wish that that good-for-nothing decrepit husband of mine would come, that I might make a fool of him in his turn, after I have thus fooled the other one. For I long to make a bit of a quarrel between these two. But look, he's coming.

As it is full of the grossest indecencies (which have precluded the possibility of translating some parts of it), it has been suggested that Plautus himself wrote it in this fragmentary form, as being sufficient to show his meaning, without displaying these indelicacies in all their amplitude. Another opinion is, that these passages are really the composition of Plautus, but that they have been reduced to their present state by lapse of time, or possibly, by reason of the MSS. having been subjected to castration by the fastidious students of the middle centuries. A third opinion is, that the portion between this line and l. 927, and some few lines in the next Scene as well, were not the composition of Plautus, but that they were composed by some of the learned in the middle ages, to fill up the hiatus which existed in this part of the Play, or was supposed to exist there.

<stage>Enter CHALINUS, from the house of ALCESIMUS, dressed in woman's clothes.</stage>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> Where are you, you who imitate the morals of the Massilians<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Of the Massilians</lemma>:  It is not at all settled by Commentators what is the meaning of this line. Massilia, now Marseilles, was a colony of the Phoc&aelig;ans. Cicero, in his Speech for L. Flaccus, particularly alludes to the strictness of their morals. It is possible that this good character may have passed into a proverb, and that Chalinus banteringly calls Stalino one who cultivates Massilian or the strictest morals. Schmieder, however, thinks that a pun on the word "Massilienses" is intended, and that as Stalino has met with a "mas," or "male," where he had hoped to find a female, Chalinus comes forward and asks him what he thinks of the Mas-silians; just as we in a similar case might say (though perhaps rather tamely)  the Man-chester people.</note>? Now, if you wish to be taking liberties with me, is a good opportunity [* * * at your risk. By my troth, you are undone. Come, only step this way. * * * Now I fancy that when a witness out of * * * * * * * * I'll find * * * * thus out of the street I order * * * * a murmur I * * *</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Now am I in extreme danger, between the stone and the sacrifice, nor know I which way to fly * * * * * The wolf-dogs * * * it was * * *
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> I' faith, I do think * * * * old there now like new.]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> <stage>turning about</stage>. I'll go this way. I trust that the omen of a bitch's barking will prove the better<milestone n="971" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Will prove the better</lemma>:  It is somewhat difficult to say exactly what he means. In l. 927, he seems to be anneyed at being called back as he is running (probably down one of the streets that debouched on the stage). "Revocamen," "being called back," was particularly considered as a bad omen among the Romans. He, perhaps, now changes his mind, and says to himself, "This is a bad omen; I'll turn back; and bad as it is, the barking of my wife may prove a better one."</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> What are you doing, my husband, my good man? Whence come you in this guise? What have you done with your walking-stick, or how disposed of the cloak you had?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TWO MAID-SERVANTS </speaker><p> While he was playing his loving pranks with Casina, he lost it, I fancy.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Utterly undone!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> <stage>coming up to STALINO</stage>. Shall we go to bed again? I am Casina.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Away with you to utter perdition!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> Don't you love me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> Nay, but answer me; what has become of your cloak?</p>
<p>[</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> <stage>running about, exclaiming</stage>. Upon my faith, wife, the Bacchantes! Bacchantes<milestone n="979" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Bacchantes! Bacchantes!</lemma>:  He tries to make an excuse by implication: pretending to be in a fright, he shouts out, wishing them to believe that he has met a gang of Bacchanalian votaries (who were not very particular as to doing mischief to any one they met). Unfortunately for him, a servant-maid suggests that no feast of Bacchus is going on at that time of the year, and that consequently the Bacchantes are not "out."</note>! Bacchantes!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TWO MAID-SERVANTS </speaker><p> He's making pretence on purpose for, upon my word, no Bacchantes are exhibiting at the present time.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> I forgot that. But still, the Bacchantes!----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> How, the Bacchantes? Why, that cannot be.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>TWO MAID-SERVANTS </speaker><p> By my troth, you are in a fright.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> What I?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> <stage>to the SERVANT</stage>. I' faith, do tell no lies, for it's quite clear. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *]</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Won't you hold your tongue?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>OLYMPIO</speaker><p> I' troth, I certainly shall not hold my tongue; for with the greatest earnestness you begged me to ask for Casina as my wife.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> That I did on account of my love for you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> I' faith, of her rather. <stage>Turning to CHALINUS.</stage> He'd have been making an attack upon you, in fact.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> I been doing these things that you mention?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> And do you ask me that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> If indeed I have done so, I've been doing wrong.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> Just come back in-doors here; I'll remind you, if you have forgotten anything.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Troth, I think, I'll believe you in preference as to what you say. But, wife, do grant pardon to your husband for this; Myrrhina, do entreat Cleostrata! If ever, from this time forward, I love Casina, or even think of it, should I love her, I say, should I ever hereafter, in fact, be guilty of such a thing, there's no reason, wife, why you shouldn't lash me with twigs as I hang up by the arms.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MYRRHINA</speaker><p> On my word, I do think that forgiveness may be granted for this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> <stage>to MYRRHINA</stage>. I'll do as you request me. <stage>To STALINO.</stage> On this account with the less difficulty do I now grant you this pardon, that, from being a long one, we mayn't be making this Play still longer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> You are not angry? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> I am not angry.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> Am I to trust your word?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> You may my word.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STALINO</speaker><p> No person ever did have a more amiable wife than I've got.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> Keep to her, then. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CLEOSTRATA</speaker><p> <stage>to CHALINUS</stage>. Come you, give him back his walking-stick and cloak.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHALINUS</speaker><p> <stage>taking them from behind him, where he had held them</stage>. Take them, if you wish. Upon my faith, a great injustice has really been most egregiously done me; I've been married to two husbands; neither has behaved to me as to a new-made bride.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The PLAYERS.</speaker>
<p>Spectators, what's to be done within, we'll tell you here. This Casina will be discovered to be the daughter of this person next door<milestone n="1013" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Of this person next door</lemma>:  Schmieder suggests that Myrrhina has not hitherto seen Casina, but now, on hearing so much of her, enquires into her history, on which Chalinus explains how he begged her of the woman who was going to expose her, and Myrrhina then recognizes in her her own child, whom she had ordered to be exposed. This practice, especially with regard to female children, was by no means uncommon among the ancients, and even with the more respectable classes. We must remember, however, that in the Prologue it is stated that the servant who found her is ill in bed.</note>, and she'll be married to Euthynicus, our master's son. Now it's only fair that with your deserving hands you should give us deserved applause. He who does so, may he always keep his mistress without the knowledge of his wife. But he who doesn't with his hands clap as loud as he can, in place of a mistress, may a he-goat, soused in bilge-water, be palmed off upon him<milestone n="1018" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Palmed off upon him</lemma>:  Warner, in his concluding Note to this Play, informs us that "Machiavel had undoubtedly this Comedy of Plautus his eye when he wrote his Clinia."</note>.
