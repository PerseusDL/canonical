<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>

<p>MNESILOCHUS, when absent at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, writes and requests his friend, Pistoclerus, to search for his mistress, Bacchis, who has left <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> with a military Captain. Having discovered her on her return to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, Pistoclerus falls in love with her twin-sister, whose name is also Bacchis, and is severely reproved by his tutor, Lydus, for so doing. Mnesilochus returns to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and discovers from Lydus that his friend Pistoclerus is in love with a female of the name of Bacchis. He thereupon imagines that he has supplanted him with his own mistress, and in his anger resolves to restore to his father some money of his which he had gone to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName> to recover, and a part of which he had contrived, through a scheme of the servant Chrysalus, to retain, in order that he might redeem his mistress from the Captain. Having afterwards discovered the truth, he greatly repents that he has done so, as the officer threatens to carry Bacchis off instantly, if the money is not paid. On this, Chrysalus contrives another stratagem against Nicobulus, his aged master, and makes him, through fear of the Captain's threats, pay the required sum. Having gained not only this but a still further sum of money, the young men regale themselves at the house of Bacchis. Nicobulus afterwards discovers from the Captain the trick that has been played upon him, and he and Mnesilochus repair to the house of Bacchis to demand their sons. The damsels, hereupon, apply themselves to coaxing the old men, who are at last persuaded to forgive their sons and Chrysalus and to go into the house and join the entertainment.

<head>THE PROLOGUE<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Prologue</lemma>:  There is little doubt that this Prologue is spurious, but as it is prefixed to many of the editions, and to <placeName key="tgn,1136756">Thornton</placeName>'s and the French translations, it is here inserted. Lascaris, the Greek grammarian, says, in a letter to Bembo, that it was discovered by him in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>.

<sp><speaker>SILENUS</speaker> <stage>mounted on his Ass.</stage>
<p>'Tis a wonder if the spectators on the benches this day don't hiss, and cough, and make a snorting noise at this ridiculous sight, furrow their brows, and, with cries with one consent<milestone n="p3" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With cries with one consent</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Concrepario</foreign>" is a barbarous word, formed from "<foreign lang="la">crepo</foreign>," to make a noise.</note>, shout all aloud, and mutter imprecations. Hardly in their youth can beardless actors, or mimics with their beards plucked out, find room upon the stage. Why comes forth this aged and lethargic go-between, who is borne upon the ass's back? Listen, I pray, and give me your attention, while I tell you the name of this quiet Comedy<milestone n="p10" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Quiet Comedy</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Statariae</foreign>." There were two kinds of Comedy represented on the ancient stage, one of which was called "<foreign lang="la">stataria</foreign>," while the other was "<foreign lang="la">motoria</foreign>." In the first, the actors stood still, or moved about quietly, and with little gesture; while in the other, dancing, gesture, and grimace were extensively employed.</note>. 'Tis proper for you to make silence for a Divinity. It befits not those to use the resources of the voice, who come here not to exclaim, but to be spectators. Give me attentive ears; but not into my hands I mean; I wish my voice<milestone n="p15" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">I wish my voice</lemma>:  There is a poor attempt at alliteration here, in the words "<foreign lang="la">volo volans vox vacuas</foreign>."</note>, as it flies, to strike these vacant ears. What do you fear? Are those blows more hurtful which open what is shut<milestone n="p17" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">What is shut</lemma>:  This passage is obscure, but the meaning seems to be, "Is it anything more disagreable to open your ears and listen, than to keep them shut and be stunned by my noise? for talk I will.</note>, or which close what is open? You're very kind; the inhabitants of heaven do love you deservedly. There is profound silence--even the children are still--and now, attend to a new-come messenger, on a new errand. Who I am--why I am come to you--I'll tell you in a few words; at the same time, I'll disclose to you the name of this Comedy. Now, behold, I shall tell you what you wish to know; do you then give me your attention. I am a God of Nature<milestone n="p25" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A God of Nature</lemma>:  The ancients considered Pan, Silenus, Sylvanus, the Fauns, the Dryades, the Hyades, and the Oreades, as Gods of Nature, presiding over it in its various aspects.</note>, the foster-father of most mighty Bromius<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Bromius</lemma>:  Bromius was one of the names of Bacchus, probably derived from <foreign lang="greek">*bre/mw,</foreign> "to make a noise;" the Bacchanalian orgies being attended with riot and drunkenness.</note>, him who, with a female army<milestone n="p26" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With a female army</lemma>:  He alludes to the Indian expedition of Bacchus, who was fabled to have marched thither at the head of an arny of Bacchantes or "<foreign lang="la">Bacchae</foreign>," females who were his votaries.</note>, gained a kingdom. Whatever about him renowned nations relate, some part, at least, has been accomplished by my advice. That which pleases me is never displeasing to him. 'Tis right if one father<milestone n="p30" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">If one father</lemma>:  The ancients gave the Gods the title of <foreign lang="la">pater</foreign>, "father," by way of honorable distinction.

Ass-borne do the Ionian multitudes<milestone n="p31" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Ionian multitudes</lemma>:  The Lydians were adjacent to the people of lonia. Etruria, which supplied the earliest actors to <placeName key="tgn,7013962">Rome</placeName>, was supposed to have been colonised by the Lydians.</note> style me, because I am borne on an ass<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Borne on an ass</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Asibidam</foreign>." This is a spurious word, probably invented by the author.</note> for my conveyance. Who I am, you understand: if you understand, allow me now to tell the name of this quiet play; at the same time, you may learn why I have come to you. Philemon<milestone n="p36" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Philemon</lemma>:  Philemon was a Greek Comic poet, of considerable merit, though inferior to Menander, of whom he was a contemporary. This play is more generally supposed to have been borrowed from a Comedy of Menander, which was called <foreign lang="greek">*di\s *e)capatw=n,</foreign> "the Twice Deceived."</note> formerly produced a play in Greek; this, those who speak the Greek language call "Evantides<milestone n="p37" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Evantides</lemma>:  "Evantides" corresponds with the Latin word "Bacchantes," "followers," or "namesakes" of <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName>," as "<placeName key="tgn,2054401">Evan</placeName>" was one of the names by which that God was addressed during the celebration of the orgies.</note>;" Plautus, who speaks the Latin, calls it "Bacchides." 'Tis not to be wondered, then, if hither I have come. <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName> sends to you the Bacchides--the Bacchanalian Bacchanals. I am bringing them unto you. What! Have I told a lie? It don't become a God to tell a lie; but the truth I tell--I bring not them; but the salacious ass, wearied with its journey, is bringing to you three, if I remember right. One you behold; see now, what on my lips I bring--to wit, two Samian sisters<milestone n="p46" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Samian sisters</lemma>:  <placeName key="tgn,2639881">Samos</placeName> was an island off the coast of lonia, neat <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>. It was the birthplace of the philosopher Pythagoras.</note>, Bacchanalians, merry Courtesans, born of the same parents, at one time, at a twin-birth; not less alike than milk to milk, if you compare it, or water to water; were you to see them you would think them halved<milestone n="p50" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Think them halved</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Dimidiatas</foreign>" &mdash; "one split into two."</note>; so much would you confuse your sight, that you would not be able to distinguish which was which. What remains you long to hear. Now give attention: the story of this Play I will disclose. What country <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName> is, is known to all; for seas, lands, mountains, and islands, have your legions<milestone n="p57" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Have your legions</lemma>:  He is supposed to be flattering the Romans in their love for foreign conquest.</note> made easy of access. There, Sostrata bore to her husband, Pyrgoteles Pyrocles<milestone n="p58" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Pyrgoteles Pyrocles</lemma>:  It was quite unusual for the Greeks to have two names. They have here been introduced either for the sake of the metre, or, as the Delphin editor suggests, as meaning "her husband Pyrocles, who was a regular Pyrgoteles," that is, a most skilful engraver; a celebrated artist of that name having flourished in the time of Alexander the Great.</note>, twin daughters at one birth; and it pleased them, being initiated at the triennial festival<milestone n="p60" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Triennial festival</lemma>:  Among the festivals of <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName>, there was one which occurred every three years, and was called the "<foreign lang="la">Trieterica</foreign>." On that occasion the Bacchantes carried the figure of the God on a chariot, drawn by two tigers or panthers, and crowned with vine leaves; holding thyrsi in their hands, they ran in a frantic manner around the chariot, filling the air with the sound of tambourines and brazen instruments, shouting "<foreign lang="la">Evo&euml; Bacche</foreign>," and calling the God by his several names of Bromius, Ly&aelig;us, Evan, Len&aelig;us, and Sabazius. To this ceremonial, which was derived from the Egyptians, the Greeks added other rites, replete with licentiousness and repulsive to decency. The author says that the parents of the Bacchides were initiated at this festival, and that in compliment to the God they named each of the newly-born twins "Bacchis."</note> of Bacchus, to call after his name the damsels of which they were the parents. The parents, as often happens, gave a turn to<milestone n="p62" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Gave a turn to</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Fata occupant</foreign>." "Consider the fact of their being born at that period as ominous of their future destiny, and devote them to the service of the Deity."</note> their future fortunes. A Captain carried one of them with him to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>. The other of the twins sailed for <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName><milestone n="p64" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Sailed for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName></lemma>:  Literally, "Cecropia." Cecrops was the founder of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note>. As soon as Mnesilochus, the son of Nicobulus, beheld her, he began to love her, and frequently paid her visits. Meantime, his father sent the youth to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, to bring back thence some gold, which he himself, some time before, had deposited with Archidemides, an ancient friend of his, an aged Ph&oelig;nician. When, for two years he had stayed at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, he received the sad news that Bacchis was gone from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, for some sailors of his acquaintance sent him word that she had set sail. On this, he writes a letter to Pistoclerus, his only friend, the son of Philoxenus, entreating him to seek the fugitive with care and earnestness. While Pistoclerus is devoting his services to his friend, the twin-sisters, who have just returned to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, arouse a passion in the seeker. The one wins Pistoclerus for herself; the other longs for the coming of Mnesilochus. What wonder if two bewitching, merry, pretty Bacchantes, should attract to themselves two unfledged Bacchanalians, and if they should ensnare their decrepit, most aged fathers, fit subjects for the undertaker<milestone n="p84" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Subjects for the undertaker</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Libitinarios</foreign>."

<stage>Enter PISTOCLERUS.<note anchored="yes">The portion from the commencement of this scene down to the beginning of the thirty-fifth line, is translated from the fragments of the beginning of the play which have been lately discovered by the research of Ritschel. It was generally supposed by Commentators that the beginning of the play had been lost, and that the author of the Prologue, or some other writer, had supplied the hiatus by adding a first scene of his own composition; in which he represents, somewhat inconsistently, Pistoclerus as having been in love with the First Bacchis before the play began, whereas it is obviously the intention of Plautus to represent him as drawn into the amour by her allurements during the First Act. It is worthy of remark, that the learned and ingenious <placeName key="tgn,1010231">Rost</placeName> was of opinion that the beginning of this play had not been lost, and that it properly commenced at line 35, "<foreign lang="la">Quod si hoc potis est</foreign>." This opinion, however, is thoroughly controverted by the result of the researches of Ritschel. Although, for the sake of brevity, these fragments are here grouped into one Scene, to supply the place of the spurious Scene which formerly occupied their place, it is clear that they are really the remnants of several Scenes, introductory to the attempt of the First Bacchis to entrap Pistoclerus.

<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> I' faith, that doesn't belong to the Courtesan.</p></sp>

Do you, I entreat you, be her protector.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Why should I protect her?</p></sp>

She feigns that it is necessary for him to protect her sister on behalf of his absent friend Mnesilochus, that she herself may obtain an opportunity of ensnaring him</note> for himself. But, if she had the gold to pay him back again, gladly would she do so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Where now is this person? </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Your coaxing is mere birdlime.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> How so?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> Why so, I pray?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> What is it that you dread? Surely, not that the couch in my house may lead you into mischief?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Your allurements<milestone n="55" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Your allurements</lemma>:  There is a play here upon the resemblance of the words "<foreign lang="la">illectus</foreign>," "allurement," and "<foreign lang="la">lectus</foreign>," a "bed."</note>, more than your couch, do I dread.

Literally, "you are an evil beast;" which sounds harsh to an English ear, even when applied to such an animal as Bacchis.</note>. But, madam, a lurking-place does not befit this youthful age.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> Should you wish at my house to do anything that's unwise, I myself should hinder it. But, when the Captain comes, I wish you to be at my house for this reason; because, when you are present, no one will do her and me any injury. You will prevent that, and by the same means you will be aiding your friend; this Captain, too, on arriving, will suspect that I am your mistress. Why are you silent, pray?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Because these things are pleasant in the talking of; but in the practice, and when you make trial, the same are armed with stings. They pierce the feelings, goad one's fortune, and wound one's merits and character.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>2nd BACCHIS</speaker><p> What do you dread from her?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> What do I dread, do you ask? Am I a person in my youth to enter a place of exercise<milestone n="66" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A place of exercise</lemma>:  He draws a parallel between the life of a person who for health and rational recreation frequents the "<foreign lang="la">palaestra</foreign>," or school for exercise, and of those who frequent the haunts of Courtesans. He alludes in the following lines to the exercises of throwing the quoit, running, boxing fencing, hurling the lance, and riding.</note> of such a nature, where people sweat to their undoing?--where for the quoit I rereive a loss, disgrace, too, for my running?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> But you are too expensive an assistant.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> Do pretend that you are in love with me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Whether should I be pretending that in jest, or seriously?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> Well said! better to do the last. When the Captain comes here, I want you<milestone n="76" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">I want you</lemma>:  He is only to pretend to be her admirer when the Captain comes, by way of accounting for his presence and interference on behalf of her sister. This is afterwards rendered unnecessary by his own pliancy, and the arrival of Mnesilochus himself.</note> to embrace me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> What need is there of my doing that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> I want him to see you. I know what I'm about?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> And I, i' faith, I know not what I'm in fear of. But what say you----?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> What's the matter now?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Well, suppose perchance on a sudden a breakfast or a drinking bout, or else a dinner, should take place at your house, just as is the wont in such places of resort; where, then, should I take my place?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> Near myself, my life, that with a she wit a he wit may be reclining at the repast. A place here, at our house, should you come late, is always at your service. When you wish right merrily to disport yourself, my rosebud, you say to me, "Do let me enjoy myself to-day," I'll provide you a delightful place where it may be so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Here is a rapid stream; not without hazard can this way be passed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. And, by my troth, something must you lose amid this stream. <stage>Aloud.</stage> Give me your hand and follow me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> O, by no means. 1st </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>FIRST BACCHIS </speaker><p> Why so?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Because to a man in his youth nothing can be more alluring than these--night, women, wine.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> Away, then, with you; for my part, I don't at all care for it, but for your own sake. The Captain, then, shall take her off; don't you be present at all if you don't choose.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. And am I a thing of nothing, who cannot moderate my own passions?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> What's there for you to fear?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> There's nothing; all nonsense. Madam, I resign myself to you. I'm yours; to you do I devote my services.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> You are a dear man. Now I wish you to do this. To-day I want to give a welcome entertainment<milestone n="94" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A welcome entertainment</lemma>:  "C&aelig;na viatica" was an entertainment offered to a person by his friends immediately on his arrival from a voyage or journey.</note> to my sister.

<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> But I can't allow you to give anything.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Do let me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> How so, prithee?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>2nd BACCHIS</speaker><p> Because, in my way of thinking, this day a lucky haul has fallen to your lot.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS </speaker><p> My aid shall be given you. The water's warm; let's go in, that you may bathe. For, as you have travelled on board ship, you are faint, I think.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> For some time, Pistoclerus, I've been following you in silence<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Following you in silence</lemma>:  We must not be surprised to find "Lydus" a Lydian slave, as his name imports, acting as the "<foreign lang="la">paedagogus</foreign>," or "tutor," of Pistoclerus. Among the wealthy, the sons of the family were committed to the "<foreign lang="la">paedagogi</foreign>" at their sixth or seventh year, and of course that officer was selected from the most trustworthy and most learned among the slaves. The youths remained under the tutor till they reached the years of puberty. His duty was rather to watch and protect them and accompany them to their school and the "<foreign lang="la">gymnasium</foreign>" or "<foreign lang="la">palaestra</foreign>," the place of exercise, than to instruct them himself; indeed; the "<foreign lang="la">praeceptores</foreign>," or "teachers," are expressly distinguished by Quintilian from the "<foreign lang="la">paedagogi</foreign>," or "conductors" of the youths. Eunuchs were sometimes appointed to this office. Among the Romans, a tutor attended on both boys and girls very frequently, as they were not confined at home according to the Grecian custom. During the Empire, much care was taken in the training of the "<foreign lang="la">paedagogi</foreign>."</note>, watching what you were doing in this dress<milestone n="110" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In this dress</lemma>:  He has put on the "<foreign lang="la">malacum pallium</foreign>," "the soft garment," mentioned in l. 71, as being about to join the entertainment which he is providing.</note>.

<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Not every age, Lydus, is suited for school<milestone n="129" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Suited for school</lemma>:  There is here a "Paronomasia," or jingle upon the resemblance of the words "<foreign lang="la">Lyde</foreign>," "Lydus," and "<foreign lang="la">ludo</foreign>," "a school."</note>.

<stage>Enter PISTOCLERUS from the house of BACCHIS.</stage>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> <stage>to the FIRST BACCHIS within</stage>. 'Tis strange that you are so earnestly begging me to return, who am able by no possible means to depart hence, if I were willing, so bound down<milestone n="180" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">So bound down</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Vadatus</foreign>" was a term properly applied to a person bound under a penalty as surety for another.</note>, and so enchained with love do you hold me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> O, ye immortal Gods, I espy Pistoclerus! O, Pistoclerus, hail!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Hail, Chrysalus, to you! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> I will at present compress many speeches for you in a small space. You are glad that I am come; I give you credit for it. You promise me lodging and an entertainment coming from my journey, as it is befitting, and I agree to come. I bring you the sincere greetings of your friend. Would you ask me where he is? He's come.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Is he alive and well? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> That I was wishful to enquire of yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> How can I know? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> No one better.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Why, in what way? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Because if she has been found whom he so loves, he is alive and well. If she is not found, he is not well, and is like to die. His mistress is the very life of a lover. If she is away, he is non-existent; if she is with him, his property is non-existent, and himself worthless and wretched. But what have you done in respect of his commission?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> And ought I not to have his request complied with against his arrival, which his messenger brought to me from him? I'd sooner be dwelling in the realms of Acheron than not.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> How now, have you found out this Bacchis?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Yes, and a Samian one too. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Prithee, do take care that no one handles her carelessly: you know how soon a Samian vessel<milestone n="202" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A Samian vessel</lemma>:  He plays upon the word "Samian," as the isle of Samos was celebrated for the quality of its earthenware, which, as he here says, was very brittle.</note> is wont to break.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> What now, your old habit? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Prithee, do tell me where she now is.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Here, where you just now saw me coming out.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> How capital that is! She's living almost next door. Does she at all remember Mnesilochus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Do you ask me that? Aye, him alone does she esteem at the very highest value.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Indeed! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Yes, and were you to believe her, distractedly in love--she quite longs for him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> That's good. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Yes, Chrysalus; see, now; not even so small a space of time ever passes by as this<milestone n="209" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Passes by as this</lemma>:  This is doing what the Greeks call <foreign lang="greek">deiktikw=s.</foreign> Suiting the action to the word, he points at the time of speaking to something very small, perhaps the breadth of his finger-nail.</note>, out that she is uttering his name.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> I' faith, so much the better. <stage>Moving, as if about to go.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Yes; but--<stage>Holds him.</stage> CHRYS. Yes, faith<milestone n="211" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Yes, faith</lemma>:  It has been suggested that Chrysalus is put out of patience here by the frequent repetition by Pistoclerus of the word "<foreign lang="la">immo</foreign>," "aye," or "yes;" on which he rejoins, "<foreign lang="la">immo</foreign>, &amp;c.," "yes, and I'll be off."</note>, I'd rather be off.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> And do you so unwillingly hear how your master's interests have prospered?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> No, not the subject<milestone n="213" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">No, not the subject</lemma>:  He seems to mean that he is not displeased with the subject. but at the tedious way in which Pistoclerus relates it to him.</note>, but the actor offends my feelings with his tediousness. Even "Epidicus," a play that I love quite as much as my own self, were Pollio to act it<milestone n="216" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Pollio to act it</lemma>:  It is clear from this that the Epidicus of Plautus was written before the Bacchides. With a rather unusual degree of license he seems to refer to an event that has recently happened, and it is not improbable that the "Epidicus," good play as it was, had suffered from the demerits of some contemptible actor of the day, known as Pollio. Plautus thus excuses his play, and excites a laugh by the quaintness of the remark. There is a passage in the Nigrinus of Lucian that throws light on this: "Friend, have you never seen a bad Tragic or Comic actor? some of those I mean who are hissed because they spoil a good play with their acting, and are at last driven off the stage; though the play itself be at other times applauded, and bear away the prize."</note>, no play would I see so reluctantly. But, does Bacchis seem handsome, as well, to you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Do you ask the question? Had I not got a Venus, I should pronounce her a Juno.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> I' faith, Mnesilochus, as I find these matters proceeding, there's something ready for you to love; 'tis needful that you find something to give her. But, perhaps you have need of gold for that other one?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Yes, some Philippeans. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> And you have need of it directly, perhaps?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Aye, and even sooner than directly. For there's a Captain coming here just now----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> A Captain, indeed! </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Who is demanding some gold here for relinquishing Bacchis.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Let him come when he pleases, and so there be no delay. The money's at home; I fear not for myself, nor do I go begging to any man; so long, at least, as this heart of mine shall be armed with its inventiveness. Go in; I'll manage here. Do you tell them in-doors, that Mnesilochus is coming to Bacchis.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> I'll do as you request. <stage>Goes into the house of BACCHIS.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> The money business belongs to me. From Ephesus we have brought twelve hundred golden Philippeans, which our entertainer owed to our old gentleman. Hence, some contrivance<milestone n="239" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Some contrivance</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Machinabor machinam</foreign>" is an Atticism borrowed by Plautus, probably from the original.

<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Alas! my heart and my brain are cleft, Nicobulus, whenever mention is made of that fellow. Why don't you call that entertainer of his your enemy?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Troth now, prithee, why so?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> What, than Archidemides? Dear me!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Than Archidemides, I say. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> What has he done?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> What has he not done? Why don't you ask me that? In the first place, then, he began to make denials to your son, and to assert that he didn't owe three obols<milestone n="260" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Three obols</lemma>:  The "<foreign lang="la">obolus</foreign>" was a very small Greek silver coin.

<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Well--when he showed him the token?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> He began to say that it was counterfeit, and that it was not a true token; and how many reproaches he did utter against him so undeserving of them! and he said that in other matters he had committed forgery.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Have you not the gold? In the first place, I want that to be told me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Yes, after the Pr&aelig;tor had appointed delegates<milestone n="270" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Appointed delegates</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Recuperatores</foreign>" were certain commissioners or judges-delegate, who were usually named by the Pr&aelig;tor, at Rome and in the provinces, to decide matters in dispute, such as disagreements about money and property; also to assess the damages where a wrong had been done; to enquire whether a man was freeborn or not; or, to which of two claimants civic honours properly belonged.</note>; being cast, at length compelled by force he paid down twelve hundred Philippeans.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> He owed that much. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Besides, listen to another struggle of his, as well, which he was desirous to enter on.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Nay, but do you listen---- </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Well, I wasn't aware of the disposition of my avaricious entertainer.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Afterwards, at last we had got the gold, and embarked on board ship, desirous for home. By chance, as I was sitting on the deck, while I was looking about me, at that moment I beheld a long bark being fitted out by this cheating knave.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Troth, I'm undone; that bark breaks my heart<milestone n="281" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Breaks my heart</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Laedit latus</foreign>" -- literally, "hurts my sides," or in other words, "gives me a twitch."</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> This was held in partnership by your host and some pirates.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> And that I should be such a blockhead as to trust him, when his very name of Archidemides<milestone n="284" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Name of Archidemides</lemma>:  He puns upon the name of Archidemides, which was really derived from the Greek "<foreign lang="greek">a)/rxomai,</foreign>" "to govern," and "<foreign lang="greek">dhma\s,</foreign>" "the people," To adapt his pun, however, to the taste of a Roman audience he would make out that it was in part a compound of the Latin word "<foreign lang="la">demo</foreign>," "to filch" or "take away."</note> cried aloud to me that he would deprive me of it, if I should entrust anything to him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> This bark was lying in wait for our ship. I began to watch them, to see what business they were about. Meanwhile, from harbour our ship set sail. When we had fully left the harbour, these fellows began to follow with their oars; nor birds, nor winds more swiftly. As I discovered what scheme was being carried out, at once we dropped anchor. As they beheld us stopping, they began to keep their vessel back in harbour.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Wicked wretches, by my troth. What did you do at last?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> We returned again into harbour. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> 'Twas cleverly done by you. What after that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> At nightfall they returned ashore.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Troth now, they intended to carry off the gold; they were attempting that plan, no doubt.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> It didn't escape me; I discovered it: I was almost terrified to death by it. As I saw that a scheme was being laid against the gold, forthwith on this we came to this determination; the next day we carried away all the gold thence in their presence, openly and publicly, that they might know it was done.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Skilfully managed, i' faith. Tell me, what did they?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Chopfallen at once,--soon as ever they saw us leaving the harbour with the gold, shaking their heads, they hauled their bark ashore. We deposited all the gold with Theotimus, who is a priest there<milestone n="307" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A priest there</lemma>:  St. Paul, when he visited Ephesus, found Diana still enthroned there in the full blaze of her glory. Her temple was esteemed one of the wonders of the world.</note> of Ephesian Diana.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Who is this Theotimus? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> The son of Megalobyzus<milestone n="308" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Son of Megalobyzus</lemma>:  The priests of Diana at Ephesus are supposed to have been eunuchs, and the priestesses virgins. Taubmann thinks that "Megabyzus," which ought to be read here, was a general name of the priests of Diana; and that the words "<foreign lang="la">Megabyzi filius</foreign>," "a son of Megabyzus," have the same import as the word "Megabyzus" itself. It may, however, mean that Theotimus was a priest, and not of necessity that his father was so.</note>, who is now living at Ephesus, a man most dear to the Ephesians.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> By my troth, he'll surely turn out very much more dear to me<milestone n="309" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">More dear to me</lemma>:  The pun here perpetrated answers equally well in English.</note> if he shall chouse me out of all that gold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> But it is stowed away in the very temple itself of the Goddess Diana; there they keep guard at the public expense<milestone n="313" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">At the public expense</lemma>:  The ancients used to place a guard, at the public expense, at the gates of their temples, as great quantities of property or value were there deposited as in places of safety.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> You kill me outright; much more safely would it have been kept in private hands. But haven't you brought any of the gold home here?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> O yes; but how much he has brought, I don't know.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> How's that?--not know? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Because Mnesilochus went privately by night to Theotimus; and didn't wish to entrust it to me, nor to any one in the ship. For that reason I don't know how much he has brought, but he hasn't brought very much.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Do you think it was even a half?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> By my troth, I know not; but I don't think it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Does he bring a third part?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Troth, I think not; but I do not know the truth. Indeed, I know nothing at all about the gold, except that I do know nothing about it. Now, you yourself must take a voyage there on board ship, to carry home this gold from Theotimus; and, hearkye---- <stage>Takes him by the arm.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> What do you want? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Take care and remember to carry your son's ring.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> What need is there of the ring?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Because that is the token agreed on with Theotimus, that the person who brings it to him, to him he is to give up the gold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> I'll remember it, and you advise me well. But is this Theotimus rich?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> What, do you ask that? Why, hasn't he the soles fastened to his shoes with gold?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Why does he thus despise it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> He has such immense riches; he doesn't know what to do with his gold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> I wish he'd give it me. But in whose presence was this gold delivered to Theotimus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> In presence of the people; there's not a person in Ephesus but what knows it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> My son at least did wisely there, in entrusting that gold to a rich man to keep. From him it may be recovered even at a moment's notice.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Aye, and look here, he'll never keep you waiting even thus much <stage>shows his finger-nail</stage> from receiving it on the very day you arrive there.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> I thought that I had escaped a seafaring life, and that, at length, an old man of my years, I shouldn't be sailing about. But now I find that I'm not allowed to have the choice whether I would or no; 'tis my fine host Archidemides has done me this. Where, then, is my son, Mnesilochus, at present?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> He has gone to the market-place to pay his respects to the Deities and his friends.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Then I'll go hence to meet him as soon as I can. <stage>(Exit NICOBULUS.)</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> He's right well loaded, and carries more than his proper burden. Not so very badly has this web been commenced by me, that I may find means for the son of my master in his amour. I've managed it so, that he may take as much of the gold as he chooses, and give up to his father as much as he may like to give up. The old gentleman will be going hence to Ephesus to fetch his gold; here our life will be spent in a delicious manner, since the old man will leave me and Mnesilochus here, and not be taking us along with him. O! what a kick-up I shall be making here. But what's to be done, when the old gentleman shall have discovered this? When he shall have found out that he has made his journey thither to no purpose, and that we have misspent his gold, what will become of me after that?

By fact have I experienced it so to be. For when I departed hence to Ephesus ('tis now almost two years ago it happened), from Ephesus I sent letters hither to my friend Pistoclerus, requesting that he would find out my mistress Bacchis for me. I hear that he has found her, as my servant Chrysalus has brought me word. How aptly, too, has he framed a device against my father about the gold, that I may have abundance in my amour.

'Tis better for you to be styled extravagant than ungrateful; but, i' faith, in my way of thinking at least, there's nothing more extravagant than the ungrateful man. The former the good will praise, the latter even the bad will censure. 'Twere better for an ill-doer to escape than for a benefactor to be deserted. For this reason, then, it behoves me to take the greater care; I needs must be on the watch. Now, Mnesilochus, the sample is on view, now the contest is being decided, whether you are or are not such as you ought to be; good or bad, of whichever kind; just or unjust, penurious or liberal, fretful or complying. Take you care, if you please, lest you let your servant exce. you in doing well. Whatever you shall prove, I warn you, you shall not be concealed.

<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>(aside).</stage> I'm sorely vexed, to my sorrow, that on my account these things should be said about my friend. In his innocence he incurs this suspicion for my sake.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILOXENUS</speaker><p> The manners, Lydus, now are altered.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> That, for my part, I know full well. For formerly, a man used to receive public honors by the votes of the people, before he ceased to be obedient to one appointed his tutor. But now-a-days, before he is seven years old, if you touch a boy with your hand, at once the child breaks his tutor's head with his tablet. When you go to complain to the father, thus says the father to the child: "Be you my own dear boy, since you can defend yourself from an injury." The tutor then is called for; "Hallo! you old good-for-nothing<milestone n="444" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">You old good-for-nothing</lemma>:  That is, in his capacity as a slave, a purchaseable commodity.</note>, don't you be touching the child for this reason, that he has behaved so boldly;" and thus the despised tutor becomes just like a lantern<milestone n="446" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Just like a lantern</lemma>:  This passage has been much discussed by various Commentators. It is, however, most probable that the Romans used lanterns made of oiled linen cloth; and that he is comparing his head, when it has been broken by the tablets, and plaistered over with oiled linen, to one of these lanterns. In his Epistles to Atticus, <bibl n="Cic. Att. 4.3">B. 4, Ep. 3</bibl>, Cicero makes mention of "linen lanterns."</note> with his oiled linen rags. Judgment pronounced, they go away thence. Can this preceptor then, on these terms, keep up his authority, if he himself is to be beaten the first?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. This is a severe accusation. So far as I understand his words, 'tis strange if Pistoclerus has never thumped Lydus with his fists.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> <stage>seeing MNESILOCHUS</stage>. But who is it that I see standing here before the door? O Philoxenus, I would not prefer for myself to behold even the propitious Gods rather than him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILOXENUS</speaker><p> Who's this? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> Why, he's Mnesilochus, the friend of your son. He is not of a like turn of mind with him who reclines and takes his meals in brothels. Fortunate Nicobulus! who begot him for himself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILOXENUS</speaker><p> <stage>(advancing).</stage> My greetings to you, Mnesilochus; I'm glad that you have arrived safe.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> May the Gods favour you, Philoxenus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> He, now, was born at a lucky moment for his father; he goes to sea, attends to the interests of his family, takes care of the house, is obedient and attentive to the wish and commands of his father. He, when but a boy, was the companion of Pistoclerus in his boyhood; 'tis not by three days that he is the older in age, but his disposition is more improved by thirty years than that of the other.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILOXENUS</speaker><p> Beware of a mischief<milestone n="463" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Of a mischief</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Malo</foreign>" seems here to be a preferable reading to "<foreign lang="la">malum</foreign>." He alludes to the punishment, to which Lydus, as a slave, is liable.</note>, and forbear to speak of him unjustly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> Hold your peace. You're a foolish man, who cannot bear to have him badly spoken of who does badly. But I would rather have him draw upon my mishaps than upon my savings<milestone n="465" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Upon my savings</lemma>:  He seems to mean, that he had rather put up with insult, or violence even, from his pupil, than be responsible for his misdeeds in which latter case, probably, some part of his "<foreign lang="la">peculium</foreign>," or "savings," would be taken away from him, in the shape of fines.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILOXENUS</speaker><p> Why so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> Because, if he were to draw upon my mishaps, he would each day be making them less.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> Why, Lydus, are you censuring your pupil, my friend?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> Your friend is ruined. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> May the Gods forbid it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> 'Tis so as I say. And further, I myself saw it when he was undone; I am not censuring him from hearsay.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> What has been done by him?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> He is disgracefully doting upon a harlot.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> Won't you be silent now? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> She, too, like a tide, most voraciously swallows all up, whenever she has touched any one.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> Where does this woman live? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> Here. <stage>(Points to the house.)</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> Whence do they say she comes?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> From Samos. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> What's her name?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> Bacchis. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> You are wrong, Lydus; I know the whole affair, just as it is. You are blaming Pistoclerus without reason, and in his innocence. For he is carefully performing the business enjoined on him by his friend and companion, his sincere well-wisher. Neither is he himself in love, nor do you suppose him so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYDUS</speaker><p> Is it necessary for him carefully to perform the business enjoined upon him by his friend in this fashion--for himself, sitting down, to hold a damsel in his lap who is kissing him? Can the business thus entrusted be in no way transacted unless ever and anon he is placing his hand upon the bosom of Bacchis, or never withdraws his lips from hers? But I'm ashamed to make mention of other things which I have seen him do; when, in my presence, I saw him take most unbecoming liberties with the person of Bacchis, and yet not be at all ashamed. What need of words is there? My pupil, your friend, his son <stage>pointing to PHILOXENUS</stage>, is ruined. For I say that he is ruined, whose modesty in fact is lost. What need of words is there? Had I been willing to wait only a little time, that I might have had a better opportunity of viewing him, I then should, I think, have seen more than would have been proper for me to see, and for him to do.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> <stage>(aside).</stage> Friend, you have undone me. And ought I not to punish this woman with death? I should prefer that I should perish after some dreadful fashion. Isn't it the fact, you know not whom to deem faithful to yourself, or in whom to put your trust?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>LYS.</speaker><p> Don't you see how much he grieves that your son, his friend, has been corrupted? and how he is afflicting himself with sorrow?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILOXENUS</speaker><p> Mnesilochus, I beg this of you, that you will influence his feelings and his disposition. Preserve for yourself a friend as well as a son for me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> I fain would do so. </p></sp>

For, this day, two exploits have I achieved; with twofold spoils have I been graced. So cleverly have I gulled my elder master this day, that he has been made a fool of. The crafty old blade, by my crafty tricks, have I compelled and constrained to believe me in everything. Then, for the son of the old gentleman, my master here in love, together with whom I drink, with whom I eat and go a-courting, I have procured regal and golden trea sures, that he may take from thence at home, and not go seeking abroad.

There's nothing more worthless than a servant without skill--worthless, if he has not a breast mightily well-stocked, so that, whenever there is necessity, he may draw his supply from his own breast. No one can be a person well to do <gap/> unless he understands both how to do good and how to do evil. With rogues he must be a rogue; with thieves let him filch whatever he can.

Why do I see you two sad and sorrowful? I like it not; and 'tis not without some reason. Are you going now to give me any answer?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> I'm undone, Chrysalus. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Perhaps you took too little of the gold.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Why the mischief then, simpleton, since by my skill an opportunity was procured for that very purpose, that you might take as much as you pleased, did you thus take it up with the tips of two fingers<milestone n="675" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Two fingers</lemma>:  He says that when he had the opportunity of gathering up the money by handfuls, he contented himself with taking it only with the tips of his fingers, that is, piece by piece; some would take "<foreign lang="la">digiti duo primores</foreign>" to mean "the two first fingers of the hand;" that is, the forefinger and thumb.

<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> We are done for. How came it into your mind to do this deed so foul?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> I had a suspicion, Chrysalus, by reason of a charge, that Bacchis and he <stage>(pointing to PISTOCLERUS)</stage> had been playing me false; for that reason, in my anger, I gave up all the gold to my father.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> What did you say to your father when you gave up the gold?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> That I had at once received this gold from his host, Archidemides.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Eh! by that speech you have this day consigned Chrysalus to the torture; for, when he shall set eyes on me, the old gentleman will carry me off that instant to the executioner.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> How the plague "easily," for me, whom he has this moment caught out in a lie? Should I entreat him not to believe me at all, he would not venture even to believe me in that.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> Aye, and if you were to hear what things he said about you in my presence.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> What did he say?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>MNESILOCHUS</speaker><p> That if you were to say that this sun was the sun, he would believe it was the moon, and that that is the night which is now the day.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PISTOCLERUS</speaker><p> Now, what would you have us do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Why, nothing, except that I beg you'll still love on. As for the rest, ask of me as much gold as you please; I'll find it you.

<stage>Enter CHRYSALUS from the house of BACCHIS.</stage>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> The two brothers, the sons of Atreus, are said to have done a most famous deed, when, with arms, and horses, and an army, and with chosen warriors, and with ships a thousand in number, after the tenth year, they subdued Pergamus, the native land of Priam, founded by hands divine. Not more decidedly did it fall by the engine of war, than I shall storm my master here, without a fleet, and without an army and so great array of soldiers. I have won, I have taken by storm this gold from his father for my master's son, in his amour. Now, before the old man comes here, I wish to lament until he does come out. O Troy! O my country! O Pergamus! O Priam! old man, you are undone, you, who'll be wretchedly and shockingly choused out of four hundred golden Philippeans. For those tablets, sealed on the one side and on the other, they are not tablets, but the horse which the Greeks sent, of wood. Pistoclerus is the Epeus<milestone n="937" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Is the Epeus</lemma>:  Epeus was the builder of the wooden horse. When the treacherous Sinon was left behind, he lurked in the tomb of Achilles, or, according to some, in that of Palamedes.</note>; from him were these received. Mnesilochus is the Simon left behind. Behold him! not in Achilles' tomb, but on a couch he reclines: he has Bacchis with him; just as the other formerly had the fire with which to give the signal; so now does she inflame himself. I am Ulysses, by whose advice they do these things. Then, the characters which there are written, are the soldiers in this horse, armed and of high courage. So even thus far has the matter prospered with me. This horse, too, will be making his attack, not on a citadel, but on a coffer<milestone n="943" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Not on a citadel, but on a coffer</lemma>:  He puns on the resemblance of the words "<foreign lang="la">arcem</foreign>," a "citadel," and "<foreign lang="la">arcam</foreign>," a "chest" or "coffer."</note> A ruin, a destruction, a cleaner-out of the old man's gold, will this horse prove this day. To this silly old man of ours, in fact, I give the name of Ilium; the Captain is Menela&uuml;s; I, Agamemnon; I, too, am Ulysses, the son of La&euml;rtes; Mnesilochus is Alexander<milestone n="947" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Alexander</lemma>:  Alexander was one of the names of Paris, the son of Priam.</note>, who will be the destruction of his father's fortunes; he has borne off the Helen, on whose account I am now carrying on the siege of Ilium. For there I have heard say that Ulysses was both bold and full of mischief, just as I am. I have been detected in my tricks--he, discovered in a beggar's guise, had almost perished, while he was spying out there the doings of the Trojans. Similarly has it happened to myself to-day. I have been bound, but by my devices I have redeemed myself; he, too, preserved himself by artifice. I have heard that there were three destinies<milestone n="953" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">There were three destinies</lemma>:  He has omitted three of the circumstances by which the downfall of Troy was to be precipitated--namely: if the horses of Rhesus should be captured before they had tasted of the pastures of Troy and the waters of Xanthus; if the bow and arrow of Hercules should be employed in the siege; and if one of the posterity of Achilles should be present, in all which circumstances the Greeks were eventually favoured.</note> attending Troy, which were fatal to it; if the statue should be lost from the citadel; whereas the second was the death of Troilus; the third was when the upper lintel of the Phrygian gate<milestone n="955" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The Phrygian gate</lemma>:  This was the Sc&aelig;an gate, near the tomb of King Laomedon</note> should be demolished. Just so are there three fatalities for this Troy of ours, corresponding with those three; for, first of all, when, a short time since, as I told our old gentleman the lying story about his host, and the gold, and the bark, then, that instant, did I steal the statue<milestone n="958" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Steal the statue</lemma>:  The Palladium was stealthily carried off from Troy by Ulysses and Diomedes.</note> from the citadel. And even then two fatalities were remaining, and no further had I taken this city. Afterwards, when I carried the letter to the old man, then I killed my Troilus. When he supposed, just now, that Mnesilochus was with the Captain's wife, from that, with difficulty, did I disengage myself. And that danger do I compare to what they say, how that Ulysses, recognized by Helen<milestone n="963" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Recognized by Helen</lemma>:  He alludes here, and in l. 951, to the occasion when Ulysses entered Troy as a spy, in the disguise of a beggar, on which occasion he was recognized by Helen.</note>, was betrayed to Hecuba. But as, in olden time, by his coaxing arts, he liberated himself from her, and persuaded her to let him go, so I, by my devices, have rescued myself from the danger, and have deceived the old man. Afterwards, I engaged with the blustering Captain, who, unarmed, takes cities with his words, and there I repulsed my man. Then I engaged in fight with the old gentleman; straightway by one lying device did I vanquish him; by one blow, in a moment, did I take the spoils away from him. He now will give the two hundred Philippean pieces to the Captain, which he has promised that he will give. <gap/> Now, I have occasion for another two hundred, to be distributed when Ilium is taken, that there may be the usual draught of honeyed wine<milestone n="972" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Draught of honeyed wine</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Mulsum</foreign>." This was a mixture of wine and honey, flavoured with myrrh, cassia, nard, costum, or pepper. On the occasion of a triumph, the soldiers were treated to copious draughts of this mixture.</note> with which the soldiers may celebrate their triumph. But this Priam is far superior to him of old. Not fifty sons only has he, but four hundred, and all choice ones, without a blemish; all these this day will I cut off at two single blows. Now, if there were any purchaser for this Priam of ours, I would sell the old fellow in the lump<milestone n="976" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In the lump</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Coemptionalem senem</foreign>." Those slaves were called "coemptionales" who, by reason of age or bad character, were so utterly worthless that they would fetch no price, and were consequently thrown into a lot with other slaves or property of real value.</note>, whom I have on sale the moment that J shall have taken the city. But, lo! I see our Priam standing before the door; I'll go and speak to him.

<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> I don't care, and I don't wish to know.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Still, do come here. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> What need is there?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Hold your tongue. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> I won't, I say.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> <stage>looking at the tablets</stage>. Heyday! he hasn't been sparing<milestone n="993" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Hasn't been sparing</lemma>:  By this expression he means that his son has written a very long letter, as he has been neither sparing of the wax for the table's, nor of the use of the "stylus" or pen.</note> of his wax or pen. But whatever it is, I'm resolved to read it through. Attend to me, please, this very instant.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> When you choose, read on; I devote to you the attention of my ears.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> <stage>looking close</stage>. Bless me! the letters are small.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> To one, indeed, who cannot see well with his eyes but they are quite large enough for one who can see well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Give your attention then. <stage>He reads.</stage> "Father, I beseech you, do give two hundred Philippeans to Chrysalus, if you wish me to be safe or alive for you----"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> By my troth, really a very great mistake, I tell you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> What's the matter? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> He hasn't first written the salutation to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> <stage>looking</stage>. I don't see it anywhere.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Even from its very commencement the letter is an impertinent one. If you are wise, you'll not give it; but at the best, if you give it him, why, let him find out some other porter for himself, if he is wise; for I won't carry it if you order me ever so much. I've been quite enough suspected as it is, when I was guiltless of a fault.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Listen on now, while I read through what's written. <stage>(Reading.)</stage> "I am ashamed, father, to appear before you in your presence; such disgraceful conduct of mine have I heard that you are aware of, that I have formed an intercourse with the wife of a strange Captain." By my troth, you are not joking there; for I have saved your life from the consequences of this foul deed with two hundred golden Philippeans.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> There's not a particle of these things but what I've told him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> <stage>reading</stage>. "I confess that I have acted foolishly. But I beseech you, father, do not forsake me, if, in my folly, I have transgressed. Of fierce desires, and eyes uncontrolled, have I been; I have been urged on to do a deed of which I am now ashamed." It were proper, then, that you should have taken heed before you were ashamed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> All these very same words did I say to him only just now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> <stage>reading</stage>. "I beseech you, father, to consider that it is enough that Chrysalus has reproached me with many cutting words, and by his advice has made me a better man, so that 'tis right that you should return him sincere thanks."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Is that written there? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Look and see, then you'll know. <stage>Shows him the letter.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> He that has so offended, how humble to all he is, and of his own accord.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> <stage>reading</stage>. "Now, father, if even yet I may be allowed to ask anything of you, do give me two hundred Philippean pieces, I do entreat you."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> By my troth, now, not one even, if you are wise.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Let me read on. <stage>Reading.</stage> "In set form<milestone n="1028" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In set form</lemma>:  Of course the oath would be the more solemn in such case.</note> I have taken an oath that I would give this to the woman this day before nightfall, ere she leaves me. Now, father, have a care that I be not forsworn, and take me hence away from her as soon as you can, on whose account I have incurred so much loss and guilt. Take care and let not the two hundred pieces be a cause of annoyance to you; I will repay you innumerable times as much, if I live. Farewell, and do attend to these matters." Now, Chrysalus, what do you think?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> I won't give you one bit of advice this day, and I won't run the risk, that if any mistake is made, you should say that you had done it by my counsel. But, as I conceive, if I were in your place, I would rather give the gold than suffer him to be corrupted. There is a twofold choice consider which you would adopt; either to lose the gold, or for a lover to be forsworn. I neither order you, nor forbid you, nor do I persuade you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> I'm sorry for him. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> You don't do anything surprising--he is your son. If still more must be lost, 'tis better for it to go, than for this disgrace to be everywhere proclaimed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> By my troth, I certainly had much rather he had been at Ephesus, so long as he was well, than that he had returned home. But why don't I hasten to get rid of that which is doomed to be squandered away? I'll bring you just now from in-doors twice two hundred Philippeans, both those which, a little time since, to my sorrow, I promised to the Captain, and these others. Wait there; I'll be out to you, Chrysalus, this instant. <stage>Goes into his house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Troy is laid waste, the chiefs have razed Pergamus. I knew some time ago that I should be the ruin of Pergamus. I' faith I wouldn't dare make a bet with him who should say that I was deserving of severe torture; so great confusion am I making. But the door makes a noise; the plunder's being brought forth from Troy. For the present I'll hold my tongue.
<stage>with the money in two bays.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Take you this gold, Chrysalus; go, carry it to my son. But I'll go hence to the market-place to pay this to the Captain.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> For my part, I'll not receive it; do you seek somebody at once to take it. I won't have it entrusted to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> But do take it; you're worrying me now. <stage>Holds it to him.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> For my part, I'll not take it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> But, prithee do. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> I am telling you what is the fact.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> You are delaying me. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> I don't want, I say, the gold to be entrusted to me. At all events, find some person to keep a watch upon me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> You're plaguing me. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> Well, give it me, if it must be so. <stage>Holds out his hand.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> <stage>gives him the money</stage>. Take care of it. I'll be back here just now. <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHRYSALUS</speaker><p> I've taken care----that you shall be a most wretched old fellow; this is bringing an undertaking to a fair ending; even as it has proved my lot to go rejoicing, laden with the spoil. With safety to myself, and the city taken by stratagem, I now bring home my whole army unhurt. But, Spectators, don't you now be surprised that I don't go in triumph; 'tis such a common thing, I don't care for it. Still however, the soldiers shall be received with the usual honeyed wine. Now I'll carry off all this booty at once to the Qu&aelig;stor<milestone n="1075" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To the Quaestor</lemma>:  It was the custom of the Romans to deliver to the City Quaestor the plunder taken in war, to be employed in the public service.

<stage>Enter PHILOXENUS.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILOXENUS</speaker><p> The more I revolve it in my breast, what disturbances my son has raised, into what a course of life, and into what habits he unwittingly has headlong plunged himself, the greater is my concern, and the more do I dread lest he may be ruined or corrupted. I know it; I once was of the same age, and I did all these things; but in a quiet way. I was gay, I had my mistress, I drank, I feasted, I made presents, but still it was seldom I did so. The methods, too, please me not which I see parents in general employ towards their sons. I have determined to give some latitude to my son, that he may have some scope for his inclinations. I think that's right; but still, I don't wish him to give way too much to sloth and wantonness. Now I'm going to Mnesilochus, to see whether, as I requested, by his endeavours he has turned him for me to virtue and to sobriety; as, indeed, I am sure he has done if he has met him, of such a disposition is he by nature.  <stage>(Exit.)</stage>

This day has Chrysalus rent me in pieces; Chrysalus has plundered wretched me; he, the villain, by his clever tricks, has shaved, to the very quick, simple me, just as he has pleased.

<sp><speaker>PHILOXENUS</speaker><p> He'll do it. <stage>Takes his arm.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Certainly not--I won't--I don't care--let me alone, now. <stage>Shakes him off.</stage> I had rather punish them both.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILOXENUS</speaker><p> Take you care, you good-for-nothing man, that through your own fault you don't lose even that which the favouring Gods offer you. One half of the gold is offered; take it, and carouse, and enjoy yourself with your partner.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> What, am I to carouse in that very place where my son is being corrupted?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILOXENUS</speaker><p> You must carouse there. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Am I to be the witness of it when she is reclining with him at table?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> Nay, so far as I'm concerned, i' faith, I'll recline at table with your own self.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> My head does itch so<milestone n="1192" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Does itch so</lemma>:  Being in doubt what to do, he scratches his head, and then tries to turn it off by saying, "Bless me, how my head does itch."</note>. <stage>Aside.</stage> I'm a ruined man--I can scarce deny her.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILOXENUS</speaker><p> And has it not before this come into your mind, that if, while you live, you enjoy yourself, that, i' faith, is for no very long time; and that, if you lose the present day, it can never return to you after you are dead?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> What am I to do? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILOXENUS</speaker><p> What are you to do? Do you even ask it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> I should like, and yet I'm afraid.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> What are you afraid of?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Lest I should be exposed before my son and my servant.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> Pray now, my honey; such things do happen. He's your own son; whence do you suppose that he is to have money, except that only which you give him yourself? Let me obtain pardon of you for them both.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. How she does work her way. She's now prevailing on me against that which I was quite resolved upon.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> I will love you, and embrace you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Through your doing, and for your sake am I corrupted.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> I certainly had rather 'twere for your own than for mine.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> Come then, however that may be, although it is to my disgrace, I'll submit; I'll induce my feelings to do so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> Have I that solemnly promised?  <gap/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> What I have once said, I will not alter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> The day wears apace. Come into the house, to take your places at table: your sons are expecting within----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>NICOBULUS</speaker><p> How soon, in fact, we may be dead, d'ye mean?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>1st BACCHIS</speaker><p> 'Tis evening, already; come, follow us.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PHILOXENUS</speaker><p> Lead us in like bondsmen<milestone n="1205" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Like bondsmen</lemma>:  "<foreign lang="la">Addicti</foreign>" were those who were made the slaves of their creditors; being thus by law deprived of their liberty until they had paid their debts.</note>. <stage>They go into the house.</stage></p></sp>

<p>Had not these old men been worthless from their youth upwards, they would not, with their hoary heads, have this day done an action so disgraceful; nor, indeed, should we have represented this, if we had not, before this, seen it happen that fathers became the rivals of their sons in the houses of procurers. Spectators, we wish you Farewell! and that you will grant us loud applause.
