<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>

<p>CALIDORUS, a young Athenian, the son of Simo, is in love with Ph&oelig;nicium, a young woman who belongs to Ballio, a procurer. A bargain has been made by the procurer, to sell her to a military officer for twenty min&aelig;; fifteen of these have been paid down, and it has been agreed that when the remaining five and a certain token, with a letter, shall have been sent by the Captain, the damsel shall be sent to him in return. Pseudolus, the servant of Simo, promises his master's son, that, if possible, he will prevent this. They first address Ballio on the subject; but their attempts to influence him are all in vain. Pseudolus then devises a plan to get some money out of Simo, by whom, however, it is discovered; but, after having acknowledged his fault, he prevails upon the old gentleman to promise him twenty min&aelig; if he shall contrive to get the girl out of the procurer's hands. Harpax, the messenger from the Captain, in the meantime makes his appearance. Being a stranger to the place, he unwittingly delivers the Captain's letter and the token to Pseudolus, who pretends that he is the head-servant of the procurer. Charinus, the friend of Calidorus, lends him five min&aelig;; and, provided with this, Pseudolus equips Simmia, a servant of Charinus, so as to represent the messenger from the Captain. He finds the procurer, delivers the letter, pays the five mine, and carries off the damsel. Ballio then makes a bet of twenty min&aelig; with Simo, that Pseudolus shall not outwit him that day. The real Harpax now applies to Ballio for the girl, and the trick being discovered, the procurer has to pay back the fifteen min&aelig; to the Captain, and the twenty for the bet which he has made with Simo. Simo then pays the twenty min&aelig;, which he has promised to Pseudolus if he should succeed in outwitting the procurer. Pseudolus is handsomely entertained by Calidorus, and engages to return to Simo one-half of the money, if he wil join the entertainment.

<p>ATTEND to me this day; good things I bring upon the stage; for I think 'tis very just that to the good good things should be brought; as likewise bad things to the bad; that those who are bad may have what's bad, those who are good what's good; bad men are bad because they hate the good; because the good contemn the bad, needs must be that they are good; and therefore, you are good since you have ever abhorred the bad; and both by your laws, Quirites, and by your legions, have you routed them with good success. In like manner now do you give your goodly attention to this goodly company, which is a good one, and. to good people brings this day good things. Ears, eyes, and understanding, shall be amply filled. He that comes hungry or thirsty to the theatre, the same shall carefully give his attention both through laughter and a sharpened stomach; while those who are full will laugh, the hungry will be carping. Now, if you are wise, you hungry ones, give place, and go away; you who are full, stand--aye, sit you down, and give attention. I shall not now divulge the plot, nor yet the name of this play--Pseudolus will fully do that. I imagine then and I think that this is enough which I have said to you. Where mirth, jokes, laughter, wine, and jollity, are the order of the day, the Graces, too, and propriety, joyousness, and delight; he who seeks for other things, that person appears to seek for evil. Away, then, with evil cares, as being men at your ease this day. <milestone n="1" unit="TLN line"/>'Tis better for your loins to be stretched<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Loins to be stretched</lemma>:  In the sitting position, the muscles of the loins are contracted; hence the present expression.</note>, and for you to arise.

<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> If, master, by your being silent, I could be in-formed what miseries are afflicting you so sadly, I would willingly have spared the trouble of two persons--of myself in asking you, and of yourself in answering me. Since, however, that cannot be, necessity compels me to enquire of you. Answer me: What's the reason that, out of spirits for these many days past, you've been carrying a letter about with you, washing it with your tears, and making no person the sharer of your purpose? Speak out, that what I am ignorant of, I may know together with yourself.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Is it allowable for me to know what it is? For hitherto you have had me as chief confidant in your plans.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> The same is now my intention.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Let me know then what's the matter with you. I'll aid you either with resources, or with my efforts, or with good counsel.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Do you take this letter: do you thence inform yourself what misery and what care are wasting me away.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Where is she, prithee?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Be silent, while I read the letter through.</p></sp>

"Cuckoo" seems to have been in all ages a term of reproach. Horace mentions it as being applied by the common people to the vintagers in the autumn. Shakspeare, in the beautiful song in the Fifth Act of Love's Labour Lost, has these lines:
<quote lang="en"><lg type="iambic"><l>The cuckoo then on every tree,</l>
<l>Mocks married men, for thus sings he,</l>
<l>Cuckoo!</l>
<l>Cuckoo! cuckoo! O word of fear,</l>
<l>Unpleasing to a married ear!</l></lg></quote>
Perhaps the reason of this epithet being deemed opprobrious was the simple fact that the cuckoo is the laziest of birds, inasmuch as it is too idle to build its own nest. The subject is further referred to in a future note.</note>? You shall survive.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Why should I not weep, who have neither a coin of silver in ready money, nor have the hope of a groat<milestone n="98" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Hope of a groat</lemma>: " Libella" was the smallest silver coin among the Romans, the tenth part of a "denarius."</note> anywhere in the world?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> As I understand the tenor of this letter, unless you weep for her with tears of silver, the affection which you wish yourself by those tears to prove is of no more value than if you were to pour water into a sieve. But have no fear, I'll not forsake you in your love. In troth, I do trust that this day, from some quarter or other, by my good aid I shall find you help in the money line.

<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> In you are now centred all the hopes of my existence.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Ask of me twenty min&aelig;, that you may be assured that I'll procure for you that which I have promised. Ask them of me, by my troth, prithee do; I long to make the promise.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Will you this day find me twenty min&aelig; of silver?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> I will find them; be no more troublesome to me then. And this I tell you first, that you mayn't deny that it was told you; if I can no one else, I'll diddle your father out of the money.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> So far as filial affection is concerned, even my mother as well. May the Gods always preserve you for me. But what if you are not able?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Upon that matter do you go to sleep with either eye.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> The latter is too common an expression. Now, that no one may affirm that it wasn't told him, I tell you all <stage>to the AUDIENCE</stage>, in the presence of the youths in this audience, and of all the people, to all my friends and all my acquaintances I give notice, that for this day they must guard against me, and not trust me.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> What's the matter? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> There was a noise at the procurer's door.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> I could only wish it were his legs in preference.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Yes, and he himself is coming out from in-doors, the perjured scoundrel. <stage>They stand at a distance.</stage></p></sp></div1>

Now, therefore, this is the best thing to do; for me to call you each by her name, that no one of you may be declaring to me by-and-by that her business hasn't been told her. Give attention, all of you. In the first place, Hedylium, my business is with you--you, who are the favorite of the corn-merchants, men who have, all of them, immense mountains of wheat piled up at home; take you care that wheat is brought here for me, to suffice this year to come for myself and all my household, and that I may so abound in corn that the city may change my name for me, and instead of the procurer Ballio proclaim me King lasions<milestone n="193" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">King Iasion</lemma>:  Iasius or Iasion, was a king of <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName>, the father of Atalanta, who attended the hunt of the Calydonian boar, and was beloved by Meleager There was another person of the same name, who was the lover of <placeName key="tgn,7010621">Ceres</placeName>, and was slain by the thunderbolts of Jove.

<stage>CALIDORUS and PSEUDOLUS come forward. BALLIO stands near his door.</stage>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Pseudolus, don't you hear what he says?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> I hear it, master, and I give good heed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> What do you advise me to send him, that he mayn't devote my mistress to dishonor?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Don't you trouble yourself about that; be of cheerful mind. I'll manage for myself and for you. For some time past I've been on terms of goodwill with him, and he with me; and our friendship is of old standing. I'll send him this day, on his birthday, a mischief heavy and well-matured.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> What's the plan? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Can't you attend to something else?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> But---- </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Tut.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> I'm distracted. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Harden your heart.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> I cannot. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Make yourself to can.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> By what means, pray, can I prevail upon my feelings?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Carry you out that which is to your advantage, rather than give heed with your feelings to the thing that's disadvantageous.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> That's nonsense; there is no pleasure, unless a lover acts like a fool.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Do you persist? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> O my dear Pseudolus, let me be undone--do let me, please.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Stay, stay. As you shall, then, wish me to be, so will I be.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Now, at last, you are in your senses.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> <stage>coming forward from the door of his house to the other side of the stage</stage>. The day is passing; I'm causing delay to myself. Boy, do you go before me. <stage>Moves as if going.</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Why the plague do you go so slowly, boy?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> You born on this day, hallo! you born on this day; I'm calling to you; hallo! you born on this day, come you back and look at us. Although you are busy, we want you; stop--it's because some persons want to speak to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> What's this? Who is it, when I'm busy, causes me unseasonable delay?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> He that has been your supporter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> He's dead that has been; only he that is, is now alive.

<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> May Jupiter confound you, whoever you are.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> May we not speak with you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Why, it doesn't please me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> But if it's something to your advantage?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Am I allowed to go away, pray, or am I not?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Pshaw! Stop. <stage>Catches hold of him.</stage> BAL. Let me go.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Ballio, listen. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I'm deaf.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Really, you are uncivil. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> You are a chatterer of nonsense.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> I gave you money so long as I had it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I'm not asking what you gave.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> I'll give you some when I have it.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Alas, alas! In what a foolish fashion have I lavished what I brought to you, and what I gave you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Your wealth defunct, you now are talking about it; you are a simpleton, a cause that has been tried you are trying over again.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> At least consider him, who he is.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I've known for a long time now who he was; who he now is, let him know himself. Do you walk on <stage>to the BOY</stage>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> And can't you, Ballio, only once give a look this way for your own profit?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> At that price I'll give a look; for if I were sacrificing to supreme Jupiter, and were presenting<milestone n="266" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">And were presenting</lemma>:  "Porricio" was the word especially employed to signify the act of laying the entrails on the altar, for the purpose of burning them.</note> the entrails in my hands to lay them on the altar, if in the meanwhile anything in the way of profit were offered, I should in preference forsake the sacrifice. There's no being able to resist that sort of piety, however other things go.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. The very Gods, whom it is especially our duty to reverence--them he esteems of little value.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I'll speak to him. Hail to you, right heartily, the very vilest slave in Athens.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> May the Gods and Goddesses favour you, Ballio, both at his wish and at my own; or, if you are deserving of other terms, let them neither favour nor bless you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> What's the matter, Calidorus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Love and pinching want<milestone n="273" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Love and pinching want</lemma>:  "Amatur atque egetur aeritor." Literally, "it is loved, and is wanted sharply."</note> are the matter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I would pity you, if, upon pity I could support my establishment.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Aye, aye, we know you quite well, what sort of character you are; don't be proclaiming it. But do you know what we want?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I' faith, I know it pretty nearly; that there may be something unfortunate for me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Both to that and this for which we called you back, prithee do give your attention.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I am attending; but compress into a few words what you want, as I'm busy now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> He <stage>pointing to CALIDORUS</stage> is quite ashamed about what he promised you, and the day for which he promised it, that he hasn't even yet paid you those twenty min&aelig; for his mistress.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> That which we are ashamed at is much more easily endured than that which we are vexed at. At not having paid the money, he is ashamed; I, because I have not received it, am vexed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Still, he'll pay it, he'll procure it; do you only wait some days to come. But he has been afraid of this, that you'll sell her on account of his embarrassment.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> He had an opportunity, had he wished, of paying the money long ago.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> What if I had it not? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> If you had been in love, you would have found it on loan. You would have gone to the usurer<milestone n="287" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To the usurer</lemma>:  "Danista" from the Greek <foreign lang="greek">dani/sths,</foreign> "an usurer."</note>; you would have paid the interest; or else you would have pilfered it from your father.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Ought he to have pilfered it from his father, you most shameless villain? There is no fear that you'll point out to him anything that's right.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> That's not like a procurer. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> And could I possibly pilfer anything from my father, an old man so much on his guard? And besides, if I could do so, filial affection forbids.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I understand you; do you then at night embrace filial affection in place of Ph&oelig;nicium. But since I see you prefer your filial affection to your love--are all men your fathers? Is there no one for you to ask to lend you some money?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Why, the very name of lending's dead and gone by this.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Look you now; since, i' faith<milestone n="296" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Since, i' faith</lemma>:  He alludes probably to the recent fraudulent failure of some well-known bankers.</note>, those fellows arose from the banker's table, with a filled skin, who, when they called in their own, paid what they had borrowed to no born creature, since then, I say, all people have been more cautious not to trust another.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Most wretched am I; nowhere am I able to find a coin of silver; so distractedly am I perishing both through love and want of money.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Buy oil on credit<milestone n="301" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Buy oil on credit</lemma>:  "Emito die c&aelig;c&acirc;--id vendito oculat&acirc; die." By buying a commodity "on a blind day," and selling it "on one with eyes," is meant the system of credit for the purposes of business; where they who purchase on that principle have an eye only to the present time, but are blind as to the future consequences of their speculation.

<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> To trust him, indeed! How now, do you repent of the great profit he has been to you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> No lover is a profitable one, except him who keeps continually making presents. Either let him be always giving, or when he has nothing, let him at the same time cease to be in love.</p></sp>

And some time since had I said that I would find them for him, and I had attempted to throw a net over our old gentleman; however, by what means I know not, he perceived it beforehand. But my voice and my talking must be stopped; for, see! I perceive my master, Simo, coming this way, together with his neighbour, Callipho.

<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> He confesses it. Didn't I tell you so just now, Callipho?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLIPHO</speaker><p> So I remember. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Why, directly you knew of these things, were they kept concealed from me? Why wasn't I made acquainted with them?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> I'll tell you: because I was unwilling that a bad custom should originate in me, for a servant to accuse his master before his master.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Wouldn't you order this fellow to be dragged head first to the treadmills<milestone n="494" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To the treadmill</lemma>:  "Pistrinum." The establishment of each wealthy person had its "pistrinum," or "handmill," where the mill for grinding corn was worked by the hand of slaves. The most worthless and refractory were employed at this labour, and as the task was deemed a degradation, the "pistrinum" was the usual place of punishment for the slaves of the household. Throughout this translation, the liberty has been in general taken of conveying the meaning of the term by the use of the word "treadmill."</note>?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLIPHO</speaker><p> Has he done anything amiss, Simo?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Yes, very much so. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> <stage>to CALLIPHO</stage>. Be quiet, I quite well understand my own affairs, Callipho. Is this a fault? Now then, give your attention to the reason why I you kept ignorant of this amour. I knew that the treadmill was close at hand, if I told you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> And didn't you know, as well, that the treadmill would be close at hand when you kept silent on it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> I did know it. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Why wasn't it told me?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> The one evil was close at hand, the other at a greater distance; the one was at the moment, the other was a few days off.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> What will you be doing now? For assuredly the money cannot be got in this quarter out of me, who have especially detected it. I shall forthwith give notice to all that no one is to trust him the money.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> I' faith, I'll never go begging to any person, so long, at all events, as you shall be alive; troth, you shall find me the money; and as for me, I shall take it from you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> You, take it from me? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Undoubtedly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Troth, now, knock out my eye, if I do find it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> You shall provide it. I warn you then to be on your guard against me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> By my troth, I know this for sure; if you do take it away, you will have done a wonderful and a great exploit.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> I will do it, however. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> But if you don't carry it off?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Then flog me with rods. But what if I do carry it off?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> I give you Jupiter as your witness, that you shall pass your life free from punishment.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Take care and remember that. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Could I possibly be unable to be on my guard, who am forewarned?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> I forewarn you to be on your guard. I say you must be on your guard, I tell you. Keep watch. Look, now, with those same hands will you this day give me the money</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> By my troth, 'tis a clever mortal if he keeps his word.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Carry me away to be your slave if I don't do it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> You speak kindly and obligingly; for at present you are not mine, I suppose.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Would you like me to tell you, too, what you will still more wonder at?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Come, then; i' faith, I long to hear it; I listen to you with pleasure.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Before I fight that battle, I shall first fight another battle, famous and memorable.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> What battle? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Why, with the procurer your neighbour; by means of stratagem and artful tricks, I'l cleverly bamboozle the procurer out of this music-girl, with whom your son is so desperately in love; and I surely will have both of these things effected this very day, before the evening.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Well, if you accomplish these tasks as you say, you will surpass in might King Agathocles<milestone n="532" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">King Agathocles</lemma>:  Agathocles was famous for having risen, by his valour and merit, from being the son of a potter to be the King of Sicily.</note>. But if you don't do it, is there any reason why I shouldn't forthwith put you in the treadmill?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Not for one day, but, i' faith, for all, whatever the time. But if I effect it, will you not at once give me the money of your own free will for me to pay to the procurer?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLIPHO</speaker><p> Pseudolus is making a fair claim; say "I'll give it."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> But still, do you know what comes into my mind? Suppose they have made an arrangement, Callipho, among themselves, or are acting in concert, and on a preconcerted plan, to bamboozle me out of the money?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Who would be more audacious than myself, if I dared to do such an action? Well, Simo, if we are thus in collusion, or have ever arranged any plan, do you mark me quite all over with elm-tree stripes<milestone n="545" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With elm-tree stripes</lemma>:  "Stylis ulmeis," "with elm-tree styli."

<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Now then, proclaim the games as soon as you please.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Give me your attention, Callipho, I beg you, for this day, so that you may not any way employ yourself upon other business.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLIPHO</speaker><p> Why, now, I had made up my mind yesterday to go into the country.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Still, do you now change the plan which you had resolved upon.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLIPHO</speaker><p> I am now resolved not to go away on account of this; I have an inclination to be a spectator of your games, Pseudolus; and if I shall find that he doesn't give you the money which he has promised, rather than it shouldn't be done, I'll give it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> I shall not change my purpose.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Because, by my faith, if you don't give it, you shall be dunned for it with clamour great and plenteous. Come, now, move yourselves off hence into the house this instant, and in turn give room for my tricks.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Be it so. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLIPHO</speaker><p> You may have your way,</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> But I want you to keep close at home.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Well, that assistance I promise you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALLIPHO</speaker><p> But I shall be off to the Forum. I'll be back here presently. <stage>Exit CALLIPHO. SIMO goes into his house.</stage></p></sp>

I will not change my design; so far as that then I know for certain; by what means I'm to carry it out not at all do I know as yet; only this, that so it shall be. For he that appears upon the stage in a new character, him it befits to bring something that is new. If he cannot do that, let him give place to him who can.

For the Goddess Opportunity herself could not come to me more opportunely, than has this letter in this opportune manner been brought to me. For this has been brought as a horn of plenty<milestone n="671" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A horn of plenty</lemma>:  He alludes to the "Cornucopia," or "horn of plenty," of the heathen Mythology, respecting which we find varying accounts in the ancient writers. Some say that by it was meant the horn of the goat Amalthen, which suckled Jupiter, and that the Nymphs gave it to Achelo&uuml;s, who afterwards exchanged it for the horn of which Hercules afterwards deprived him in the contest for the hand of Deianira. Ovid, in the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, represents it as being the same horn which was broken off by Hercules. "And that was not enough: while his relentless right hand was holding my stubborn born, he broke it, and tore it away from my mutilated forehead. This heaped with fruit and odoriferous flowers, the Nymphs have consecrated, and the bounteous Goddess Plenty is enriched by my horn."</note>, in which there is whatever I wish for: here are my wiles, here all my tricks, here my stratagems, here my money, here his mistress for my master's son so much in love. And now how vaunting shall I show myself; how, with a breast so fertile in expedients, I was to do each thing, how, to steal away the damsel from the procurer, I had all my plans arranged in order in my mind as I desired, fixed, planned out. But, no doubt, thus will it come to pass: this Goddess Fortune, unaided, prevails over the designs of a hundred armed men. And this is the fact, just as each person uses his fortune, so does he surpass others, and forthwith we all pronounce him wise. When we learn that the counsels of any person have turned out well, we declare that he is a prudent man; but that he is a fool who is unsuccessful. In our folly we know not how much we are mistaken, when we eagerly wish anything to be given to us; as though we ourselves could possibly know what is for our advantage. We lose what is certain, while we are seeking what is uncertain. And this comes to pass, amid labours and amid sorrow, that death meanwhile comes creeping on. But there's enough now of philosophizing; I have been talking too long, and at too great length. Immortal Gods! my lie was not dear at its weight in double-distilled gold, which I just now trumped up here on the spur of the moment, when I said that I belonged to the procurer. Now, through this letter shall I deceive three persons--my master, and the procurer, and him who gave me this letter.

<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Will you then boldly enjoin me what it is necessary to do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> My thanks, so far. May it be well with you, Charinus; I don't like that we should be troublesome to you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> You, troublesome to me? Now, really, that's troublesome.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Well, then, wait a moment. <stage>Takes the letter out from under his dress.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> What's that? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> This letter have I just now intercepted, and the token.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Token? What token? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> The one that was brought just now from the Captain. His servant, who was bringing it, with five mine&aelig; of silver, who came to fetch your mistress hence, him I have just now bamboozled.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> For the sake of these Spectators the play is being performed; they know, who were present here; you I'll tell at another time.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> What are we to do then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> You shall this day embrace your mistress at liberty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> What, I? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> You yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> I? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Your own self, I say, if indeed this head shall exist so long; if you'll only quickly find me out a man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Of what description? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> A cunning, crafty and clever one, who, when he has once taken hold of the beginning, may by his own ingenuity still hold fast upon what it behoves him to do; one, too, who has not often been seen here.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> If he is a slave, does that matter at all?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Why, I'd much rather have him than a free man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> I think that I'm able to procure for you a cunning and clever fellow, that has lately come to my father from Carystus<milestone n="730" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">From Carystus</lemma>:  This was a city of Eub&oelig;a, opposite the Isle of Andros.</note>, and hasn't as yet gone anywhere out the house, and who never visited Athens before yesterday.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> You assist in right earnest. But I have need to borrow five min&aelig; of silver, which I shall repay this day, for his father <stage>pointing to CALIDORUS</stage> owes it me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> I'll lend it; don't seek it anywhere else.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> O, how convenient a person for me. I have need of a scarf as well, a sword, and a broad-brimmed hat.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> I can provide them from my house. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Immortal Gods! surely this is not Charinus for me, but Abundance. But this servant, who is come here from Carystus, is there anything in him?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Plenty of the stinking goat<milestone n="738" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The stinking goat</lemma>:  He cannot resist the temptation of a pun, though a somewhat unsavoury one. Pseudolus asks if this servant of Charinus is at all sharp. "Quid sapit?" The same words also admit of the meaning, "does he smell of anything?" On which Charinus gives him answer, as though the question had been put in the latter sense, "Yes, of the goat under the arm- pits." The Romans, who were fond of giving a name to everything, whether it was worth it or not, called the strong smell produced by the glands of the arm-pits by the name of "hircus," "the goat," by reason of the rank smell of that animal.</note> in him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> It befits the fellow, then, to have a tunic with long sleeves<milestone n="738" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Tunic with long sleeves</lemma>:  On this dirty answer being given him, Pesudolus says, "Well, then, he must have an under-garment with long sleeves," "manuleata tunica," in order to suppress the offensive smell. The use of the long-sleeved tunic was considered to denote great effeminacy.</note> Has the chap anything sharp<milestone n="739" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Anything sharp</lemma>:  "Ecquid aceti."

<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Aye, of the very sharpest. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> But if it is necessary for him to draw forth what is sweet from the same place, has he aught of that?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Do you ask that He has wine of myrrh, sweet raisin wine, spice wine<milestone n="741" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Raisin wine, spice wine</lemma>:  "Passum" was wine made from grapes dried in the sun. "Defrutum" was new wine boiled down to one-half with herbs and spices to make it keep.</note> honey wine, sweets of every sort. Why, he once began to set up a hot liquor-shop in his breast.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Bravissi o! Why, Charinus, you beat me cleverly<milestone n="743" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">You beat me cleverly</lemma>:  "Lamberas." The verb "lambero" generally signifies "to tear in pieces."</note> at my own game. But what am I to say is the name of this servant?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Simmia. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> In a difficulty, does he understand how to twirl about?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> A whirlwind<milestone n="745" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A whirlwind</lemma>:  "Turbo" may mean either a "spinning-" or "whipping-top," or a "whirlwind," here.</note> is not so ready as he.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Is he shrewd at all? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> In mischievous tricks<milestone n="746" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In mischievous tricks</lemma>:  "Argutus," as an adjective, signifies "clever," "shrewd." As the past participle of the verb "arguo," it means "accused." Pseudolus asks if he is "shrewd," "argutus" to which the other answers evasively, "O yes (he has been accused," "argutus"), "of mischievous tricks very often."</note> very often.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> How, when he's caught in the fact?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> He's a very eel; he slips out.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Is this fellow an experienced one?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> A public ordinance<milestone n="748" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A public ordinance</lemma>:  The "plebiscita" among the Romans were the public ordinances, which were proposed by the Tribunes at the "Comitia Tributa" of the people.

"O yes, a public ordinance" "scitum," "is not more knowing," "scitus," "than he is"</note> is not more experienced.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> He is a suitable person, according to what I hear you say.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CHARINUS</speaker><p> Aye, and from this you may know it. When he looks at you he'll tell, of his own accord, what it is you want with him. But what are you about to do?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> I'll tell you. When I've dressed up my man, I intend to make him become the pretended servant of the Captain; let him take this token to the procurer, with five min&aelig; of silver. There's the whole plot for you. As for the rest, in what way he is to do each thing, I'll instruct himself.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> Why, therefore, do we stand here then?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Bring the fellow to me just now, dressed out with all his accoutrements, to &AElig;schinus, the banker's. But make all haste.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>CALIDORUS</speaker><p> We'll be there before you.</p></sp>

Just as this servitude has turned out to me, where I am set over duties great and small; nor am I able to find any admirer to love me, so that at length I might be fitted out in a little better guise. Now this day is the birthday of this procurer. The procurer has made a determination, from the lowest to the highest, that if each one does not this day send him a present, he shall perish to-morrow with the greatest torments.

<milestone unit="scene" n="2"/>
<div1 type="card" n="790">
<stage>Enter BALLIO and a COOK.</stage>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Those who call it the cook's market, call it so foolishly; for 'tis not a cook's market, but a thieves' market. For if, upon oath, I were to seek out the worst of men, I couldn't have brought a worse one than this fellow that I'm bringing, one, chattering, bragging, silly, and worthless. Why, for this very reason Orcus has declined<milestone n="795" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Or cus has declined</lemma>:  "Orcus" is an epithet of Pluto, the king of the Infernal regions, and, sometimes, of the place itself.</note> to take him to himself, that he might be here to cook a banquet for the dead; for here he is able to cook a thing to please them alone.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> If you thought of me in this manner that you are mentioning, why did you hire me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> From scarcity; there wasn't another. But why, if you were a cook, were you sitting in the market-place, you alone behind the rest?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> I'll tell you. By reason of the avarice of men have I become an inferior cook, not through my own inclination.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> For what reason is that? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> I'll tell you. Because, in fact, directly people come to hire a cook, no one enquires for him that's the best and the highest priced: rather do they hire him that's the lowest priced. Through this have I to-day been the only sitter in the market. Those wretched fellows are for a drachma a-piece; not any person is able to prevail on me to rise for less than a didrachm<milestone n="820" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A didrachm</lemma>:  Literally, "nummus," "a coin" or "piece of money," which means a didrachm or piece of two drachm&aelig; in value, or about one shilling and sevenpence of our money.</note>. I don't cook a dinner too, like other cooks, who bring me up seasoned meadows of grass upon their dishes; who turn the guests into oxen, and supply the grass. This herbage, too, do they further season with other herbs: put in coriander, fennel, garlick, orage; they add, too, sorrel, cabbage, beet, and spinach. In this they dissolve a pound weight of asaf&oelig;tida. The roguish mustard is pounded, which makes the eyes of those that pound it drop tears before they have pounded it. These fellows, when they cook dinners, when they do season them, season them, not with seasonings, but with vampyre owls<note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With vampyre owls</lemma>:  "Strigibus." By this expression he probably alludes to the drastic effect of these herbs on those who partook of them. Ovid, in the Sixth Book of the Fasti, has these words: "There are ravenous fowls; not those which used to rob the mouth of Phineus at the board, but thence do they derive their origin. Large are their heads, fixed is their gaze for plunder are their beaks adapted; on their wings is a greyish colour, crooked talons are on their claws. By night they fly, and they seek the children unprotected by the nurse, and pollute their bodies dragged from their cradles. With their beaks they are said to tear the entrails of the sucklings, and they have their maws distended with the blood which they have swallowed. 'Striges' are they called; and the origin of this name is the fact, that they are wont to screech in the dismal night." It is supposed by some persons that, under this name, the vampyre bat is alluded to.</note> which eat out the bowels of the guests while still alive. Through this, in fact, it is, that people here live such short lives, inasmuch as they heap up these herbs of this sort in their stomachs, dreadful to be mentioned, not only to be eaten. Herbage which the cattle eat not, men eat themselves.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> What do you say? Do you use divine seasonings, by which you can prolong the life of men, you, who find fault with these other seasonings?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> I proclaim it boldly; for those who shall eat of my victuals which I have seasoned will be able to exist two hundred years even. For when I've put into the saucepan either cicilendrum, or cepolindrum, or mace<milestone n="832" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Cepolindrum, or mace</lemma>:  With the exception of mace, all these names are gibberish, invented by the Cook for the purpose of imposing upon Bailio.</note>, or saucaptis, the very dishes become warmed forthwith. These are sauces for fish, the cattle of Neptune; the flesh of the earthly cattle I season with cicimandrum, hapalopsis, or cataractria.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Now may Jupiter and all the Divinities confound you with your sauces, and with all those lies of yours!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> Do allow me to speak, please. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Speak, and go to very perdition.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> When all the saucepans are hot, I open them all then does the odour fly towards heaven with its handhanging down<milestone n="841" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">With its hands hanging down</lemma>:  He means to personify the odour and to represent it as flying up to heaven; but, by mistake, he says it flies up, "demissis manibus," with its hands hanging down, which would father be the attitude of a person thrown out of, and falling from, the heavens. Ballio repeats the expression in a tone of surprise, on which the Cook corrects himself, and says he meant to say, "with its feet hanging down," "demissis pedibus."</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> The odour with its hands hanging down?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> I made a mistake without thinking.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> With its feet hanging down, I meant to say. Jupiter dines on that odour every day.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> If you happen not to go out to cook, pray what does Jupiter dine upon?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> He goes to sleep without his dinner.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Go to very perdition. Is it for this reason that I'm to give you a didrachm to-day?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> Well, I confess that I am a very high-priced cook; but I make the results of my labour to be seen for the price, hired at which I go out.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> In thieving, to wit. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> And do you expect to meet with any cook except with the claws of a kite or of an eagle?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> And do you expect to go anywhere to cook, and not to cook the dinner there with your claws tied up? Now, therefore, you boy <stage>to the BOY</stage>, who are my servant, I now give you notice to make haste to remove hence all my property; and to keep his eyes as well in your sight. Whichever way he shall look, do you look the same way as well. If he shall move in any direction, do you move as well. If he shall put forth his hand, put you forth your hand as well. If he shall take anything of his own, do you suffer him to take it; if he shall take what's mine, do you on the other side hold him fast. If he shall stoop to the ground, do you stoop there as well. Likewise over your understrappers I shall appoint a single guard a-piece.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> Only have good courage. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Prithee, tell me how I possibly can have good courage, who am taking you home to my house?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> Because, by my broth, this day will I do just in the way that Medea cooked up the old man Pelias<milestone n="869" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The old man Pelias</lemma>:  The Cook could not be expected to be very learned in the heathen Mythology; and we accordingly find him making a blunder. &AElig;son, the father of Jason, was restored to youth by the charms of Medea; but Pelias being the enemy of Jason, Medea persuaded his daughters to cut him in pieces, that he might in similar manner restore him to youth; which was accordingly done, on which, having thus contrived his death, she refused her assistance. It is much more probable that the Cook should be intended to be represented as ignorant, than as attempting here to impose on the ignorance of Ballio. Warner, in his translation, however, thinks otherwise. He says, "The humour plainly lies in the Cook's promises to restore Ballio to his juvenility by a cookery--one that would kill him. Ballio's ignorance is, indeed, here meant to be exposed to ridicule by the Cook, that is by Plautus, as it likewise is in the names of the spices, which are probably fictitious."</note> whom she is said by a draught and by her potions from an aged man to have made young again; so will I make you likewise.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Well now; for how much would you teach me that one point in cooking?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> What point? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> That I may preserve you from pilfering anything from me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> For a didrachm, if you believe me; if not, not for a mina even. But whether are you about to-day to give a dinner, to your friends or to your enemies?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Why, faith, to my friends surely.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> But why don't you invite your enemies to it rather than your friends? For this day will I present to the guests a banquet so savoury, and I'll season it with such a dulcet sweetness, that whoever shall taste each thing that's seasoned, I'll make that same person to gnaw off the ends of his own fingers.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Troth now, prithee, before you shall present aught to the guests do you yourself first taste, and give some to your understrappers, that you may gnaw off the ends of your own pilfering hands.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A COOK.</speaker><p> Perhaps then you don't believe me in the things that I say.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Don't you be troublesome; you din me too much; you don't please me by it. See, there I live. <stage>Points to his house.</stage> Do you go in-doors and cook the dinner, with all speed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A BOY</speaker><p> Why don't you go, and take your place? Go and find the guests; the dinner's spoiling already. <stage>COOK and BOY go into the house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Now, just look, please, at that young offshoot; for he, too, is a good-for-nothing deputy-scullion for the cook. Truly I don't know what now first to be on my guard against; such thieves there are in my house, and there's a robber close at hand. For my neighbour here, the father of Calidorus, a short time since, in the market-place, asked me by all means to be on my guard against his servant Pseudolus, not to put any trust in him; for that he is on the hunt this day, if possible to dupe me out of the woman. He said that he had stoutly promised to him that he would get away Ph&oelig;nicium from me by stratagem. I'll now go indoors and give notice to my household, that no one must put any trust whatever in this Pseudolus. <stage>Goes into his house.</stage>

<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> May the Deities grant you as many blessings as you may wish for yourself. For if I were to wish for as many as you are deserving of, they would be less than nothing; <stage>aside</stage> nor have I ever seen any one more of a rogue than this fellow.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> <stage>overhearing him</stage>. Do you say that to me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> This man's an honest fellow.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> It is neither this person, then <stage>pointing to PSEUDOLUS</stage>, nor myself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> But take care that you don't be tripping.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Can't you hold your tongue? He that puts a man in mind of that which, remembering it, he does keep in mind, causes him to forget it. I recollect everything; they are stored up in my breast; my plans are cleverly laid.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> I'm silent. But what good turn shall I do you if you carry through this matter with management? So may the Gods love me----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> They won't do so; you'll be uttering sheer falsehoods then.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> How I do love you, Simmia, for your roguery, and both fear and laud you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> That I have learned to make a present of to others; you can't put your flatteries on me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> In how delightful a manner I shall receive you this day, when you have completed this matter.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Ha, ha, ha! <stage>Laughing.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> With nice viands, wine, perfumes, and titbits between our cups. There, too, shall be a charming damsel, who shall give you kiss upon kiss.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> You will be receiving me in a delightful manner.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Aye, and if you effect it, then I'll make you say so still more.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> If I don't effect it, do you, the executioner, take me off to torture. But make haste and point out to me where is the door of the procurer's house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUD. </speaker><p> 'Tis the third hence. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Hist! hush! the door's opening.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> In my mind, I believe that the house is poorly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Why so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Because, i' faith, it is vomiting forth the procurer. <stage>BALLIO is coming out of his house.</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Is this he? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> This is his own self.</p></sp>

<stage>Enter BALLIO from his house.</stage>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I do believe that this fellow is not so bad a cook as I thought he was; for he has clawed off nothing as yet except a cup and a tankard.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> <stage>apart to SIMMIA</stage>. Hallo you! now's your opportunity and your time.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> I agree with you. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> Step slily out into the street; I'll be here in ambush. <stage>SIMMIA steps forward, and then walks along the middle of the street to meet BALLIO.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> <stage>talking aloud to himself</stage>. I took the number carefully; this is the sixth lane from the city gate; down that lane he bade me turn; how many houses down he told me, that I don't quite know for certain.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> <stage>eyeing SIMMIA</stage>. Who's this fellow in the scarf, or whence does he come, or whom is he looking for? The appearance of the fellow seems outlandish and shabby.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> But see, here's a person, who, from uncertainty, will make the thing more certain for me that I wish to know.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> He's coming straight towards me. Where in the world am I to say this fellow comes from?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Harkye! you who are standing there with a goat's beard, answer me this that I ask you.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I know myself. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Few persons do that which you mention; for in the Forum there is hardly every tenth person that knows his own self.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> <stage>from behind</stage>. I'm all right; he is philosophizing now.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> I'm looking for a fellow here, a bad one, a law breaker, an impious, perjured, and dishonest rogue.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. He's looking for me, for those are my titles If he would only mention the name. <stage>To SIMMIA.</stage> What's the name of this person?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Ballio, the procurer. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Do I know him? I am the very person, young man, that you are looking for.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> What, are you Ballio? </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I think if you were to see me in the dark, you'd be keeping your hand off.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> My master bade me present you many greetings. Receive this letter from me; he bade me give you it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Who's the person that bade you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PSEUDOLUS</speaker><p> <stage>from behind</stage>. I'm undone, now the fellow's in the middle of the mud. He doesn't know the name--this business is at a dead lock.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Who do you say sent me this?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Observe the seal; do you yourself tell me his name, that I may know that you are Ballio himself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Give me the letter. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Take it, and look at the seal. <stage>Gives him the letter.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> <stage>looking at it</stage>. Oho!

<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> I know now that I have rightly given you the letter, since you have mentioned the name of Polymach&aelig;roplagides,</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> How fares he? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> By my troth, just as a brave man and a good soldier should. But make haste, I beg, to read this letter through, for it is requisite to do so, and to take this money at once and send out the damsel. For it's necessary for me this day to be at Sicyon<milestone n="995" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To be at Sicyon</lemma>:  This was a very ancient city of the Peloponnesus on the Gulf of Corinth.</note>, or else to suffer death to-morrow; so peremptory is my master.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Make haste then to read the letter through.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I'll do so, if you'll only hold your tongue. <stage>He reads the letter.</stage> "The Captain Polymach&aelig;roplagides sends this letter, written to the procurer Ballio, sealed with the impression which was formerly agreed upon between us two."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> The token's in the letter</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I see the token and I recognize it. But is he in the habit of sending no greeting written in his letter?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Such is the military etiquette, Ballio; with their hand they send health to their well-wishers, and with the same do they send destruction to their evil-wishers. But as you have commenced, go on to ascertain of yourself what this letter says.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Listen then. <stage>Reading on.</stage> "Harpax is my camp-servant, who has come to you." Are you this Harpax?</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> What then? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Pay me the money, take away the woman.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Which of us is delaying the matter?</p></sp>

Should he prove mischievous towards me * * * * But, i' faith, for my part I hope not, for I wish well to him. Now in three ways am I in the greatest dread. First of all then, I dread this comrade of mine, lest he should forsake me and go over from me to the enemy. Next do I dread that my master should in the meantime return from the Forum; lest, the booty taken, the plunderers should be taken. Together with these things do I fear, lest that other Harpax should arrive here before this Harpax has departed hence with the woman.

<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> I' faith, he told no lie.</p></sp>

<stage>Enter HARPAX.</stage>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. That slave's a base and worthless fellow, who values his master's commands at nought; and he, too, is good for nothing who is forgetful to do his duty unless he's put in mind. But those who forthwith deem themselves to be at liberty, when they have hidden themselves from the sight of their master, who riot, wench, devour what they have,--aye, what they have not,--long do those same endure the name of servitude. Nor is there any good disposition in them, except only that they may uphold themselves by their dishonest contrivances. With these, neither their company nor their conversation suits me, nor by these persons have I been ever known. Although he is away, I consider my master as being here; I fear him when he isn't here, that I may not have to fear him when he is here. Therefore, as I have been ordered, to this business will I give my attention. But that Syrus, to whom I gave the token, would have been letting me stay even yet in the shop. As he bade me, I stayed there; he said that he would send for me when the procurer was at home. But since he hasn't come, or called me while staying there, I'm come hither of my own accord, that I may know what is the fact, that that fellow mayn't be playing tricks with me. And there is nothing better than that I should knock at this door, and call some out here from indoors. I want this procurer to take this money of me, and to send off this woman with me. <stage>Goes towards BALLIO'S door.</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> About as much as the most ignorant do.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Your servant, Pseudolus, has sent this fellow on the message, as though he was from the Macedonian Captain.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Have you got the money from the fellow?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Do you ask about that which you see? <stage>Shows the purse in his hand.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Harkye, remember to give me one half of that plunder. It's right that that should be in common.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Why, plague on't, 'tis all your own<milestone n="1165" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Your own</lemma>:  Meaning that, no doubt, Pseudolus had stolen it from him.</note>.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I'll attend to you, indeed. <stage>Aside.</stage> What now do you advise me to do, Simo?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. Let's make some fun of this counterfeit spy, even until he himself shall be sensible that he is being made a fool of.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Follow me. <stage>To HARPAX.</stage> What have you to say? You are his servant, I suppose?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> Most certainly. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> At what price did he purchase you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> With the victory of his prowess in battle; for I was a very great general at home in my own country.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Why, did he ever capture a gaol in your country?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> If you utter affronting speeches, you'll be hearing them.

<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> In what time did you come from Sicyon hither?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> In one day, by noon. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Bravo! By my troth, you did come quickly; how very swift of foot this man is.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> When you look at his calves, you might know that he can wear heavy fetters. How say you--were you also, when a child, in the habit of sleeping in a cradle?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Of course. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> And were you, too, in the habit of doing<milestone n="1178" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The habit of doing</lemma>:  An indecent allusion is most probably here intended. An attempt has been made in the translation to turn it into another channel.</note>--you know what I mean?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Of course he was in the habit of doing as other children did?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> Are you men in your senses? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> What, because I asked you that? At night, when the Captain was going on guard, and when you were going with him, did the sword of the officer fit your scabbard?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> Go to utter perdition. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> You, indeed, shall have the opportunity of going there in good time to-day.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p>But do you bring out the woman to me, or else give me back the money.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Wait a bit. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> Why should I wait?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> That scarf, tell me for how much it has been lent.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> What matters it? </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> These fellows surely stand in need of hellebore<milestone n="1184" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Have need of hellebore</lemma>:  Black hellebore was much esteemed in eases of madness.

<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> What do the shoes? * * * * * * *</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> What are you dreaming about? Why, I'm the owner of all these things, bought with my own savings.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Those, you mean, which the upper part of your thighs supports<milestone n="1189" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Your thighs supports</lemma>:  Unless a more gross allusion is intended, he means that his "peculium" is not his "savings" (which is the strict meaning of the word), but his back and flanks, which often receive on them the punishment of servitude, ana which alone he can call his own.</note>.

These old fellows have been anointed; they want themselves rubbed down<milestone n="1190" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Themselves rubbed down</lemma>:  After bathing, the Greeks and Romans were in the habit of being anointed, and then rubbed down with a flesh-brush. Probably the latter custom had gone out of fashion in the time of Plautus. Harpax says that the old men want to be rubbed down; but he means, as uncle Bowling expresses it in Roderick Random, "with an oaken towel."</note>, after the old-fashioned custom.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> I' faith, prithee, answer me this truly and seriously, which I ask of you: What are you to earn? For how trifling a sum has Pseudolus hired you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> Who is this Pseudolus? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BAR.</speaker><p> Your tutor, who has instructed you in this knavery, to take away the woman hence from me by stratagem.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> What Pseudolus, and what stratagem are you talking to me about? A person that I know of no colour, black or white.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Will you not be off from here? There's no profit here for swindlers to-day. Therefore you may tell Pseudolus that another person has carried off the prize-the first Harpax that came.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> On my word, I really am that Harpax.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Aye, on my word, you want to be. This is nothing more nor less than a downright impostor.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> I have given yourself the money, and a while ago, immediately on my arrival, the token to your servant; a letter sealed with the likeness of my master, here before the door.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> You gave a letter to my servant? What servant?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> To Syrus. </p></sp>

The wicked rogue has assurance enough<milestone n="1204" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Has assurance enough</lemma>:  The note of interrogation, in Ritschel's edition, after "nequam," seems to be out of place.</note>. He hasn't contrived his knavish scheme amiss.

<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> My name is Harpax; I am the servant of the Macedonian Captain. I'm doing nothing roguishly or cheatingly, nor do I know or understand this Pseudolus, what mortal being he is.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> Unless it's something wonderful, procurer, you've clearly lost the woman.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> Assuredly, by my troth, I'm in dread of that more and more, when I come to hear his words. I' faith, that Syrus, too, has already set my heart a-freezing, that received the token from him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> 'Tis a wonder if it isn't Pseudolus. <stage>To HARPAX.</stage> How now, you! of what appearance was the person to whom you delivered the token?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> A certain red-haired fellow<milestone n="1218" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Red-haired fellow</lemma>:  Some Commentators fancy that in these lines Plautus intends to give a description of himself. If so, he certainly was not so handsome as he was ingenious.</note>, pot-bellied, with thick calves, swarthy, with a big head, sharp eyes, red face, and very large feet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> You prove our undoing, when you mention the feet. It was Pseudolus himself. It's all up with me. I'm dying now, Simo.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>HARPAX</speaker><p> By my troth, I shan't let you die, unless the money's returned me-twenty min&aelig;.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> <stage>to SIMO</stage>. And is the sum to be taken of me that I promised by way of a joke?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> From unprincipled men it's proper for both their money and their plunder to be taken.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> At least you might give up Pseudolus to me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> I, give up Pseudolus to you? What has he done amiss? Did I not tell you a hundred times that you were to beware of him?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> He has ruined me. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SIMO</speaker><p> And on me he has laid a fine of twenty fair min&aelig;.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>BALLIO</speaker><p> What am I to do then? </p></sp>

But, by my faith, if I do fall down, yours will be the fault. Are you going to go? Heigho! I must wait upon myself. This is the great fault in wine; it first lays hold of the feet; 'tis a cunning wrestler. By my faith, assuredly am I now come off right well drenched; with such exquisite viands, with such becoming elegance, in such a delightful place, have we been delightfully entertained. What's the need for me to make much prosing? This is the thing for a man, an object for him to pass his life for; here are all pleasures and all delights. I think that the ecstasy is equal to that of the Deities, when the lover embraces his mistress, when he places lip to lip, when melting kisses are exchanged, when breast is pressed to breast, or else, if they please, they are locked in strict embrace; then for your most loving mistress, with her white hand, to be pledging you in the luscious goblet, for no one there to be disagreable to another, for no one to be indulging in silly conversation; for unguents and perfumes, ribbons<milestone n="1265" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Ribbons</lemma>:  "Lemniscos." According to Festus, "lemnisci" were purple ribbons wrapped round one another, and hanging down from the wreaths which the ancients wore on their heads at their entertainments. From a passage in Pliny it would appear that these ribbons were in general only worn by persons of distinction. The translation of l. 1260 has necessarily been somewhat modified.</note> and festive wreaths, to be provided in profusion; and for the rest of the entertainment, too, to be provided in no niggardly style. That no one may have to question me then, in this manner have myself and my young master been spending this day in jollity. After I had fulfilled all my task just as I intended, the enemy put to flight, I was leaving them reclining and drinking, each lover with his mistress, and my own mistress there as well, indulging heart and soul. But after I had risen, they begged me to dance. After this fashion <stage>he dances</stage> did I show myself off there quite charmingly, in a master-like style, to wit; for I am thoroughly acquainted with the Ionian step. Thus, clad in my little mantle, full of fun, I was stepping about, this way. Some of them clapped me, others cried out for me to dance again. In that same Ionian fashion once again did I begin to take a turn; I presented myself to my mistress, that she might caress me; as I was pirouetting, down I tumbled: that was the funeral dirge<milestone n="1278" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The funeral dirge</lemma>:  The word "N&aelig;nia," or "nenia," has severai meanings, among others, that of "a funeral dirge," which is probably its meaning here.

And so, while I was a-struggling to get up, near----, almost, I mean, I soiled my mantle. Then, by my troth, I was the cause of plenteous mirth. A goblet was presented me on account of my fall. Forthwith I changed my mantle, and put on this; thence have I come hither, that I might get rid of my surfeit. Now I'm going to my old master, to put him in mind of our bargain. Open-open the door.
