<head>THE SUBJECT.</head>

<p>THE plot of this Play (which is supposed by some Commentators not to have been written by Plautus) is extremely meagre. Antipho, a wealthy and jovial old gentleman of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, has two daughters, Philumena and Pamphila. They are married to two brothers, Epignomus and Pamphilus, who, having run through their property in the company of idlers and Parasites, have, with the view of retrieving their fortunes, taken to merchandize. Having been absent three years from home, and no tidings being heard of them whether they are alive or not Antipho assumes the prerogative of a father, and requests his daughters to marry again; who resolve, however, to maintain their fidelity to their absent husbands. Philumena sends the Parasite, Gelasimus, to the harbour to see if any ships have arrived. In the meantime, the boy, Pinacium, brings her word that her husband has. returned to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. He and his brother meet the Parasite, and resist all his attempts to fasten himself upon them; they then go home, and become reconciled to Antipho, from whom, in their poverty, they had become estranged; and who now requests them to make him a present of a female slave. Stichus, the servant, obtains a day's holiday, together with a present from his master of a cask of wine. He makes an entertainment for himself, his friend Sagarinus, and their mistress Stephanium. The Play concludes with a dance, to the music of the Piper.

<stage>Enter PHILUMENA and PAMPHILA.<note anchored="yes">Title <lemma targOrder="U">Stichus</lemma>:  Plautus has named this Play "Stichus," from the servant, who is one of the characters in it, though not the principal one as Gelasimus, the Parasite, certainly occupies that place.</note></stage>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> Sister, I think that Penelope was wretched from her very soul, who was so long deprived of her husband; for from our own fortunes, whose husbands are absent from us, we judge of her feelings; for whose affairs, still, in their absence, both night and day, sister, as is becoming, we are ever anxious.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> 'Tis right that we should do our duty; and we do not that any further than affection bids us.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> But, sister, step this way a moment; I want to speak about the affairs of my husband.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> Ain't they prospering, pray?</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> I hope and wish so, indeed. But, sister, at this am I vexed, that your and my father, one who is esteemed as especially honorable among all his fellow-citizens, should be now acting the part of a dishonorable man; who is undeservedly doing so great an injustice to our absent husbands, and is wishing to separate us from them. These things, sister, render me tired of existence; these things are a care and a vexation to me. <stage>She sheds tears.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> Weep not, sister, nor do that to your feelings which your father is threatening to do. 'Tis to be hoped<milestone n="22" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">'Tis to be hoped</lemma>:  "Spes est." Literally, "there is a hope."</note> that he will act more righteously. I know him well; he says these things in jest; and he would not earn for himself the mountains of the Persians, which are said to be of gold<milestone n="25" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Said to be of gold</lemma>:  No doubt, as the Persians were from an early period noted for their wealth and grandeur, it was a common notion with the people of <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> that they had "mountains of gold."</note>, to do that of which you are in dread. Still, if he does do it, it befits you by no means to be angry; nor will it happen without some reason. For this is the third year since our husbands have been away from home.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> 'Tis as you say; while, in the meantime, they may be living, and may be well<milestone n="31" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">May be well</lemma>:  After "valeant" in this line, a comma, and not colon, seems more reconcileable to the meaning of the passage.</note>, they do not make us acquainted where they are, what they are doing, whether they are doing well, neither do they return.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> And do you, sister, regret this, that they do not observe their duty, whereas you do yours?</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> Troth, I do. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> Hold your peace, if you please; take care, please, that I hear not that same thing from you in future.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> And why, pray? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> Because, i' faith, in my opinion, 'tis proper for all prudent people to observe and to do their duty. For that reason, sister, although you are the older, I advise you to remember your duty; and if they are unjust and act otherwise to us than is right, then, i' faith, in exactly the same degree, that there may be no further mischief, it befits us studiously to remember our duty by all means in our power.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> 'Tis good; I'm silenced. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> But do take care and remember it.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> I do not wish, sister, to be thought to be unmindful of my husband; nor has he thrown away the distinction that he conferred upon me. For, by my troth, his kindness is pleasing and delightful to me; and, really, this choice of mine is not now irksome to me, nor is there any reason why I should wish to abandon this match. But, in fine, 'tis placed in our father's power<milestone n="53" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">In our father's power</lemma>:  By the law of the Twelve Tables at <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName>, females were never "sui juris," but under a perpetual guardianship; and even marriage did not entirely exempt them from parental authority, unless they had been emancipated from it before. Among the Greeks also, parents exercised great authority in disposing of their daughters in marriage.</note>; that must be done by us which our relatives enjoin.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> I know it, and in thinking of it I am overwhelmed with grief; for already has he almost disclosed his sentiments.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> Let us consider, then, what is necessary for us to do.</p></sp></div1>

<milestone unit="scene" n="2"/>
<div1 type="card" n="58">
<stage>Enter ANTIPHO from his house, speaking at the door to his SERVANTS.</stage>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> The man in condition of a servant who always waits to be told his duty, and doesn't remember to do it of his own accord, that servant, I say, is not of a deserving character. You remember well on each returning Calends to ask for your allotment of provisions<milestone n="60" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Allotment of provisions</lemma>:  The Greeks, it must be borne in mind, had no Calends (whence the proverb "ad Gr&aelig;cas Calendas," "to-morrow come never"); the Poet is here alluding to the Roman custom of distributing to the slaves their allowance of food on the Calends, or first day of every month.</note>; why, then, do you less remember to do what is necessary to do about the house? Now, therefore, if, when I return, the furniture shall not be set for me, each piece in its proper place, I'll be putting you in mind with a bull's hide remembrancer<milestone n="63" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Bull's hide remembrancer</lemma>:  "Monumentis bubulis." Literally, "with memorials of oxen." The thongs of the "scutica" and of the "flagellum" were generally made of bull's hide.</note>. Not human beings seem to be living with me, but pigs. Take care, if you please, that my house is clean, when I return home. I shall soon be back home; I'm going to her house, to see my eldest daughter. If any one should enquire for me, call me thence, some of you; or----I shall be here soon myself.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. What are we to do, sister, if our father shall resolve against us?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> It befits us to submit to what he does whose power is the stronger. By entreating, not by opposing, I think we must use our endeavours. If with mildness we ask for favour, I trust to obtain it of him. Oppose him we cannot, without disgrace and extreme criminality; I will neither do that myself, nor will I give you the advice to do it, but rather that we should entreat him. I know our family<milestone n="74" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">I know our family</lemma>:  "Nostros." Literally, "ours," meaning "our people," "our family."</note>; he will yield to entreaty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>speaking to himself</stage>. In the first place, in what manner I should make a beginning with them, about that I am in doubt; whether I should accost them in language couched in ambiguous terms, after this fashion, as though I had never pretended<milestone n="77" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">As though I had never pretended</lemma>:  Despite the ingenuity of Ritschel, this line seems to be in a corrupt state.</note> anything at all against them, or whether as though I had heard that they were deserving of some censure against them; whether I should rather try them gently or with threats. I know that there will be opposition; I know my daughters right well. If they should prefer to remain here rather than to marry afresh, why, let them do so. What need is there for me, the term of my life run out, to be waging war with my children, when I think that they don't at all deserve that I should do so? By no means; I'll have no disturbances. But I think that this is the best thing to be done by me; I'll do thus; I'll pretend as though they had themselves been guilty of some fault; I'll terribly terrify their minds this day by some ambiguous expressions; ana then, after that, as I shall feel disposed, I'll disclose myself. I know that many words will be spoken; I'll go in. <stage>Goes to the door of PHILUMENA'S house.</stage> But the door's open.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> Why, surely the sound of my father's voice reached my ears.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> I' troth, 'tis he; let's hasten to meet him with a kiss. <stage>They both run to kiss him.</stage></p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> My father, my respects.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> And to you the same. Away this instant, and be off from me, <stage>Removes her.</stage></p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> One kiss. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> I've had enough of your kissing.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> Prithee, father, why so?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Because, as it is, the seasoning of your affection has reached my soul<milestone n="92" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Has reached my soul</lemma>:  "Me&aelig; anim&aelig; salsura evenit." Literally, "the salting has come forth to my soul." This phrase is rendered in Leverett's Lexicon, "I am dejected" or "I am in an ill humour." That, however, does not appear to be the meaning. The father has had kissing enough from his daughters, but he intends, as it would seem, to compliment them by comparing their kisses to salt, with its refreshing and vivifying powers; and when Philumena asks for one kiss more, he says, "No, as it is (ita) their refreshing power has reached my soul." <placeName key="tgn,1010231">Rost</placeName> seems to be of this opinion, but he suggests that "anim&aelig; me&aelig;" are vocatives plural; in that case the passage would mean, "as it is, my loves," or "my delights, the refreshing salt of your affection has reached me."</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> Sit down here, father. <stage>Points to a chair.</stage></p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> I'll not sit there; do you sit down; I'll sit on the bench<milestone n="93" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">On the bench</lemma>:  "Subsellium" generally means "a footstool," used by persons when sitting on a high seat. Here, however, it probably signifies "a bench," perhaps placed against the wall in the front of Philumena's house, where he was about to make a call.</note>. <stage>Sits on a bench.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> Wait till I fetch a cushion.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> You take kind care of me; I'm nicely seated now as I am<milestone n="94" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Nicely seated now as I am</lemma>:  "Sat sic fultum est." Literally "enough is it thus supported." She has brought out the cushion, and has placed it upon or at the back of the hard bench, which was perhaps something like our garden chair.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> Do let me, father. <stage>Goes into the house.</stage> </p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p>What need is there?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> There is need. <stage>Coming out, and bringing a cushion.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> I'll submit to you. <stage>Arranging the cushion.</stage> Yes, this does very well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> Why, daughters can never take too much care of their parent. Whom is it proper that we should esteem more dear than yourself? And then, in the next place, father, our husbands, for whom you have chosen that we should be the mothers of families.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> You do as it is proper for good wives to do, in esteeming your husbands, though absent, just as though they were present.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> 'Tis propriety, father, for us to highly honor those who have chosen us as companions for themselves.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Is there any other person here to listen with his ears<milestone n="102" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To listen with his ears</lemma>:  "Nostris dictis auceps auribus" Literacy "a fowler for our words;" in allusion to the stealthy manner in which the fowler lies in wait for his prey.</note> to our conversation?
</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> There's no one except us and yourself.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> I wish your attention to be given; for, unacquainted with female matters and ways, I come now as a pupil to you, my instructresses; in order that each of you may tell me what endowments matrons ought to have, who are the best esteemed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> What's the reason that you come hither to enquire about the ways of females?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Troth, I'm looking for a wife, as your mother's dead and gone.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> You'll easily find, father, one both worse and of worse morals than she was; one better you'll neither find nor does the sun behold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> But I'm making the enquiry of you, and of this sister of yours.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> I' faith, father, I know how they should be, if they are to be such as I think right.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> I wish, then, to know what you do think right.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> That when they walk through the city, they should shut the mouths of all, so that none can speak ill of them with good reason.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>to PHILUMENA</stage>. And now speak you in your turn.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> What do you wish that I should speak to you about, father?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> How is the woman most easily distinguished, who is of a good disposition?</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> When she, who has the power of doing ill, refrains from doing so.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Not bad that. <stage>To PAMPHILA.</stage> Come, say you, which choice is the preferable, to marry a maiden or a widow?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> So far as my skill extends, of many evils<milestone n="120" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Of many evils</lemma>:  Pamphila is embarrassed here; and as she probably does not wish her father to marry either widow or maiden, but still does not like to tell him so, she takes refuge in a truism, rather than give a direct answer to his question. Aristotle tells us that Epicharmus was much in the habit of giving utterance to remarks of this nature.</note>, that which is the least evil, the same is the least an evil. He that can avoid the women, let him avoid them, so that each day he takes care, the day before, not to do that which, the day after, he may regret.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> What sort of woman, pray, seems to you by far the wisest?</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> She who, when affairs are prosperous, shall still be able to know herself, and who with equanimity can endure it to be worse with her than it has been.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> By my troth, in merry mood have I been trying the bent of your dispositions. But 'tis this for which I am come to you, and for which I wished to meet you both. My friends are advising me to the effect that I should remove you hence to my own house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> But still, we, whose interests are concerned, are advising you quite otherwise. For either, father, we ought not formerly to have been bestowed in marriage, unless our husbands pleased you, or, it is not right for us now to be taken away when they are absent.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> And shall I suffer you while I am alive to remain married to men who are beggars?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> This beggar of mine is agreable to me; her own king is agreable<milestone n="133" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Her own king is agreable</lemma>:  She speaks here of the husband in the character of the "rex," or "king," in his own establishment, which to him is his kingdom. Of course, then, the wife would be the "regina," or "queen."</note> to the queen. In poverty have I the same feelings that once I had in riches.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> And do you set such high value on thieves and beggars?</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> You did not, as I think, give me in marriage to the money, but to the man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Why are you still in expectation of those who have been absent for now three years? Why don't you accept an eligible match<milestone n="138" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Eligible match</lemma>:  "Conditio," in the sense of "offer" or "proposal," especially applies to one of marriage. As their husbands had spent almost all their substance, the ladies are probably living on the fortune which he has given them, and he anticipates that it may be soon exhausted.</note> in place of a very bad one?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILA</speaker><p> 'Tis folly, father, to lead unwilling dogs to hunt. That wife is an enemy, who is given to a man in marriage against her will.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Are you then determined that neither of you will obey the command of your father?</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> We do obey; for where you gave us in marriage, thence are we unwilling to depart.

<stage>Enter GELASIMUS.</stage>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> I do suspect that Famine was my mother; for since I was born I have never been filled with victuals. And no man could better return the favour to his mother, than do I right unwillingly return it to my mother, Famine. For in her womb, for ten months she bore me, whereas I have been carrying her for more than ten years in my stomach. She, too, carried me but a little child, wherefore I judge that she endured the less labour; in my stomach no little Famine do I bear, but of full growth, i' faith, and extremely heavy. The labour-pains arise with me each day, but I'm unable to bring forth my mother, nor know I what to do. I've often heard it so said that the elephant is wont<milestone n="168" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The elephant is wont</lemma>:  Pliny the Elder informs us that this was the vulgar notion with regard to the elephant. He also says that Aristotle tells us that two years is the duration of its pregnancy.</note> to be pregnant ten whole years; for sure this hunger of mine is of its breed. For now for many a year has it been clinging to, my inside. Now, if any person wants a droll fellow, I am on sale, with all my equipage: of a filling-up for these chasms am I in search. When little, my father gave me the name of Gelasimus<milestone n="174" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Name of Gelasimus</lemma>:  "Gelasimus" signifies "comical," "laughable," "funny," from the Greek verb <foreign lang="greek">gela/w,</foreign> "to laugh."</note>, because, even from a tiny child, I was a droll chap. By reason of poverty, in fact, did I acquire this name, because, it was poverty that made me to be a droll; for whenever she reaches a person, she instructs him thoroughly in every art. My father used to say that I was born when provisions were dear; for that reason, I do believe, I am now the more sharply set. But on our family such complacence has been bestowed--I am in the habit of refusing no person, if any one asks me out to eat. One form of expression has most unfortunately died away with people, and one, i' faith, most beseeming and most elegant to my thinking, which formerly they employed: "Come here to dinner--do so--really, do promise--don't make any difficulties--is it convenient?--I wish it to be so, I say; I'll not part with you unless you come." But now, in the present day, they have found a substitute for these expressions--a saying, by my faith, truly right worthless and most vile: "I'd invite you to dinner, were I not dining; out myself." I' faith, I wish the very loins of that phrase broken, that it mayn't repeat its perjury if he does dine at his own house. These phrases reduce me to learn foreign habits<milestone n="193" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Foreign habits</lemma>:  By "barbaros mores," he probably alludes to the Roman custom. of selling by auction, which was one of the duties of the "pr&aelig;co," or "herald," here rendered "auctioneer."

<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> Now there are a good many curious mischief-makers here, who, with extreme zeal, busy themselves with the affairs of other people, and who have themselves no affairs of their own to busy themselves with. They, when they know that any one is about to have an auction, go forthwith and sift out what's the reason; whether a debt compels it, or whether he has purchased a farm; or whether, on a divorce, her marriage-portion is to be repaid to his wife<milestone n="204" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To be repaid to his wife</lemma>:  If the divorce took place by mutual consent, then the "dos," or "marriage-portion," of the wife was returned. Such a circumstance occurring on a sudden, might very easily cause a necessity for recourse to the services of the auctioneer.</note>. All these, although, i' faith, I don't judge them undeserving, in their most wretched state, to go toiling on, I don't care about. I'll proclaim the reason of my auction, that they may rejoice in my mishaps, for there's no person a busybody but what he's ill-natured too. Very great mishaps, alas! have befallen wretched me.

Literally, "parasitical little perjuries." This is probably meant in reference to the adjurations so common among the ancients on the most trivial occasions, and of which the Parasite promises to be lavish in speaking in praise of his entertainer. The diminutive "uncula" suits the measure, and also shows the air of self- satisfaction with which he mentions that which he takes to be of the same harmless nature which some easy casuists among ourselves attribute to what they choose to call white lies. Indeed, the ancients esteemed perjury very much according to the subject on which it was employed. Ovid mentions Mercury as laughing at the perjuries of cheating tradesmen, and <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> as smiling at those of lovers; surely, then, "a little bit of a perjury" (the true meaning of "perjeratiuncula") could not be amiss on an occasion so trivial, and yet, to the Parasite, so all-important, as the acquisition of a good dinner.</note>. I'm selling a rusty flesh-scraper<milestone n="228" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A rusty flesh-scraper</lemma>:  The "strigil" was an instrument used by the Greeks and Romans in the place of the flesh-brush of modern times. It was made of bone, iron, copper, and sometimes of silver. It was used after taking the "sudatorium," or sweating-bath, for the purpose of scraping the perspiration from the body. These instruments were of curved form, and in shape somewhat resembled our tongue-scrapers on a large scale. Rich persons took slaves with them to the baths for the purpose of scraping them. From Hesychius, Athen&aelig;us, and Theophrastus, we learn that Parasites were much in the habit of spunging for entertainers at the public baths; and, no doubt, they generally had ready, for an emergency, both a "strigil" and a bottle of perfumed ointment, as a handy medium of introduction to strangers.</note>, too; a rusty-coloured brown bottle<milestone n="228" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A rusty-coloured brown bottle</lemma>:  The "ampulla," or "bottle," was probably a "lorea," or leather one, and had turned of a rusty-brown colour from age.</note> for the Greek unguents<milestone n="229" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Greek unguents</lemma>:  By mentioning "Greek unguents," Plautus here recollects that he is addressing a Latin audience.

Cicero styles it "assa," because it produced perspiration by means of a dry hot atmosphere. After it had been used, and the "strigil" applied to the skin, the bather was dried with towels, and then anointed, when the "unctiones Gr&aelig;c&aelig;" of the Parasite would be in demand. These were used either to close the pores of the skin and to prevent the person from catching cold, or to keep the skin from being rough when dried with the towel.

Now, however, he will put it up to sale by auction, and in future, before he says "dabo," "I'll give you my tongue" or, in other words, "my company" he will say, "cedo," "give me," or "tell me what is your offer" or "bidding.</note> I've sold as well."</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> With such rapid speed have I been hastening from the harbour, for the sake of your own well-doing.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> Why, do you bring any good news?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> I bring more, by very much, than you expect.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> I'm saved, then. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> And I'm done for; lassitude is drinking up my marrow apace.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> What, then, am I, the marrow of whose stomach, to my sorrow, famine has seized upon?</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> Did you meet any one? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> Many.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> But any man? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> Very many; but, of the many, not one a greater rascal than he is. <stage>Points at GELASIMUS.</stage></p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> How so? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> I have been affronted already at his saying uncivil things to me. If you irritate me any further---- <stage>Holds up his fist to PINACIUM.</stage></p></sp>

<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> I'll cause you to know that assuredly you've said that with reason.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> Come, do you quickly sweep the ground, and sprinkle before he t house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> I'll do so. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> It needs be done. I'll knock down the spider-webs there from the door and from the wall.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> I' faith, a troublesome business, this.</p></sp>

 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> By my troth, as I imagine, you haven't quite minded the directions of your mistress.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> Why, I've left all matters unattended to by reason of what you wished.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> Then do you inform me upon that, on account of which you were sent to the harbour?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> I'll tell you. After, with the daybreak, you had sent me to the harbour, the sun with its beams opportunely arose from out of the sea. While I was enquiring of the revenue officers whether any ship had arrived from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and they were saying none had come, I beheld, in the meantime, a bark, than which I think I never saw a greater one. With a favouring breeze, and in full sail, it came into harbour. We were enquiring one of another whose ship it was, and what it carried? In the meantime I espied your husband and his servant Stichus.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> Ha! what? Did you mention Epignomus?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> Your husband and my own life.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> He has arrived, I say. </p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> Did you see him yourself?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> Yes, and with pleasure too. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> I' faith, I'll surely take the broom, and sweep this place with pleasure.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> He has brought a great amount of silver and gold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> 'Tis right cleverly done. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> Wool and purple in plenty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> Aye, for me to clothe my carcase with.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> Couches, adorned with ivory and gold.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> I'll recline at table right regally.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> Besides--Babylonian coverings for couches<milestone n="378" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Coverings for couches</lemma>:  "Peristromatia," "blankets" or "counterpanes" were used among the Romans to cover couches; they were sometimes of the most costly description, and were mostly of purple colour, and frequently richly embroidered with gold. Pliny speaks of Babylonian cloths of divers colours, and in the seventh chapter of Joshua, ver. 24, we read, "When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment."</note>, and carpets dyed in purple, has he brought.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> Abundance of fine things. I' faith, his business has been successful.</p></sp>

It is supposed to have been a kind of triangular harp. The word "sambucas" is substituted in Ritschel's edition for "sambucinas," in the former editions It is probably intended here to have the same meaning--"female players on the sambuca,'" who were also called "sambucistri&aelig;," and whose performances were highly prized by the Romans as Asiatic luxuries.</note>, has he brought with him, of surprising beauty.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> Besides many unguents of numerous kinds.

Let the mischievous hunters of auctions go to perdition. Hercules, I congratulate thee that the tenths which I vowed to thee are increased. 'Tis my hope that at length, by some means or other, I may expel this plaguy famine from my stomach.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> And then, besides, he has brought some Parasites<milestone n="388" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Brought some Parasites</lemma>:  The arch boy only adds this to put Gelasimus in a fright, in which he fully succeeds. There was no necessity to import Parasites from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> with him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> Alas! to my confusion, I'm undone.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> Right funny fellows. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> I' faith, I'll sweep this dust back, which I just now swept together. <stage>Sweeps it back</stage>. Those bon mots are now on sale, which I was saying I wouldn't sell. I'm done for: now there is occasion for spiteful persons to rejoice at my misfortune. Hercules, thou who art a God, thou really hast departed not oppoitunely.</p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> Did you see Pamphilus, the husband of my sister?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> No. </p></sp>
 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> Isn't he there?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PINACIUM</speaker><p> Yes, they said that he had come as well. I ran hither before them, with all speed, that I might bring the welcome tidings.</p></sp>

 <sp><speaker>PHILUMENA</speaker><p> I have servants enough in the house. <stage>PHILUMENA and PINACIUM go into the house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. In good sooth, Gelasimus, I doubt you have come to but little purpose, if neither he that is here gives you any aid, nor yet he that's coming. I'll off indoors to my books<milestone n="400" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">To my books</lemma>:  These were probably pamphlets, filled with jokes and funny stories, which Parasites would study for the entertainment of the patrons whom they were to amuse by way of return for their dinner.

Indeed, the latter, in all their amplitude, would have been invaluable to a Parasite, as they contain directions how to court a lady, ask a riddle, sing a funny song, put a posy on a ring, direct a letter, and a hundred other things.</note>, and take my instructions from the cleverest sayings; for if I don't drive away those fellows, the Parasites that are coming, most surely I'm undone.  <stage>(Exit.)</stage>

Those whom formerly I affected with sorrow at my departure, the same shall I now make joyous at my arrival. But already have I met my connexion Antipho, and from bad terms have I returned to friendship with him. See, prithee, what money can effect. Since, my affairs prospering, he sees that I've returned, and brought home great wealth, without any mediators, there on board the ship, upon the deck, we have returned to friendship and good feeling.

Troth now, I'll pass through the garden to my mistress, to engage her beforehand for me this evening; at the same time I'll give my contribution, and bid the dinner to be cooked at Sagarinus's, or else I'll go myself and make my marketing as caterer.

This passage is very obscure, and has puzzled the Commentators, who have generally taken refuge in a various reading, "Eum strenue obc&aelig;navit," which seems to make but very poor sense. The research, however, of the indefatigable Ritschel has set that mode of escape entirely at rest. "Strena" was the name of a New Year's gift, which was given and received on the Calenus of January, that the year might be commenced under good auspices. Probably from that circumstance, it became synonymous with a good or "auspicious omen." "Obsc&aelig;vo" is rendered in the Dictionaries, "to give a bad omen" Such, however, is not necessarily its meaning, in all instances. "Sc&aelig;va" is an "omen" or "augury," whether fortunate or not. Consequently, "obsc&aelig;vo" may very reasonably mean, "to fall in one's way as an omen;" if so, the expression, as here used, will mean "a lucky omen fell in my way."</note>.

Epignomus mentions that number here, by way of assuring Gelasimus that there is really no room for him. On this, the Parasite says that he is "imi subsellii vir," "a man for the lowest stool" or "bench," which he can very well manage with.

<stage>Enter ANTIPHO and PAMPHILUS.</stage>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> So may the Gods favour me, and preserve for me my daughters, it is a pleasure to me, Pamphilus, that I see you both return home to your native land, your business prosperously managed, yourself and your brother.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> I should have heard enough from you, Antipho, did I not see that you are friendly to me; now, since I've found that you are my friend, I'll give you credence.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> I would invite you to my house to dinner, had not your brother told me that you were going to dine at his house to-day, when he invited myself to his house to dinner. And it would have been more proper for me to give you an entertainment on your arrival, than to engage myself to him, were it not that I didn't wish to disoblige him. Now I don't wish with words alone to insinuate myself into your favour; to-morrow you shall be at my house, both you and he, with your wives.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Then, the day after, at my house; for it was yesterday he invited me for to-day. But am I quite reconciled to you, Antipho?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Since you have thus thrived in your affairs, as it behoves yourselves and persons friendly disposed to wish, let there be good-will and intercourse between us. Take you care to think of this; according as wealth is obtained by each man, so does he experience his friends. If his fortunes are flourishing, so are his friends true; if his prospects decline, so, too, do his friends decline. Fortune finds friends.
<stage>from his house.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIGNOMUS </speaker><p> <stage>to himself</stage>. I'm now returned. 'Tis a great delight, if you have been long from home, when you return home again, if no anxieties come in contact with your feelings. But, in my absence, so well has my wife taken care of my private affairs, that she has made me free and unembarrassed by anxieties. But, see, here's my brother Pamphilus, walking with his father-in-law.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> How fares it, Epignomus? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIGNOMUS </speaker><p> How with you? How long since you came into harbour?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Not very long ago. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIGNOMUS </speaker><p> <stage>aside</stage>. And is it since then that he has become on smooth terms with you?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>overhearing</stage>. More smooth than the sea, on which you have both been borne.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIGNOMUS </speaker><p> You do as you are wont to do other things. Do we unlade the ship to-day, brother?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> I would rather go quietly to work. Let's rather lade ourselves with delights in their turn. How soon will the dinner be cooked? I haven't breakfasted to-day.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIGNOMUS </speaker><p> Go in-doors to my house and bathe.</p></sp>

If I do that as I wish, I'll forthwith return to your house.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIGNOMUS </speaker><p> But your wife is hastening to come here with her sister.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> 'Tis very good; there will then be the less delay on that account. I shall be at your house<milestone n="537" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">I shall be at your house</lemma>:  These words are given, in Ritschel's edition, to Epignomus. but clearly erroneously, as it is Pamphilus who is promising that, after he has run home, he will be at the house of his brother immediately.</note> this instant.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> <stage>to PAMPHILUS.</stage> Before you go away, in your presence I wish to relate a single story to him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIGNOMUS </speaker><p> By all means. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> There was once an old gentleman, just as I now am; he had two daughters, such as mine now are; they were married to two brothers, just as mine now are to yourselves.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> I wonder how the story is to turn out?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> One of these young men had, as you <stage>to PAMPHILUS</stage> now have, a damsel, a music-girl; he had brought her from abroad, as you have now done. Now, this old gentleman was a widower, just as I now am.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Do proceed; this story is really &agrave; propos.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Then said this old gentleman to him to whom the music-girl belonged, just as I now say to you----</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> I'm listening<milestone n="546" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">I'm listening</lemma>:  Pamphilus says this, as the old man has probably touched him, to bespeak his attention.</note>, and carefully giving heed.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> "I gave you my daughter, to be a comfortable bedfellow for you; now, I think it fair that one should be given me in return by you, to be my bed-fellow."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Who says that? Does he say it<milestone n="549" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Does he say it</lemma>:  He imitates the old man's manner of adapting his story to the present company, and here jokes him upon it.</note> just as though you were to say it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Just as I now say it to you. "Aye, I'll give you two of them," says this young man, "if one's too little; and if you are not satisfied with two," says he, "two more shall be added."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Prithee, who says that? Does he say it just as though I were to say it?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> He says it just as though you were to say it. Then says this old gentleman, just as though I were to say it, "Well, give me four, if you like, so long only as, i' faith, you find them something to eat as well, that they mayn't consume my victuals."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Why surely it must have been a stingy old chap to say that, in asking food as well of him who promised them to him.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> Why surely, this young man must have been a good-for-nothing fellow, who forthwith, when the other asked him, refused to give him a grain of wheat. But, i' troth, the old gentleman asked what was fair, inasmuch as the dowry which he had given to his daughter, he wished him to have as an equivalent for the music-girl.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> I' faith, for sure I really do think that the young man was well advised, who wouldn't give a mistress to that old fellow in return for the dower.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>ANTIPHO</speaker><p> The old gentleman wished, indeed, if he could, to bargain for their maintenance; because he couldn't, he said he wished it to be done on what terms it might. "Done," said this young man. "You do me a kindness," said the old gentleman. "Have I the thing agreed upon?" said he. "I'll do even as you wish it to be done," said the other. But I'll be off in-doors, and congratulate my daughters on your arrival. Then I'll go wash me at the bath<milestone n="568" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">At the bath</lemma>:  "Pyelum." "Pyelus" is a Greek word Latinised it signifies a vessel used in bathing, which was sufficiently large to hold the bathe in a sitting posture.</note>; there will I take all care of my old age; after that, when I've bathed, lying down, I'll await you at my leisure. <stage>(Exit.)</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> A funny mortal, Antipho; how cleverly he did make up his story. Even yet the rogue considers himself a young man. A mistress shall be given to the fellow, to sing to the old chap at night in bed; for, i' faith, indeed, I know not of what other use a mistress can be to him. But how fares our Parasite, Gelasimus? Is he well, too?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIGNOMUS </speaker><p> I' faith, I saw the fellow not so very long ago.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> How fares he? </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIGNOMUS </speaker><p> Like one half-starved.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>PAMPHILUS</speaker><p> Why didn't you invite the fellow to your house to dinner?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIGNOMUS </speaker><p> That on my arrival I mightn't be wasting anything But see, here's the wolf in the Fable<milestone n="577" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Wolf in the Fable</lemma>:  "Lupus in Fabul&acirc;" was a common expression among the Romans, answering exactly to our very elegart Proverb, "Talk of the devil, he is sure to appear."

<sp><speaker>GELASIMUS</speaker><p> It may easily be excused--only listen to me; do order a dinner to be cooked at home.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>EPIGNOMUS </speaker><p>. Not by my advice, indeed, will he act so as to disappoint that person this day.</p></sp>

From the Greek word <foreign lang="greek">monotrofoi\,</foreign> "eaters alone."</note>, let's wait upon ourselves.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> This banquet, for our means, is quite sufficient, with its nuts, beans, figs<milestone n="690" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Nuts, beans, figs</lemma>:  These articles formed the usual food of the Roman slaves.</note>, a dish of olives, pounded lupines, and a cake.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> It better becomes a man who is a slave to bring his expenses within moderation than beyond. Each one to his own station; they, who have wealth at home, drink from cups, goblets, and bowls; we, if we are now drinking from our Samian jug<milestone n="694" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Samian jug</lemma>:  A plain earthenware goblet, or cup. Reference has been already made to the Samian pottery. The Proverb in this line is similar to ours, of each "cutting his cloth according to his measure."</note>, still build our walls according to our means.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> But while she who is your mistress and mine is arranging her hair, and bedecking herself, I wish us to have some diversion among ourselves. I appoint you the commander<milestone n="697" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">The commander</lemma>:  "Strategum." This is a Greek word, signifying the commander of an army. It was usual with the Greeks, Romans, and Jews, to appoint a master of the feast, who probably gave the toasts, looked to the comforts of the guests, and took care that the quality of the wine was satisfactory. See the second Chapter of <placeName key="tgn,7005135">St. John</placeName>, v. 8.</note> of this feast.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> Very aptly does it suggest itself to your mind.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> Wouldn't we be more suitably entertained like Cynics<milestone n="699" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Entertained like Cynics</lemma>:  The absurdities consequent on the unity of place in the Roman Comedy could not possibly be better illustrated than in the present instance. The servants not only carouse in front of their master's house, but absolutely bring out couches to recline upon. Persons of rigid manners, and especially the Cynic philosophers, persisted in retaining the old posture of sitting at meals; to that circumstance reference is here made.</note> on benches here, than upon couches?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> Aye, but this is far the most pleasant.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> On which side is each of us to recline by our mistress?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> Of course you go to the upper place. And, so that you may understand it, I make a division with you on these terms: consider, and take which province you would even like now to take. <stage>They take their places.</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> But what's your meaning about this "province?"</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> Whether you would choose to hold the command over the water or over <placeName key="tgn,2097807">Bacchus</placeName>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> Over Bacchus, most distinctly. But, in the meantime, general of ours, why stands this goblet here? See how many cups<milestone n="706" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">How many cups</lemma>:  "Cyathos." The "cyathus" was a cup which contained a fixed and definite measure. It contained but a small quantity, one- twelfth part of a "sextarius," which was not quite an English pint. It seems most probable that the "cyathus" was used for the purpose of ladling the wine out of the bowl, or "cratera," in which it was mixed with water, into the goblets or cups. The question of Sagarinus here seems to apply to the number of "cyathi" of the pure wine which they had been drinking at each goblet-full that they took, as otherwise they would be making but slow inroads on the "cadus," five "cyathi" holding, perhaps, about as much as three of our ordinary wine-glasses. It is not improbable that a portion of the Play is lost here.</note> we have drunk.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> As many as there are fingers on your hand. The Greek song is, "Drink either your five cups<milestone n="707" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Either your five cups, &amp;c.</lemma>:  These words are in Greek. Eustathius and Athen&aelig;us say that this Greek song bears reference to the proportions of water that should be mixed with the wine. It seems, however, here to mean that there's "luck in odd numbers" when you are drinking.</note> or your three, but not your four."</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> <stage>about to drink</stage>. I pledge you. Do you take for yourself the tenth part from the fountain<milestone n="708" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">From the fountain</lemma>:  The "fons" in this case was probably a pitcher of water which they had on the table. Sagarinus seems to recommend him, in mixing, only to take one-tenth part of water. Sober people generally mixed in the proportion of three-fifths water and two-fifths wine.</note>, if you are wise. Here's luck to you, luck to us; here's luck to thee, luck to me; luck to our Stephanium as well.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> 'Tis bravely done. I pledge you in a goblet. <stage>Drinks.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> Keep your wine; I'd very much like something by way of a relish<milestone n="711" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">By way of a relish</lemma>:  By "pulpamentum" Sagarinus seems to mean some dainty, by way of a relish; at least, Stichus so understands him, as he points to the nuts, beans, figs, lupines, and olives on the table, and tells him that he will get nothing else.</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> If you are not satisfied with what's here, there's nothing else. Take some water<milestone n="712" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Take some water</lemma>:  He probably tells him to take some water if he feels queer, or, in our vernacular, "seedy," from taking too much wine; which he has some reason to suppose, from the other calling for a "pulpamentum." Anchovy toast is an item of our favorite "pulpamenta."</note>.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> You say right; I care for no dainties. Drink away, <placeName key="tgn,2585845">Piper</placeName><milestone n="713" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Drink away, <placeName key="tgn,2585845">Piper</placeName></lemma>:  He thinks that the <placeName key="tgn,2585845">Piper</placeName> is inclined to shirk his goblet, and to show that he himself is not flagging in spirit, tries to keep him up to the mark.</note>; drink, if you do drink. I' faith, this must be drunk--don't shirk it. <stage>Holds the goblet to the <placeName key="tgn,2585845">PIPER</placeName>.</stage> Why flinch at what you see must be done by you? Why don't you drink? Do it, if you are to do it. Take it, I tell you, for the public pays for this. That's not your way to shirk your drink. Take your pipes<milestone n="716" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Take your pipes</lemma>:  The "Tibicines," "Pipers" or "flute-players," among the Greeks and Romans, were in the habit of playing upon two pipes at the same time. These were perfectly distinct, and were not even, as has been supposed by some, connected by a common mouth-piece. The Romans were particularly fond of this music, and it was introduced both at sacrifices, funerals, and entertainments. See a comical story about the Roman "Tibicines" in the Fasti of <placeName key="tgn,2033049">Ovid</placeName>, B. 6, l. 670 et seq. From the present specimen they appear to have been merry souls, occupying much the same place as the country fiddlers of modern times.</note> out of your mouth. <stage>The <placeName key="tgn,2585845">PIPER</placeName> drinks.</stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> When he has drunk, either do you mind my rules<milestone n="717" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Mind my rules</lemma>:  It is pretty clear, that in his zeal, and to show that there is no flagging in him, Sagarinus has been overdoing it, perhaps helping himself out of his turn; on this, the other threatens to resign his office of master of the ceremonies.</note>, or else I'll give up. I don't wish us to drink this straight out; we shall soon be about nothing<milestone n="718" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Soon be about nothing</lemma>:  "Nulli rei erimus poste&agrave;." This is the proper reading, which has been restored by the research of Ritschel. It is difficult to say precisely what he alludes to, but most probably he means, "at this rate our supply will soon be exhausted."</note>; for, by my faith, almost all in a moment, the cask might be turned head downwards<milestone n="719" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">Turned head downwards</lemma>:  He says that the "cadus," or earthenware cask, will soon at this rate be capable of being turned upside down without any risk of spilling the wine</note>.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> <stage>to the <placeName key="tgn,2585845">PIPER</placeName></stage>. How now? Although you did make a fuss about it, still it didn't hurt you. Come, <placeName key="tgn,2585845">Piper</placeName>, when you've done drinking, put back your pipes to your lips; quickly puff out your cheeks, just like a reptile serpent<milestone n="722" unit="TLN line"/><note anchored="yes"><lemma targOrder="U">A reptile serpent</lemma>:  The head of the serpent is said to swell, or puff out, when it infuriated.</note>. Come now, Stichus, whichever of the two breaks order, shall be fined a cup.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> You propose a good regulation. You ought to have your way, who only ask what's fair.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> Mind it then; if you offend, I'll forthwith take the forfeit on the spot.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> You ask what's quite right and just.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> <stage>pledging STICHUS</stage>. Here's to you first of all.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> 'Tis a droll thing this, for two persons, rivals of each other, to be courting, to be drinking from one goblet, and to be kissing one wench. 'Tis worthy of remark this: I am you, you are I; of one accord are we. With one mistress are we both in love; when she's with me, still she's with you; and when she's with you, she's with me as well; neither of us envies the other.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> Come, come, there's enough of it; I don't want it overdone to weariness. I'd now like some other sport.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> Drink on, if you are drinking.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> There shall be no skulking in me. But, troth, I've had enough of the feast; would but our mistress come here. If she were here, nothing else would be away.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> Should you like us to invite our mistress out? She shall give us a dance.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> I agree. </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> <stage>calling aloud</stage>. My sweet one, my lovely one, my pleasing one, Stephanium, do come out of doors to your sweethearts; to me you are quite charming.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> But to me, indeed, most charming.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> Make us jovial fellows more jovial by your assistance and your company. Returning from abroad, we want you, dear little Stephanium, my honey, that is, if our lovingness is pleasing to you, if we are acceptable to you.</p></sp></div1>

<sp><speaker>STEPHANIUM</speaker><p> I'll indulge you, my dears; but, so may pretty <placeName key="tgn,2100948">Venus</placeName> favour me, I should have already come out of doors here together with you, had I not been sprucing myself up for you. For such is the way of woman, when she is well washed, made clean, dressed and tricked out, still is she incomplete; and a female who is a courtesan much more quickly acquires dislike for herself by sluttishness than always keeps in favour through neatness.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>STICHUS</speaker><p> That's very cleverly said. </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>SAGARINUS</speaker><p> I' faith, you shan't that way get the better of me, but what I'll have a bit of enjoyment, too, that way.</p></sp>
