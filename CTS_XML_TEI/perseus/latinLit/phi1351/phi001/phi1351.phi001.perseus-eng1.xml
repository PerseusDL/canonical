			<div type="chapter" n="4">
				<p>CNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA was born at the ancient and respectable colony of
					Forojulium. His grandfather, by the maternal as well as the paternal line,
					served the office of imperial procurator, a trust of importance, which always
					confers the equestrian dignity. His father, Julius Grsecinus, was a member of
					the Senate, distinguished by his eloquence and philosophy. His merit gave
					umbrage to Caligula. Being commanded by that emperor to undertake the
					prosecution of Marcus Silanus, he refused to comply, and was put to death. Julia
					Procilla, Agricola's mother, was respected for the purity of her manners. Under
					her care and, as it were, in her bosom, the tender mind of the son was trained
					to science and every liberal accomplishment. His own ingenuous disposition
					guarded him against the seductions of pleasure. To that happy temperament was
					added the advantage of pursuing his studies at Marseilles, that seat of
					learning, where the refinements of Greece were happily blended with the sober
					manners of provincial economy.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="5">
				<p>His first rudiments of military knowledge were acquired in Britain, under the
					conduct of Suetonius Paulinus, that experienced officer, active, vigilant, yet
					mild in command. Agricola was soon distinguished by his general, and selected to
					live with him at head-quarters. Honoured in this manner, he did not, as is usual
					with young men, mix riot and dissipation with actual service; nor did he avail
					himself of his rank of military tribune to obtain leave of absence, in order to
					pass his time in idle pleasures and ignorance of his duty. To know the province,
					and make himself known to the army; to learn from men of experience, and to
					emulate the best examples; to seek no enterprise with a forward spirit, and to
					decline none with timid caution, were the rules he laid down to himself; prudent
					with valour, and brave without ostentation. A more active campaign had never
					been known, nor was Britain at any time as fiercely disputed. Our veteran forces
					were put to the sword; our colonies smoked on the ground; and the legions were
					intercepted on their march. The struggle was then for life; we fought afterwards
					for fame and victory. In a juncture so big with danger, though the conduct of
					the war was in other hands, and the glory of recovering the province was justly
					ascribed to the commander-inchief, yet so fair an opportunity did not fail to
					improve a young officer, and plant in his mind the early seeds of military
					ambition.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="6">
				<p>He returned from Britain to enter on the gradations of the civil magistracy, and
					married Domitia Decidiana, a lady of high rank and splendid descent. By that
					alliance he gained an accession of strength and credit, that served to forward
					him in the road to public honours. The conjugal state proved a source of
					domestic happiness. They lived in perfect harmony, endeared by the tenderest
					affection, and each ascribing to the other the felicity which they enjoyed.
					Agricola obtained the office of quaestor, and the province of Asia, of which
					Salvius Titianus was proconsul, fell to his lot. Neither the place nor the
					governor could warp his integrity. The wealth of the inhabitants invited ihe
					hand of rapacity; and Titianus, by the bias of his nature prone to acts of
					avarice, was ready, on terms of mutual connivance, to cooperate in any scheme of
					guilt and plunder; but Agricola maintained his honour and his principles. During
					his stay in As a, his family was increased by the birth of a daughter, who
					proved soon after, when he lost his infant son, a source of consolation. The
					intermediate space between the expiration of his quaestorship and his
					advancement to the post of tribune of the people, he had the prudence to pass in
					calm tranquillity. Even during the year of his tribuneship he acted with the
					same reserve, aware of those disastrous times when, under the tyranny of Nero's
					reign, the want of exertion was the truest wisdom. He discharged the office of
					praetor with the same moderation and silent dignity, having no occasion, as his
					good fortune would have it, to sit in judicature. The pageantry of public
					spectacles, which belonged to his department, he conducted with economy and
					magnificence, short of profusion, yet with due regard to popularity.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="7">
				<p>In the course of the following year (<date when="0069">A. D. 69</date>), a
					dreadful misfortune happened in his family, and proved to him a severe stroke of
					affliction. A descent, from Otho's fleet, which roved about in quest of
					depredation, was made on the coast of Liguria. The freebooters plundered the
					city of Intemelium, and in their fury, murdered Agricola's mother, then residing
					upon her own estate. They laid waste her lands, and went off with a considerable
					booty. Agricola set out immediately to pay the last tribute of filial piety, and
					being informed on his way, that Vespasian aspired to the imperial dignity, he
					declared at once in favour of that party. In the beginning of the new reign, the
					government of Rome, and the whole administration, centred in Mucianus, Dornitian
					being, at that time, too young for business, and from the elevation of his
					father claiming no other privilege than that of being debauched and profligate
					without control. Agricola was despatched to raise new levies. He executed that
					commission with so much zeal and credit to himself, that Mucianus advanced him
					to the command of the twentieth legion, then quartered in Britain, and for some
					time unwilling to swear fidelity to Vespasian. Their commander was of pretoran
					rank; but either on account of his own disaffection, or the turbulent spirit of
					the soldiers, his authority was too feeble. Agricola succeeded to the command of
					the legion, and to the task of punishing the guilty. He acquitted himself with
					consummate address and singular moderation.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="8">
				<p>The government of Britain was at that time committed to Vettius Bolanus, a man of
					milder disposition than consisted with the genius of those ferocious islanders.
					Agricola, that he might not seem to eclipse his superior officer, restrained his
					martial ardour, submitting with deference to his commander-in-chief, and, in
					every part of his conduct, uniting to his love of glory, a due regard for the
					service. Bolanus was soon recalled, and Petilius Cerealis, an officer of
					consular rank. succeeded to the command. The field of warlike enterprise was
					laid open to Agricola Under the new commander, he was, at first, no more than a
					common sharer m the dangers of the campaign; but in a short time his talents had
					their free career. The general to make his experiment, sent him at the head of
					detached parties, and afterwards, encouraged by the event, employed him in more
					important operations. Agricola never betrayed a symptom of vainglory. From the
					issue of his expeditions, however successful, he assumed no merit. By this
					conduct, vigorous in action, but modest in the report of his exploits, he gained
					a brilliant reputation, secure from the envy that attends it.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="9">
				<p>On his return to Rome, Vespasian advanced him to the patrician rank, and soon
					after to the government of the province of Aquitania; an appointment of the
					first importance, leading directly to the honours of the consulship, to which he
					then aspired with the concurrence of the prince The military mind, trained up in
					the school of war, is generally supposed to want the power of nice
					discrimination. Agricola, however, indebted to nature for a certain rectitude of
					understanding, was not out of his sphere even among men versed in questions of
					jurisprudence. In the council of the province, or on the tribunal of justice, he
					discharged the duties of his station with awful gravity, intent to inquire,
					often severe, but more inclined to soften the rigour of the law. In less than
					three years he was recalled from his province, to take upon him the consular
					dignity. During his consulship, though I was then very young, he agreed to a
					marriage between me and his daughter, who certainly might have looked for a
					prouder connection. The nuptial ceremony was not performed till the term of his
					consulship expired. In a short time after, he was appointed governor of Britain,
					with the additional honour of a seat in the pontifical college.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="18">
				<p>When Agricola arrived, about the middle of the summer (<date when="0078">A. D.
						78</date>), to take upon him the command, he found an army lulled in
					indolence and security, as if the campaign was at an end, while the enemy was on
					the watch to seize the first opportunity. The Ordovicians, not long before his
					arrival, had fallen upon a party of horse that happened to be quartered in their
					district, and put them almost all to the sword. By this blow the courage of the
					Britons was once more revived; the bold and resolute declared for open war,
					while others less sanguine, were against unsheathing the sword till the
					character and genius of the new governor should be better known. Many things
					conspired to embarrass Agricola: the summer was far advanced; the troops were
					stationed at different quarters, expecting a cessation of arms during the
					remainder of the year; and to act on the defensive, content with strengthening
					the weakest stations, was in the opinion of the best officers the most prudent
					measure. These were circumstances unfavourable to a spirit of enterprise; but
					the general resolved to put his army in motion, and face the danger without
					delay. For this purpose he drew together val ious detachments from the legions,
					and, with the addition of a body of auxiliaries, marched against the enemy. The
					Ordovicians continuing to decline an engagement on the open plain, he determined
					to seek them on their heights, and, to animate his men by his own example, he
					advanced at the head of the line. A battle ensued, and the issue was the
					destruction of the Ordovician state. Knowing of what moment it is to follow the
					first impressions of fame, Agricola formed a plan for the reduction of the Isle
					of Mona. For the execution of an enterprise so sudden and important, no measures
					had been concerted, and by consequence no vessels were ready to transport the
					troops. The genius and resolution of the general supplied all deficiencies. He
					draughted from the auxiliaries a chosen band well acquainted with the fordable
					places, and inured to the national practice of swimming across lakes and rivers
					with such dexterity, that they could manage their arms and guide their horses at
					the same time. This select corps, free from the incumbrance of their baggage,
					dashed into the water, and made their way with vigour towards the island. This
					mode of attack astonished the enemy, who expected nothing less than a fleet of
					transports, and a regular embarkation. Struck with consternation, they thought
					nothing impregnable to men who waged so unusual a war. Ih despair they sued for
					peace, and surrendered the island. The event added a new lustre to the name of
					Agricola, who had thus crowded so much glory into that part of the year which is
					usually trifled away m vain parade. The moderation with which he enjoyed his
					victory was remarkable. In his despatches to Rome he assumed no merit, nor were
					his letters, according to custom, decorated with sprigs of laurel: but this
					self-denial served only to enhance his fame.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="19">
				<p>Agricola knew by the experience of past events, that conquest, while it loads the
					vanquished with injury and oppression, can never be secure and permanent. He
					determined, therefore, to suppress the seeds of future hostility. He began a
					reform in his own household. He removed his slaves and freedmen from every
					department of public business. Promotions in the army no longer went by favour;
					merit decided, and the man of worth, Agricola knew, would be the most faithful
					soldier. To know everything, and yet overlook a great deal; to forgive slight
					offences, and treat matters of importance with due severity, was the rule of his
					conduct; never vindictive, and in many instances disarmed by penitence. The
					exigencies of the army called for large contributions of corn and other
					supplies, and yet he lightened the burden by just and equal assessments,
					providing at the same time against the extortion of the tax-gatherer, more
					odious and intolerable than even the tax itself.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="20">
				<p>The consequence was, that peace, which, through the neglect or connivance of
					former governors was no less terrible than war itself, began to diffuse its
					blessings, and to be relished by all. As soon as the summer opened, he assembled
					his army and marched in quest of the enemy. Having spread a general terror
					through the country, he then suspended his operations, that, in the interval of
					repose, the barbarians might taste the sweets of peace. In consequence of these
					measures, several states, which till then had breathed a spirit of independence,
					were induced to lay aside their hostile intentions, and to give hostages for
					their pacific behaviour. Along the frontier of the several districts which had
					submitted, a chain of posts was established with so much care and judgment, that
					no part of the country could think itself secure from the vigour of the
					conqueror.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="21">
				<p>To introduce a system of new and wise regulations was the business of the
					following winter. To establish a plan of education, and give the sons of the
					leading chiefs a tincture of letters, was part of his policy. By way of
					encouragement, he praised their talents, and already saw them, by the force of
					their natural genius, rising superior to the attainments of the Gauls.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="22">
				<p>In the course of the third year the progress of the Roman arms discovered new
					nations, whose territories were laid waste as far as the estuary called the
					Firth of Tay. The legions had to struggle with all the difficulties of a
					tempestuous season, and yet the Barbarians, struck with a general panic, never
					dared to hazard an engagement. The country, as far as the Romans advanced, was
					secuied by forts and garrisons. No officer knew better than Agricola, how to
					seize the most advantageous situation; and, accordingly, not one of the
					stations, fortified by his direction, was taken by storm; not one was reduced to
					capitulate; not one was surrendered or abandoned to the enemy. The enemy who had
					been accustomed to retrieve in the winter what they lost in the antecedent
					summer, now saw no difference of seasons; they were defeated everywhere, and
					reduced to the last despair.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="24">
				<p>In the fifth summer Agricola made an expedition by sea. He embarked in the first
					Roman vessel that ever crossed the estuary of the Clyde, and having penetrated
					into regions till then unknown, he defeated the inhabitants in several
					engagements, and lined the coast. which lies opposite to Ireland, with a body of
					troops; not so much from an apprehension of danger, as with a view to future
					projects. He saw that Ireland, lying between Britain and Spain, and at the same
					time convenient to the ports of Gaul, might prove a valuable acquisition,
					capable of giving an easy communication, and, of course, strength and union to
					provinces disjoined by nature.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="25">
				<p>In the campaign which began in the sixth summer, having reason to apprehend a
					general confederacy of the nations beyond the Firth of Bodotria, and fearing, in
					a country not yet explored, the danger of a surprise, Agricola ordered his ships
					to sail across the gulf, and gain bome knowledge of those new regions. The
					fleet, now acting, for the first time, in concert with the land forces,
					proceeded in sight of the army, forming a magnificent spectacle, and adding
					terror to the war. At the sight of the Roman fleet, the Britons, according to
					intelligence gained from the prisoners, were struck with consternation,
					convinced that every resource was cut off since the sea, which had always been
					their shelter, was now laid open to the invader. In this distress, the
					Caledonians resolved to try the issue of a battle. Without waiting for the
					commencement of hostilities, they stormed the Roman forts and cas les, and by
					provoking danger, made such an impression Ihat several officers in Agricola's
					army recommended a sudden retreat to avoid the disgrace of being driven back to
					the other side of the Firth. Meanwhile Agricola received intelligence that the
					enemy meditated an attack in various quarters at once, and thereupon, lest
					superior numbers, in a country where he was a stranger to the defiles and
					passes, should be able to surround him, he divided his army, and marched forward
					in three columns.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="26">
				<p>The Caledonians, informed of this arrangement, changed their plan, and in the
					dead of night fell with their united force upon the ninth legion, then the
					weakest of the Roman army. They surprised the advanced guard, and having, in the
					confusion of sleep and terror, put ihe sentinels to the sword, they forced their
					way through the entrenchments. The conflict was in the very camp when Agricola,
					who had been informed that the Barbarians were on their march, and instantly
					pursued their steps, came up to the relief of the legion. He ordered the
					swiftest of the horse and light infantry to advance with expedition, and charge
					the enemy in the rear, while his whole army set up a general shout. At break of
					day the Roman banners glittered in view of the Barbarians, who found themselves
					hemmed in by two armies, and began to relax their vigour. The spirit of the
					legion revived. Acting no longer on the defensive, they rushed on to the attack.
					The Caledonians were put to the rout, and if the woods and marshes had not
					favoured their escape, that single action had put an end to the war.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="27">
				<p>By this victory, so complete and glorious, the Roman army was inspired with
					confidence to such a degree, that they now pronounced themselves invincible. The
					Caledonians, notwithstanding their defeat, abated nothing from their ferocity.
					They listed the young men of their nation; they sent their wives and children to
					a place of safety; they held public conventions of the several states, and with
					solemn rites and sacrifices formed a league in the cause of liberty. The
					campaign ended in this manner, and the two armies, inflamed with mutual
					animosity, retired into winter quarters.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="29">
				<p>In the beginning of the following summer Agricola met with a stroke of
					affliction, by the loss of a son about a year old. He did not upon this occasion
					affect, like many others, the character of a man superior to the feelings of
					nature; nor yet did he suffer his grief to sink him down into unbecoming
					weakness. In the opening of the campaign, he despatched his fleet, with orders
					to annoy the coast with frequent descents in different places. and spread a
					general alarm. He put himself, in the meantime, at the head of his army equipped
					for expedition, and, taking with him a select band of the bravest Britons, of
					known and approved fidelity, he advanced as far as the Grampian hills, where the
					enemy was already posted in force. Undismayed by their former defeat, the
					Barbarians expected no other issue than a total overthrow, or a brave revenge.
					By treaties of alliance, and by deputations to the several cantons, they had
					drawn together the strength of their nation. Upwards of thirty thousand men
					appeared in arms, and their force was increasing every day. Among the chieftains
					distinguished by their birth and valour, the most renowned was Galgacus. The
					multitude gathered around him, eager for action, and burning with uncommon
					ardour.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="30">
				<p>He harangued them to the following effect: "All that can inspire the human heart,
					every motive that can excite us to deeds of valour, is on our side The Romans
					have no wives in the field to animate their drooping spirit; no parents to
					reproach their want of courage. They are not listed in the cause of their
					country,their country, if any they have, lies at a distance. In me behold your
					general; behold an army of freeborn men. Your enemy is before you, and, in his
					train, heavy tributes, drudgery in the mines, and all the horrors of slavery.
					Are those calamities to be entailed upon us? Or shall this day relieve us by a
					brave revenge ? There is the field of battle, and let that determine. Let us
					seek the enemy, and as we rush upon him, remember the glory delivered down to us
					by our ancestors; and let each man think that upon his sword depends the fate of
					all posterity."</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="33">
				<p>This speech was received with war songs, with savage howlings, and a wild uproar
					of military applause. Their battalions began to form a line of battle; the brave
					and warlike rushed forward to the front, and the field glittered with the blaze
					of arms. The Romans on their side burned with equal ardour. Agricola saw the
					impatient spirit of his men, but did not think proper to begin the engagement
					till he confirmed their courage by a speech in which he said:</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="34">
				<p>"If our present struggle were with nations wholly unknown; if we had to do with
					an enemy new to our swords, I should call to mind the example of other armies.
					At present what can I propose so bright and animating as your own exploits? I
					appeal to your own eyes: behold the men drawn up against you: are they not the
					same, who last year, under the covert of the night, assaulted the ninth legion,
					and, upon the first shout of our army, fled before you? A band of dastards ! who
					have subsisted hitherto, because of all the Britons they are the most
					expeditious runaways. Benumbed with fear they stand motionless on yonder spot,
					which you will render forever memorable by a glorious victory. Here you may end
					your labours, and close a scene of fifty years by one great, one glorious day.
					Let your country see, and let the commonwealth bear witness, if the conquest of
					Britain has been a lingering work, if the seeds of rebellion have not been
					crushed, that we at least have done our duty."</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="35">
				<p>As soon as the general ended, the field rung with shouts of applause. Impatient
					for the onset, the soldiers grasped their arms. Agricola restrained their
					violence, till he formed his order of battle. The auxiliary infantry, in number
					about eight thousand, occupied the centre. The wings consisted of three thousand
					horse. The legions were stationed in the rear, at the head of the intrenchments
					as a body of reserve to support the ranks, if necessary, but otherwise to remain
					inactive, that a victory, obtained without the effusion of Roman blood might be
					of higher value. The Caledonians kept possession of the rising grounds,
					extending their ranks as wide as possible, to present a formidable show of
					battle. Their first line was ranged on the plain, the rest in a gradual ascent
					on the acclivity of the hill. The intermediate space between both armies was
					filled with the charioteers and cavalry of the Britons, rushing to and fro in
					wild career, and traversing the plain with noise and tumult.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="36">
				<p>The battle began, and at first was maintained at a distance. The Britons wanted
					neither skill nor resolution. With their long swords, and targets of small
					dimension, they had the address to elude the missive weapons of the Romans, and
					at the same time to discharge a thick volley of their own. To bring the conflict
					to a speedy decision, Agricola ordered three Batavian and two Tungarian cohorts
					to charge the enemy sword in hand. To this mode of attack those troops had been
					long accustomed, but to the Britons it was every way disadvantageous. Their
					small targets afforded no protection, and their unwieldy swords, not sharpened
					to a point, could do but little execution in a close engagement. The Batavians
					rushed to the attack with impetuous fury. Incited by their example, the other
					cohorts advanced with a spirit of emulation, and cut their way with terrible
					slaughter. Eager in pursuit of victory, they pressed forward with determined
					fury, leaving behind them numbers wounded, but not slain, and others not so much
					as hurt.</p>
				<p>The Roman cavalry, in the mean time, was forced to give ground. The Caledonians,
					in their armed chariots, rushed at full speed into the thick of the battle,
					where the infantry were engaged. Their first impression struck a general terror,
					but their career was soon checked by the inequalities of the ground and the
					close ranks of the Romans. Pent up in narrow places, the Barbarians crowded upon
					each other, and were driven or dragged along by their own horses. A scene of
					confusion followed. Chariots without a guide, and horses without a rider, broke
					from the ranks in wild disorder, and flying every way, as fear and consternation
					urged, they overwhelmed their own files and trampled down all who came in their
					way.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="37">
				<p>Meanwhile, the Britons who had hitherto kept their post on the hills, began to
					quit their station. Descending slowly, they hoped, by wheeling round the field
					of battle, to attack the victors in the rear. To counteract their design,
					Agricola ordered four squadrons of horse, which he had kept as a body of
					reserve, to advance to the charge. The Britons poured down with impetuosity, and
					retired with equal precipitation. At the same time, the cavalry, by the
					directions of the general, wheeled round from the wings, and fell with great
					slaughter on the rear of the enemy, who now perceived that their own stratagem
					was turned against themselves.</p>
				<p>The field presented a dreadful spectacle of carnage and destruction. The Britons
					fled; the Romans pursued; they wounded, gashed, and mangled the runaways; they
					seized their prisoners, and to be ready for others, butchered them on the spot.
					Swords and bucklers, mangled limbs and dead bodies, covered the plain. The field
					was red with blood. The vanquished Britons had their moments of returning
					courage, and gave proofs of virtue and of brave despair. They fled to the woods,
					and rallying their scattered numbers, surrounded such of the Romans as pursued
					with too much eagerness.</p>
				<p>Agricola was everywhere present. He saw the danger, and if he had not in the
					instant taken due precaution, the victorious army would have had reason to
					repent of too much confidence in success. Night coming on, the Romans weary of
					slaughter, desisted from the pursuit. Ten thousand of the Caledonians fell in
					this engagement; on the part of the Romans, the number of slain did not exceed
					three hundred and forty.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="38">
				<p>The Roman army, elated with success, and enriched with plunder, passed the night
					in exultation. The Britons, on the other hand, wandered about, uncertain which
					way to turn, helpless and disconsolate. The mingled cries of men and women
					filled the air with lamentations. It is a fact well authenticated, that some
					laid violent hands upon their wives and children, determined with savage
					compassion to end their misery.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="39">
				<p>The account of these transactions, sent to Rome by Agricola, was plain and
					simple, without any decoration of language to heighten the narrative. Domitian
					received it in the true spirit of his character, with a smile on his
					countenance, and malignity at his heart. He began to fear that the name of a
					private citizen might overshadow the imperial title. The reflection planted
					thorns in his breast. He resolved, however, to nourish resentment in sullen
					silence, till the tide of popularity which attended the general should ebb away,
					and the affection of the army had time to cool. Agricola was still in Britain,
					and had the command of the army and the province.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="40">
				<p>Domitian, in the meantime, caused a decree to pass the Senate, by which triumphal
					ornaments, the honour of a statue crowned with laurel, and all other marks of
					distinction usually substituted in the place of a real triumph were granted to
					Agricola. The Emperor had also the art to circulate a report, that the province
					of Syria, at that time vacant by the death of Atilius Rufus, an officer of
					consular rank, was intended for Agricola, in order to do him honour by an
					appointment always given to men of the highest eminence. However that may be,
					Agricola resigned the command (<date when="0085">A. D. 85</date>), and delivered
					to his successor, Sallustius Lucullus, a quiet and well ordered government.</p>
				<p>Lest his arrival at Rome should draw together too great a concourse, he concealed
					his approach from his friends, and entered the city privately in the dead of
					night. With the same secrecy, and in the night also, he went, as commanded, to
					present himself to the Emperor. Domitian received him with a cold salute, and,
					without uttering a word, left the conqueror of Britain to mix with the servile
					creatures of the court.</p>
				<p>To soften prejudices, Agricola resolved to shade the lustre of his name in the
					mild retreat of humble virtues. With this view he resigned himself to the calm
					enjoyments of domestic life. Plain in his apparel, easy of access, and never
					attended by more than one or two friends, he was remarkable for nothing but the
					simplicity of his appearance.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="41">
				<p>But in the distress of public affairs which soon after followed, the name of
					Agricola could not be suffered to remain in obscurity. By the rashness or
					inactivity of the commanders-in-chief, the armies of the empire were lost in
					Moesia, Dacia, Germany, and Pannonia. Every day brought an account of some new
					misfortune; forts besieged and taken; garrisons stormed, and whole cohorts with
					their commanding officers made prisoners of war. In times like those, when
					calamity followed calamity, and every successive year was marked by the defeat
					and slaughter of armies, the voice of the people called aloud for Agricola to be
					employed in the public service.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="42">
				<p>The year was now at hand in which Agricola was to have by lot the proconsulship
					of Asia or of Africa; but the death of Civica, who had been lately murdered in
					his government, gave at once a warning to Agricola. and a precedent to Domitian.
					At this point of time, the spies of the court thought proper to pay their visits
					to Agricola. The design of those pretended friends was to discover whether the
					government of a province would be acceptable. They contented themselves, in
					their first approaches, with suggesting to him the value of tranquillity in a
					private station, and then obligingly undertook, by their interests at court, to
					obtain permission for him to decline the office. At length the mask fell off: by
					adding menaces to their insidious advice, they gained their point, and hurried
					him away to the presence of the Emperor. Domitian knew the part he had to act;
					with a concerted countenance, and an air of distant pride, he heard Agricola's
					apology, and complied with his request, conscious of his own treachery, yet
					receiving thanks for it without a blush.</p>
				<p>The proconsular salary, which had been usually granted in such cases, was
					withheld upon this occasion; perhaps in resentment, because it was not
					solicited, or the better reason might be, that the prince might not seem to gain
					by compromise what he had a right to command.</p>
			</div>
			<div type="chapter" n="43">
				<p>The death of Agricola (<date when="0093">A. D. 93</date>) was felt by his family
					with the deepest sorrow, by his friends with tender concern, and even by
					foreigners with universal regret. During his illness, the common people were
					constantly at his door, making their inquiries. In the forum, and all circular
					meetings, he was the subject of conversation. When he breathed his last, no man
					was so hardened as to rejoice at the news. He died lamented, and not soon
					forgotten. What added to the public affliction, was a report that so valuable a
					life was ended by a dose of poison. No proof of the fact appearing, I leave the
					story to shift for itself. Thus much is certain, during his illness, instead of
					formal messages, according to the usual practice of courts, the freedmen most in
					favour, and the principal physicians of the Emperor, were assiduous in their
					visits. Was this the solicitude of friendship, or were these men the spies of
					state?</p>
				<p>On the day that closed his life, while he was yet in the agony of death, the
					quickest intelligence of every symptom was conveyed to Domitian by messengers in
					waiting for the purpose. That so much industry was exerted to hasten news which
					the Emperor did not wish to hear, no man believed. As soon as the event was
					known Domitian put on an air of sorrow, and even affected to be touched with
					real regret. The will of the deceased gave him entire satisfaction; he was named
					joint heir with Agricola's excellent wife and his most dutiful daughter, and
					this the tyrant considered as a voluntary mark of the testator's love and
					esteem. A mind like his, debauched and blinded by continued flattery, could not
					perceive that by a good father, none but an evil prince is ever called to a
					share in the succession.</p>

				<p>Agricola was born on the ides of June, in the third consulship of Caligula; he
					died on the tenth before the calends of September, during the consulship of
					Collega and Priscus, in the fifty-sixth year of his age.<note anchored="true"
						>There seems, in this place, to be some mistake, not, however, imputable to
						Tacitus, but, more probably, to the transcribers, who, in their manuscript,
						might easily write LVI. instead of LIV. Caligula's third consulship was A.
						U. C. 793, <date when="0040">A. D. 40</date>. Agricola was born on the
						thirteenth of June in that year: he died on the ioth of the calends of
						September, that is the 23d of August, in the consulship of Pompeius Collega
						and Cornelius Priscus, A. U. C, 846, <date when="0093">A. D. 93</date>.
						According to this account, Agricola, on the 13th of June, A. U. C. 846,
						entered on the fifty-fourth year of his age, and died in the month of August
						following. It is, therefore, probable, that the copyists, as already
						observed, inserted in their manuscript fifty-six for fifty-four.</note> [His
					life extended through the reigns of nine emperors, from Caligula to Domitian.]
					As to his person, about which in future times there may be some curiosity, he
					was of that make and stature which may be said to be graceful, not majestic. His
					countenance had not that commanding air which strikes with awe; a sweetness of
					expression was the prevailing character.</p>
				<p>Though he was snatched away in the vigour of life, yet if we consider the space
					his glory filled in the eyes of mankind, he might be said to have died full of
					years. Possessing all the best enjoyments that spring from virtue, and from
					virtue only; adorned with every dignity, which either the consular rank or
					triumphal honours could bestow; what further advantage could he derive from
					fortune? Immoderate riches he never desired, content with an honourable
					independence. His wife and daughter left in a state of security, his honours
					blooming around him, his fame unblemished, his relations flourishing, and every
					tie of friendship preserved to the last, he may be considered as supremely
					happy, that he did not live to see the tempestuous times that soon after
					followed. To counterbalance his untimely end, it is at least some consolation,
					that he escaped that black and horrible period, in which Domitian no longer
					broke out in sudden fits and starts of cruelty, but, throwing off all restraint,
					proceeded in one continued course of unrelenting fury, as if determined to crush
					the commonwealth at a blow. </p>
