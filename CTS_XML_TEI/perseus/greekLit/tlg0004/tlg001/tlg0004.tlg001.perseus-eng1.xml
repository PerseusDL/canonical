<head>Prologue</head>
<div3 type="section" n="1">
<p>There are some who say that the study of philosophy had its beginning among the barbarians.
They urge that the Persians have had their Magi,
the Babylonians or Assyrians their Chaldaeans, and
the Indians their Gymnosophists; and among the
Celts and Gauls there are the people called Druids
or Holy Ones, for which they cite as authorities the
<hi rend='ital'>Magicus</hi> of Aristotle and Sotion in the
twenty-third<note n='a'>The alteration of the numeral from 23 to 13 is
supported
by what little we know of Sotion's work. It was from a similar source that Clement of Alexandria must have taken
what we find in
<hi rend='ital'>Strom.</hi> i. 71 concerning
Chaldaeans, Druids,
Magians, Gymnosophists, and other barbarian philosophers.</note>
book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Succession of Philosophers.</hi> Also they
say that Mochus was a Phoenician, Zamolxis a
Thracian, and Atlas a Libyan.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
<p>If we may believe the Egyptians, Hephaestus was
the son of the Nile, and with him philosophy began,
priests and prophets being its chief exponents.
Hephaestus lived 48,863 years before Alexander
of Macedon, and in the interval there occurred 373
solar and 832 lunar eclipses.</p>
<pb n='5'/>
<p>The date of the Magians, beginning with Zoroaster
the Persian, was 5000 years before the fall of Troy,
as given by Hermodorus the Platonist in his work
on mathematics; but Xanthus the Lydian reckons
6000 years from Zoroaster to the expedition of
Xerxes, and after that event he places a long line
of Magians in succession, bearing the names of
Ostanas, Astrampsychos, Gobryas, and Pazatas,
down to the conquest of Persia by Alexander.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
<p>These authors forget that the achievements which
they attribute to the barbarians belong to the
Greeks, with whom not merely philosophy but the
human race itself began. For instance, Musaeus is
claimed by Athens, Linus by Thebes. It is said
that the former, the son of Eumolpus, was the first
to compose a genealogy of the gods and to construct
a sphere, and that he maintained that all things
proceed from unity and are resolved again into
unity. He died at Phalerum, and this is his
epitaph<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii.
615.</note>:</p>
<p>Musaeus, to his sire Eumolpus dear,</p>
<p>In Phalerean soil lies buried here;</p>
<p>and the Eumolpidae at Athens get their name from
the father of Musaeus.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
<p>Linus again was (so it is said) the son of Hermes
and the Muse Urania. He composed a poem describing the creation of the world, the courses of the
sun and moon, and the growth of animals and
plants. His poem begins with the line:</p>
<p>Time was when all things grew up at once;</p>
<p>and this idea was borrowed by Anaxagoras when he
<pb n='7'/>
declared that all things were originally together
until Mind came and set them in order. Linus died
in Euboea, slain by the arrow of Apollo, and this is
his epitaph<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii.
616.</note>:</p>
<p>Here Theban Linus, whom Urania bore,</p>
<p>The fair-crowned Muse, sleeps on a foreign shore.</p>
<p>And thus it was from the Greeks that philosophy
took its rise: its very name refuses to be translated
into foreign speech.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
<p>But those who attribute its invention to barbarians
bring forward Orpheus the Thracian, calling him a
philosopher of whose antiquity there can be no
doubt. Now, considering the sort of things he said
about the gods, I hardly know whether he ought to
be called a philosopher; for what are we to make of
one who does not scruple to charge the gods with
all human suffering, and even the foul crimes wrought
by the tongue amongst a few of mankind? The
story goes that he met his death at the hands of
women; but according to the epitaph at Dium in
Macedonia he was slain by a thunderbolt; it runs
as follows<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> ii.
99.</note>:</p>
<p>Here have the Muses laid their minstrel true,</p>
<p>The Thracian Orpheus whom Jove's thunder slew.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
<p>But the advocates of the theory that philosophy
took its rise among the barbarians go on to explain
the different forms it assumed in different countries.
As to the Gymnosophists and Druids we are told
that they uttered their philosophy in riddles, bidding
men to reverence the gods, to abstain from wrongdoing, and to practise courage. That the Gymno-
<pb n='9'/>
sophists at all events despise even death itself is
affirmed by Clitarchus in his twelfth book; he also
says that the Chaldaeans apply themselves to
astronomy and forecasting the future; while the
Magi spend their time in the worship of the gods,
in sacrifices and in prayers, implying that none but
themselves have the ear of the gods. They propound their views concerning the being and origin
of the gods, whom they hold to be fire, earth, and
water; they condemn the use of images, and
especially the error of attributing to the divinities
difference of sex.
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
They hold discourse of justice,
and deem it impious to practise cremation; but
they see no impiety in marriage with a mother or
daughter, as Sotion relates in his twenty-third book.
Further, they practise divination and forecast the
future, declaring that the gods appear to them in
visible form. Moreover, they say that the air is
full of shapes which stream forth like vapour and
enter the eyes of keen-sighted seers. They prohibit
personal ornament and the wearing of gold. Their
dress is white, they make their bed on the ground,
and their food is vegetables, cheese,<note n='a'>Compare Pliny,
<hi rend='ital'>N.H.</hi> xx. 11. 242: Zoroaster lived in
the wilderness on cheese (<hi rend='ital'>cf. Yasht</hi>, xxii.
18 "Spring butter is the ambrosia of the blessed"). For fuller
comments on 7-9 see J. H. Moulton's
<hi rend='ital'>Early
Zoroastrianism</hi>, pp. 410-418.</note> and coarse
bread; their staff is a reed and their custom is, so
we are told, to stick it into the cheese and take up
with it the part they eat.</p>
<p>With the art of magic they were wholly unacquainted, according to Aristotle in his
<hi rend='ital'>Magicus</hi>
and Dinon in the fifth book of his
<hi rend='ital'>History</hi> Dinon
tells us that the name Zoroaster, literally interpreted,
means "star-worshipper"<note n='b'>This popular etymology, though
wide-spread, is
erroneous, the true form of the prophet's name being
Zarathustra, almost certainly derived from
<hi
rend='ital'>zarath</hi>="old"
(a Zend stem, parallel to<foreign lang='greek'>ge/ront-</foreign>) and
<hi rend='ital'>ustra</hi>="camel."
<hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> J. H. Moulton,
<hi rend='ital'>op. cit.</hi>
p. 426, and, for star-lore in the
Avesta,
<hi rend='ital'>ib.</hi> p. 210.</note>; and Hermodorus
agrees
<pb n='11'/>
with him in this. 
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
Aristotle in the first book of his
dialogue
<hi rend='ital'>On Philosophy</hi> declares that the Magi are
more ancient than the Egyptians; and further, that
they believe in two principles, the good spirit and
the evil spirit, the one called Zeus or Oromasdes,
the other Hades or Arimanius. This is confirmed
by Hermippus in his first book about the Magi,
Eudoxus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Voyage round the World</hi>, and Theopompus in the eighth book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Philippica.</hi> 
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
The last-named author says that according to the Magi
men will live in a future life and be immortal, and
that the world will endure through their invocations.<note n='a'>In
this clause the word
<foreign lang='greek'>e)piklh/sesi</foreign> is
usually taken as
equivalent to
<foreign lang='greek'>o)no/masi</foreign> (names). The
meaning then would
be: "What exists now will exist hereafter under its own
present name." Diels would alter
<foreign lang='greek'>e)piklh/sesi</foreign> to
<foreign lang='greek'>periku-
klh/sesi</foreign>, thus obtaining something very like the Heraclitean
union of opposites: "the things which are will continue to
be through all their revolutions." But
<foreign lang='greek'>e)pi/klhsis</foreign> like
<foreign lang='greek'>e)tikalei=sqai</foreign> can be used of prayer, and
there is some
evidence that Avestan religion fully recognized the efficacy
of prayers and spells. The testimony of Theopompus, who
wrote in the fourth century, to the Zoroastrian doctrine of
immortality is regarded by J. H. Moulton as specially
important:
<hi rend='ital'>cf. Early Zoroastrianism</hi>, pp. 177
<hi
rend='ital'>sq.</hi> and 416.</note>
This is again confirmed by Eudemus of Rhodes.
But Hecataeus relates that according to them the
gods are subject to birth. Clearchus of Soli in his
tract
<hi rend='ital'>On Education</hi> further makes the Gymnosophists
to be descended from the Magi; and some trace
the Jews also to the same origin. Furthermore,
those who have written about the Magi criticize
Herodotus. They urge that Xerxes would never
have cast javelins at the sun nor have let down
fetters into the sea, since in the creed of the Magi
sun and sea are gods. But that statues of the
gods should be destroyed by Xerxes was natural
enough.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
<p>The philosophy of the Egyptians is described as
follows so far as relates to the gods and to justice.
They say that matter was the first principle, next
the four elements were derived from matter, and
thus living things of every species were produced.</p>
<pb n='13'/>
<p>The sun and the moon are gods bearing the names of
Osiris and Isis respectively; they make use of the
beetle, the dragon, the hawk, and other creatures
as symbols of divinity, according to Manetho in his
<hi rend='ital'>Epitome of Physical Doctrines</hi>, and Hecataeus in
the
first book of his work
<hi rend='ital'>On the Egyptian Philosophy.</hi>
They also set up statues and temples to these sacred
animals because they do not know the true form of
the deity. 
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>
They hold that the universe is created
and perishable, and that it is spherical in shape.
They say that the stars consist of fire, and that,
according as the fire in them is mixed, so events
happen upon earth; that the moon is eclipsed when
it falls into the earth's shadow; that the soul
survives death and passes into other bodies; that
rain is caused by change in the atmosphere; of all
other phenomena they give physical explanations,
as related by Hecataeus and Aristagoras. They
also laid down laws on the subject of justice, which
they ascribed to Hermes; and they deified those
animals which are serviceable to man. They also
claimed to have invented geometry, astronomy, and
arithmetic. Thus much concerning the invention
of philosophy.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>
<p>But the first to use the term, and to call himself
a philosopher or lover of wisdom, was Pythagoras;<note n='a'>This is
confirmed by Clement,
<hi rend='ital'>Strom.</hi> i. 61, who also
repeats (<hi rend='ital'>Strom.</hi> i. 24) the statement that
<foreign lang='greek'>sofisth/s</foreign>=<foreign lang='greek'>sofo/s.</foreign></note>
for, said he, no man is wise, but God alone. Heraclides of Pontus, in his
<hi rend='ital'>De mortua</hi>, makes him say
this at Sicyon in conversation with Leon, who was
the prince of that city or of Phlius. All too quickly
the study was called wisdom and its professor a
sage, to denote his attainment of mental perfection;
while the student who took it up was a philosopher
or lover of wisdom. Sophists was another name for
<pb n='15'/>
the wise men, and not only for philosophers but for
the poets also. And so Cratinus when praising
Homer and Hesiod in his
<hi rend='ital'>Archilochi</hi> gives them the
title of sophist.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
<p>The men who were commonly regarded as sages
were the following: Thales, Solon, Periander,
Cleobulus, Chilon, Bias, Pittacus. To these are
added Anacharsis the Scythian, Myson of Chen,
Pherecydes of Syros, Epimenides the Cretan; and
by some even Pisistratus the tyrant. So much for
the sages or wise men.<note n='a'>Compare Clem. Alex.
<hi
rend='ital'>Strom.</hi> i. 59. His authority
includes another candidate for admission to the Seven,
Acusilaus of Argos, but makes no mention of Pisistratus.</note></p>
<p>But philosophy, the pursuit of wisdom, has had
a twofold origin; it started with Anaximander on
the one hand, with Pythagoras on the other. The
former was a pupil of Thales, Pythagoras was taught
by Pherecydes. The one school was called Ionian,
because Thales, a Milesian and therefore an Ionian,
instructed Anaximander; the other school was called
Italian from Pythagoras, who worked for the most
part in Italy. 
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>
And the one school, that of Ionia,
terminates with Clitomachus and Chrysippus and
Theophrastus, that of Italy with Epicurus. The
succession passes from Thales through Anaximander,
Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Archelaus, to Socrates,
who introduced ethics or moral philosophy; from
Socrates to his pupils the Socratics, and especially
to Plato, the founder of the Old Academy; from
Plato, through Speusippus and Xenocrates, the
succession passes to Polemo, Crantor, and Crates,
Arcesilaus, founder of the Middle Academy, Lacydes,<note n='b'>See iv.
59-61, where Lacydes is made the founder of
the New Academy, although other authorities,
<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
Sext.
Emp.
<hi rend='ital'>Pyrrh. Hyp.</hi> i. 220. say the Third or New
Academy
began with Carneades. But the claim of Lacydes is supported by
<hi rend='ital'>Ind. Acad.</hi> pp. 76. 37
<hi
rend='ital'>sq.</hi> Mekler, and the article
<hi rend='ital'>s.v.</hi> in Suidas, which comes from
Hesychius.</note>
<pb n='17'/>
founder of the New Academy, Carneades, and Clitomachus. This line brings us to Clitomachus.</p>
<p>
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
There is another which ends with Chrysippus,
that is to say by passing from Socrates to Antisthenes,
then to Diogenes the Cynic, Crates of Thebes, Zeno
of Citium, Cleanthes, Chrysippus. And yet again
another ends with Theophrastus; thus from Plato
it passes to Aristotle, and from Aristotle to Theophrastus. 
In this manner the school of Ionia comes
to an end.</p>
<p>In the Italian school the order of succession is as
follows: first Pherecydes, next Pythagoras, next
his son Telauges, then Xenophanes, Parmenides,<note n='a'>This
succession (Pythagoras, Telauges, Xenophanes,
Parmenides) does not exactly agree with what is said in
the lives of Xenophanes and Parmenides, ix. 18, 21, where
Parmenides, not Xenophanes, is made a pupil of the Pythagoreans. 
The arrangement followed in i. 12-15 treats the
Italian school as a true succession, whereas in Book IX.
many of them are regarded as sporadic thinkers, according
to the view expressed in viii. 91.</note>
Zeno of Elea, Leucippus, Democritus, who had
many pupils, in particular Nausiphanes [and Naucydes], who were teachers of Epicurus.</p>
<p>
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>
Philosophers may be divided into dogmatists and
sceptics: all those who make assertions about
things assuming that they can be known are
dogmatists; while all who suspend their judgement
on the ground that things are unknowable are
sceptics. Again, some philosophers left writings
behind them, while others wrote nothing at all, as
was the case according to some authorities with
Socrates, Stilpo, Philippus, Menedemus, Pyrrho,
Theodorus, Carneades, Bryson; some add Pythagoras and Aristo of Chios, except that they wrote a
few letters. Others wrote no more than one treatise
each, as Melissus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras. Many
works were written by Zeno, more by Xenophanes,
more by Democritus, more by Aristotle, more by
Epicurus, and still more by Chrysippus.</p>
<pb n='19'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
<p>Some schools took their name from cities, as the
Elians and the Megarians, the Eretrians and the
Cyrenaics; others from localities, as the Academics
and the Stoics; others from incidental circumstances,
as the Peripatetics; others again from derisive nicknames, as the Cynics; others from their temperaments, as the Eudaemonists or Happiness School;
others from a conceit they entertained, as Truthlovers, Refutationists, and Reasoners from Analogy;
others again from their teachers, as Socratics,
Epicureans, and the like; some take the name of
Physicists from their investigation of nature, others
that of Moralists because they discuss morals;
while those who are occupied with verbal jugglery
are styled Dialecticians.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
<p>Philosophy has three parts, physics, ethics, and
dialectic or logic. Physics is the part concerned
with the universe and all that it contains; ethics
that concerned with life and all that has to do with
us; while the processes of reasoning employed
by both form the province of dialectic. Physics
flourished down to the time of Archelaus; ethics,
as we have said, started with Socrates; while
dialectic goes as far back as Zeno of Elea. In ethics
there have been ten schools: the Academic, the
Cyrenaic, the Elian, the Megarian, the Cynic, the
Eretrian, the Dialectic, the Peripatetic, the Stoic,
and the Epicurean.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>
<p>The founders of these schools were: of the Old
Academy, Plato; of the Middle Academy, Arcesilaus;
of the New Academy, Lacydes; of the Cyrenaic,
Aristippus of Cyrene; of the Elian, Phaedo of Elis;
of the Megarian, Euclides of Megara; of the Cynic,
Antisthenes of Athens; of the Eretrian, Menedemus
<pb n='21'/>
of Eretria; of the Dialectical school, Clitomachus of
Carthage; of the Peripatetic, Aristotle of Stagira;
of the Stoic, Zeno of Citium; while the Epicurean
school took its name from Epicurus himself.</p>
<p>Hippobotus in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On Philosophical Sects</hi>
declares that there are nine sects or schools, and
gives them in this order: (1) Megarian, (2) Eretrian,
(3) Cyrenaic, (4) Epicurean, (5) Annicerean,<note n='a'>The separation
of the followers of Anniceris from the
Cyrenaic school was made by the author whom Clement of
Alexandria followed in ii. 130. This author may have been
Antiochus of Ascalon. Strabo x. 837
<hi rend='ital'>s.f.</hi> supports
the
same view:
<foreign lang='greek'>*)anni/keris o( dokw=n e)panorqw=sai th\n *kurhnai+kh\n ai(/resin, kai\ paragagei=n a)nt' au)th=s th\n *)annikerei/an.</foreign></note>,
(6)
Theodorean, (7) Zenonian or Stoic, (8) Old Academic,
(9) Peripatetic. 
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>
He passes over the Cynic, Elian,
and Dialectical schools; for as to the Pyrrhonians,
so indefinite are their conclusions that hardly any
authorities allow them to be a sect; some allow
their claim in certain respects, but not in others.
It would seem, however, that they are a sect, for
we use the term of those who in their attitude to
appearance follow or seem to follow some principle;
and on this ground we should be justified in calling
the Sceptics a sect. But if we are to understand
by "sect" a bias in favour of coherent positive
doctrines, they could no longer be called a sect,<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> the distinction drawn by Sextus Empiricus in
<hi
rend='ital'>Pyrrh.
Hyp.</hi> i. 16, 17. If by rules for conduct dogmas are implied,
then the Pyrrhonians are not a sect,
<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> a
dogmatic school.</note>,
for they have no positive doctrines. So much for
the beginnings of philosophy, its subsequent developments, its various parts, and the number of the
philosophic sects.</p>
<p>
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>
One word more: not long ago an Eclectic school
was introduced by Potamo of Alexandria,<note n='c'>Certainly not the
same as the person mentioned by
Porphyry in his
<hi rend='ital'>Life of Plotinus,</hi> 9, 11, for
Polemo, not
Potamo, is the correct form of the name in that place.
Potamo is said by Suidas (<hi rend='ital'>s.v.</hi>
<foreign lang='greek'>*hota/mwn *)al.</foreign>) to have lived
shortly before and contemporary with Augustus, whence
it follows that Diogenes has taken without alteration a
statement by an earlier writer who might truthfully say
"not long ago" of the reign of Augustus. Suidas, whose
article
<foreign lang='greek'>ai(/resis</foreign> agrees closely with our
text, naturally omits
<foreign lang='greek'>pro\ o)li/gou.</foreign></note>, who
<pb n='23'/>
made a selection from the tenets of all the existing
sects. As he himself states in his
<hi rend='ital'>Elements of
Philosophy,</hi> he takes as criteria of truth (1) that
by which the judgement is formed, namely, the
ruling principle of the soul; (2) the instrument
used, for instance the most accurate perception.
His universal principles are matter and the efficient
cause, quality, and place; for that out of which
and that by which a thing is made, as well as the
quality with which and the place in which it is
made, are principles. The end to which he refers
all actions is life made perfect in all virtue, natural
advantages of body and environment being indispensable to its attainment.</p>
<p>It remains to speak of the philosophers themselves,
and in the first place of Thales.</p>

<hi rend='ital'>Iambics</hi>:</p>
<p>Who first of men the course made plain</p>
<p>Of those small stars we call the Wain,</p>
<p>Whereby Phoenicians sail the main.<note n='b'>Greek mariners steered
by the Great Bear, the Phoenicians
by the Little Bear, as Ovid states,
<hi rend='ital'>Tristia,</hi> iv.

<p>But according to others he wrote nothing but two
treatises, one
<hi rend='ital'>On the Solstice</hi> and one
<hi
rend='ital'>On the Equinox,</hi>
regarding all other matters as incognizable. He
seems by some accounts to have been the first to
study astronomy,<note n='c'>See Sir T. L. Heath,
<hi
rend='ital'>Aristarchus of Samos</hi>, pp. 12-23.</note>, the first to
predict eclipses of the
sun and to fix the solstices; so Eudemus in his
<hi rend='ital'>History of Astronomy.</hi> It was this which gained for
him the admiration of Xenophanes and Herodotus
and the notice of Heraclitus and Democritus.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>
<p>And some, including Choerilus the poet, declare
that he was the first to maintain the immortality
of the soul. He was the first to determine the sun's
course from solstice to solstice, and according to
some the first to declare the size of the sun to be
one seven hundred and twentieth part of the solar
circle, and the size of the moon to be the same
fraction of the lunar circle. He was the first to give
the last day of the month the name of Thirtieth, and
the first, some say, to discuss physical problems.</p>
<p>Aristotle<note n='d'><hi rend='ital'>De anima,</hi> A 2, 405 a

the magnet and from amber, he attributed a soul or
life even to inanimate objects. Pamphila states that,
<pb n='27'/>
having learnt geometry from the Egyptians, he was
the first to inscribe a right-angled triangle in a circle,
whereupon he sacrificed an ox. 
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>
Others tell this tale
of Pythagoras, amongst them Apollodorus the arithmetician. (It was Pythagoras who developed to
their furthest extent the discoveries attributed by
Callimachus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Iambics</hi> to Euphorbus the
Phrygian, I mean "scalene triangles" and whatever
else has to do with theoretical geometry.<note n='a'><hi

<foreign lang='greek'>grammai/,</foreign> which of

<p>Thales is also credited with having given excellent
advice on political matters. For instance, when
Croesus sent to Miletus offering terms of alliance,
he frustrated the plan; and this proved the salvation
of the city when Cyrus obtained the victory. Heraclides makes Thales himself<note n='b'>Namely, in a dialogue.
<hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> viii. 4.</note> say that he had always
lived in solitude as a private individual and kept
aloof from State affairs. 
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>
Some authorities say that
he married and had a son Cybisthus; others that
he remained unmarried and adopted his sister's son,
and that when he was asked why he had no children
of his own he replied "because he loved children."
The story is told that, when his mother tried to
force him to marry, he replied it was too soon, and
when she pressed him again later in life, he replied
that it was too late. Hieronymus of Rhodes in the
second book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Scattered Notes</hi> relates that,
in
order to show how easy it is to grow rich, Thales,
foreseeing that it would be a good season for olives,
rented all the oil-mills and thus amassed a fortune.<note

what he pleased. See Aristotle's version of the story,

His doctrine was that water is the universal
primary substance, and that the world is animate
and full of divinities. He is said to have discovered
<pb n='29'/>
the seasons of the year and divided it into 365
days.</p>
<p>He had no instructor, except that he went to
Egypt and spent some time with the priests there.
Hieronymus informs us that he measured the height
of the pyramids by the shadow they cast, taking the
observation at the hour when our shadow is of the
same length as ourselves. He lived, as Minyas
relates, with Thrasybulus, the tyrant of Miletus.</p>
<p>The well-known story of the tripod found by the
fishermen and sent by the people of Miletus to all
the Wise Men in succession runs as follows. 
<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>
Certain
Ionian youths having purchased of the Milesian
fishermen their catch of fish, a dispute arose over
the tripod which had formed part of the catch.
Finally the Milesians referred the question to
Delphi, and the god gave an oracle in this form<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> vi. 51.</note>:</p>
<p>Who shall possess the tripod? Thus replies</p>
<p>Apollo: "Whosoever is most wise."<note n='b'>Or in prose: "Offspring
of Miletus, do you ask Phoebus
concerning the tripod? Whoso in wisdom is of all the first,
to him the tripod I adjudge."</note></p>
<p>Accordingly they give it to Thales, and he to
another, and so on till it comes to Solon, who, with
the remark that the god was the most wise, sent it
off to Delphi. Callimachus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Iambics</hi> has a
different version of the story, which he took from
Maeandrius of Miletus.<note n='c'>Although disguised as Leandrius, the
writer meant is
Maeandrius, who is known (<hi rend='ital'>Inscr. Gr.</hi> no. 2905) to
have
written a local history of Miletus. Such histories,
<hi
rend='ital'>etg.</hi> of
Sicyon, Megara, Samos, Naxos, Argolis, Epirus, Thessaly,
abounded in the Alexandrian age.</note> It is that Bathycles, an
Arcadian, left at his death a bowl with the solemn
injunction that it "should be given to him who
had done most good by his wisdom." So it was
given to Thales, went the round of all the sages,
and came back to Thales again. 
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
And he sent it
<pb n='31'/>
to Apollo at Didyma, with this dedication, according
to Callimachus:</p>
<p>Lord of the folk of Neleus' line,</p>
<p>Thales, of Greeks adjudged most wise,</p>
<p>Brings to thy Didymaean shrine</p>
<p>His offering, a twice-won prize.</p>
<p>But the prose inscription is:</p>
<p>Thales the Milesian, son of Examyas [dedicates this]
to Delphinian Apollo after twice winning the prize from
all the Greeks.</p>
<p>The bowl was carried from place to place by the
son of Bathycles, whose name was Thyrion, so it is
stated by Eleusis in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On Achilles,</hi> and
Alexo
the Myndian in the ninth book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Legends.</hi></p>
<p>But Eudoxus of Cnidos and Euanthes of Miletus
agree that a certain man who was a friend of Croesus
received from the king a golden goblet in order to
bestow it upon the wisest of the Greeks; this man
gave it to Thales, and from him it passed to others
and so to Chilon.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>
<p>Chilon laid the question "Who is a wiser man
than I?" before the Pythian Apollo, and the god
replied "Myson." Of him we shall have more to
say presently. (In the list of the Seven Sages
given by Eudoxus, Myson takes the place of Cleobulus; Plato also includes him by omitting Periander.) The answer of the oracle respecting him
was as follows<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> vi.
40.</note>:</p>
<p>Myson of Chen in Oeta; this is he</p>
<p>Who for wiseheartedness surpasseth thee;</p>
<p>and it was given in reply to a question put by
Anacharsis. Daimachus the Platonist and Clearchus
allege that a bowl was sent by Croesus to Pittacus
and began the round of the Wise Men from him.</p>
<pb n='33'/>
<p>The story told by Andron<note n='a'>Andron of Ephesus (&sect;119) is known
to have written in the life-time (or at least before the death) of
Theopompus,
who is accused of having plagiarized from
<hi rend='ital'>The
Tripod:</hi>
Eusebius,
<hi rend='ital'>Praep. Ev.</hi> x. 3, 7.</note> in his work
on
<hi rend='ital'>The Tripod</hi> is that the Argives offered a tripod as
a prize
of virtue to the wisest of the Greeks; Aristodemus
of Sparta was adjudged the winner but retired in
favour of Chilon. 
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
Aristodemus is mentioned by
Alcaeus thus<note n='b'>Fr. 49 Bergk;
<hi rend='ital'>cf. Schol.</hi>
Pindar,
<hi rend='ital'>Isthm.</hi> ii. 17.</note>:</p>
<p>Surely no witless word was this of the Spartan, I deem,</p>
<p>"Wealth is the worth of a man; and poverty void of
esteem."</p>
<p>Some relate that a vessel with its freight was sent
by Periander to Thrasybulus, tyrant of Miletus,
and that, when it was wrecked in Coan waters, the
tripod was afterwards found by certain fishermen.
However, Phanodicus declares it to have been found
in Athenian waters and thence brought to Athens.
An assembly was held and it was sent to Bias; 
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>
for
what reason shall be explained in the life of Bias.</p>
<p>There is yet another version, that it was the work
of Hephaestus presented by the god to Pelops on
his marriage. Thence it passed to Menelaus and
was carried off by Paris along with Helen and was
thrown by her into the Coan sea, for she said it
would be a cause of strife. In process of time
certain people of Lebedus, having purchased a catch
of fish thereabouts, obtained possession of the tripod,
and, quarrelling with the fishermen about it, put in
to Cos, and, when they could not settle the dispute,
reported the fact to Miletus, their mother-city.
The Milesians, when their embassies were disregarded, made war upon Cos; many fell on both
sides, and an oracle pronounced that the tripod
<pb n='35'/>
should be given to the wisest; both parties to the
dispute agreed upon Thales. After it had gone the
round of the sages, Thales dedicated it to Apollo
of Didyma. 
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
The oracle which the Coans received
was on this wise:</p>
<p>Hephaestus cast the tripod in the sea;</p>
<p>Until it quit the city there will be</p>
<p>No end to strife, until it reach the seer</p>
<p>Whose wisdom makes past, present, future clear.</p>
<p>That of the Milesians beginning "Who shall possess
the tripod?" has been quoted above. So much for
this version of the story.</p>
<p>Hermippus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Lives</hi> refers to Thales the
story
which is told by some of Socrates, namely, that he
used to say there were three blessings for which
he was grateful to Fortune: "first, that I was
born a human being and not one of the brutes;
next, that I was born a man and not a woman;
thirdly, a Greek and not a barbarian." 
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
It is said
that once, when he was taken out of doors by an old
woman in order that he might observe the stars, he
fell into a ditch, and his cry for help drew from the
old woman the retort, "How can you expect to
know all about the heavens, Thales, when you cannot
even see what is just before your feet?" Timon too
knows him as an astronomer, and praises him in the
<hi rend='ital'>Silli</hi> where he says<note n='a'>Fr. 23
Diels.</note>:</p>
<p>Thales among the Seven the sage astronomer.</p>
<p>His writings are said by Lobon of Argos to have
run to some two hundred lines. His statue is said
to bear this inscription<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi>
vii. 83.</note>:</p>
<pb n='37'/>
<p>Pride of Miletus and Ionian lands,</p>
<p>Wisest astronomer, here Thales stands.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
<p>Of songs still sung these verses belong to him:</p>
<p>Many words do not declare an understanding heart.</p>
<p>Seek one sole wisdom.</p>
<p>Choose one sole good.</p>
<p>For thou wilt check the tongues of chatterers prating
without end.</p>
<p>Here too are certain current apophthegms assigned
to him:</p>
<p>Of all things that are, the most ancient is God, for he is
uncreated.</p>
<p>The most beautiful is the universe, for it is God's workmanship.</p>
<p>The greatest is space, for it holds all things.</p>
<p>The swiftest is mind, for it speeds everywhere.</p>
<p>The strongest, necessity, for it masters all.</p>
<p>The wisest, time, for it brings everything to light.</p>
<p>He held there was no difference between life and
death. "Why then," said one, "do you not die?"
"Because," said he, "there is no difference." 
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>
To the question which is older, day or night, he
replied: "Night is the older by one day." Some
one asked him whether a man could hide an evil
deed from the gods: "No," he replied, "nor yet
an evil thought." To the adulterer who inquired if
he should deny the charge upon oath he replied that
perjury was no worse than adultery. Being asked
what is difficult, he replied, "To know oneself."
"What is easy?" "To give advice to another."
"What is most pleasant?" "Success." "What
is the divine?" "That which has neither beginning
nor end." To the question what was the strangest
<pb n='39'/>
thing he had ever seen, his answer was, "An aged
tyrant." "How can one best bear adversity?"
"If he should see his enemies in worse plight."
"How shall we lead the best and most righteous
life?" "By refraining from doing what we blame
in others." 
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>
"What man is happy?" "He who
has a healthy body, a resourceful mind and a docile
nature." He tells us to remember friends, whether
present or absent; not to pride ourselves upon
outward appearance, but to study to be beautiful
in character. "Shun ill-gotten gains," he says.
"Let not idle words prejudice thee against those
who have shared thy confidence." "Whatever
provision thou hast made for thy parents, the same
must thou expect from thy children." He explained
the overflow of the Nile as due to the etesian winds
which, blowing in the contrary direction, drove the
waters upstream.</p>
<p>Apollodorus in his

He died at the age of 78 (or, according to Sosicrates, of

<p>Here in a narrow tomb great Thales lies;</p>

<p>To him belongs the proverb "Know thyself,"
which Antisthenes in his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of
Philosophers</hi>
attributes to Phemono&euml;, though admitting that it
was appropriated by Chilon.</p>
<p>This seems the proper place for a general notice of
the Seven Sages, of whom we have such accounts
as the following. Damon of Cyrene in his
<hi rend='ital'>History
of the Philosophers</hi> carps at all sages, but especially
the Seven. Anaximenes remarks that they all
applied themselves to poetry; Dicaearchus that
they were neither sages nor philosophers, but merely
<pb n='43'/>
shrewd men with a turn for legislation.<note n='a'>The opinion of
Dicaearchus thus expressed is correct.
With the exception of Thales, no one whose life is contained
in Book I. has any claim to be styled a philosopher. The
tradition of the Seven Wise Men and of their meeting at
some court, whether of a native tyrant like Periander
or of a foreign prince like Croesus, was used by Plato
(<hi rend='ital'>Protag.</hi> 343 A) and, largely through his influence,
grew into
a romantic legend, the result being late biographies, collections of apophthegms, and letters attributed to various
authors,
<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the apophthegms of Demetrius of
Phalerum.
Diogenes Laertius swallows all this as true; modern criticism
rejects it all as forgery.</note> Archetimus
of Syracuse describes their meeting at the court of
Cypselus, on which occasion he himself happened to
be present; for which Ephorus substitutes a meeting
without Thales at the court of Croesus. Some make
them meet at the Pan-Ionian festival, at Corinth,
and at Delphi. 
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
Their utterances are variously reported, and are attributed now to one now to the
other, for instance the following<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Plan.</hi> iv. 22.</note>:</p>
<p>Chilon of Lacedaemon's words are true:</p>
<p>Nothing too much; good comes from measure due.</p>
<p>Nor is there any agreement how the number is made
up; for Maeandrius, in place of Cleobulus and Myson,
includes Leophantus, son of Gorgiadas, of Lebedus
or Ephesus, and Epimenides the Cretan in the list;
Plato in his
<hi rend='ital'>Protagoras</hi> admits Myson and leaves
out Periander; Ephorus substitutes Anacharsis
for Myson; others add Pythagoras to the Seven.
Dicaearchus hands down four names fully recognized:
Thales, Bias, Pittacus and Solon; and appends the
names of six others, from whom he selects three:
Aristodemus, Pamphylus, Chilon the Lacedaemonian,
Cleobulus, Anacharsis, Periander. Others add Acusilaus, son of Cabas or Scabras, of Argos. 
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>
Hermippus
in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On the Sages</hi> reckons seventeen, from
which number different people make different selections of seven. They are: Solon, Thales, Pittacus,
Bias, Chilon, Myson, Cleobulus, Periander, Ana-
<pb n='45'/>
charsis, Acusilaus, Epimenides, Leophantus, Pherecydes, Aristodemus, Pythagoras, Lasos, son of
Charmantides or Sisymbrinus, or, according to
Aristoxenus, of Chabrinus, born at Hermione, Anaxagoras. Hippobotus in his
<hi rend='ital'>List of Philosophers</hi>
enumerates: Orpheus, Linus, Solon, Periander,
Anacharsis, Cleobulus, Myson, Thales, Bias, Pittacus,

<p>"I hear that you intend to be the first Ionian to

was a wise decision to make the book common property without taking advice, instead of entrusting it

has no advantages. However, if it would give you
any pleasure, I am quite willing to discuss the subject of your book with you; and if you bid me
come to Syros I will do so. For surely Solon of

<head>Chapter 2. SOLON (archon 594 B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="45">
<p>Solon, the son of Execestides, was born at Salamis.
His first achievement was the
<foreign lang='greek'>seisa/xqeia</foreign> or Law of
Release, which he introduced at Athens; its effect
was to ransom persons and property. For men used
to borrow money on personal security, and many
were forced from poverty to become serfs or daylabourers. He then first renounced his claim to a
debt of seven talents due to his father, and encouraged others to follow his example. This law of
his was called
<foreign lang='greek'>seisa/xqeia,</foreign> and the
reason is obvious.</p>
<p>He next went on to frame the rest of his laws,
which would take time to enumerate, and inscribed
them on the revolving pillars.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>
<p>His greatest service was this: Megara and Athens
laid rival claims to his birthplace Salamis, and after
many defeats the Athenians passed a decree punishing with death any man who should propose a renewal of the Salaminian war. Solon, feigning madness, rushed into the Agora with a garland on his
head; there he had his poem on Salamis read to
<pb n='49'/>
the Athenians by the herald and roused them to
fury. They renewed the war with the Megarians
and, thanks to Solon, were victorious. 
<milestone unit="section" n="47"/>
These were
the lines which did more than anything else to
inflame the Athenians<note n='a'>Fr. 2 Bergk.</note>:</p>
<p>Would I were citizen of some mean isle</p>
<p>Far in the Sporades! For men shall smile</p>
<p>And mock me for Athenian: "Who is this?"</p>
<p>"An Attic slave who gave up Salamis";</p>
<p>and<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Ib.</hi> 3.</note></p>
<p>Then let us fight for Salamis and fair fame,</p>
<p>Win the beloved isle, and purge our shame!</p>
<p>He also persuaded the Athenians to acquire the
Thracian Chersonese. 
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>
And lest it should be thought
that he had acquired Salamis by force only and not
of right, he opened certain graves and showed that
the dead were buried with their faces to the east,
as was the custom of burial among the Athenians;
further, that the tombs themselves faced the east,<note n='c'>If these
words are pressed, they contradict the precise
statement in Plutarch's
<hi rend='ital'>Life of Solon</hi> (c. 10) that
the
Athenians buried their dead to face the setting sun;
<hi
rend='ital'>cf.</hi>
Aelian,
<hi rend='ital'>Var. Hist.</hi> v. 14. The Mycenaean graves
with two
exceptions showed the dead with their heads to the east and
their feet to the west. Sir W. Ridgeway (<hi rend='ital'>Early Age of
Greece,</hi> c. 7) assumes that Plutarch and Aelian are right
and Diogenes either misktaken or inaccurate in his mode of
expression. A view has been put forward that there was no
uniform orientation in early times (see H. J. Rose,
<hi
rend='ital'>Classical
Review,</hi> xxxiv. p. 141
<hi rend='ital'>sq.</hi>).</note>
and that the inscriptions graven upon them named
the deceased by their demes, which is a style peculiar
to Athens. Some authors assert that in Homer's
catalogue of the ships after the line<note n='d'><hi
rend='ital'>Il.</hi> ii. 557.</note>:</p>
<p>Ajax twelve ships from Salamis commands,</p>
<p>Solon inserted one of his own:</p>
<p>And fixed their station next the Athenian bands.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>
<p>Thereafter the people looked up to him, and
<pb n='51'/>
would gladly have had him rule them as tyrant; he
refused, and, early perceiving the designs of his
kinsman Pisistratus (so we are told by Sosicrates),
did his best to hinder them. He rushed into the
Assembly armed with spear and shield, warned them
of the designs of Pisistratus, and not only so, but
declared his willingness to render assistance, in these
words: "Men of Athens, I am wiser than some of
you and more courageous than others: wiser than
those who fail to understand the plot of Pisistratus,
more courageous than those who, though they see
through it, keep silence through fear." And the
members of the council, who were of Pisistratus'
party, declared that he was mad: which made him
say the lines<note n='a'>Fr. 10 Bergk.</note>:</p>
<p>A little while, and the event will show</p>
<p>To all the world if I be mad or no.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="50"/>
<p>That he foresaw the tyranny of Pisistratus is proved
by a passage from a poem of his<note n='b'>Fr. 9 Bergk.</note>:</p>
<p>On splendid lightning thunder follows straight,</p>
<p>Clouds the soft snow and flashing hail-stones bring;</p>
<p>So from proud men comes ruin, and their state</p>
<p>Falls unaware to slavery and a king.</p>
<p>When Pisistratus was already established, Solon,
unable to move the people, piled his arms in front
of the generals' quarters, and exclaimed, "My
country, I have served thee with my word and
sword!" Thereupon he sailed to Egypt and to
Cyprus, and thence proceeded to the court of Croesus.
There Croesus put the question, "Whom do you
consider happy?" and Solon replied, "Tellus of
Athens, and Cleobis and Biton," and went on in
words too familiar to be quoted here.</p>
<pb n='53'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>
<p>There is a story that Croesus in magnificent array
sat himself down on his throne and asked Solon if
he had ever seen anything more beautiful. "Yes,"
was the reply, "cocks and pheasants and peacocks;
for they shine in nature's colours, which are ten
thousand times more beautiful." After leaving that
place he lived in Cilicia and founded a city which he
called Soli after his own name. In it he settled
some few Athenians, who in process of time corrupted
the purity of Attic and were said to "solecize."
Note that the people of this town are called Solenses,
the people of Soli in Cyprus Solii. When he learnt
that Pisistratus was by this time tyrant, he wrote to
the Athenians on this wise<note n='a'>Fr. 11 Bergk.</note>:</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
<p>If ye have suffered sadly through your own wickedness,
lay not the blame for this upon the gods. For it is you
yourselves who gave pledges to your foes and made them
great; this is why you bear the brand of slavery. Every
one of you treadeth in the footsteps of the fox, yet in the
mass ye have little sense. Ye look to the speech and fair
words of a flatterer, paying no regard to any practical
result.</p>
<p>Thus Solon. After he had gone into exile Pisistratus
wrote to him as follows:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'><hi rend='ital'>Pisistratus to Solon</hi></hi></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>
<p>"I am not the only man who has aimed at a tyranny
in Greece, nor am I, a descendant of Codrus, unfitted
for the part. That is, I resume the privileges which
the Athenians swore to confer upon Codrus and his
family, although later they took them away. In
everything else I commit no offence against God or
man; but I leave to the Athenians the management
<pb n='55'/>
of their affairs according to the ordinances established
by you. And they are better governed than they
would be under a democracy; for I allow no one to
extend his rights, and though I am tyrant I arrogate
to myself no undue share of reputation and honour,
but merely such stated privileges as belonged to the
kings in former times. Every citizen pays a tithe
of his property, not to me but to a fund for defraying
the cost of the public sacrifices or any other charges
on the State or the expenditure on any war which
may come upon us.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
<p>"I do not blame you for disclosing my designs;
you acted from loyalty to the city, not through any
enmity to me, and further, in ignorance of the sort
of rule which I was going to establish; since, if you
had known, you would perhaps have tolerated me
and not gone into exile. Wherefore return home,
trusting my word, though it be not sworn, that Solon
will suffer no harm from Pisistratus. For neither
has any other enemy of mine suffered; of that you
may be sure. And if you choose to become one of
my friends, you will rank with the foremost, for I
see no trace of treachery in you, nothing to excite
mistrust; or if you wish to live at Athens on other
terms, you have my permission. But do not on my
account sever yourself from your country.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
<p>So far Pisistratus. To return to Solon: one of his
sayings is that 70 years are the term of man's life.</p>
<p>He seems to have enacted some admirable laws;
for instance, if any man neglects to provide for his
parents, he shall be disfranchised; moreover there
is a similar penalty for the spendthrift who runs
through his patrimony. Again, not to have a settled
<pb n='57'/>
occupation is made a crime for which any one may,
if he pleases, impeach the offender. Lysias, however,
in his speech against Nicias ascribes this law to Draco,
and to Solon another depriving open profligates of
the right to speak in the Assembly. He curtailed
the honours of athletes who took part in the games,
fixing the allowance for an Olympic victor at 500
drachmae, for an Isthmian victor at 100 drachmae,
and proportionately in all other cases. It was in
bad taste, he urged, to increase the rewards of these
victors, and to ignore the exclusive claims of those
who had fallen in battle, whose sons ought, moreover,
to be maintained and educated by the State.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>
<p>The effect of this was that many strove to acquit
themselves as gallant soldiers in battle, like Polyzelus,
Cynegirus, Callimachus and all who fought at Marathon; or again like Harmodius and Aristogiton, and
Miltiades and thousands more. Athletes, on the
other hand, incur heavy costs while in training, do
harm when successful, and are crowned for a victory
over their country rather than over their rivals, and
when they grow old they, in the words of Euripides,<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Autolycus,</hi> Fr. 1, 1. 12 Nauck,

<p><hi rend='center'>Are worn threadbare, cloaks that have lost the

<p>and Solon, perceiving this, treated them with scant
respect.<note n='b'>This censure of athletes recurs Diod. Sic. ix. 2. 3
f. It
was probably a commonplace
<foreign lang='greek'>kefa/laion</foreign> in
some earlier life
of Solon.</note> Excellent, too, is his provision that the
guardian of an orphan should not marry the mother
of his ward, and that the next heir who would succeed
on the death of the orphans should be disqualified
from acting as their guardian. 
<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>
Furthermore, that
no engraver of seals should be allowed to retain an
impression of the ring which he has sold, and that
the penalty for depriving a one-eyed man of his
single eye should be the loss of the offender's two
eyes. A deposit shall not be removed except by the
<pb n='59'/>
depositor himself, on pain of death. That the magistrate found intoxicated should be punished with death.</p>
<p>He has provided that the public recitations of
Homer shall follow in fixed order<note n='a'>Or "in succession," though
this is rather
<foreign lang='greek'>e)c u(podoxh=s.</foreign>
In Plato,
<hi rend='ital'>Hipparchus</hi> 228 B, the same thing is
expressed by
<foreign lang='greek'>e)c u(polh/yews e)fech=s.</foreign></note>: thus the
second
reciter must begin from the place where the first
left off. Hence, as Dieuchidas says in the fifth book
of his
<hi rend='ital'>Megarian History,</hi> Solon did more than
Pisistratus to throw light on Homer. The passage in
Homer more particularly referred to is that beginning "Those who dwelt at Athens ..."<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Iliad</hi> ii. 546.</note></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="58"/>
<p>Solon was the first to call the 30th day of the
month the Old-and-New day, and to institute
meetings of the nine archons for private conference,
as stated by Apollodorus in the second book of his
work
<hi rend='ital'>On Legislators.</hi> When civil strife began, he
did not take sides with those in the city, nor with
the plain, nor yet with-the coast section.</p>
<p>One of his sayings is: Speech is the mirror of
action; and another that the strongest and most
capable is king. He compared laws to spiders' webs,
which stand firm when any light and yielding object
falls upon them, while a larger thing breaks through
them and makes off. Secrecy he called the seal of
speech, and occasion the seal of secrecy. 
<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>
He used
to say that those who had influence with tyrants
were like the pebbles employed in calculations; for,
as each of the pebbles represented now a large and
now a small number, so the tyrants would treat each
one of those about them at one time as great and
famous, at another as of no account. On being asked
why he had not framed any law against parricide,
<pb n='61'/>
he replied that he hoped it was unnecessary. Asked
how crime could most effectually be diminished, he
replied, "If it caused as much resentment in those
who are not its victims as in those who are," adding,
"Wealth breeds satiety, satiety outrage." He required the Athenians to adopt a lunar month. He
prohibited Thespis from performing tragedies on the
ground that fiction was pernicious. 
<milestone unit="section" n="60"/>
When therefore
Pisistratus appeared with self-inflicted wounds, Solon
said, "This comes from acting tragedies." His
counsel to men in general is stated by Apollodorus
in his work on the
<hi rend='ital'>Philosophic Sects</hi> as follows:
Put
more trust in nobility of character than in an oath.
Never tell a lie. Pursue worthy aims. Do not be
rash to make friends and, when once they are made,
do not drop them. Learn to obey before you command. In giving advice seek to help, not to please,
your friend. Be led by reason. Shun evil company.
Honour the gods, reverence parents. He is also said
to have criticized the couplet of Mimnermus:</p>
<p>Would that by no disease, no cares opprest,</p>
<p>I in my sixtieth year were laid to rest;</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>
<p>and to have replied thus<note n='a'>Fr. 20 Bergk.</note>:</p>
<p>Oh take a friend's suggestion, blot the line,</p>
<p>Grudge not if my invention better thine;</p>
<p>Surely a wiser wish were thus expressed,</p>
<p>At eighty years let me be laid to rest.</p>
<p>Of the songs sung this is attributed to Solon<note n='b'>Fr. 42
Bergk.</note>:</p>
<p>Watch every man and see whether, hiding hatred in his
<pb n='63'/>
heart, he speaks with friendly countenance, and his tongue
rings with double speech from a dark soul.</p>
<p>He is undoubtedly the author of the laws which
bear his name; of speeches, and of poems in elegiac
metre, namely, counsels addressed to himself, on
Salamis and on the Athenian constitution, five thousand lines in all, not to mention poems in iambic
metre and epodes.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>
<p>His statue has the following inscription<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 86.</note>:</p>
<p>At Salamis, which crushed the Persian might,</p>
<p>Solon the legislator first saw light.</p>
<p>He flourished, according to Sosicrates, about the
46th Olympiad, in the third year of which he was
archon at Athens<note n='b'>594 b.c.</note>; it was then that he
enacted his
laws. He died in Cyprus at the age of eighty. His
last injunctions to his relations were on this wise:
that they should convey his bones to Salamis and,
when they had been reduced to ashes, scatter them
over the soil. Hence Cratinus in his play,
<hi rend='ital'>The
Chirons,</hi> makes him say<note n='c'>Fr. 5 Meineke,
<hi

<p>This is my island home; my dust, men say,</p>

<p>An epigram of my own is also contained in the

<hi rend='ital'>Epigrams in Various Metres</hi> mentioned
above, where I have discoursed of all the illustrious

<p>So light the burden of his laws on men.</p>
<pb n='65'/>
<p>It is said that he was the author of the apophthegm
"Nothing too much,"
<hi rend='ital'>Ne quid nimis.</hi> According to
Dioscurides in his
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia,</hi> when he was
weeping
for the loss of his son, of whom nothing more is
known, and some one said to him, "It is all of no
avail," he replied, "That is why I weep, because it
is of no avail."</p>
<p>The following letters are attributed to Solon:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'><hi rend='ital'>Solon to Periander</hi></hi></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
<p>"You tell me that many are plotting against you.
You must lose no time if you want to get rid of them
all. A conspirator against you might arise from a
quite unexpected quarter, say, one who had fears
for his personal safety or one who disliked your
timorous dread of anything and everything. He
would earn the gratitude of the city who found out
that you had no suspicion. The best course would
be to resign power, and so be quit of the reproach.
But if you must at all hazards remain tyrant, endeavour to make your mercenary force stronger than
the forces of the city. Then you have no one to
fear, and need not banish any one."</p>
<p><hi rend='center'><hi rend='ital'>Solon to Epimenides</hi></hi></p>
<p>"It seems that after all I was not to confer much
benefit on Athenians by my laws, any more than you
by purifying the city. For religion and legislation
are not sufficient in themselves to benefit cities; it
can only be done by those who lead the multitude
in any direction they choose. And so, if things are
going well, religion and legislation are beneficial; if
not, they are of no avail.</p>
<pb n='67'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>
<p>"Nor are my laws nor all my enactments any better;
but the popular leaders did the commonwealth harm
by permitting licence, and could not hinder Pisistratus
from setting up a tyranny. And, when I warned
them, they would not believe me. He found more
credit when he flattered the people than I when I
told them the truth. I laid my arms down before
the generals' quarters and told the people that I
was wiser than those who did not see that Pisistratus
was aiming at tyranny, and more courageous than
those who shrank from resisting him. They, however, denounced Solon as mad. And at last I protested: "My country, I, Solon, am ready to defend
thee by word and deed; but some of my countrymen
think me mad. Wherefore I will go forth out of
their midst as the sole opponent of Pisistratus; and
let them, if they like, become his bodyguard." For
you must know, my friend, that he was beyond
measure ambitious to be tyrant. 
"<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>
He began by being
a popular leader; his next step was to inflict wounds
on himself and appear before the court of the Heliaea,
crying out that these wounds had been inflicted by
his enemies; and he requested them to give him a
guard of 400 young men. And the people without
listening to me granted him the men, who were
armed with clubs. And after that he destroyed the
democracy. It was in vain that I sought to free
the poor amongst the Athenians from their condition
of serfdom, if now they are all the slaves of one
master, Pisistratus."</p>
<p><hi rend='center'><hi rend='ital'>Solon to Pisistratus</hi></hi></p>
<p>"I am sure that I shall suffer no harm at your
hands; for before you became tyrant I was your

friend, and now I have no quarrel with you beyond
that of every Athenian who disapproves of tyranny.
Whether it is better for them to be ruled by one man or
to live under a democracy, each of us must decide for
himself upon his own judgement. 
<milestone unit="section" n="67"/>
You are, I admit,
of all tyrants the best; but I see that it is not well
for me to return to Athens. I gave the Athenians
equality of civil rights; I refused to become tyrant

escape censure if I were now to return and set my
approval on all that you are doing?"</p>

<p>"I admire you for your kindness to me; and, by
Athena, if I had not been anxious before all things
to live in a democracy, I would rather have fixed my
abode in your palace than at Athens, where Pisistratus is setting up a rule of violence. But in truth
to live in a place where all have equal rights is
more to my liking. However, I will come and see

<head>Chapter 3. CHILON (c. 560B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="68">
<p>Chilon, son of Damagetas, was a Lacedaemonian.
He wrote a poem in elegiac metre some 200 lines in
length; and he declared that the excellence of a
man is to divine the future so far as it can be grasped
by reason. When his brother grumbled that he was
not made ephor as Chilon was, the latter replied,
"I know how to submit to injustice and you do not."
He was made ephor in the 55th Olympiad; Pamphila,
however, says the 56th. He first became ephor,
according to Sosicrates, in the archonship of Euthy-
<pb n='71'/>
demus. He first proposed the appointment of ephors
as auxiliaries to the kings, though Satyrus says this
was done by Lycurgus.<note n='a'>There seems to be some confusion in
these extracts.
Possibly Diogenes Laertius found among his materials some
such note as this:
<foreign lang='greek'>*xi/lwn tw=n e(pta\ sofw=n prw=tos e)/foros,</foreign>
and connected it with the date as given by Sosicrates,
namely, the archonship of Euthydemus, meticulously correcting this date from Pamphila. 
But he seems to have mislaken the meaning of
<foreign lang='greek'>prw=tos e)/foros</foreign> and
to have rashly
inferred from it that it was Chilon who introduced the
ephorate.</note></p>
<p>As Herodotus relates in his first Book, when
Hippocrates was sacrificing at Olympia and his
cauldrons boiled of their own accord, it was Chilon
who advised him not to marry, or, if he had a wife,
to divorce her and disown his children. 
<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>
The tale is
also told that he inquired of Aesop what Zeus was
doing and received the answer: "He is humbling
the proud and exalting the humble." Being asked
wherein lies the difference between the educated
and the uneducated, Chilon answered, "In good
hope." What is hard? "To keep a secret, to
employ leisure well, to be able to bear an injury."
These again are some of his precepts: To control
the tongue, especially at a banquet. 
<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
Not to abuse
our neighbours, for if you do, things will be said
about you which you will regret. Do not use threats
to any one; for that is womanish. Be more ready
to visit friends in adversity than in prosperity. Do
not make an extravagant marriage.
<hi rend='ital'>De mortuis nil
nisi bonum.</hi> Honour old age. Consult your own
safety. Prefer a loss to a dishonest gain: the one
brings pain at the moment, the other for all time.
Do not laugh at another's misfortune. When strong,
be merciful, if you would have the respect, not the
fear, of your neighbours. Learn to be a wise master
in your own house. Let not your tongue outrun
your thought. Control anger. Do not hate divina-
<pb n='73'/>
tion. Do not aim at impossibilities. Let no one
see you in a hurry. Gesticulation in speaking should
be avoided as a mark of insanity. Obey the laws.
Be restful.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
<p>Of his songs the most popular is the following:
"By the whetstone gold is tried, giving manifest
proof; and by gold is the mind of good and evil
men brought to the test." He is reported to have
said in his old age that he was not aware of having
ever broken the law throughout his life; but on one
point he was not quite clear. In a suit in which a
friend of his was concerned he himself pronounced
sentence according to the law, but he persuaded his
colleague who was his friend to acquit the accused,
in order at once to maintain the law and yet not to
lose his friend.</p>
<p>He became very famous in Greece by his warning
about the island of Cythera off the Laconian coast.
For, becoming acquainted with the nature of the
island, he exclaimed: "Would it had never been
placed there, or else had been sunk in the depths
of the sea." 
<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>
And this was a wise warning; for
Demaratus, when an exile from Sparta, advised
Xerxes to anchor his fleet off the island; and if
Xerxes had taken the advice Greece would have
been conquered. Later, in the Peloponnesian war,
Nicias reduced the island and placed an Athenian
garrison there, and did the Lacedaemonians much
mischief.</p>
<p>He was a man of few words; hence Aristagoras
of Miletus calls this style of speaking Chilonean. . . .
is of Branchus, founder of the temple at Branchidae.
Chilon was an old man about the 52nd Olympiad,
when Aesop the fabulist was flourishing. According
<pb n='75'/>
to Hermippus, his death took place at Pisa, just
after he had congratulated his son on an Olympic
victory in boxing. It was due to excess of joy
coupled with the weakness of a man stricken in
years. And all present joined in the funeral procession.</p>
<p>I have written an epitaph on him also, which runs
as follows<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii.
88.</note>:</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>
<p>I praise thee, Pollux, for that Chilon's son</p>
<p>By boxing feats the olive chaplet won.</p>
<p>Nor at the father's fate should we repine;</p>
<p>He died of joy; may such a death be mine.</p>
<p>The inscription on his statue runs thus<note n='b'><hi

<p>Here Chilon stands, of Sparta's warrior race,</p>
<p>Who of the Sages Seven holds highest place.</p>

<head>Chapter 4. PITTACUS (c. 600B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="74">
<p>Pittacus was the son of Hyrrhadius and a native
of Mitylene. Duris calls his father a Thracian.
Aided by the brothers of Alcaeus he overthrew
<pb n='77'/>
Melanchrus, tyrant of Lesbos; and in the war
between Mitylene and Athens for the territory of
Achileis he himself had the chief command on the
one side, and Phrynon, who had won an Olympic
victory in the pancratium, commanded the Athenians.
Pittacus agreed to meet him in single combat; with
a net which he concealed beneath his shield he entangled Phrynon, killed him, and recovered the
territory. Subsequently, as Apollodorus states in
his
<hi rend='ital'>Chronology,</hi> Athens and Mitylene referred their
claims to arbitration. Periander heard the appeal
and gave judgement in favour of Athens.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>
<p>At the time, however, the people of Mitylene
honoured Pittacus extravagantly and entrusted him
with the government. He ruled for ten years
and brought the constitution into order, and then
laid down his office. He lived another ten years
after his abdication and received from the people
of Mitylene a grant of land, which he dedicated
as sacred domain; and it bears his name to this
day Sosicrates relates that he cut off a small
portion for himself and pronounced the half to be
more than the whole. Furthermore, he declined
an offer of money made him by Croesus, saying
that he had twice as much as he wanted; for his
brother had died without issue and he had inherited
his estate.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>
<p>Pamphila in the second book of her
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>
narrates that, as his son Tyrraeus sat in a barber's
shop in Cyme, a smith killed him with a blow from
an axe. When the people of Cyme sent the murderer
to Pittacus, he, on learning the story, set him at
liberty and declared that "It is better to pardon
now than to repent later." Heraclitus, however, says
<pb n='79'/>
that it was Alcaeus whom he set at liberty when he
had got him in his power, and that what he said
was: "Mercy is better than vengeance."</p>
<p>Among the laws which he made is one providing
that for any offence committed in a state of intoxication the penalty should be doubled; his object was
to discourage drunkenness, wine being abundant in
the island. One of his sayings is, "It is hard to be
good," which is cited by Simonides in this form:
"Pittacus's maxim, `Truly to become a virtuous man
is hard."' 
<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
Plato also cites him in the
<hi
rend='ital'>Protagoras</hi><note n='a'>345d.</note>:
"Even the gods do not fight against necessity."
Again, "Office shows the man." Once, when asked
what is the best thing, he replied, "To do well
the work in hand." And, when Croesus inquired
what is the best rule, he answered, "The rule of the
shifting wood," by which he meant the law. He
also urged men to win bloodless victories. When
the Phocaean said that we must search for a good
man, Pittacus rejoined, "If you seek too carefully,
you will never find him." He answered various
inquiries thus: "What is agreeable?" "Time."
"Obscure?" "The future." "Trustworthy?"
"The earth." "Untrustworthy?" "The sea."
"It is the part of prudent men," he said, "before
difficulties arise, to provide against their arising;
<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
and of courageous men to deal with them when they
have arisen." Do not announce your plans beforehand; for, if they fail, you will be laughed at. Never
reproach any one with a misfortune, for fear of
Nemesis. Duly restore what has been entrusted to
you. Speak no ill of a friend, nor even of an enemy.
Practise piety. Love temperance. Cherish truth,
fidelity, skill, cleverness, sociability, carefulness.</p>
<pb n='81'/>
<p>Of his songs the most popular is this:</p>
<p>With bow and well-stored quiver</p>
<p>We must march against our foe,</p>
<p>Words of his tongue can no man trust,</p>
<p>For in his heart there is a deceitful thought.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>
<p>He also wrote poems in elegiac metre, some 600
lines, and a prose work
<hi rend='ital'>On Laws</hi> for the use of the
citizens.</p>
<p>He was flourishing about the 42nd Olympiad. He
died in the archonship of Aristomenes, in the third
year of the 52nd Olympiad,<note n='a'>570b.c.</note> having lived more
than
seventy years, to a good old age. The inscription
on his monument runs thus<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi>

<p>Here holy Lesbos, with a mother's woe,</p>
<p>Bewails her Pittacus whom death laid low.</p>
<p>To him belongs the apophthegm, "Know thine opportunity."</p>
<p>There was another Pittacus, a legislator, as is
stated by Favorinus in the first book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>, and by Demetrius in his work on
<hi rend='ital'>Men of the
Same Name.</hi> He was called the Less.</p>
<p>To return to the Sage: the story goes that a
young man took counsel with him about marriage,
and received this answer, as given by Callimachus
in his Epigrams<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii.
89.</note>:</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>
<p>A stranger of Atarneus thus inquired of Pittacus, the son
of Hyrrhadius:</p>
<p>Old sire, two offers of marriage are made to me; the one
bride is in wealth and birth my equal;</p>
<p>The other is my superior. Which is the better? Come now
and advise me which of the two I shall wed.</p>
<pb n='83'/>
<p>So spake he. But Pittacus, raising his staff, an old man's
weapon, said, "See there, yonder boys will tell you the
whole tale."</p>
<p>The boys were whipping their tops to make them go fast
and spinning them in a wide open space.</p>
<p>"Follow in their track," said he. So he approached near,
and the boys were saying, "Keep to your own sphere."</p>
<p>When he heard this, the stranger desisted from aiming at
the lordlier match, assenting to the warning of the boys.</p>

<p>The advice seems to have been prompted by his
situation. For he had married a wife superior in
birth to himself: she was the sister of Draco, the
son of Penthilus, and she treated him with great
haughtiness.</p>
<p>Alcaeus nicknamed him
<foreign lang='greek'>sara/pous</foreign> and

because he had flat feet and dragged them in walking; also "Chilblains," because he had chapped feet,
for which their word was

Braggadocio,
because he was always swaggering; Paunch and
Potbelly, because he was stout; a Diner-in-the-Dark,
because he dispensed with a lamp; and the Sloven,
because he was untidy and dirty. The exercise he
took was grinding corn, as related by Clearchus the
philosopher.</p>
<p>The following short letter is ascribed to him:</p>

<head>Chapter 5. BIAS (c. 570 B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="82">
<p>Bias, the son of Teutames, was born at Priene, and
by Satyrus is placed at the head of the Seven Sages.
Some make him of a wealthy family, but Duris
says he was a labourer living in the house. Phanodicus relates that he ransomed certain Messenian
maidens captured in war and brought them up as his
daughters, gave them dowries, and restored them to
their fathers in Messenia. In course of time, as has
been already related, the bronze tripod with the
inscription "To him that is wise" having been found
at Athens by the fishermen, the maidens according
to Satyrus, or their father according to other
accounts, including that of Phanodicus, came forward into the assembly and, after the recital of their
own adventures, pronounced Bias to be wise. And
thereupon the tripod was dispatched to him; but
Bias, on seeing it, declared that Apollo was wise,
and refused to take the tripod. 
<milestone unit="section" n="83"/>
But others say that
he dedicated it to Heracles in Thebes, since he was
a descendant of the Thebans who had founded a
colony at Priene; and this is the version of Phanodieus.</p>
<p>A story is told that, while Alyattes was besieging
Priene, Bias fattened two mules and drove them into
the camp, and that the king, when he saw them, was
amazed at the good condition of the citizens actually
extending to their beasts of burden. And he decided
<pb n='87'/>
to make terms and sent a messenger. But Bias piled
up heaps of sand with a layer of corn on the top,
and showed them to the man, and finally, on being
informed of this, Alyattes made a treaty of peace
with the people of Priene. Soon afterwards, when
Alyattes sent to invite Bias to his court, he replied,
"Tell Alyattes, from me, to make his diet of onions,"
that is, to weep. 
<milestone unit="section" n="84"/>
It is also stated that he was a
very effective pleader; but he was accustomed to
use his powers of speech to a good end. Hence it
is to this that Demodicus of Leros makes reference
in the line:</p>
<p>If you happen to be prosecuting a suit, plead as they do
at Priene;</p>
<p>and Hipponax thus: "More powerful in pleading
causes than Bias of Priene."<note n='a'>P. 79 Bergk; Strabo xiv. p.
636.</note></p>
<p>This was the manner of his death. He had been
pleading in defence of some client in spite of his
great age. When he had finished speaking, he reclined his head on his grandson's bosom. The opposing counsel made a speech, the judges voted and
gave their verdict in favour of the client of Bias,
who, when the court rose, was found dead in his
grandson's arms. 
<milestone unit="section" n="85"/>
The city gave him a magnificent
funeral and inscribed on his tomb<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> vii. 90.</note>:</p>
<p>Here Bias of Priene lies, whose name</p>
<p>Brought to his home and all Ionia fame.</p>
<p>My own epitaph is<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii.
91.</note>:</p>
<p>Here Bias rests. A quiet death laid low</p>
<p>The aged head which years had strewn with snow.</p>
<p>His pleading done, his friend preserved from harms,</p>
<p>A long sleep took him in his grandson's arms.</p>
<pb n='89'/>
<p>He wrote a poem of 2000 lines on Ionia and the
manner of rendering it prosperous. Of his songs the
most popular is the following:</p>
<p>Find favour with all the citizens . . .
. . . in whatever state you dwell.</p>
<p>For this earns most gratitude;
the headstrong spirit often flashes forth with harmful bane.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="86"/>
<p>The growth of strength in man is nature's work;
but to set forth in speech the interests of one's
country is the gift of soul and reason. Even chance
brings abundance of wealth to many. He also
said that he who could not bear misfortune was
truly unfortunate; that it is a disease of the soul to
be enamoured of things impossible of attainment;
and that we ought not to dwell upon the woes of
others. Being asked what is difficult, he replied,
"Nobly to endure a change for the worse." He
was once on a voyage with some impious men; and,
when a storm was encountered, even they began to
call upon the gods for help. "Peace!" said he,
"lest they hear and become aware that you are here
in the ship." When an impious man asked him to
define piety, he was silent; and when the other
inquired the reason, "I am silent," he replied,
"because you are asking questions about what does
not concern you."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>
<p>Being asked "What is sweet to men," he
answered, "Hope." He said he would rather
decide a dispute between two of his enemies than
between two of his friends; for in the latter case
he would be certain to make one of his friends
his enemy, but in the former case he would make
one of his enemies his friend. Asked what occupation gives a man most pleasure, he replied, "Making
<pb n='91'/>
money." He advised men to measure life as if they
had both a short and a long time to live; to love
their friends as if they would some day hate them,
the majority of mankind being bad. Further, he
gave this advice: Be slow to set about an enterprise, but persevere in it steadfastly when once it is
undertaken. Do not be hasty of speech, for that
is a sign of madness. 
<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>
Cherish wisdom. Admit the
existence of the gods. If a man is unworthy, do not
praise him because of his wealth. Gain your point
by persuasion, not by force. Ascribe your good
actions to the gods. Make wisdom your provision
for the journey from youth to old age; for it is a
more certain support than all other possessions.</p>
<p>Bias is mentioned by Hipponax as stated above,
and Heraclitus, who is hard to please, bestows upon
him especial praise in these words<note n='a'>P. 39 d, 112 b.</note>:
"In Priene
lived Bias, son of Teutames, a man of more consideration than any." And the people of Priene dedicated
a precinct to him, which is called the Teutameum.
His apophthegm is: Most men are bad.</p>

<p>Cleobulus, the son of Euagoras, was born at Lindus,
but according to Duris he was a Carian. Some say
that he traced his descent back to Heracles, that he
was distinguished for strength and beauty, and was
acquainted with Egyptian philosophy. He had a
daughter Cleobuline, who composed riddles in hexameters; she is mentioned by Cratinus, who gives
one of his plays her name, in the plural form
Cleobulinae. He is also said to have rebuilt the
temple of Athena which was founded by Danaus.</p>
<pb n='93'/>
<p>He was the author of songs and riddles, making some

<p>Who, if he trusts his wits, will praise Cleobulus the dweller

<p>Of his songs the most popular are: It is want of
taste that reigns most widely among mortals and
multitude of words; but due season will serve. Set
your mind on something good. Do not become
thoughtless or rude. He said that we ought to give
our daughters to their husbands maidens in years
but women in wisdom; thus signifying that girls
need to be educated as well as boys. Further, that
we should render a service to a friend to bind him
closer to us, and to an enemy in order to make a
friend of him. For we have to guard against the
censure of friends and the intrigues of enemies.
<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>
When anyone leaves his house, let him first inquire
what he means to do; and on his return let him ask
himself what he has effected. Moreover, he advised
men to practise bodily exercise; to be listeners
rather than talkers; to choose instruction rather
than ignorance; to refrain from ill-omened words;
to be friendly to virtue, hostile to vice; to shun
injustice; to counsel the state for the best; not to
be overcome by pleasure; to do nothing by violence;
to educate their children; to put an end to enmity.
Avoid being affectionate to your wife, or quarrelling
with her, in the presence of strangers; for the one
savours of folly, the other of madness. Never correct
a servant over your wine, for you will be thought
to be the worse for wine. Mate with one of your

When
men are being bantered, do not laugh at their expense, or you will incur their hatred. Do not be

<head>Chapter 7. PERIANDER (tyrant 625-585 B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="94">
<p>Periander, the son of Cypselus, was born at Corinth,
of the family of the Heraclidae. His wife was
Lysida, whom he called Melissa. Her father was
Procles, tyrant of Epidaurus, her mother Eristheneia,
daughter of Aristocrates and sister of Aristodemus,
who together reigned over nearly the whole of
Arcadia, as stated by Heraclides of Pontus in his book
<hi rend='ital'>On Government.</hi> By her he had two sons, Cypselus
and Lycophron, the younger a man of intelligence,
the elder weak in mind. 
<milestone unit="section" n="95"/>
However, after some time,
in a fit of anger, he killed his wife by throwing
a footstool at her, or by a kick, when she was pregnant, having been egged on by the slanderous tales
of concubines, whom he afterwards burnt alive.</p>
<p>When the son whose name was Lycophron grieved
<pb n='99'/>
for his mother, he banished him to Corcyra. And
when well advanced in years he sent for his son to
be his successor in the tyranny; but the Corcyraeans
put him to death before he could set sail. Enraged
at this, he dispatched the sons of the Corcyraeans
to Alyattes that he might make eunuchs of them;
but, when the ship touched at Samos, they took
sanctuary in the temple of Hera, and were saved by
the Samians.</p>
<p>Periander lost heart and died at the age of
eighty. Sosicrates' account is that he died fortyone years before Croesus, just before the 49th
Olympiad.<note n='a'>584-580 b.c.</note> Herodotus in his first book
says that
he was a guest-friend of Thrasybulus, tyrant of

von Karystos,</hi> pp. 48 ff.</note> accuses him of incest with
his own mother Crateia, and adds that, when the fact
came to light, he vented his annoyance in indiscriminate severity. Ephorus records his now that,
if he won the victory at Olympia in the chariot-race,
he would set up a golden statue. When the victory
was won, being in sore straits for gold, he despoiled
the women of all the ornaments which he had seen
them wearing at some local festival. He was thus
enabled to send the votive offering.</p>
<p>There is a story that he did not wish the place
where he was buried to be known, and to that end
contrived the following device. He ordered two
young men to go out at night by a certain road
which he pointed out to them; they were to kill
the man they met and bury him. He afterwards
ordered four more to go in pursuit of the two, kill
them and bury them; again, he dispatched a larger
<pb n='101'/>
number in pursuit of the four. Having taken these
measures, he himself encountered the first pair and
was slain. The Corinthians placed the following

<p>To him belongs the maxim: Never do anything
for money; leave gain to trades pursued for gain.
He wrote a didactic poem of 2000 lines. He said
that those tyrants who intend to be safe should make
loyalty their bodyguard, not arms. When some one
asked him why he was tyrant, he replied, "Because it
is as dangerous to retire voluntarily as to be dispossessed." Here are other sayings of his: Rest is
beautiful. Rashness has its perils. Gain is ignoble.
Democracy is better than tyranny. Pleasures are

maintains that the Corinthian Periander was the

<p>His apophthegm is: Practice makes perfect. He

<head>Chapter 8. ANACHARSIS</head>
<div3 type="section" n="101">
<p>Anacharsis the Scythian was the son of Gnurus
and brother of Caduidas, king of Scythia. His mother
was a Greek, and for that reason he spoke both
languages. He wrote on the institutions of the
Greeks and the Scythians, dealing with simplicity of
life and military matters, a poem of 800 lines. So
outspoken was he that he furnished occasion for a
proverb, "To talk like a Scythian."</p>
<p>Sosicrates makes him come to Athens about the
47th Olympiad<note n='a'>591-588 B.C.</note> in the archonship of
Eucrates.
Hermippus relates that on his arrival at the house
of Solon he told one of the servants to announce
that Anacharsis had come and was desirous of seeing
him and, if possible, of becoming his guest. 
<milestone unit="section" n="102"/>
The
<pb n='107'/>
servant delivered his message and was ordered by
Solon to tell him that men as a rule choose their
guests from among their own countrymen. Then
Anacharsis took him up and said that he was now
in his own country and had a right to be entertained
as a guest. And Solon, struck with his ready wit,
admitted him into his house and made him his
greatest friend.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>
<p>After a while Anacharsis returned to Scythia,
where, owing to his enthusiasm for everything Greek,
he was supposed to be subverting the national institutions, and was killed by his brother while they
were out hunting together. When struck by the
arrow he exclaimed, "My reputation carried me
safe through Greece, but the envy it excited at
home has been my ruin." In some accounts it is
said that he was slain while performing Greek rites.</p>
<p>Here is my own epitaph upon him<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> vii. 92.</note>:</p>
<p>Back from his travels Anacharsis came,</p>
<p>To hellenize the Scythians all aglow;</p>
<p>Ere half his sermon could their minds inflame,</p>
<p>A wing&egrave;d arrow laid the preacher low.</p>
<p>It was a saying of his that the vine bore three
kinds of grapes: the first of pleasure, the next of
intoxication, and the third of disgust. He said he
wondered why in Greece experts contend in the
games and non-experts award the prizes. Being
asked how one could avoid becoming a toper, he
answered, "By keeping before your eyes the disgraceful exhibition made by the drunkard." Again,
he expressed surprise that the Greek lawgivers should
impose penalties on wanton outrage, while they
honour athletes for bruising one another. After
<pb n='109'/>
ascertaining that the ship's side was four fingers'
breadth in thickness, he remarked that the passengers
were just so far from death.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>
<p>Oil he called a drug which produced madness,
because the athletes when they anoint themselves
with it are maddened against each other. How is
it, he asked, that the Greeks prohibit falsehood and
yet obviously tell falsehoods in retail trade? Nor
could he understand why at the beginning of their
feasts they drink from small goblets and when they
are "full" from large ones. The inscription on his
statues is: "Bridle speech, gluttony, and sensuality."
Being asked if there were flutes in Scythia, he replied,
"No, nor yet vines." To the question what vessels
were the safest his reply was, "Those which have
been hauled ashore." And he declared the strangest
thing he had seen in Greece to be that they leave
the smoke on the mountains and convey the fuel
into the city.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> in the form of
charcoal.
<hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> A. S. Ferguson in
<hi rend='ital'>Class. Rev.</hi> vol. xxxi. p. 97.</note> When some one
inquired which
were more in number, the living or the dead, he
rejoined, "In which category, then, do you place
those who are on the seas?" When some Athenian
reproached him with being a Scythian, he replied,
"Well, granted that my country is a disgrace to
me, you are a disgrace to your country." 
<milestone unit="section" n="105"/>
To the
question, "What among men is both good and bad?"
his answer was "The tongue." He said it was
better to have one friend of great worth than many
friends worth nothing at all. He defined the market
as a place set apart where men may deceive and
overreach one another. When insulted by a boy
over the wine he said, "If you cannot carry your
liquor when you are young, boy, you will be a water
carrier when you are old."</p>
<pb n='111'/>
<p>According to some he was the inventor of the anchor
and the potter's wheel.</p>
<p>To him is attributed the following letter:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'><hi rend='ital'>Anacharsis to
Croesus</hi></hi></p>
<p>"I have come, O King of the Lydians, to the land

<p>Myson was the son of Strymon, according to
Sosicrates, who quotes Hermippus as his authority,
and a native of Chen, a village in the district of
Oeta or Laconia; and he is reckoned one of the
Seven Sages. They say that his father was a tyrant.
We are told by some one that, when Anacharsis
inquired if there were anyone wiser than himself,
the Pythian priestess gave the response which has
already been quoted in the Life of Thales as her reply
to a question by Chilon<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> vi.

<p>Myson of Chen in Oeta; this is he</p>
<p>Who for wiseheartedness surpasseth thee.</p>
<p>His curiosity aroused, Anacharsis went to the village in
summer time and found him fitting a share to a plough
and said, "Myson, this is not the season for the
plough." "It is just the time to repair it," was the
reply. 
<milestone unit="section" n="107"/>
Others cite the first line of the oracle differently, "Myson of Chen in Etis," and inquire what
<pb n='113'/>
"Myson of Etis" means. Parmenides indeed explains that Etis is a district in Laconia to which
Myson belonged. Sosicrates in his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of
Philosophers</hi> makes him belong to Etis on the father's
side and to Chen on the mother's. Euthyphro, the
son of Heraclides of Pontus, declares that he was a
Cretan, Eteia being a town in Crete. Anaxilaus
makes him an Arcadian.</p>
<p>Myson is mentioned by Hipponax, the words
being<note n='a'>Fr. 45 Bergk.</note>:</p>

At any rate he was seen in Lacedaemon laughing to himself in a lonely spot; and
when some one suddenly appeared and asked him
why he laughed when no one was near, he replied,
"That is just the reason." And Aristoxenus says
that the reason why he remained obscure was that
he belonged to no city but to a village and that an
unimportant one. Hence because he was unknown,
some writers, but not Plato the philosopher, attributed to Pisistratus the tyrant what properly belonged
to Myson. For Plato mentions him in the
<hi

reckoning him as one of the Seven instead of
Periander.</p>
<p>He used to say we should not investigate facts by
the light of arguments, but arguments by the light
of facts; for the facts were not put together to fit
the arguments, but the arguments to fit the facts.</p>

<head>Chapter 10. EPIMENIDES (c. 600 B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="109">
<p>Epimenides, according to Theopompus and many
other writers, was the son of Phaestius; some, however, make him the son of Dosiadas, others of
Agesarchus. He was a native of Cnossos in Crete,
though from wearing his hair long he did not look
like a Cretan. One day he was sent into the country
by his father to look for a stray sheep, and at noon
he turned aside out of the way, and went to sleep
in a cave, where he slept for fifty-seven years. After
this he got up and went in search of the sheep, thinking he had been asleep only a short time. And when
he could not find it, he came to the farm, and found
everything changed and another owner in possession.
Then he went back to the town in utter perplexity;
and there, on entering his own house, he fell in with
people who wanted to know who he was. At length
he found his younger brother, now an old man, and
learnt the truth from him. 
<milestone unit="section" n="110"/>
So he became famous
throughout Greece, and was believed to be a special
favourite of heaven.</p>
<p>Hence, when the Athenians were attacked by
pestilence, and the Pythian priestess bade them
purify the city, they sent a ship commanded by
Nicias, son of Niceratus, to Crete to ask the help of
Epimenides. And he came in the 46th Olympiad,<note n='a'>595-592
b.c.</note>
purified their city, and stopped the pestilence in the
following way. He took sheep, some black and
others white, and brought them to the Areopagus;
and there he let them go whither they pleased,
instructing those who followed them to mark the
spot where each sheep lay down and offer a sacrifice
to the local divinity. And thus, it is said, the plague
was stayed. Hence even to this day altars may be
<pb n='117'/>
found in different parts of Attica with no name
inscribed upon them, which are memorials of this
atonement. According to some writers he declared
the plague to have been caused by the pollution
which Cylon brought on the city and showed them
how to remove it. In consequence two young men,
Cratinus and Ctesibius, were put to death and the
city was delivered from the scourge.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="111"/>
<p>The Athenians voted him a talent in money and
a ship to convey him back to Crete. The money he
declined, but he concluded a treaty of friendship
and alliance between Cnossos and Athens.</p>
<p>So he returned home and soon afterwards died.
According to Phlegon in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On Longevity</hi> he
lived
one hundred and fifty-seven years; according to the
Cretans two hundred and ninety-nine years. Xenophanes of Colophon gives his age as 154, according
to hearsay.</p>
<p>He wrote a poem
<hi rend='ital'>On the Birth of the Curetes and
Corybantes</hi> and a
<hi rend='ital'>Theogony,</hi><note n='a'>These
long poems may have been written by Lobon
himself on the Hesiodic model; or Lobon may merely have

on the building of the Argo and Jason's voyage to
Colchis in 6500 lines. 
<milestone unit="section" n="112"/>
He also compiled prose works
<hi rend='ital'>On Sacrifices and the Cretan Constitution,</hi> also
<hi rend='ital'>On
Minos and Rhadamanthus,</hi> running to about 4000 lines.
At Athens again he founded the temple of the
Eumenides, as Lobon of Argos tells us in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On Poets.</hi> He is stated to have been the first who
purified houses and fields, and the first who founded
temples. Some are found to maintain that he did
not go to sleep but withdrew himself<note n='b'>This is the meaning of

engaged in gathering simples.</p>
<pb n='119'/>
<p>There is extant a letter of his to Solon the lawgiver, containing a scheme of government which
Minos drew up for the Cretans. But Demetrius of
Magnesia, in his work on poets and writers of the
same name, endeavours to discredit the letter on the
ground that it is late and not written in the Cretan
dialect but in Attic, and New Attic too. However, I have found another letter by him which runs
as follows:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'><hi rend='ital'>Epimenides to Solon</hi></hi></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="113"/>
<p>"Courage, my friend. For if Pisistratus had attacked
the Athenians while they were still serfs and before
they had good laws, he would have secured power in
perpetuity by the enslavement of the citizens. But,
as it is, he is reducing to subjection men who are no
cowards, men who with pain and shame remember
Solon's warning and will never endure to be under a
tyrant. But even should Pisistratus himself hold
down the city, I do not expect that his power will
be continued to his children; for it is hard to contrive that men brought up as free men under the
best laws should be slaves. But, instead of going on
your travels, come quietly to Crete to me; for here
you will have no monarch to fear, whereas, if some
of his friends should fall in with you while you are
travelling about, I fear you may come to some harm."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="114"/>
<p>This is the tenor of the letter. But Demetrius reports a story that he received from the Nymphs food
of a special sort and kept it in a cow's hoof; that he
took small doses of this food, which was entirely
absorbed into his system, and he was never seen to
eat. Timaeus mentions him in his second book.
Some writers say that the Cretans sacrifice to him
<pb n='121'/>
as a god; for they say that he had superhuman
foresight. For instance, when he saw Munichia, at
Athens, he said the Athenians did not know how
many evils that place would bring upon them; for,
if they did, they would destroy it even if they had
to do so with their teeth. And this he said so long
before the event. It is also stated that he was the
first to call himself Aeacus; that he foretold to the
Lacedaemonians their defeat by the Arcadians; and
that he claimed that his soul had passed through
many incarnations.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="115"/>
<p>Theopompus relates in his
<hi rend='ital'>Mirabilia</hi> that, as he
was building a temple to the Nymphs, a voice came
from heaven: "Epimenides, not a temple to the
Nymphs but to Zeus," and that he foretold to the
Cretans the defeat of the Lacedaemonians by the
Arcadians, as already stated; and in very truth they
were crushed at Orchomenus.</p>
<p>And he became old in as many days as he had
slept years; for this too is stated by Theopompus.
Myronianus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Parallels</hi> declares that the
Cretans
called him one of the Curetes. The Lacedaemonians
guard his body in their own keeping in obedience to
a certain oracle; this is stated by Sosibius the
Laconian.</p>
<p>There have been two other men named Epimenides,
namely, the genealogist and another who wrote in
Doric Greek about Rhodes.</p>

<p>Pherecydes, the son of Babys, and a native of
Syros according to Alexander in his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of
Philosophers,</hi> was a pupil of Pittacus. Theopompus
<pb n='123'/>
tells us that he was the first who wrote in Greek on
nature and the gods.</p>
<p>Many wonderful stories are told about him. He
was walking along the beach in Samos and saw a
ship running before the wind; he exclaimed that in
no long time she would go down, and, even as he
watched her, down she went. And as he was drinking water which had been drawn up from a well he
predicted that on the third day there would be an
earthquake; which came to pass. And on his way
from Olympia he advised Perilaus, his host in
Messene, to move thence with all belonging to him;
but Perilaus could not be persuaded, and Messene
was afterwards taken.<note n='a'>These stories no doubt come from
Theopompus, whose
work on
<hi rend='ital'>Marvels</hi> is cited in the next
paragraph.</note></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="117"/>
<p>He bade the Lacedaemonians set no store by gold
or silver, as Theopompus says in his
<hi rend='ital'>Mirabilia.</hi> He
told them he had received this command from
Heracles in a dream; and the same night Heracles
enjoined upon the kings to obey Pherecydes. But
some fasten this story upon Pythagoras.</p>
<p>Hermippus relates that on the eve of war between
Ephesus and Magnesia he favoured the cause of the
Ephesians, and inquired of some one passing by where
he came from, and on receiving the reply "From
Ephesus," he said, "Drag me by the legs and place
me in the territory of Magnesia; and take a message
to your countrymen that after their victory they
must bury me there, and that this is the last injunction of Pherecydes." 
<milestone unit="section" n="118"/>
The man gave the message;
a day later the Ephesians attacked and defeated
the Magnesians; they found Pherecydes dead and
buried him on the spot with great honours. Another
<pb n='125'/>
version is that he came to Delphi and hurled himself
down from Mount Corycus. But Aristoxenus in his
work
<hi rend='ital'>On Pythagoras and his School</hi> affirms that he
died a natural death and was buried by Pythagoras
in Delos; another account again is that he died of
a verminous disease, that Pythagoras was also present
and inquired how he was, that he thrust his finger
through the doorway and exclaimed, "My skin tells
its own tale," a phrase subsequently applied by the
grammarians as equivalent to "getting worse,"
although some wrongly understand it to mean "all
is going well." 
<milestone unit="section" n="119"/>
He maintained that the divine name
for "table" is
<foreign lang='greek'>quwro/s</foreign>, or that which
takes care of
offerings.</p>
<p>Andron of Ephesus says that there were two
natives of Syros who bore the name of Pherecydes:
the one was an astronomer, the other was the son
of Babys and a theologian, teacher of Pythagoras.
Eratosthenes, however, says that there was only one
Pherecydes of Syros, the other Pherecydes being an
Athenian and a genealogist.</p>
<p>There is preserved a work by Pherecydes of Syros,
a work which begins thus: "Zeus and Time and
Earth were from all eternity, and Earth was called
<foreign lang='greek'>*gh=</foreign> because Zeus gave her earth
(<foreign lang='greek'>gh=</foreign>) as guerdon
(<foreign lang='greek'>ge/ras</foreign>)." His sun-dial is also
preserved in the island
of Syros.</p>
<p>Duris in the second book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Horae</hi> gives the
inscription on his tomb as follows<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.

<p>With manly worth endowed and modesty,</p>
<p>Though he be dead, his soul lives happily,</p>
<p>If wise Pythagoras indeed saw light</p>
<p>And read the destinies of men aright.</p>
<p>There is also an epigram of my own in the Pherecratean metre<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> iii.
128.</note>:</p>
<p>The famous Pherecydes, to whom Syros gave birth, 
<milestone unit="section" n="121"/>
when
his former beauty was consumed by vermin, gave orders that
he should be taken straight to the Magnesian land in order
that he might give victory to the noble Ephesians. There
was an oracle, which he alone knew, enjoining this; and
there he died among them. It seems then it is a true tale;
if anyone is truly wise, he brings blessings both in his lifetime and when he is no more.</p>
<p>He lived in the 59th Olympiad. He wrote the
following letter:</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="122"/>
<p><hi rend='center'><hi rend='ital'>Pherecydes to
Thales</hi></hi><note n='b'>

This forgery is easily analysed. There is
the tradition
of the malady which proved fatal to Pherecydes (
<hi
rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Porphyry,
<hi rend='ital'>Vit. Pyth.</hi> &sect;55), with
the anecdote of his protruding his finger through the door. There is
also an allusion to
the alleged obscurity of the work on the gods which passed
current as written by him.</note></p>
<p>"May yours be a happy death when your time
comes. Since I received your letter, I have been
attacked by disease. I am infested with vermin and
subject to a violent fever with shivering fits. I have
therefore given instructions to my servants to carry
my writing to you after they have buried me. I
would like you to publish it, provided that you and
<pb n='129'/>
the other sages approve of it, and not otherwise.
For I myself am not yet satisfied with it. The facts
are not absolutely correct, nor do I claim to have
discovered the truth, but merely such things as one
who inquires about the gods picks up. The rest
must be thought out, for mine is all guess-work. As
I was more and more weighed down with my malady,
I did not permit any of the physicians or my friends
to come into the room where I was, but, as they stood
before the door and inquired how I was, I thrust
my finger through the keyhole and showed them
how plague-stricken I was; and I told them to come
to-morrow to bury Pherecydes."</p>
<p>So much for those who are called the Sages, with
whom some writers also class Pisistratus the tyrant.
I must now proceed to the philosophers and start
with the philosophy of Ionia. Its founder was
Thales, and Anaximander was his pupil.</p>

<p>Anaximander, the son of Praxiades, was a native of
Miletus. He laid down as his principle and element
that which is unlimited without defining it as air or
water or anything else. He held that the parts
undergo change, but the whole is unchangeable;
that the earth, which is of spherical shape, lies in
the midst, occupying the place of a centre; that
the moon, shining with borrowed light, derives its
illumination from the sun; further, that the sun is
as large as the earth and consists of the purest fire.<note n='b'>These

<p>His exposition of his doctrines took the form of a

Anaximenes, and was the first who set mind above

matter, for at the beginning of his treatise, which
is composed in attractive and dignified language, he
says, "All things were together; then came Mind
and set them in order." This earned for Anaxagoras
himself the nickname of Nous or Mind, and Timon
in his
<hi rend='ital'>Silli</hi> says of him<note n='a'>Fr. 24

<p>Then, I ween, there is Anaxagoras, a doughty champion,
whom they call Mind, because forsooth his was the mind
which suddenly woke up and fitted closely together all that
had formerly been in a medley of confusion.</p>
<p>He was eminent for wealth and noble birth, and
furthermore for magnanimity, in that he gave up
his patrimony to his relations.

For, when they
accused him of neglecting it, he replied, "Why then
do you not look after it?" And at last he went into
retirement and engaged in physical investigation
without troubling himself about public affairs. When
some one inquired, "Have you no concern in your
native land?" "Gently," he replied, "I am greatly
concerned with my fatherland," and pointed to the
sky.</p>
<p>He is said to have been twenty years old at the invasion of Xerxes and to have lived seventy-two years.

<p>He declared the sun to be a mass of red-hot metal
and to be larger than the Peloponnesus, though
others ascribe this view to Tantalus; he declared
that there were dwellings on the moon, and moreover
<pb n='139'/>
hills and ravines. He took as his principles the
homoeomeries or homogeneous molecules; for just
as gold consists of fine particles which are called
gold-dust, so he held the whole universe to be compounded of minute bodies having parts homogeneous
to themselves. His moving principle was Mind; of
bodies, he said, some, like earth, were heavy, occupying the region below, others, light like fire, held the
region above, while water and air were intermediate
in position. For in this way over the earth, which
is flat, the sea sinks down after the moisture has
been evaporated by the sun. 
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
In the beginning the
stars moved in the sky as in a revolving dome, so
that the celestial pole which is always visible was
vertically overhead; but subsequently the pole took
its inclined position. He held the Milky Way to be
a reflection of the light of stars which are not shone
upon by the sun; comets to be a conjunction of
planets which emit flames; shooting-stars to be a
sort of sparks thrown off by the air. He held that
winds arise when the air is rarefied by the sun's
heat; that thunder is a clashing together of the
clouds, lightning their violent friction; an earthquake a subsidence of air into the earth.</p>
<p>Animals were produced from moisture, heat, and
an earthy substance; later the species were propagated by generation from one another, males from

he sat down wrapped in a sheep-skin cloak as if it
were going to rain; and the rain came. When
some one asked him if the hills at Lampsacus would
ever become sea, he replied, "Yes, it only needs
time." Being asked to what end he had been
born, he replied, "To study sun and moon and
heavens." To one who inquired, "You miss the
society of the Athenians?" his reply was, "Not I,
but they miss mine." When he saw the tomb of
Mausolus, he said, "A costly tomb is an image of
an estate turned into stone."<note n='a'>Anaxagoras, whose death falls

not earlier than 350 b.c. Mausolus ruled over Caria, according to Diodorus, from 377 to 353. The apophthegm is

Anaxagoras was the first to maintain that Homer in his

<p>Of the trial of Anaxagoras different accounts are
given. Sotion in his
<hi rend='ital'>Succession of the
Philosophers</hi>
says that he was indicted by Cleon on a charge of
impiety, because he declared the sun to be a mass
of red-hot metal; that his pupil Pericles defended
him, and he was fined five talents and banished.
Satyrus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Lives</hi> says that the prosecutor was
Thucydides, the opponent of Pericles, and the charge
one of treasonable correspondence with Persia as
well as of impiety; and that sentence of death was
passed on Anaxagoras by default. 
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
When news was
brought him that he was condemned and his sons
were dead, his comment on the sentence was, "Long
ago nature condemned both my judges and myself
to death"; and on his sons, "I knew that my
children were born to die." Some, however, tell
this story of Solon, and others of Xenophon. That
he buried his sons with his own hands is asserted by
Demetrius of Phalerum in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On Old Age.</hi>
Hermippus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Lives</hi> says that he was confined
in
the prison pending his execution; that Pericles
came forward and asked the people whether they
had any fault to find with him in his own public
career; to which they replied that they had not.
"Well," he continued, "I am a pupil of Anaxagoras;
do not then be carried away by slanders and put
him to death. Let me prevail upon you to release
him." So he was released; but he could not brook
the indignity he had suffered and committed suicide.
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>
Hieronymus in the second book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Scattered
Notes</hi> states that Pericles brought him into court so
weak and wasted from illness that he owed his
<pb n='145'/>
acquittal not so much to the merits of his case as to
the sympathy of the judges. So much then on the
subject of his trial.</p>
<p>He was supposed to have borne Democritus a
grudge because he had failed to get into communication with him.<note n='a'>In ix. 34, 35 the statement that Democritus
was hostile
to Anaxagoras and criticized his doctrines is ascribed to
Favorinus, and, as the motive alleged is similar, Favorinus
may also be the source of the statement of ii. 14.</note> At length he
retired to Lampsacus
and there died. And when the magistrates of the
city asked if there was anything he would like done
for him, he replied that he would like them to grant
an annual holiday to the boys in the month in which
he died; and the custom is kept up to this day.
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
So, when he died, the people of Lampsacus gave
him honourable burial and placed over his grave the
following inscription<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii.
94.</note>:</p>
<p>Here Anaxagoras, who in his quest</p>
<p>Of truth scaled heaven itself, is laid to rest.</p>

<p>Pericles from that fate</p>
<p>Rescued his friend too late;</p>
<p>His spirit crushed, by his own hand he dies.</p>
<p>There have been three other men who bore the
name of Anaxagoras [of whom no other writer gives
a complete list]. The first was a rhetorician of the
school of Isocrates; the second a sculptor, mentioned
by Antigonus; the third a grammarian, pupil of

natural philosophy from Ionia to Athens. Archelaus
was the teacher of Socrates. He was called the
physicist inasmuch as with him natural philosophy
came to an end, as soon as Socrates had introduced
ethics. It would seem that Archelaus himself also
treated of ethics, for he has discussed laws and
goodness and justice; Socrates took the subject
from him and, having improved it to the utmost,
was regarded as its inventor. Archelaus laid down
that there were two causes of growth or becoming,
heat and cold; that living things were produced
from slime; and that what is just and what is base
depends not upon nature but upon convention.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
<p>His theory is to this effect. Water is melted by
heat and produces on the one hand earth in so far
as by the action of fire it sinks and coheres, while
on the other hand it generates air in so far as it
overflows on all sides. Hence the earth is confined
by the air, and the air by the circumambient fire.
Living things, he holds, are generated from the
earth when it is heated and throws off slime of the
consistency of milk to serve as a sort of nourishment,
and in this same way the earth produced man. He
was the first who explained the production of sound
as being the concussion of the air, and the formation
of the sea in hollow places as due to its filtering
through the earth. He declared the sun to be the
largest of the heavenly bodies and the universe to
be unlimited.</p>
<p>There have been three other men who bore the
name of Archelaus: the topographer who described
the countries traversed by Alexander; the author
<pb n='149'/>
of a treatise on Natural Curiosities; and lastly a
rhetorician who wrote a handbook on his art.</p>

<p>Socrates was the son of Sophroniscus, a sculptor,

and
belonged to the deme Alopece. It was thought that
he helped Euripides to make his plays; hence

<p>According to some authors he was a pupil of
Anaxagoras, and also of Damon, as Alexander states
in his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers.</hi> When
Anaxagoras
was condemned, he became a pupil of Archelaus the
physicist; Aristoxenus asserts that Archelaus was
very fond of him. Duris makes him out to have
been a slave and to have been employed on stonework, and the draped figures of the Graces on the
Acropolis have by some been attributed to him.
Hence the passage in Timon's
<hi rend='ital'>Silli</hi><note n='e'>Fr.

<pb n='151'/>
<p>From these diverged the sculptor, a prater about laws,
the enchanter of Greece, inventor of subtle arguments, the
sneerer who mocked at fine speeches, half-Attic in his mock
humility.</p>
<p>He was formidable in public speaking, according to
Idomeneus; 
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>
moreover, as Xenophon tells us, the
Thirty forbade him to teach the art of words. And
Aristophanes attacks him in his plays for making the
worse appear the better reason. For Favorinus in
his
<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History</hi> says Socrates and his
pupil
Aeschines were the first to teach rhetoric; and this
is confirmed by Idomeneus in his work on the
Socratic circle.<note n='a'>Possibly the reference is to the same
citation as
in 19 which Diogenes Laertius may have found independently in
two of his authorities. Diogenes himself notices the agreement between Favorinus and Idomeneus of Lampsacus, a
much earlier author, for he was a disciple of Epicurus, whom
he knew from 310 to 270 b.c.</note> Again, he was the first who discoursed on the conduct of life, and the first philosopher
who was tried and put to death. Aristoxenus, the
son of Spintharus, says of him that he made money;
he would at all events invest sums, collect the interest
accruing, and then, when this was expended, put out
the principal again.</p>
<p>Demetrius of Byzantium relates that Crito removed
him from his workshop and educated him, being
struck by his beauty of soul; 
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>
that he discussed moral
questions in the workshops and the market-place,
being convinced that the study of nature is no
concern of ours; and that he claimed that his
inquiries embraced</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>Whatso'er is good or evil in an house<note
n='b'>Hom.
<hi rend='ital'>Od.</hi> iv. 392.</note>;</hi></p>
<p>that frequently, owing to his vehemence in argument, men set upon him with their fists or tore his
hair out; and that for the most part he was despised
and laughed at, yet bore all this ill-usage patiently.
So much so that, when he had been kicked, and
<pb n='153'/>
some one expressed surprise at his taking it so quietly,
Socrates rejoined, "Should I have taken the law of
a donkey, supposing that he had kicked me?"
Thus far Demetrius.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>
<p>Unlike most philosophers, he had no need to
travel, except when required to go on an expedition.
The rest of his life he stayed at home and engaged
all the more keenly in argument with anyone who
would converse with him, his aim being not to alter
his opinion but to get at the truth. They relate that
Euripides gave him the treatise of Heraclitus and
asked his opinion upon it, and that his reply was,
"The part I understand is excellent, and so too is, I
dare say, the part I do not understand; but it needs
a Delian diver to get to the bottom of it."</p>
<p>He took care to exercise his body and kept in
good condition. At all events he served on the
expedition to Amphipolis; and when in the battle
of Delium Xenophon had fallen from his horse, he
stepped in and saved his life. 
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>
For in the general
flight of the Athenians he personally retired at his
ease, quietly turning round from time to time and
ready to defend himself in case he were attacked.
Again, he served at Potidaea, whither he had gone
by sea, as land communications were interrupted by
the war<note n='a'>The reason assigned for an expedition to Potidaea by
sea will not hold. Communications between Athens and
Thrace were, as a rule, made by sea. Moreover, the siege
of Potidaea began in 432 b.c., the year before the outbreak
of the Peloponnesian war. It has been suggested that the
words
<foreign lang='greek'>dia\ qala/tths ... kwlu/ontos</foreign> should
properly follow
<foreign lang='greek'>*)isqmo/n</foreign> eight lines lower down. If any
Athenian wished to
attend the Isthmian games during the early part of the
Peloponnesian war, it was probably safer not to risk the
land journey owing to the bitter hostility of the Megarians.</note>;
and while there he is said to have remained a whole night without changing his position,
and to have won the prize of valour. But he resigned
it to Alcibiades, for whom he cherished the tenderest
affection, according to Aristippus in the fourth book
of his treatise
<hi rend='ital'>On the Luxury of the Ancients.</hi> Ion
of
<pb n='155'/>
Chios relates that in his youth he visited Samos in
the company of Archelaus; and Aristotle that he went
to Delphi; he went also to the Isthmus, according
to Favorinus in the first book of his
<hi
rend='ital'>Memorabilia.</hi></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>
<p>His strength of will and attachment to the democracy are evident from his refusal to yield to Critias
and his colleagues when they ordered him to bring
the wealthy Leon of Salamis before them for execution, and further from the fact that he alone voted
for the acquittal of the ten generals; and again
from the facts that when he had the opportunity to
escape from the prison he declined to do so, and
that he rebuked his friends for weeping over his fate,
and addressed to them his most memorable discourses
in the prison.</p>
<p>He was a man of great independence and dignity
of character. Pamphila in the seventh book of her
<hi rend='ital'>Commentaries</hi> tells how Alcibiades once offered him
a large site on which to build a house; but he
replied, "Suppose, then, I wanted shoes and you
offered me a whole hide to make a pair with, would
it not be ridiculous in me to take it?" 
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>
Often when
he looked at the multitude of wares exposed for sale,
he would say to himself, "How many things I can
do without!" And he would continually recite the
lines:</p>
<p>The purple robe and silver's shine</p>
<p>More fits an actor's need than mine.<note n='a'>Stobaeus,
<hi
rend='ital'>Florilegium</hi>, lvi. 15, attributes these and three
preceding lines to Philemon, the well-known poet of the New
Comedy. If Philemon wrote them, Socrates cannot have
recited them, however well they express his temper.</note></p>
<p>He showed his contempt for Archelaus of Macedon
and Scopas of Cranon and Eurylochus of Larissa by
refusing to accept their presents or to go to their
court. He was so orderly in his way of life that on
<pb n='157'/>
several occasions when pestilence broke out in Athens
he was the only man who escaped infection.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>
<p>Aristotle says that he married two wives: his first
wife was Xanthippe, by whom he had a son, Lamprocles; his second wife was Myrto, the daughter of
Aristides the Just, whom he took without a dowry.
By her he had Sophroniscus and Menexenus. Others
make Myrto his first wife; while some writers,
including Satyrus and Hieronymus of Rhodes, affirm
that they were both his wives at the same time.
For they say that the Athenians were short of men
and, wishing to increase the population, passed a
decree permitting a citizen to marry one Athenian
woman and have children by another; and that
Socrates accordingly did so.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>
<p>He could afford to despise those who scoffed at
him. He prided himself on his plain living, and
never asked a fee from anyone. He used to say that
he most enjoyed the food which was least in need
of condiment, and the drink which made him feel
the least hankering for some other drink; and that
he was nearest to the gods in that he had the fewest
wants. This may be seen from the Comic poets,
who in the act of ridiculing him give him high praise.
Thus Aristophanes<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Clouds</hi>,
412-417.</note>:</p>
<p>O man that justly desirest great wisdom, how blessed will be
thy life amongst Athenians and Greeks, retentive of memory
and thinker that thou art, with endurance of toil for thy
character; never art thou weary whether standing or walk-
<pb n='159'/>
ing, never numb with cold, never hungry for breakfast; from
wine and from gross feeding and all other frivolities thou
dost turn away.</p>
<milestone unit="sectio" n="28"/>
<p>Ameipsias too, when he puts him on the stage
wearing a cloak, says<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Sc.</hi> in the
<hi
rend='ital'>Connus</hi>, Meineke,
<hi rend='ital'>C.G.F.</hi> i. 201
sq., ii. 703.</note>:</p>
<p>a. You come to join us, Socrates, worthiest of a small
band and emptiest by far! You are a robust fellow. Where
can we get you a proper coat?</p>
<p>b. Your sorry plight is an insult to the cobblers.</p>
<p>a. And yet, hungry as he is, this man has never stooped
to flatter.</p>
<p>This disdainful, lofty spirit of his is also noticed by
Aristophanes when he says<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Clouds</hi>,
362.</note>:</p>
<p>Because you stalk along the streets, rolling your eyes,
and endure, barefoot, many a hardship, and gaze up at us
[the clouds].</p>
<p>And yet at times he would even put on fine clothes
to suit the occasion, as in Plato's
<hi
rend='ital'>Symposium</hi>,<note n='c'>174 a.</note> where
he is on his way to Agathon's house.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
<p>He showed equal ability in both directions, in
persuading and dissuading men; thus, after conversing with Theaetetus about knowledge, he sent
him away, as Plato says, fired with a divine impulse;
but when Euthyphro had indicted his father for
manslaughter, Socrates, after some conversation with
him upon piety, diverted him from his purpose.
Lysis, again, he turned, by exhortation, into a most
virtuous character. For he had the skill to draw
his arguments from facts. And when his son
<pb n='161'/>
Lamprocles was violently angry with his mother,
Socrates made him feel ashamed of himself, as I
believe Xenophon has told us. When Plato's brother
Glaucon was desirous of entering upon politics,
Socrates dissuaded him, as Xenophon relates, because
of his want of experience; but on the contrary he
encouraged Charmides to take up politics because he
had a gift that way.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Mem.</hi> iii.
7.</note></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>
<p>He roused Iphicrates the general to a martial
spirit by showing him how the fighting cocks of
Midias the barber flapped their wings in defiance of
those of Callias. Glauconides demanded that he
should be acquired for the state as if he were some
pheasant or peacock.</p>
<p>He used to say it was strange that, if you asked
a man how many sheep he had, he could easily tell
you the precise number; whereas he could not name
his friends or say how many he had, so slight was
the value he set upon them. Seeing Euclides keenly
interested in eristic arguments, he said to him:
"You will be able to get on with sophists, Euclides,
but with men not at all." For he thought there
was no use in this sort of hair-splitting, as Plato shows
us in the
<hi rend='ital'>Euthydemus.</hi></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
<p>Again, when Charmides offered him some slaves in
order that he might derive an income from them, he
declined the offer; and according to some he scorned
the beauty of Alcibiades. He would extol leisure as
the best of possessions, according to Xenophon in the
<hi rend='ital'>Symposium.</hi> There is, he said, only one good, that
is, knowledge, and only one evil, that is, ignorance;
wealth and good birth bring their possessor no
dignity, but on the contrary evil. At all events,
when some one told him that Antisthenes' mother
<pb n='163'/>
was a Thracian, he replied, "Nay, did you expect
a man so noble to have been born of two Athenian
parents?" He made Crito ransom Phaedo who,
having been taken prisoner in the war, was kept in
degrading slavery, and so won him for philosophy.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>
<p>Moreover, in his old age he learnt to play the lyre,
declaring that he saw no absurdity in learning a new
accomplishment. As Xenophon relates in the
<hi rend='ital'>Symposium</hi>, it was his regular habit to dance, thinking
that such exercise helped to keep the body in good
condition. He used to say that his supernatural
sign warned him beforehand of the future; that to
make a good start was no trifling advantage, but a
trifle turned the scale; and that he knew nothing
except just the fact of his ignorance. He said that,
when people paid a high price for fruit which had
ripened early, they must despair of seeing the fruit
ripen at the proper season. And, being once asked
in what consisted the virtue of a young man, he
said, "In doing nothing to excess." He held that
geometry should be studied to the point at which a
man is able to measure the land which he acquires
or parts with.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
<p>On hearing the line of Euripides' play
<hi rend='ital'>Auge</hi>
where
the poet says of virtue:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>'Tis best to let her roam at will,<note n='a'>This

<p>he got up and left the theatre. For he said it was
absurd to make a hue and cry about a slave who
could not be found, and to allow virtue to perish in
this way. Some one asked him whether he should
marry or not, and received the reply, "Whichever
you do you will repent it." He used to express his
astonishment that the sculptors of marble statues
<pb n='165'/>
should take pains to make the block of marble into
a perfect likeness of a man, and should take no pains
about themselves lest they should turn out mere
blocks, not men. He recommended to the young
the constant use of the mirror, to the end that handsome men might acquire a corresponding behaviour,
and ugly men conceal their defects by education.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
<p>He had invited some rich men and, when Xanthippe
said she felt ashamed of the dinner, "Never mind,"
said he, "for if they are reasonable they will put up
with it, and if they are good for nothing, we shall
not trouble ourselves about them." He would say
that the rest of the world lived to eat, while he
himself ate to live. Of the mass of men who do
not count he said it was as if some one should object
to a single tetradrachm as counterfeit and at the
same time let a whole heap made up of just such
pieces pass as genuine. Aeschines said to him, "I
am a poor man and have nothing else to give, but
I offer you myself," and Socrates answered, "Nay,
do you not see that you are offering me the greatest
gift of all?" To one who complained that he was
overlooked when the Thirty rose to power, he said,
"You are not sorry for that, are you?" 
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
To one
who said, "You are condemned by the Athenians to
die," he made answer, "So are they, by nature."
But some ascribe this to Anaxagoras. When his
wife said, "You suffer unjustly," he retorted, "Why,
would you have me suffer justly?" He had a dream
that some one said to him<note n='a'>Hom.
<hi rend='ital'>Il.</hi> ix.
363.</note>:</p>
<p>On the third day thou shalt come to the fertile fields of
Phthia;</p>
<p>and he told Aeschines, "On the third day I shall
die."<note n='b'>The proposal that Socrates should escape from prison
was attributed to Aeschines as well as to Crito (see below, 60). The
Homeric citation occurs in Plato's
<hi rend='ital'>Crito</hi>, 44
b.</note> When he was about to drink the hemlock,
<pb n='167'/>
Apollodorus offered him a beautiful garment to
die in: "What," said he, "is my own good
enough to live in but not to die in?" When
he was told that So-and-so spoke ill of him, he
replied, "True, for he has never learnt to speak
well." 
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>
When Antisthenes turned his cloak so that
the tear in it came into view, "I see," said he,
"your vanity through your cloak." To one who
said, "Don't you find so-and-so very offensive?" his
reply was, "No, for it takes two to make a quarrel."
We ought not to object, he used to say, to be subjects for the Comic poets, for if they satirize our
faults they will do us good, and if not they do not
touch us. When Xanthippe first scolded him and
then drenched him with water, his rejoinder was,
"Did I not say that Xanthippe's thunder would end
in rain?" When Alcibiades declared that the scolding of Xanthippe was intolerable, "Nay, I have got

"No," replied Alcibiades, "but they furnish me with eggs and goslings." "And Xanthippe,"
said Socrates, "is the mother of my children." When
she tore his coat off his back in the market-place and
his acquaintances advised him to hit back, "Yes, by
Zeus," said he, "in order that while we are sparring
each of you may join in with `Go it, Socrates!'
`Well done, Xanthippe!' " He said he lived with
a shrew, as horsemen are fond of spirited horses,
"but just as, when they have mastered these, they
can easily cope with the rest, so I in the society of
Xanthippe shall learn to adapt myself to the rest of
the world."</p>
<p>These and the like were his words and deeds, to
<pb n='169'/>
which the Pythian priestess bore testimony when
she gave Chaerephon the famous response:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>Of all men living Socrates most wise.</hi></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>
<p>For this he was most envied; and especially because
he would take to task those who thought highly of
themselves, proving them to be fools, as to be sure
he treated Anytus, according to Plato's
<hi rend='ital'>Meno.</hi><note
n='a'>95 a.</note> For
Anytus could not endure to be ridiculed by Socrates,
and so in the first place stirred up against him Aristophanes and his friends; then afterwards he helped to
persuade Meletus to indict him on a charge of impiety and corrupting the youth.</p>
<p>The indictment was brought by Meletus, and the
speech was delivered by Polyeuctus, according to
Favorinus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History.</hi> The speech
was written by Polycrates the sophist, according to
Hermippus; but some say that it was by Anytus.
Lycon the demagogue had made all the needful
preparations.<note n='b'>The confusion in the last sentence of 38 is
due to the insertion in the wrong place of two extracts, one from
Favorinus and the other from Hermippus. When these are
removed, the parts assigned to the three accusers, Meletus,
Anytus and Lycon, become clear:

<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>
<p>Antisthenes in his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers</hi>,
and
Plato in his
<hi rend='ital'>Apology</hi>, say that there were three
accusers, Anytus, Lycon and Meletus; that Anytus
was roused to anger on behalf of the craftsmen and
politicians, Lycon on behalf of the rhetoricians,
Meletus of the poets, all three of which classes had
felt the lash of Socrates. Favorinus in the first
book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi> declares that the speech
of
Polycrates against Socrates is not authentic; for he
mentions the rebuilding of the walls by Conon, which
<pb n='171'/>
did not take place till six years after the death of
Socrates. And this is the case.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
<p>The affidavit in the case, which is still preserved, says
Favorinus, in the
<hi rend='ital'>Metron</hi>, ran as follows: "This
indictment and affidavit is sworn by Meletus, the son
of Meletus of Pitthos, against Socrates, the son of
Sophroniscus of Alopece: Socrates is guilty of refusing to recognize the gods recognized by the state, and
of introducing other new divinities. He is also guilty
of corrupting the youth. The penalty demanded is
death." The philosopher then, after Lysias had
written a defence for him, read it through and said:
"A fine speech, Lysias; it is not, however, suitable
to me." For it was plainly more forensic than
philosophical. 
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
Lysias said, "If it is a fine speech,
how can it fail to suit you?" "Well," he replied,
"would not fine raiment and fine shoes be just as
unsuitable to me?"</p>
<p>Justus of Tiberias in his book entitled
<hi rend='ital'>The
Wreath</hi>
says that in the course of the trial Plato mounted
the platform and began: "Though I am the
youngest, men of Athens, of all who ever rose to
address you"--whereupon the judges shouted out,
"Get down! Get down!" When therefore he was
condemned by 281 votes more than those given for
acquittal, and when the judges were assessing what
he should suffer or what fine he should pay, he proposed to pay 25 drachmae. Eubulides indeed says
he offered 100. 
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>
When this caused an uproar among
the judges, he said, "Considering my services, I
assess the penalty at maintenance in the Prytaneum
at the public expense."</p>
<p>Sentence of death was passed, with an accession
of eighty fresh votes. He was put in prison, and a
<pb n='173'/>
few days afterwards drank the hemlock, after much
noble discourse which Plato records in the
<hi rend='ital'>Phaedo.</hi>
Further, according to some, he composed a paean
beginning:</p>
<p>All hail, Apollo, Delos' lord!</p>
<p>Hail Artemis, ye noble pair!</p>
<p>Dionysodorus denies that he wrote the paean. He
also composed a fable of Aesop, not very skilfully,
beginning<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> iv.
16.</note>:</p>
<p>"Judge not, ye men of Corinth," Aesop cried,</p>
<p>"Of virtue as the jury-courts decide."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>
<p>So he was taken from among men; and not long
afterwards the Athenians felt such remorse that they
shut up the training grounds and gymnasia. They
banished the other accusers but put Meletus to death;
they honoured Socrates with a bronze statue, the
work of Lysippus, which they placed in the hall
of processions. And no sooner did Anytus visit
Heraclea than the people of that town expelled him
on that very day. Not only in the case of Socrates
but in very many others the Athenians repented in
this way. For they fined Homer (so says Heraclides<note n='b'>Most
probably Heraclides of Pontus. This remarkable
assertion may have occurred in one of his dialogues, and
was perhaps not meant to be taken seriously.</note>)
50 drachmae for a madman, and said Tyrtaeus was
beside himself, and they honoured Astydamas before
Aeschylus and his brother poets with a bronze statue.

of the month of Thargelion, when the Athenians
purify their city, which according to the Delians is
the birthday of Artemis. He died in the first year

seventy. With
this Demetrius of Phalerum agrees; but some say he
was sixty when he died.</p>

and Euripides, who was born in the first year of the
75th Olympiad in the archonship of Calliades.<note n='c'>480-479
b.c.</note></p>
<p>In my opinion Socrates discoursed on physics as
well as on ethics, since he holds some conversations
about providence, even according to Xenophon, who,
however, declares that he only discussed ethics. But
Plato, after mentioning Anaxagoras and certain other
physicists in the
<hi rend='ital'>Apology</hi>,<note n='d'>26 d.</note>
treats for his own part
themes which Socrates disowned, although he puts
everything into the mouth of Socrates.</p>
<p>Aristotle relates that a magician came from Syria
to Athens and, among other evils with which he
threatened Socrates, predicted that he would come
to a violent end.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>
<p>I have written verses about him too, as follows<note n='e'><hi

<p>Drink then, being in Zeus's palace, O Socrates; for truly
did the god pronounce thee wise, being wisdom himself;

<p>He was sharply criticized, according to Aristotle
<pb n='177'/>
in his third book
<hi rend='ital'>On Poetry</hi>, by a certain
Antilochus
of Lemnos, and by Antiphon the soothsayer, just as
Pythagoras was by Cylon of Croton, or as Homer
was assailed in his lifetime by Syagrus, and after his
death by Xenophanes of Colophon. So too Hesiod
was criticized in his lifetime by Cercops, and after
his death by the aforesaid Xenophanes; Pindar by
Amphimenes of Cos; thales by Pherecydes; Bias
by Salarus of Priene; Pittacus by Antimenidas and

after Xenophon I shall take the Socratics proper, and
so pass on to Plato. With Plato the ten schools
begin: he was himself the founder of the First
Academy. This then is the order which I shall
follow.</p>
<p>Of those who bear the name of Socrates there is
one, a historian, who wrote a geographical work
upon Argos; another, a Peripatetic philosopher of
Bithynia; a third, a poet who wrote epigrams;
lastly, Socrates of Cos, who wrote on the names of
the gods.</p>

<head>Chapter 6. XENOPHON (426?-354 B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="48">
<p>Xenophon, the son of Gryllus, was a citizen of
Athens and belonged to the deme Erchia; he was
<pb n='179'/>
a man of rare modesty and extremely handsome.
The story goes that Socrates met him in a narrow
passage, and that he stretched out his stick to bar
the way, while he inquired where every kind of
food was sold. Upon receiving a reply, he put
another question, "And where do men become good
and honourable?" Xenophon was fairly puzzled;
"Then follow me," said Socrates, "and learn." From
that time onward he was a pupil of Socrates. He
was the first to take notes of, and to give to the
world, the conversation of Socrates, under the title
of
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia.</hi> Moreover, he was the first to
write
a history of philosophers.</p>
<p>Aristippus, in the fourth book of his work
<hi rend='ital'>On the
Luxury of the Ancients</hi>, declares that he was enamoured
of Clinias, 
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>
and said in reference to him, "It is
sweeter for me to gaze on Clinias than on all the fair
sights in the world. I would be content to be blind
to everything else if I could but gaze on him alone.
I am vexed with the night and with sleep because
I cannot see Clinias, and most grateful to the day
and the sun for showing him to me."</p>
<p>He gained the friendship of Cyrus in the following
way. He had an intimate friend named Proxenus,
a Boeotian, a pupil of Gorgias of Leontini and a
friend of Cyrus. Proxenus, while living in Sardis at
the court of Cyrus, wrote a letter to Xenophon at
Athens, inviting him to come and seek the friendship
of Cyrus. 
<milestone unit="section" n="50"/>
Xenophon showed this letter to Socrates
and asked his advice, which was that he should go
to Delphi and consult the oracle. Xenophon complied and came into the presence of the god. He
inquired, not
<hi rend='ital'>whether</hi> he should go and seek
service
with Cyrus, but
<hi rend='ital'>in what way</hi> he should do so.
For
<pb n='181'/>
this Socrates blamed him, yet at the same time he
advised him to go. On his arrival at the court
of Cyrus he became as warmly attached to him as
Proxenus himself. We have his own sufficient narrative of all that happened on the expedition and on
the return home. He was, however, at enmity with
Meno of Pharsalus, the mercenary general, throughout the expedition, and, by way of abuse, charges
him with having a favourite older than himself.
Again, he reproaches one Apollonides with having
had his ears bored.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anab.</hi> iii. 1.
26-31.</note></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>
<p>After the expedition and the misfortunes which
overtook it in Pontus and the treacheries of Seuthes,
the king of the Odrysians, he returned to Asia,
having enlisted the troops of Cyrus as mercenaries
in the service of Agesilaus, the Spartan king, to
whom he was devoted beyond measure. About this
time he was banished by the Athenians for siding
with Sparta. When he was in Ephesus and had a
sum of money, he entrusted one half of it to
Megabyzus, the priest of Artemis, to keep until his
return, or if he should never return, to apply to the
erection of a statue in honour of the goddess. But
the other half he sent in votive offerings to Delphi.
Next he came to Greece with Agesilaus, who had
been recalled to carry on the war against Thebes.
And the Lacedaemonians conferred on him a privileged position.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
<p>He then left Agesilaus and made his way to Scillus,
a place in the territory of Elis not far from the city.
According to Demetrius of Magnesia he was accompanied by his wife Philesia, and, in a speech written
for the freedman whom Xenophon prosecuted for
neglect of duty, Dinarchus mentions that his two
<pb n='183'/>
sons Gryllus and Diodorus, the Dioscuri as they
were called, also went with him. Megabyzus having
arrived to attend the festival, Xenophon received
from him the deposit of money and bought and
dedicated to the goddess an estate with a river
running through, which bears the same name
Selinus as the river at Ephesus. And from that
time onward he hunted, entertained his friends,
and worked at his histories without interruption.
Dinarchus, however, asserts that it was the
Lacedaemonians who gave him a house and
land.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>
<p>At the same time we are told that Phylopidas the
Spartan sent to him at Scillus a present of captive
slaves from Dardanus, and that he disposed of them
as he thought fit, and that the Elians marched against
Scillus, and owing to the slowness of the Spartans
captured the place, whereupon his sons retired to
Lepreum with a few of the servants, while Xenophon
himself, who had previously gone to Elis, went next
to Lepreum to join his sons, and then made his
escape with them from Lepreum to Corinth and
took up his abode there. Meanwhile the Athenians
passed a decree to assist Sparta, and Xenophon sent
his sons to Athens to serve in the army in defence
of Sparta. 
<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
According to Diocles in his
<hi rend='ital'>Lives of the
Philosophers</hi>, they had been trained in Sparta itself.
Diodorus came safe out of the battle without
performing any distinguished service, and he had a
son of the same name (Gryllus) as his brother.
Gryllus was posted with the cavalry and, in the battle
which took place about Mantinea, fought stoutly and
fell, as Ephorus relates in his twenty-fifth book,
Cephisodorus being in command of the cavalry
<pb n='185'/>
and Hegesilaus commander-in-chief. In this battle
Epaminondas also fell. On this occasion Xenophon
is said to have been sacrificing, with a chaplet on his
head, which he removed when his son's death was
announced. But afterwards, upon learning that he
had fallen gloriously, he replaced the chaplet on his
head. 
<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
Some say that he did not even shed tears, but
exclaimed, "I knew my son was mortal." Aristotle
mentions that there were innumerable authors of
epitaphs and eulogies upon Gryllus, who wrote, in
part at least, to gratify his father. Hermippus too,
in his
<hi rend='ital'>Life of Theophrastus</hi>, affirms that even
Isocrates wrote an encomium on Gryllus. Timon,
however, jeers at Xenophon in the lines<note n='a'>Fr. 26
D.</note>:</p>
<p>A feeble pair or triad of works, or even a greater number,
such as would come from Xenophon or the might of
Aeschines, that not unpersuasive writer.</p>
<p>Such was his life. He flourished in the fourth
year of the 94th Olympiad,<note n='b'>401-400 b.c.</note> and he took
part in the
expedition of Cyrus in the archonship of Xenaenetus
in the year before the death of Socrates.</p>

<p>He died, according to Ctesiclides<note n='c'>Ctesiclides is known to
us from Athenaeus, who cites his
<hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi>, vi. 272 c, x. 445 d. it may seem rash

the son of
Amyntas, came to the throne of Macedon. He died
at Corinth, as is stated by Demetrius of Magnesia,
obviously at an advanced age. He was a worthy
man in general, particularly fond of horses and
hunting, an able tactician as is clear from his writings,
<pb n='187'/>
pious, fond of sacrificing, and an expert in augury
from the victims; and he made Socrates his exact
model.</p>
<p>He wrote some forty books in all, though the
division into books is not always the same, namely:</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>
<p>The Anabasis, with a preface to each separate
book but not one to the whole work.</p>
<p>Cyropaedia.</p>
<p>Hellenica.</p>
<p>Memorabilia.</p>
<p>Symposium.</p>
<p>Oeconomicus.</p>
<p>On Horsemanship.</p>

<p>A Defence of Socrates.</p>
<p>On Revenues.</p>
<p>Hieron or Of Tyranny.</p>
<p>Agesilaus.</p>
<p>The Constitutions of Athens and Sparta.</p>
<p>Demetrius of Magnesia denies that the last of
these works is by Xenophon. There is a tradition
that he made Thucydides famous by publishing his
history, which was unknown, and which he might
have appropriated to his own use. By the sweetness
of his narrative he earned the name of the Attic
Muse. Hence he and Plato were jealous of each
other, as will be stated in the chapter on Plato.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="58"/>
<p>There is an epigram of mine on him also<note n='a'><hi

<p>Up the steep path to fame toiled Xenophon</p>
<p>In that long march of glorious memories;

<p>How fair was wisdom seen in Socrates!<note n='a'>Or in plain prose:
"Not only for Cyrus's sake did
Xenophon go up to Persia, but because he sought the path
which leads to the abode of Zeus. For, having shown that
the great deeds of Greece are the outcome of his training, he
recalled what a beautiful thing was the wisdom of Socrates."</note></p>
<p>There is another on the circumstances of his death<note n='b'><hi

<p>Albeit the countrymen of Cranaus and Cecrops condemned

<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>
<p>In other authorities I find the statement that he
flourished, along with the other Socratics, in the
89th Olympiad,<note n='c'>This would be 424-420 b.c., a date obviously
absurd as
the

<div3 type="section" n="60">
<p>Aeschines was the son of Charinus the sausagemaker, but others make his father's name Lysanias.
He was a citizen of Athens, industrious from his
birth up. For this reason he never quitted Socrates;
hence Socrates' remark, "Only the sausage-maker's
son knows how to honour me." Idomeneus declared
<pb n='191'/>
that it was Aeschines, not Crito, who advised Socrates
in the prison about making his escape,<note n='a'>Idomeneus, it may be
conjectured, relied on some
Socratic dialogue in which the part assigned by Plato to
Crito was given to Aeschines.</note> but that
Plato put the words into the mouth of Crito because
Aeschines was more attached to Aristippus than to
himself. It was said maliciously--by Menedemus
of Eretria in particular--that most of the dialogues
which Aeschines passed off as his own were really
dialogues of Socrates obtained by him from Xanthippe. Those of them which are said to have no
beginning (<foreign lang='greek'>a)ke/faloi</foreign>) are very slovenly
and show
none of the vigour of Socrates; Pisistratus of Ephesus
even denied that they were written by Aeschines.
<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>
Persaeus indeed attributes the majority of the seven
to Pasiphon of the school of Eretria, who inserted
them among the dialogues of Aeschines. Moreover,
Aeschines made use of the
<hi rend='ital'>Little Cyrus</hi>, the
<hi
rend='ital'>Lesser
Heracles</hi> and the
<hi rend='ital'>Alcibiades</hi> of Antisthenes as
well
as dialogues by other authors. However that may
be, of the writings of Aeschines those stamped with
a Socratic character are seven, namely
<hi rend='ital'>Miltiades</hi>,
which for that reason is somewhat weak; then
<hi rend='ital'>Callias, Axiochus, Aspasia, Alcibiades, Telauges</hi>,
and
<hi rend='ital'>Rhinon.</hi></p>
<p>They say that want drove him to Sicily to the
court of Dionysius, and that Plato took no notice of
him, but he was introduced to Dionysius by Aristippus, and on presenting certain dialogues received
gifts from him. 
<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>
Afterwards on his return to Athens
he did not venture to lecture owing to the popularity
of Plato and Aristippus. But he took fees from
pupils, and subsequently composed forensic speeches
for aggrieved clients. This is the point of Timon's
reference to him as "the might of Aeschines, that
not unconvincing writer." They say that Socrates,
<pb n='193'/>
seeing how he was pinched by poverty, advised him
to borrow from himself by reducing his rations. Aristippus among others had suspicions of the genuineness of his dialogues. At all events, as he was
reading one at Megara, Aristippus rallied him by
asking, "Where did you get that, you thief?"</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
<p>Polycritus of Mende, in the first book of his
<hi
rend='ital'>History
of Dionysius</hi>, says that he lived with the tyrant until
his expulsion from Syracuse, and survived until the
return of Dion, and that with him was Carcinus the
tragic poet. There is also extant an epistle of
Aeschines to Dionysius. That he had received a
good rhetorical training is clear from his defence of
the father of Phaeax the general, and from his
defence of Dion. He is a close imitator of Gorgias
of Leontini. Moreover, Lysias attacked him in a
speech which he entitled "On dishonesty." And
from this too it is clear that he was a rhetorician.
A single disciple of his is mentioned, Aristotle, whose
nickname was "Story."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
<p>Panaetius thinks that, of all the Socratic dialogues, those by Plato, Xenophon, Antisthenes and
Aeschines are genuine; he is in doubt about those
ascribed to Phaedo and Euclides; but he rejects the
others one and all.</p>
<p>There are eight men who have borne the name of
Aeschines: (1) our subject himself; (2) the author of
handbooks of rhetoric; (3) the orator who opposed
Demosthenes; (4) an Arcadian, a pupil of Isocrates;
(5) a Mitylenean whom they used to call the "scourge
of rhetoricians"; (6) a Neapolitan, an Academic
philosopher, a pupil and favourite of Melanthius of
Rhodes; (7) a Milesian who wrote upon politics;

<p>Aristippus was by birth a citizen of Cyrene and,
as Aeschines informs us, was drawn to Athens by
the fame of Socrates. Having come forward as a
lecturer or sophist, as Phanias of Eresus, the Peripatetic, informs us, he was the first of the followers
of Socrates to charge fees and to send money to his
master. And on one occasion the sum of twenty
minae which he had sent was returned to him,
Socrates declaring that the supernatural sign would
not let him take it; the very offer, in fact, annoyed
him. Xenophon was no friend to Aristippus; and
for this reason he has made Socrates direct against
Aristippus the discourse in which he denounces
pleasure.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Mem.</hi> ii. 1.</note> Not but

<p>He was capable of adapting himself to place, time
and person, and of playing his part appropriately
under whatever circumstances. Hence he found
more favour than anybody else with Dionysius,
because he could always turn the situation to good
account. He derived pleasure from what was present,
and did not toil to procure the enjoyment of something not present Hence Diogenes called him the
king's poodle<note n='c'>Or "royal cynic." It is impossible to preserve
the
<hi rend='ital'>double entendre</hi> here, for
<foreign lang='greek'>ku/wn,</foreign> dog, also means "cynic";
in fact the very name of that sect proclaims that they gloried
in their dog-like attributes, especially in snarling and biting.</note>
Timon, too, sneered at him for luxury
in these words<note n='d'>Fr. 27 D.</note>:</p>
<pb n='197'/>
<p>Such was the delicate nature of Aristippus, who groped
after error by touch.<note n='a'>This alludes to his doctrine of
sensation, sometimes called "internal touch." Compare
<hi

<p>He is said to have ordered a partridge to be bought
at a cost of fifty drachmae, and, when someone censured him, he inquired, "Would not you have given
an obol for it?" and, being answered in the affirmative, rejoined, "Fifty drachmae are no more to me."
<milestone unit="section" n="67"/>
And when Dionysius gave him his choice of three
courtesans, he carried off all three, saying, "Paris
paid dearly for giving the preference to one out of
three." And when he had brought them as far as
the porch, he let them go. To such lengths did he
go both in choosing and in disdaining. Hence the
remark of Strato, or by some accounts of Plato,
"You alone are endowed with the gift to flaunt in
robes or go in rags." He bore with Dionysius when
he spat on him, and to one who took him to task he
replied, "If the fishermen let themselves be drenched
with sea-water in order to catch a gudgeon, ought I
not to endure to be wetted with negus in order to
take a blenny?"</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="68"/>
<p>Diogenes, washing the dirt from his vegetables,
saw him passing and jeered at him in these terms,
"If you had learnt to make these your diet, you
would not have paid court to kings," to which his
rejoinder was, "And if you knew how to associate
with men, you would not be washing vegetables."
Being asked what he had gained from philosophy,
he replied, "The ability to feel at ease in any
society." Being reproached for his extravagance,
he said, "If it were wrong to be extravagant, it
would not be in vogue at the festivals of the gods."</p>
<pb n='199'/>
<p>Being once asked what advantage philosophers have,
he replied, "Should all laws be repealed, we shall
go on living as we do now." 
<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>
When Dionysius inquired what was the reason that philosophers go to
rich men's houses, while rich men no longer visit
philosophers, his reply was that "the one know what
they need while the other do not." When he was
reproached by Plato for his extravagance, he inquired, "Do you think Dionysius a good man?"
and the reply being in the affirmative, "And yet,"
said he, "he lives more extravagantly than I do.
So that there is nothing to hinder a man living
extravagantly and well." To the question how the
educated differ from the uneducated, he replied,
"Exactly as horses that have been trained differ
from untrained horses." One day, as he entered
the house of a courtesan, one of the lads with him
blushed, whereupon he remarked, "It is not going
in that is dangerous, but being unable to go out."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
<p>Some one brought him a knotty problem with the
request that he would untie the knot. "Why, you
simpleton," said he, "do you want it untied, seeing
that it causes trouble enough as it is?" "It is
better," he said, "to be a beggar than to be uneducated; the one needs money, the others need to
be humanized." One day that he was reviled, he
tried to slip away; the other pursued him, asking,
"Why do you run away?" "Because," said he,
"as it is your privilege to use foul language, so it is
my privilege not to listen." In answer to one who
remarked that he always saw philosophers at rich
men's doors, he said, "So, too, physicians are in
attendance on those who are sick, but no one for that
reason would prefer being sick to being a physician."</p>
<pb n='201'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
<p>It happened once that he set sail for Corinth and,
being overtaken by a storm, he was in great consternation. Some one said, "We plain men are not
alarmed, and are you philosophers turned cowards?"
To this he replied, "The lives at stake in the two
cases are not comparable." When some one gave
himself airs for his wide learning, this is what he
said: "As those who eat most and take the most
exercise are not better in health than those who
restrict themselves to what they require, so too it is
not wide reading but useful reading that tends to
excellence." An advocate, having pleaded for him
and won the case, thereupon put the question,
"What good did Socrates do you?" "Thus much,"
was the reply, "that what you said of me in your
speech was true."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>
<p>He gave his daughter Arete the very best advice,
training her up to despise excess. He was asked
by some one in what way his son would be the better
for being educated. He replied, "If nothing more
than this, at all events, when in the theatre he
will not sit down like a stone upon stone." When
some one brought his son as a pupil, he asked a fee
of 500 drachmae. The father objected, "For that
sum I can buy a slave." "Then do so," was the
reply, "and you will have two." He said that he
did not take money from his friends for his own
use, but to teach them upon what objects their
money should be spent. When he was reproached
for employing a rhetorician to conduct his case, he
made reply, "Well, if I give a dinner, I hire a cook."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>
<p>Being once compelled by Dionysius to enunciate
some doctrine of philosophy, "It would be ludicrous,"
he said, "that you should learn from me what to
<pb n='203'/>
say, and yet instruct me when to say it." At this,
they say, Dionysius was offended and made him
recline at the end of the table. And Aristippus
said, "You must have wished to confer distinction
on the last place." To some one who boasted of his
diving, "Are you not ashamed," said he, "to brag
of that which a dolphin can do?" Being asked on
one occasion what is the difference between the wise
man and the unwise, "Strip them both," said he,
"and send them among strangers and you will know."
To one who boasted that he could drink a great deal
without getting drunk, his rejoinder was, "And so
can a mule."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>
<p>To one who accused him of living with a courtesan,
he put the question, "Why, is there any difference
between taking a house in which many people have
lived before and taking one in which nobody has
ever lived?" The answer being "No," he continued, "Or again, between sailing in a ship in
which ten thousand persons have sailed before and
in one in which nobody has ever sailed?" "There
is no difference." "Then it makes no difference,"
said he, "whether the woman you live with has
lived with many or with nobody." To the accusation that, although he was a pupil of Socrates, he
took fees, his rejoinder was, "Most certainly I do,
for Socrates, too, when certain people sent him corn
and wine, used to take a little and return all the
rest; and he had the foremost men in Athens for
his stewards, whereas mine is my slave Eutychides."
He enjoyed the favours of La&iuml;s, as Sotion states in
the second book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of
Philosophers.</hi> 
<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>
To
those who censured him his defence was, "I have
Lais, not she me; and it is not abstinence from
<pb n='205'/>
pleasures that is best, but mastery over them without
ever being worsted." to one who reproached him
with extravagance in catering, he replied, "Wouldn't
you have bought this if you could have got it for
three obols?" The answer being in the affirmative,
"Very well, then," said Aristippus, "I am no longer
a lover of pleasure, it is you who are a lover of
money." One day Simus, the steward of Dionysius,
a Phrygian by birth and a rascally fellow, was showing him costly houses with tesselated pavements,
when Aristippus coughed up phlegm and spat in his
face. And on his resenting this he replied, "I could
not find any place more suitable."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>
<p>When Charondas (or, as others say, Phaedo) inquired, "Who is this who reeks with unguents?"
he replied, "It is I, unlucky wight, and the still more
unlucky Persian king. But, as none of the other
animals are at any disadvantage on that account,
consider whether it be not the same with man.
Confound the effeminates who spoil for us the use of
good perfume." Being asked how Socrates died, he
answered, "As I would wish to die myself." Polyxenus the sophist once paid him a visit and, after
having seen ladies present and expensive entertainment, reproached him with it later. After an interval Aristippus asked him, "Can you join us today?" 
<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
On the other accepting the invitation,
Aristippus inquired, "Why, then, did you find fault?
For you appear to blame the cost and not the entertainment." When his servant was carrying money
and found the load too heavy--the story is told by
Bion in his
<hi rend='ital'>Lectures</hi>--Aristippus cried, "Pour away
the greater part, and carry no more than you can
manage." Being once on a voyage, as soon as he
<pb n='207'/>
discovered the vessel to be manned by pirates, he
took out his money and began to count it, and then,
as if by inadvertence, he let the money fall into
the sea, and naturally broke out into lamentation.
Another version of the story attributes to him the
further remark that it was better for the money to
perish on account of Aristippus than for Aristippus
to perish on account of the money. Dionysius once
asked him what he was come for, and he said it was
to impart what he had and obtain what he had not.
<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
But some make his answer to have been, "When I
needed wisdom, I went to Socrates; now that I am
in need of money, I come to you." He used to complain of mankind that in purchasing earthenware
they made trial whether it rang true, but had no
regular standard by which to judge life. Others
attribute this remark to Diogenes. One day Dionysius over the wine commanded everybody to put on
purple and dance. Plato declined, quoting the line<note n='a'>Eur.
<hi
rend='ital'>Bacch.</hi> 836.</note>:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>I could not stoop to put on women's
robes.</hi></p>
<p>Aristippus, however, put on the dress and, as he was
about to dance, was ready with the repartee:</p>
<p>Even amid the Bacchic revelry</p>
<p>True modesty will not be put to shame.<note n='b'><hi

<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>
<p>He made a request to Dionysius on behalf of a
friend and, failing to obtain it, fell down at his feet.
And when some one jeered at him, he made reply,
"It is not I who am to blame, but Dionysius who has
his ears in his feet." He was once staying in Asia
and was taken prisoner by Artaphernes, the satrap.
"Can you be cheerful under these circumstances?"
<pb n='209'/>
some one asked. "Yes, you simpleton," was the
reply, "for when should I be more cheerful than
now that I am about to converse with Artaphernes?"
Those who went through the ordinary curriculum,
but in their studies stopped short at philosophy, he
used to compare to the suitors of Penelope. For
the suitors won Melantho, Polydora and the rest of
the handmaidens, but were anything but successful
in their wooing of the mistress. 
<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>
A similar remark
is ascribed to Ariston. For, he said, when Odysseus
went down into the under-world, he saw nearly all
the dead and made their acquaintance, but he never
set eyes upon their queen herself.</p>
<p>Again, when Aristippus was asked what are the
subjects which handsome boys ought to learn, his
reply was, "Those which will be useful to them when
they are grown up." To the critic who censured
him for leaving Socrates to go to Dionysius, his
rejoinder was, "Yes, but I came to Socrates for
education and to Dionysius for recreation." When
he had made some money by teaching, Socrates
asked him, "Where did you get so much?" to which
he replied, "Where you got so little."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="81"/>
<p>A courtesan having told him that she was with
child by him, he replied, "You are no more sure of
this than if, after running through coarse rushes, you
were to say you had been pricked by one in particular." Someone accused him of exposing his son
as if it was not his offspring  Whereupon he replied,
"Phlegm, too, and vermin we know to be of our
own begetting, but for all that, because they are
useless, we cast them as far from us as possible."
He received a sum of money from Dionysius at the
same time that Plato carried off a book and, when
<pb n='211'/>
he was twitted with this, his reply was,, "Well, I
want money, Plato wants books." Some one asked
him why he let himself be refuted by Dionysius.
"For the same reason," said he, "as the others
refute him."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="82"/>
<p>Dionysius met a request of his for money with the
words, "Nay, but you told me that the wise man
would never be in want." To which he retorted,
"Pay! Pay! and then let us discuss the question;"
and when he was paid, "Now you see, do you not,"
said he, "that I was not found wanting?" Dionysius
having repeated to him the lines:</p>
<p>Whoso betakes him to a prince's court</p>
<p>Becomes his slave, albeit of free birth,<note n='a'>Nauck,
<hi

<p>he retorted:</p>

<hi rend='ital'>s.f.</hi></note></hi></p>
<p>This is stated by Diocles in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On the Lives
of
Philosophers</hi>; other writers refer the anecdotes to
Plato. After getting in a rage with Aeschines, he
presently addressed him thus: "Are we not to make
it up and desist from vapouring, or will you wait for
some one to reconcile us over the wine-bowl?" To
which he replied, "Agreed." 
<milestone unit="section" n="83"/>
"Then remember,"
Aristippus went on, "that, though I am your senior,
I made the first approaches." Thereupon Aeschines
said, "Well done, by Hera, you are quite right; you
are a much better man than I am. For the quarrel
was of my beginning, you make the first move to
friendship." Such are the repartees which are
attributed to him.</p>
<p>There have been four men called Aristippus, (1)
our present subject, (2) the author of a book about
<pb n='213'/>

<p>He laid down as the end the smooth motion resulting in sensation.</p>
<p>Having written his life, let me now proceed to
pass in review the philosophers of the Cyrenaic school
which sprang from him, although some call themselves followers of Hegesias, others followers of
Anniceris, others again of Theodorus.<note n='a'>This sentence is a
sort of preface to the valuable summary of Hedonistic tenets which
occupies 86-99 under four heads, Aristippus (86-93), Hegesias (93-96),
Anniceris (96,
97), and Theodorus (97-99).
<hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> note on i. 19 and
Epiphanius(Diels,
<hi rend='ital'>Dox. Gr.</hi> 591). It seems as if the
sentence
<foreign lang='greek'>te/los de\</foreign>. . .
<foreign lang='greek'>a)nadidome/nhn</foreign> ought to follow, not to precede,
this preface. But before the doctrines comes a list of disciples,
including
Hegesias, Anniceris, and Theodorus, whose divergencies from
Aristippus are noted below. The intrusion of Phaedo and
the Eretrians at this stage is certainly strange: it looks as
if Diogenes Laertius jotted down a direction for his own
future guidance.</note> Not but
what we shall notice further the pupils of Phaedo,
the chief of whom were called the school of Eretria.
<milestone unit="section" n="86"/>
The case stands thus. The disciples of Aristippus
were his daughter Arete, Aethiops of Ptolemais,<note n='b'>If the city
was so named after a Ptolemy, it is impossible that one of its citizens could have been contemporary
with the first Aristippus, the companion of Socrates. Even
if Aristippus II. was the teacher of Aethiops the difficulty is
not removed.</note>
<pb n='217'/>
and Antipater of Cyrene. The pupil of Arete was
Aristippus, who went by the name of mother-taught,
and his pupil was Theodorus, known as the atheist,
subsequently as "god." Antipater's pupil was
Epitimides of Cyrene, his was Paraebates, and he
had as pupils Hegesias, the advocate of suicide, and
Anniceris, who ransomed Plato.</p>
<p>Those then who adhered to the teaching of
Aristippus and were known as Cyrenaics held the
following opinions. They laid down that there are
two states, pleasure and pain, the former a smooth,
the latter a rough motion, and that pleasure does
not differ from pleasure nor is one pleasure more
pleasant than another. T
<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>
he one state is agreeable
and the other repellent to all living things. However, the bodily pleasure which is the end is, according to Panaetius in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On the Sects</hi>, not the
settled pleasure following the removal of pains, or
the sort of freedom from discomfort which Epicurus
accepts and maintains to be the end. They also
hold that there is a difference between "end" and
"happiness." Our end is particular pleasure, whereas
happiness is the sum total of all particular pleasures,
in which are included both past and future pleasures.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>
<p>Particular pleasure is desirable for its own sake,
whereas happiness is desirable not for its own sake
but for the sake of particular pleasures. That
pleasure is the end is proved by the fact that from
our youth up we are instinctively attracted to it,
and, when we obtain it, seek for nothing more,
and shun nothing so much as its opposite, pain.
Pleasure is good even if it proceed from the most
unseemly conduct, as Hippobotus says in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On the Sects.</hi> For even if the action be
irregular,
<pb n='219'/>
still, at any rate, the resultant pleasure is desirable
for its own sake and is good.
<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>
The removal of
pain, however, which is put forward in Epicurus,
seems to them not to be pleasure at all, any more
than the absence of pleasure is pain. For both
pleasure and pain they hold to consist in motion,
whereas absence of pleasure like absence of pain is
not motion, since painlessness is the condition of one
who is, as it were, asleep. They assert that some
people may fail to choose pleasure because their
minds are perverted; not all mental pleasures and
pains, however, are derived from bodily counterparts. For instance, we take disinterested delight
in the prosperity of our country which is as real as
our delight in our own prosperity. Nor again do they
admit that pleasure is derived from the memory or
expectation of good, which was a doctrine of Epicurus.
<milestone unit="section" n="90"/>
For they assert that the movement affecting the mind
is exhausted in course of time. Again they hold
that pleasure is not derived from sight or from
hearing alone. At all events, we listen with pleasure
to imitation of mourning, while the reality causes
pain. They gave the names of absence of pleasure
and absence of pain to the intermediate conditions.
However, they insist that bodily pleasures are far
better than mental pleasures, and bodily pains far
worse than mental pains, and that this is the reason
why offenders are punished with the former. For
they assumed pain to be more repellent, pleasure
more congenial. For these reasons they paid more
attention to the body than to the mind. Hence,
although pleasure is in itself desirable, yet they hold
that the things which are productive of certain
pleasures are often of a painful nature, the very
<pb n='221'/>
opposite of pleasure; so that to accumulate the
pleasures which are productive of happiness appears
to them a most irksome business.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>
<p>They do not accept the doctrine that every wise
man lives pleasantly and every fool painfully, but
regard it as true for the most part only. It is
sufficient even if we enjoy but each single pleasure
as it comes. They say that prudence is a good,
though desirable not in itself but on account of its
consequences; that we make friends from interested
motives, just as we cherish any part of the body so
long as we have it; that some of the virtues are
found even in the foolish; that bodily training contributes to the acquisition of virtue; that the sage
will not give way to envy or love or superstition,
since these weaknesses are due to mere empty
opinion; he will, however, feel pain and fear, these
being natural affections; 
<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>
and that wealth too is
productive of pleasure, though not desirable for its
own sake.</p>
<p>They affirm that mental affections can be known,
but not the objects from which they come; and
they abandoned the study of nature because of its
apparent uncertainty, but fastened on logical inquiries because of their utility. But Meleager in his
second book
<hi rend='ital'>On Philosophical Opinions</hi>, and Clitomachus in his first book
<hi rend='ital'>On the Sects</hi>, affirm that
they
maintain Dialectic as well as Physics to be useless,
since, when one has learnt the theory of good and
evil, it is possible to speak with propriety, to be free
from superstition, and to escape the fear of death.
<milestone unit="section" n="93"/>
They also held that nothing is just or honourable or
base by nature, but only by convention and custom.
Nevertheless the good man will be deterred from
<pb n='223'/>
wrong-doing by the penalties imposed and the prejudices that it would arouse. Further that the wise
man really exists. They allow progress to be attainable in philosophy as well as in other matters. They
maintain that the pain of one man exceeds that of
another, and that the senses are not always true and
trustworthy.</p>
<p>The school of Hegesias, as it is called, adopted the
same ends, namely pleasure and pain. In their view
there is no such thing as gratitude or friendship or
beneficence, because it is not for themselves that we
choose to do these things but simply from motives
of interest, apart from which such conduct is nowhere
found. 
<milestone unit="section" n="94"/>
They denied the possibility of happiness, for
the body is infected with much suffering, while the
soul shares in the sufferings of the body and is a
prey to disturbance, and fortune often disappoints.
From all this it follows that happiness cannot be
realized. Moreover, life and death are each desirable
in turn. But that there is anything naturally
pleasant or unpleasant they deny; when some men
are pleased and others pained by the same objects,
this is owing to the lack or rarity or surfeit of such
objects. Poverty and riches have no relevance to
pleasure; for neither the rich nor the poor as such
have any special share in pleasure. 
<milestone unit="section" n="95"/>
Slavery and
freedom, nobility and low birth, honour and dishonour, are alike indifferent in a calculation of
pleasure. To the fool life is advantageous, while to
the wise it is a matter of indifference. The wise man
will be guided in all he does by his own interests,
for there is none other whom he regards as equally
deserving. For supposing him to reap the greatest
advantages from another, they would not be equal to
<pb n='225'/>
what he contributes himself. They also disallow
the claims of the senses, because they do not lead
to accurate knowledge. Whatever appears rational
should be done. They affirmed that allowance should
be made for errors, for no man errs voluntarily, but
under constraint of some suffering; that we should
not hate men, but rather teach them better. The
wise man will not have so much advantage over
others in the choice of goods as in the avoidance of
evils, making it his end to live without pain of body
or mind. 
<milestone unit="section" n="96"/>
This then, they say, is the advantage
accruing to those who make no distinction between
any of the objects which produce pleasure.</p>
<p>The school of Anniceris in other respects agreed
with them, but admitted that friendship and gratitude and respect for parents do exist in real life, and
that a good man will sometimes act out of patriotic
motives. Hence, if the wise man receive annoyance,
he will be none the less happy even if few pleasures
accrue to him. The happiness of a friend is not in
itself desirable, for it is not felt by his neighbour.
Instruction is not sufficient in itself to inspire us
with confidence and to make us rise superior to the
opinion of the multitude. Habits must be formed
because of the bad disposition which has grown up
in us from the first. 
<milestone unit="section" n="97"/>
A friend should be cherished
not merely for his utility--for, if that fails, we should
then no longer associate with him--but for the good
feeling for the sake of which we shall even endure
hardships. Nay, though we make pleasure the end
and are annoyed when deprived of it, we shall
nevertheless cheerfully endure this because of our
love to our friend.</p>
<p>The Theodoreans derived their name from Theo-
<pb n='227'/>
dorus, who has already been mentioned, and adopted
his doctrines. Theodorus was a man who utterly
rejected the current belief in the gods. And I have
come across a book of his entitled
<hi rend='ital'>Of the Gods</hi>
which
is not contemptible. From that book, they say,
Epicurus borrowed most of what he wrote on the
subject.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="98"/>
<p>Theodorus was also a pupil of Anniceris and of
Dionysius the dialectician, as Antisthenes mentions
in his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers.</hi> He considered
joy
and grief to be the supreme good and evil, the one
brought about by wisdom, the other by folly. Wisdom and justice he called goods, and their opposites
evils, pleasure and pain being intermediate to good
and evil. Friendship he rejected because it did not
exist between the unwise nor between the wise;
with the former, when the want is removed, the
friendship disappears, whereas the wise are selfsufficient and have no need of friends. It was
reasonable, as he thought, for the good man not to
risk his life in the defence of his country, for he would
never throw wisdom away to benefit the unwise.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="99"/>
<p>He said the world was his country. Theft, adultery,
and sacrilege would be allowable upon occasion, since
none of these acts is by nature base, if once you
have removed the prejudice against them, which is
kept up in order to hold the foolish multitude
together. The wise man would indulge his passions
openly without the least regard to circumstances.
Hence he would use such arguments as this. "Is
a woman who is skilled in grammar useful in so far
as she is skilled in grammar?" "Yes." "And is
a boy or a youth skilled in grammar useful in so far
as he is skilled in grammar?" "Yes." 
<milestone unit="section" n="100"/>
"Again,
<pb n='229'/>
is a woman who is beautiful useful in so far as she
is beautiful? And the use of beauty is to be enjoyed?" "Yes." When this was admitted, he
would press the argument to the conclusion, namely,
that he who uses anything for the purpose for which
it is useful does no wrong. And by some such
interrogatories he would carry his point.</p>
<p>He appears to have been called
<foreign lang='greek'>qeo/s</foreign>
(god) in
consequence of the following argument addressed to
him by Stilpo. "Are you, Theodorus, what you
declare yourself to be?" To this he assented, and
Stilpo continued, "And do you say you are god?"
To this he agreed. "Then it follows that you are
god." Theodorus accepted this, and Stilpo said with
a smile, "But, you rascal, at this rate you would
allow yourself to be a jackdaw and ten thousand
other things."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="101"/>
<p>However, Theodorus, sitting on one occasion beside
Euryclides, the hierophant, began, "Tell me,
Euryclides, who they are who violate the mysteries?"
Euryclides replied, "Those who disclose them to the
uninitiated." "Then you violate them," said Theodorus, "when you explain them to the uninitiated."
Yet he would hardly have escaped from being brought
before the Areopagus if Demetrius of Phalerum had
not rescued him. And Amphicrates in his book
<hi rend='ital'>Upon
Illustrious Men</hi> says he was condemned to drink the
hemlock.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="102"/>
<p>For a while he stayed at the court of Ptolemy
the son of Lagus, and was once sent by him as
ambassador to Lysimachus. And on this occasion
his language was so bold that Lysimachus said, "Tell
me, are you not the Theodorus who was banished
from Athens?" To which he replied, "Your in-
<pb n='231'/>
formation is correct, for, when Athens could not bear
me any more than Semele could Dionysus, she cast
me out." And upon Lysimachus adding, "Take
care you do not come here again," "I never will,"
said he, "unless Ptolemy sends me." Mithras, the
king's minister, standing by and saying, "It seems
that you can ignore not only gods but kings as well,"
Theodorus replied, "How can you say that I ignore
the gods when I regard you as hateful to the gods?"
He is said on one occasion in Corinth to have walked
abroad with a numerous train of pupils, and Metrocles
the Cynic, who was washing chervil, remarked, "You,
sophist that you are, would not have wanted all
these pupils if you had washed vegetables." Thereupon Theodorus retorted, "And you, if you had
known how to associate with men, would have had no
use for these vegetables." 
<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>
A similar anecdote is told
of Diogenes and Aristippus, as mentioned above.<note n='a'>See
&sect;68.</note></p>
<p>Such was the character of Theodorus and his
surroundings. At last he retired to Cyrene, where
he lived with Magas and continued to be held in
high honour. The first time that he was expelled
from Cyrene he is credited with a witty remark:
"Many thanks,<note n='b'>Or, if

<p>Some twenty persons have borne the name of
Theodorus: (1) a Samian, the son of Rhoecus. He
it was who advised laying charcoal embers under the

<head>Chapter 9. PHAEDO</head>
<div3 type="section" n="105">
<p>Phaedo was a native of Elis, of noble family, who
on the fall of that city was taken captive and forcibly
consigned to a house of ill-fame. But he would
close the door and so contrive to join Socrates'
circle, and in the end Socrates induced Alcibiades
or Crito with their friends to ransom him; from that
time onwards he studied philosophy as became a
free man. Hieronymus in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On Suspense of
Judgement</hi> attacks him and calls him a slave. Of the
dialogues which bear his name the
<hi rend='ital'>Zopyrus</hi> and
<hi

<hi rend='ital'>Nicias</hi> is doubtful; the
<hi

<hi rend='ital'>Antimachus</hi>
or
<hi rend='ital'>The Elders</hi> is also doubted; the
<hi

also by some attributed to Aeschines.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by Plistanus of Elis, and a
generation later by Menedemus of Eretria and
Asclepiades of Phlius, who came over from Stilpo's
school. Till then the school was known as that of
Elis, but from Menedemus onward it was called the
Eretrian school. Of Menedemus we shall have to
speak hereafter, because he too started a new school.</p>

<head>Chapter 10. EUCLIDES</head>
<div3 type="section" n="106">
<p>Euclides was a native of Megara on the Isthmus,<note n='a'>So called
to distinguish it from Megara Hyblaea, in
Sicily.</note>or according to some of Gela, as Alexander states in
his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers.</hi> He applied
himself
to the writings of Parmenides, and his followers were
called Megarians after him, then Eristics, and at a
later date Dialecticians, that name having first been
given to them by Dionysius of Chalcedon because
they put their arguments into the form of question
and answer. Hermodorus tells us that, after the
death of Socrates, Plato and the rest of the philosophers came to him, being alarmed at the cruelty
of the tyrants. He held the supreme good to be
really one, though called by many names, sometimes
wisdom, sometimes God, and again Mind, and so
forth. But all that is contradictory of the good he
used to reject, declaring that it had no existence.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="107"/>
<p>When he impugned a demonstration, it was not
the premisses but the conclusion that he attacked.
He rejected the argument from analogy, declaring
that it must be taken either from similars or from
<pb n='237'/>
dissimilars. If it were drawn from similars, it is with
these and not with their analogies that their arguments should deal; if from dissimilars, it is gratuitous
to set them side by side. Hence Timon says of him,
with a side hit at the other Socratics as well<note n='a'>Fr. 28
D.</note>:</p>
<p>But I care not for these babblers, nor for anyone besides,
not for Phaedo whoever he be, nor wrangling Euclides, who
inspired the Megarians with a frenzied love of controversy.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="108"/>
<p>He wrote six dialogues, entitled
<hi rend='ital'>Lamprias, Aeschines, Phoenix, Crito, Alcibiades,</hi> and a
<hi

Love.</hi> To the school of Euclides belongs Eubulides
of Miletus, the author of many dialectical arguments
in an interrogatory form, namely,
<hi rend='ital'>The Liar, The Disguised, Electra, The Veiled Figure, The Sorites, The
Horned One,</hi> and
<hi rend='ital'>The Bald Head.</hi> Of him it is

<p>Eubulides the Eristic, who propounded his quibbles about
horns and confounded the orators with falsely pretentious
arguments, is gone with all the braggadocio of a Demosthenes.</p>
<p>Demosthenes was probably his pupil and thereby
improved his faulty pronunciation of the letter R.
<milestone unit="section" n="109"/>
Eubulides kept up a controversy with Aristotle and
said much to discredit him.</p>
<p>Among other members the school of Eubulides
included Alexinus of Elis, a man very fond of controversy, for which reason he was called Elenxinus.
In particular he kept up a controversy with Zeno.
Hermippus says of him that he left Elis and removed
to Olympia, where he studied philosophy. His pupils
inquired why he took up his abode here, and were
<pb n='239'/>
told that it was his intention to found a school which
should be called the Olympian school. But as their
provisions ran short and they found the place unhealthy, they left it, and for the rest of his days
Alexinus lived in solitude with a single servant.
And some time afterwards, as he was swimming in
the Alpheus, the point of a reed ran into him, and
of this injury he died.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="110"/>
<p>I have composed the following lines upon him<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> iii. 129.</note>:</p>
<p>It was not then a vain tale that once an unfortunate man,
while diving, pierced his foot somehow with a nail; since
that great man Alexinus, before he could cross the Alpheus,
was pricked by a reed and met his death.</p>
<p>He has written not only a reply to Zeno but other
works, including one against Ephorus the historian.</p>
<p>To the school of Eubulides also belonged Euphantus
of Olynthus, who wrote a history of his own times.
He was besides a poet and wrote several tragedies,
with which he made a great reputation at the
festivals. He taught King Antigonus<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> Antigonus Doson, born 262 b.c.
<hi rend='ital'>Cf.
F.H.G.</hi> iii. 20.</note> and dedicated
to him a work
<hi rend='ital'>On Kingship</hi> which was very popular.
He died of old age.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="111"/>
<p>There are also other pupils of Eubulides, amongst
them Apollonius surnamed Cronus. He had a pupil
Diodorus, the son of Ameinias of Iasus, who was
also nicknamed Cronus.<note n='c'>See Strabo xiv. 658, who says the
nickname was transferred from the teacher to the more celebrated pupil.</note>
Callimachus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Epigrams</hi> says of him:</p>
<p>Momus himself chalked up on the walls "Cronus is wise."</p>
<p>He too was a dialectician and was supposed to
have been the first who discovered the arguments
<pb n='241'/>
known as the "Veiled Figure" and the "Horned
One." When he was staying with Ptolemy Soter,
he had certain dialectical questions addressed to him
by Stilpo, and, not being able to solve them on the
spot, he was reproached by the king and, among
other slights, the nickname Cronus was applied to
him by way of derision. 
<milestone unit="section" n="112"/>
He left the banquet and,
after writing a pamphlet upon the logical problem,
ended his days in despondency. Upon him too I
have written lines<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> vii.

<p>The successors of Euclides include Ichthyas, the
son of Metallus, an excellent man, to whom Diogenes
the Cynic has addressed one of his dialogues; Clinomachus of Thurii, who was the first to write about
propositions, predications and the like; and Stilpo of
Megara, a most distinguished philosopher, of whom
we have now to treat.</p>
</div3></div2>
<div2 n="11" type="chapter">
<head>Chapter 11. STILPO</head>
<div3 type="section" n="113">
<p>Stilpo, a citizen of Megara in Greece, was a pupil
of some of the followers of Euclides, although others
make him a pupil of Euclides himself, and furthermore
of Thrasymachus of Corinth, who was the friend of
Ichthyas, according to Heraclides. And so far did
he excel all the rest in inventiveness and sophistry
that nearly the whole of Greece was attracted to
<pb n='243'/>
him and joined the school of Megara. On this let
me cite the exact words of Philippus the Megarian
philosopher: "for from Theophrastus he drew away
the theorist Metrodorus and Timagoras of Gela,
from Aristotle the Cyrenaic philosopher, Clitarchus,
and Simmias; and as for the dialecticians themselves,
he gained over Paeonius from Aristides; Diphilus of
Bosphorus, the son of Euphantus, and Myrmex, the
son of Exaenetus, who had both come to refute him,
he made his devoted adherents." 
<milestone unit="section" n="114"/>
And besides these
he won over Phrasidemus the Peripatetic, an accomplished physicist, and Alcimus the rhetorician, the
first orator in all Greece; Crates, too, and many
others he got into his toils, and, what is more, along
with these, he carried off Zeno the Phoenician.</p>
<p>He was also an authority on politics.</p>
<p>He married a wife, and had a mistress named
Nicarete, as Onetor has somewhere stated. He had
a profligate daughter, who was married to his friend
Simmias of Syracuse. And, as she would not live
by rule, some one told Stilpo that she was a disgrace
to him. To this he replied, "Not so, any more than
I am an honour to her."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="115"/>
<p>Ptolemy Soter, they say, made much of him, and
when he had got possession of Megara, offered him
a sum of money and invited him to return with him
to Egypt. But Stilpo would only accept a very
moderate sum, and he declined the proposed journey,
and removed to Aegina until Ptolemy set sail.
Again, when Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, had
taken Megara, he took measures that Stilpo's house
should be preserved and all his plundered property
restored to him. But when he requested that a
schedule of the lost property should be drawn up,
<pb n='245'/>
Stilpo denied that he had lost anything which really
belonged to him, for no one had taken away his learning, while he still had his eloquence and knowledge.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="116"/>
<p>And conversing upon the duty of doing good to
men he made such an impression on the king that
he became eager to hear him. There is a story that
he once used the following argument concerning the
Athena of Phidias: "Is it not Athena the daughter
of Zeus who is a goddess?" And when the other
said "Yes," he went on, "But this at least is not
by Zeus but by Phidias," and, this being granted,
he concluded, "This then is not a god." For this
he was summoned before the Areopagus; he did
not deny the charge, but contended that the reasoning was correct, for that Athena was no god but a
goddess; it was the male divinities who were gods.
However, the story goes that the Areopagites ordered
him to quit the city, and that thereupon Theodorus,
whose nickname was
<foreign lang='greek'>*qeo/s</foreign>, said in
derision, "Whence
did Stilpo learn this? and how could he tell whether
she was a god or a goddess?" But in truth Theodorus was most impudent, and Stilpo most ingenious.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="117"/>
<p>When Crates asked him whether the gods take
delight in prayers and adorations, he is said to have
replied, "Don't put such a question in the street,
simpleton, but when we are alone!" It is said that
Bion, when he was asked the same question whether
there are gods, replied:</p>
<p>Will you not scatter the crowd from me, O much-enduring
elder?</p>
<p>In character Stilpo was simple and unaffected, and
he could readily adapt himself to the plain man.
For instance, when Crates the Cynic did not answer
the question put to him and only insulted the ques-
<pb n='247'/>
tioner, "I knew," said Stilpo, "that you would utter
anything rather than what you ought." 
<milestone unit="section" n="118"/>
And once
when Crates held out a fig to him when putting a
question, he took the fig and ate it. Upon which
the other exclaimed, "O Heracles, I have lost the
fig," and Stilpo remarked, "Not only that but your
question as well, for which the fig was payment in
advance." Again, on seeing Crates shrivelled with
cold in the winter, he said, "You seem to me, Crates,
to want a new coat,"
<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> to be wanting in sense
as
well.<note n='a'>The pun upon
<foreign lang='greek'>kainou=</foreign>
("new") and
<foreign lang='greek'>kai\ nou=</foreign> ("mind as
well") recurs vi. 3.</note> And the other being annoyed replied with
the following burlesque<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi>
Add. v. 13 b.</note>:</p>
<p>And Stilpo I saw enduring toilsome woes in Megara,
where men say that the bed of Typhos is. There he would
ever be wrangling, and many comrades about him, wasting
time in the verbal pursuit of virtue.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="119"/>
<p>It is said that at Athens he so attracted the public
that people would run together from the workshops
to look at him. And when some one said, "Stilpo,
they stare at you as if you were some strange creature." "No, indeed," said he, "but as if I were a
genuine man." And, being a consummate master
of controversy, he used to demolish even the ideas,
and say that he who asserted the existence of Man
meant no individual; he did not mean this man or
that. For why should he mean the one more than
the other? Therefore neither does he mean this
individual man. Again, "vegetable" is not what
is shown to me, for vegetable existed ten thousand
years ago. Therefore this is not vegetable. The
story goes that while in the middle of an argument
with Crates he hurried off to buy fish, and, when
Crates tried to detain him and urged that he was
leaving the argument, his answer was, "Not I. I
<pb n='249'/>
keep the argument though I am leaving you; for
the argument will remain, but the fish will soon be
sold."</p>

Asclepiades
of Phlius drew him away, and he lived at Megara
with Stilpo, whose lectures they both attended.</p>
<pb n='259'/>
<p>Thence they sailed to Elis, where they joined
Anchipylus and Moschus of the school of Phaedo.
Down to their time, as was stated in the Life of
Phaedo, the school was called the Elian school.
Afterwards it was called the Eretrian school, from
the city to which my subject belonged.</p>
<p>It would appear that Menedemus was somewhat
pompous. Hence Crates burlesques him thus<note n='a'>Fr. 2
D.</note>:</p>
<p>Asclepiades the sage of Phlius and the Eretrian bull;</p>
<p>and Timon as follows<note n='b'>Fr. 29 D.</note>:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>A puffing, supercilious purveyor of
humbug.</hi></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="127"/>
<p>He was a man of such dignity that, when Eurylochus of Casandrea was invited by Antigonus to
court along with Cle&iuml;ppides, a youth of Cyzicus, he
declined the invitation, being afraid that Menedemus
would hear of it, so caustic and outspoken was he.
When a young gallant would have taken liberties
with him, he said not a word but picked up a twig
and drew an insulting picture on the ground, until
all eyes were attracted and the young man, perceiving the insult, made off. When Hierocles, who
was in command of the Piraeus, walked up and
down along with him in the shrine of Amphiaraus,
and talked much of the capture of Eretria, he made
no other reply beyond asking him what Antigonus's
object was in treating him as he did.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="128"/>
<p>To an adulterer who was giving himself airs he
said, "Do you not know that, if cabbage has a good
flavour, so for that matter has radish?" Hearing
a youth who was very noisy, he said, "See what
there is behind you." When Antigonus consulted
him as to whether he should go to a rout, he sent
<pb n='261'/>
a message to say no more than this, that he was the
son of a king. When a stupid fellow related something to him with no apparent object, he inquired
if he had a farm. And hearing that he had, and
that there was a large stock of cattle on it, he said,
"Then go and look after them, lest it should happen
that they are ruined and a clever farmer thrown
away." To one who inquired if the good man ever
married, he replied, "Do you think me good or
not?" The reply being in the affirmative, he said,
"Well, I am married." 
<milestone unit="section" n="129"/>
Of one who affirmed that
there were many good things, he inquired how many,
and whether he thought there were more than a
hundred. Not being able to curb the extravagance
of some one who had invited him to dinner, he said
nothing when he was invited, but rebuked his host
tacitly by confining himself to olives. However, on
account of this freedom of speech he was in great
peril in Cyprus with his friend Asclepiades when
staying at the court of Nicocreon. For when the
king held the usual monthly feast and invited these
two along with the other philosophers, we are told
that Menedemus said that, if the gathering of such
men was a good thing, the feast ought to have been
held every day; if not, then it was superfluous even
on the present occasion. 
<milestone unit="section" n="130"/>
The tyrant having replied
to this by saying that on this day he had the
leisure to hear philosophers, he pressed the point
still more stubbornly, declaring, while the feast was
going on, that any and every occasion should be
employed in listening to philosophers. The consequence was that, if a certain flute-player had not
got them away, they would have been put to death.
Hence when they were in a storm in the boat
<pb n='263'/>
Asclepiades is reported to have said that the fluteplayer through good playing had proved their salvation when the free speech of Menedemus had been
their undoing.</p>
<p>He shirked work, it is said, and was indifferent to
the fortunes of his school. At least no order could be
seen in his classes, and no circle of benches; but each
man would listen where he happened to be, walking or
sitting, Menedemus himself behaving in the same way.
<milestone unit="section" n="131"/>
In other respects he is said to have been nervous and
careful of his reputation; so much so that, when
Menedemus himself and Asclepiades were helping
a man who had formerly been a builder to build a
house, whereas Asclepiades appeared stripped on the
roof passing the mortar, Menedemus would try to
hide himself as often as he saw anyone coming.
After he took part in public affairs, he was so nervous
that, when offering the frankincense, he would
actually miss the censer. And once, when Crates
stood about him and attacked him for meddling in
politics, he ordered certain men to have Crates
locked up. But Crates none the less watched him
as he went by and, standing on tiptoe, called him a
pocket Agamemnon and Hegesipolis.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="132"/>
<p>He was also in a way rather superstitious. At all
events once, when he was at an inn with Asclepiades
and had inadvertently eaten some meat which had
been thrown away, he turned sick and pale when he
learnt the fact, until Asclepiades rebuked him, saying
that it was not the meat which disturbed him but
merely his suspicion of it. In all other respects he
was magnanimous and liberal. In his habit of body,
even in old age, he was as firm and sunburnt in
appearance as any athlete, being stout and always
<pb n='265'/>
in the pink of condition; in stature he was wellproportioned, as may be seen from the statuette in
the ancient Stadium at Eretria. For it represents
him, intentionally no doubt, almost naked, and displays the greater part of his body.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="133"/>
<p>He was fond of entertaining and used to collect
numerous parties about him because Eretria was
unhealthy; amongst these there would be parties of
poets and musicians. He welcomed Aratus also and
Lycophron the tragic poet, and Antagoras of Rhodes,
but, above all, he applied himself to the study of
Homer and, next, the Lyric poets; then to Sophocles,
and also to Achaeus, to whom he assigned the second
place as a writer of satiric dramas, giving Aeschylus
the first. Hence he quoted against his political
opponents the following lines<note n='a'>Nauck,
<hi
rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi rend='super'>2</hi>,
<hi
rend='ital'>Achaeus</hi>, 34.</note>:</p>
<p>Ere long the swift is overtaken by the feeble,</p>
<p>And the eagle by the tortoise,</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="134"/>
<p>which are from the
<hi rend='ital'>Omphale</hi>, a satiric drama of
Achaeus. Therefore it is a mistake to say that he
had read nothing except the
<hi rend='ital'>Medea</hi> of Euripides,
which some have asserted to be the work of Neophron
of Sicyon.</p>
<p>He despised the teachers of the school of Plato
and Xenocrates as well as the Cyrenaic philosopher
Paraebates. He had a great admiration for Stilpo;
and on one occasion, when he was questioned about
him, he made no other answer than that he was a
gentleman. Menedemus was difficult to see through,
and in making a bargain it was difficult to get the
better of him. He would twist and turn in every
direction, and he excelled in inventing objections.
He was a great controversialist, according to Anti-
<pb n='267'/>
sthenes in his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers.</hi> In
particular he was fond of using the following argument:
"Is the one of two things different from the other?"
"Yes." "And is conferring benefits different from
the good?" "Yes." "Then to confer benefits is
not good."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="135"/>
<p>It is said that he disallowed negative propositions,
converting them into affirmatives, and of these he
admitted simple propositions only, rejecting those
which are not simple, I mean hypothetical and
complex propositions. Heraclides declares that,
although in his doctrines he was a Platonist, yet he
made sport of dialectic. So that, when Alexinus
once inquired if he had left off beating his father, his
answer was, "Why, I was not beating him and have
not left off"; and upon Alexinus insisting that he
ought to have cleared up the ambiguity by a plain
"Yes" or "No," "It would be absurd," he said,
"for me to conform to your rules when I can stop
you on the threshold." And when Bion persistently
ran down the soothsayers, Menedemus said he was
slaying the slain.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="136"/>
<p>On hearing some one say that the greatest good
was to get all you want, he rejoined, "To want the
right things is a far greater good." Antigonus of
Carystus asserts that he never wrote or composed
anything, and so never held firmly by any doctrine.
He adds that in discussing questions he was so
pugnacious that he would only retire after he had
been badly mauled. And yet, though he was so
violent in debate, he was as mild as possible in his
conduct. For instance, though he made sport of
Alexinus and bantered him cruelly, he was nevertheless very kind to him, for, when his wife was afraid
<pb n='269'/>
that on her journey she might be set upon and
robbed, he gave her an escort from Delphi to Chalcis.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="137"/>
<p>He was a very warm friend, as is shown by his
affection for Asclepiades, which was hardly inferior
to the devotion shown by Pylades. But, Asclepiades
being the elder, it was said that he was the playwright and Menedemus the actor. They say that
once, when Archipolis had given them a cheque for
half a talent, they stickled so long over the point as
to whose claim came second that neither of them
got the money. It is said that they married a
mother and her daughter; Asclepiades married the
daughter and Menedemus the mother. But after
the death of his own wife, Asclepiades took the wife
of Menedemus; and afterwards the latter, when he
became head of the state, married a rich woman as
his second wife.  Nevertheless, as they kept one
household, Menedemus entrusted his former wife
with the care of his establishment. 
<milestone unit="section" n="138"/>
However,
Asclepiades died first at a great age at Eretria,
having lived with Menedemus economically, though
they had ample means. Some time afterwards a
favourite of Asclepiades, having come to a party
and being refused admittance by the pupils,
Menedemus ordered them to admit him, saying
that even now, when under the earth, Asclepiades
opened the door for him. It was Hipponicus the
Macedonian and Agetor of Lamia who were their
chief supporters; the one gave each of the two
thirty minae, while Hipponicus furnished Menedemus
with two thousand drachmae with which to portion
his daughters. There were three of them according
to Heraclides, his children by a wife who was a
native of Oropus.</p>
<pb n='271'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="139"/>
<p>He used to give his parties in this fashion: he
would breakfast beforehand with two or three friends
and stay until it was late in the day. And in the
next place some one would summon the guests who
had arrived and who had themselves already dined,
so that, if anyone came too soon, he would walk up
and down and inquire from those who came out of
the house what was on the table and what o'clock
it was. If then it was only vegetables or salt fish,
they would depart; but if there was meat, they
would enter the house. In the summer time a rush
mat was put upon each couch, in winter time a sheepskin. The guest brought his own cushion. The
loving-cup which was passed round was no larger
than a pint cup. The dessert consisted of lupins or
beans, sometimes of ripe fruit such as pears, pomegranates, a kind of pulse, or even dried figs. 
<milestone unit="section" n="140"/>
All of
these facts are mentioned by Lycophron in his
satiric drama entitled
<hi rend='ital'>Menedemus</hi>, which was composed as a tribute to him. Here is a specimen of it<note n='a'>Nauck,
<hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi rend='super'>2</hi> p. 818.</note>:</p>
<p>And after a temperate feast the modest cup was passed
round with discretion, and their dessert was temperate discourse for such as cared to listen.</p>
<p>At first he was despised, being called a cynic and
a humbug by the Eretrians. But afterwards he was
greatly admired, so much so that they entrusted him
with the government of the state. He was sent as
envoy to Ptolemy and to Lysimachus, being honoured
wherever he went. He was, moreover, envoy to
Demetrius, and he caused the yearly tribute of
two hundred talents which the city used to pay
Demetrius to be reduced by fifty talents. And
when he was accused to Demetrius of intriguing
to hand over the city to Ptolemy, he defended
<pb n='273'/>
himself in a letter which commences thus: 
<milestone unit="section" n="141"/>
"Menedemus to King Demetrius, greeting. I hear that
a report has reached you concerning me." There
is a tradition that one Aeschylus who belonged
to the opposite party had made these charges against
him. He seems to have behaved with the utmost
dignity in the embassy to Demetrius on the subject
of Oropus, as Euphantus relates in his
<hi rend='ital'>Histories.</hi>
Antigonus too was much attached to him and used to
proclaim himself his pupil. And when he vanquished
the barbarians near the town of Lysimachia, Menedemus moved a decree in his honour in simple terms
and free from flattery, beginning thus: 
<milestone unit="section" n="142"/>
"On the
motion of the generals and the councillors--Whereas
King Antigonus is returning to his own country after
vanquishing the barbarians in battle, and whereas
in all his undertakings he prospers according to his
will, the senate and the people have decreed . . ."</p>
<p>On these grounds, then, and from his friendship for
him in other matters, he was suspected of betraying
the city to Antigonus, and, being denounced by
Aristodemus, withdrew from Eretria and stayed
awhile in Oropus in the temple of Amphiaraus.
And, because some golden goblets were missing
from the temple, he was ordered to depart by a
general vote of the Boeotians, as is stated by
Hermippus; and thereupon in despair, after a secret
visit to his native city, he took with him his wife
and daughters and came to the court of Antigonus,
where he died of a broken heart.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="143"/>
<p>Heraclides tells quite another story, that he was
made councillor of the Eretrians and more than once
saved the city from a tyranny by calling in Demetrius
--so then he would not be likely to betray the city
<pb n='275'/>
to Antigonus, but was made the victim of a false
charge; that he betook himself to Antigonus and
was anxious to regain freedom for his country;
that, as Antigonus would not give way, in despair
he put an end to his life by abstaining from food for
seven days. The account of Antigonus of Carystus
is similar.<note n='a'>Antigonus of Carystus (see Introd. p. xxiii) is
the older
authority, from whom Heraclides (probably Heraclides
Lembos) directly or indirectly derived his information.</note> With
Persaeus alone he carried on open
warfare, for it was thought that, when Antigonus
was willing for Menedemus's sake to restore to the
Eretrians their democracy, Persaeus prevented him.
<milestone unit="section" n="144"/>
Hence on one occasion over the wine Menedemus
refuted Persaeus in argument and said, amongst
other things, "Such he is as a philosopher but, as
a man, the worst of all that are alive or to be born
hereafter."</p>
<p>According to the statement of Heraclides he died
in his seventy-fourth year. I have written the
following epigram upon him<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi>
v. 40.</note>:</p>
<p>I heard of your fate, Menedemus, how, of your own free
will, you expired by starving yourself for seven days, a
deed right worthy of an Eretrian, but unworthy of a man;
but despair was your leader and urged you on.</p>
<p>These then are the disciples of Socrates or their
immediate successors. We must now pass to Plato,
the founder of the Academy, and his successors, so
far as they were men of reputation.</p>

<p>Plato was the son of Ariston and a citizen of Athens.
His mother was Perictione (or Potone), who traced
back her descent to Solon. For Solon had a brother,
Dropides; he was the father of Critias, who was the
father of Callaeschrus, who was the father of Critias,
one of the Thirty, as well as of Glaucon, who was the
father of Charmides and Perictione. Thus Plato,
the son of this Perictione and Ariston, was in the
sixth generation from Solon. And Solon traced his
descent to Neleus and Poseidon. His father too is
said to be in the direct line from Codrus, the son of
Melanthus, and, according to Thrasylus, Codrus and
Melanthus also trace their descent from Poseidon.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
<p>Speusippus in the work entitled
<hi rend='ital'>Plato's Funeral
Feast</hi>, Clearchus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Encomium on Plato</hi>,
and
Anaxila&iuml;des in his second book
<hi rend='ital'>On Philosophers</hi>,
tell
us that there was a story at Athens that Ariston
made violent love to Perictione, then in her bloom,
and failed to win her; and that, when he ceased to
offer violence, Apollo appeared to him in a dream,
whereupon he left her unmolested until her child
was born.</p>
<p>Apollodorus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi> fixes the date of
Plato's birth in the 88th Olympiad, on the seventh
day of the month Thargelion, the same day on which
<pb n='279'/>
the Delians say that Apollo himself was born. He
died, according to Hermippus, at a wedding feast,
in the first year of the 108th Olympiad, in his eightyfirst year.<note n='a'>427-347 b.c.</note> 
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
Neanthes, however, makes him
die at the
age of eighty-four. He is thus seen to be six years
the junior of Isocrates. For Isocrates was born in the
archonship of Lysimachus,<note n='b'>436-435 b.c.</note> Plato in that
of Ameinias,
the year of Pericles' death.<note n='c'>429 b.c.</note> He belonged to
the
deme Collytus, as is stated by Antileon in his second
book
<hi rend='ital'>On Dates.</hi> He was born, according to some,
in Aegina, in the house of Phidiades, the son of
Thales, as Favorinus states in his
<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous
History</hi>, for his father had been sent along with
others to Aegina to settle in the island, but returned
to Athens when the Athenians were expelled by the
Lacedaemonians, who championed the Aeginetan
cause. That Plato acted as choregus at Athens, the
cost being defrayed by Dion, is stated by Athenodorus in the eighth book of a work entitled
<hi rend='ital'>Walks.</hi>
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
He had two brothers, Adeimantus and Glaucon, and
a sister, Potone, who was the mother of Speusippus.</p>
<p>He was taught letters in the school of Dionysius,
who is mentioned by him in the
<hi rend='ital'>Rivals.</hi> And he
learnt gymnastics under Ariston, the Argive wrestler.
And from him he received the name of Plato on
account of his robust figure, in place of his original
name which was Aristocles, after his grandfather, as
Alexander informs us in his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of
Philosophers.</hi>
But others affirm that he got the name Plato from
the breadth of his style, or from the breadth of his
forehead, as suggested by Neanthes. Others again
affirm that he wrestled in the Isthmian Games--this
is stated by Dicaearchus in his first book
<hi rend='ital'>On
Lives</hi>--
<pb n='281'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
and that he applied himself to painting and wrote
poems, first dithyrambs, afterwards lyric poems and
tragedies. He had, they say, a weak voice; this is
confirmed by Timotheus the Athenian in his book
<hi rend='ital'>On Lives.</hi> It is stated that Socrates in a dream
saw
a cygnet on his knees, which all at once put forth
plumage, and flew away after uttering a loud sweet
note. And the next day Plato was introduced as a
pupil, and thereupon he recognized in him the swan
of his dream.<note n='a'>Compare Apuleius,

<p>At first he used to study philosophy in the
Academy, and afterwards in the garden at Colonus
(as Alexander states in his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of
Philosophers</hi>),
as a follower of Heraclitus. Afterwards, when he
was about to compete for the prize with a tragedy,

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
<p>From that time onward, having reached his twentieth
year (so it is said), he was the pupil of Socrates.
When Socrates was gone, he attached himself to
Cratylus the Heraclitean, and to Hermogenes who
professed the philosophy of Parmenides. Then at
the age of twenty-eight, according to Hermodorus,
he withdrew to Megara to Euclides, with certain
other disciples of Socrates. Next he proceeded to
Cyrene on a visit to Theodorus the mathematician,
thence to Italy to see the Pythagorean philosophers
Philolaus and Eurytus, and thence to Egypt to see
<pb n='283'/>
those who interpreted the will of the gods; and
Euripides is said to have accompanied him thither.
There he fell sick and was cured by the priests, who
treated him with sea-water, and for this reason he
cited the line<note n='a'>Eur.
<hi rend='ital'>Iph. T.</hi>
1193.</note>:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>The sea doth wash away all human ills.</hi></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
<p>Furthermore he said that, according to Homer,<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Od.</hi> iv. 231.</note>
beyond all men the Egyptians were skilled in healing.
Plato also intended to make the acquaintance of the
Magians, but was prevented by the wars in Asia.
Having returned to Athens, he lived in the Academy,
which is a gymnasium outside the walls, in a grove
named after a certain hero, Hecademus, as is stated
by Eupolis in his play entitled
<hi rend='ital'>Shirkers</hi><note
n='c'>Meineke,
<hi rend='ital'>C.G.F.</hi> ii. 437. According to Suidas,
<hi rend='ital'>s.v.</hi>
<foreign lang='greek'>*eu)/polis,</foreign> this play had a second title,

alone it is cited in
<hi rend='ital'>Etymol. Magnum.</hi></note>:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>In the shady walks of the divine
Hecademus.</hi></p>
<p>Moreover, there are verses of Timon which refer to
Plato<note n='d'>Fr. 30 D.</note>:</p>
<p>Amongst all of them Plato was the leader, a big fish, but
a sweet-voiced speaker, musical in prose as the cicala who,
perched on the trees of Hecademus, pours forth a strain as
delicate as a lily.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
<p>Thus the original name of the place was Hecademy,
spelt with
<hi rend='ital'>e.</hi> Now Plato was a friend of Isocrates.
And Praxiphanes makes them converse about poets
at a country-seat where Plato was entertaining
Isocrates. And Aristoxenus asserts that he went
on service three times, first to Tanagra, secondly
to Corinth, and thirdly at Delium, where also he
obtained the prize of valour. He mixed together
doctrines of Heraclitus, the Pythagoreans and
<pb n='285'/>
Socrates. In his doctrine of sensible things he
agrees with Heraclitus, in his doctrine of the intelligible with Pythagoras, and in political philosophy
with Socrates.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
<p>Some authorities, amongst them Satyrus, say that
he wrote to Dion in Sicily instructing him to purchase three Pythagorean books from Philolaus for
100 minae. For they say he was well off, having
received from Dionysius over eighty talents. This
is stated by Onetor in an essay upon the theme,
"Whether a wise man will make money." Further,
he derived great assistance from Epicharmus the
Comic poet, for he transcribed a great deal from
him, as Alcimus says in the essays dedicated to
Amyntas, of which there are four. In the first of
them he writes thus:</p>
<p>"It is evident that Plato often employs the words
of Epicharmus.<note n='a'>The genuineness of these fragments is doubted
by
Wilamowitz, Rohde, and others; see Wilamowitz,
<hi
rend='ital'>Platon</hi>,
ii. 28 note 2, and on the other side Diels, note
<hi rend='ital'>ad
loc.</hi> (<hi rend='ital'>Frag.
der Vorsok.</hi> 13 B. 1-5).</note> Just consider. Plato asserts that
the object of sense is that which never abides in
quality or quantity, but is ever in flux and change.
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
The assumption is that the things from which you
take away number are no longer equal nor determinate, nor have they quantity or quality. These
are the things to which becoming always, and being
never, belongs. But the object of thought is something constant from which nothing is subtracted, to
which nothing is added. This is the nature of the
eternal things, the attribute of which is to be ever
alike and the same. And indeed Epicharmus has
expressed himself plainly about objects of sense and
objects of thought.</p>
<p>a. But gods there always were; never at any time were
they wanting, while things in this world are always alike,
and are brought about through the same agencies.</p>
<pb n='287'/>
<p>b. Yet it is said that Chaos was the first-born of the
gods.</p>
<p>a. How so? If indeed there was nothing out of which,
or into which, it could come first.</p>
<p>b. What! Then did nothing come first after all?</p>
<p>a. No, by Zeus, nor second either, 
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>
at least of the things
which we are thus talking about now; on the contrary, they
existed from all eternity. . . .</p>
<p>a. But suppose some one chooses to add a single pebble
to a heap containing either an odd or an even number,
whichever you please, or to take away one of those already
there; do you think the number of pebbles would remain
the same?</p>
<p>b. Not I.</p>
<p>a. Nor yet, if one chooses to add to a cubit-measure
another length,<note n='a'>Or, reading
<foreign lang='greek'>sterro/n</foreign> for
<foreign lang='greek'>e(/teron,</foreign> "a substantial length."</note> or cut off
some of what was there already,
would the original measure still exist?</p>
<p>b. Of course not.</p>
<p>a. Now consider mankind in this same way. One man
grows, and another again shrinks; and they are all undergoing change the whole time. But a thing which naturally
changes and never remains in the same state must ever be
different from that which has thus changed. And even so
you and I were one pair of men yesterday, are another
to-day, and again will be another to-morrow, and will never
remain ourselves, by this same argument."</p>
<pb n='289'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>
<p>Again, Alcimus makes this further statement:
"There are some things, say the wise, which the
soul perceives through the body, as in seeing and
hearing; there are other things which it discerns by
itself without the aid of the body. Hence it follows
that of existing things some are objects of sense and
others objects of thought. Hence Plato said that, if
we wish to take in at one glance the principles
underlying the universe, we must first distinguish
the ideas by themselves, for example, likeness, unity
and plurality, magnitude, rest and motion; next we
must assume the existence of 
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
beauty, goodness,
justice and the like, each existing in and for itself;
in the third place we must see how many of the
ideas are relative to other ideas, as are knowledge,
or magnitude, or ownership, remembering that the
things within our experience bear the same names
as those ideas because they partake of them; I
mean that things which partake of justice are just,
things which partake of beauty are beautiful. Each
one of the ideas is eternal, it is a notion, and moreover is incapable of change. Hence Plato says that
they stand in nature like archetypes, and that all
things else bear a resemblance to the ideas because
they are copies of these archetypes. Now here are
the words of Epicharmus about the good and about
the ideas:</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>
<p>a. Is flute-playing a thing?</p>
<p>b. Most certainly.</p>
<p>a. Is man then flute-playing?</p>
<p>b. By no means.</p>
<p>a. Come, let me see, what is a flute-player? Whom do
you take him to be? Is he not a man?</p>
<p>b. Most certainly.</p>
<p>a. Well, don't you think the same would be the case with
<pb n='291'/>
the good? Is not the good in itself a thing? And does not
he who has learnt that thing and knows it at once become
good? For, just as he becomes a flute-player by learning
flute-playing, or a dancer when he has learnt dancing, or a
plaiter when he has learnt plaiting, in the same way, if he
has learnt anything of the sort, whatever you like, he would
not be one with the craft but he would be the craftsman.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
<p>Now Plato in conceiving his theory of Ideas says<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf. Phaedo</hi>, 96 b "(I considered) whether it is blood or
air or fire with which we think, or none of these things, but
the brain which furnishes the senses of hearing and sight
and smell, and from these arise memory and opinion, and
from memory and opinion, when they have become stable, in
the same way knowledge arises."</note>:
Since there is such a thing as memory, there must
be ideas present in things, because memory is of
something stable and permanent, and nothing is
permanent except the ideas. `For how,' he says,
`could animals have survived unless they had apprehended the idea and had been endowed by Nature
with intelligence to that end? As it is, they remember similarities and what their food is like,
which shows that animals have the innate power of
discerning what is similar. And hence they perceive others of their own kind.' How then does
Epicharmus put it?</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>
<p>Wisdom is not confined, Eumaeus, to one kind alone, but
all living creatures likewise have understanding. For, if
you will study intently the hen among poultry, she does not
bring forth the chicks alive, but sits clucking on the eggs
and wakens life in them. As for this wisdom of hers, the
true state of the case is known to Nature alone, for the hen
has learnt it from herself.</p>
<p>And again:</p>
<p>It is no wonder then that we talk thus and are pleased
with ourselves and think we are fine folk. For a dog
appears the fairest of things to a dog, an ox to an ox, an
ass to an ass, and verily a pig to a pig."</p>
<pb n='293'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
<p>These and the like instances Alcimus notes through
four books, pointing out the assistance derived by
Plato from Epicharmus. That Epicharmus himself
was fully conscious of his wisdom can also be seen
from the lines in which he foretells that he will have
an imitator<note n='a'>This fragment (Fr. 6 D.), which has not the
authority
of Alcimus, is generally condemned as spurious.</note>:</p>
<p>And as I think--for when I think anything I know it full
well--that my words will some day be remembered; some
one will take them and free them from the metre in which
they are now set, nay, will give them instead a purple robe,
embroidering it with fine phrases; and, being invincible, he
will make every one else an easy prey.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
<p>Plato, it seems, was the first to bring to Athens
the mimes of Sophron which had been neglected,
and to draw characters in the style of that writer;
a copy of the mimes, they say, was actually found
under his pillow. He made three voyages to Sicily,
the first time to see the island and the craters of
Etna: on this occasion Dionysius, the son of Hermocrates, being on the throne, forced him to become
intimate with him. But when Plato held forth on
tyranny and maintained that the interest of the
ruler alone was not the best end, unless he were
also pre-eminent in virtue, he offended Dionysius,
who in his anger exclaimed, "You talk like an old
dotard." "And you like a tyrant," rejoined Plato.
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>
At this the tyrant grew furious and at first was bent
on putting him to death; then, when he had been
dissuaded from this by Dion and Aristomenes, he
did not indeed go so far but handed him over to
Pollis the Lacedaemonian, who had just then arrived
on an embassy, with orders to sell him into slavery.</p>
<pb n='295'/>
<p>And Pollis took him to Aegina and there offered him
for sale. And then Charmandrus, the son of Charmandrides, indicted him on a capital charge according
to the law in force among the Aeginetans, to the
effect that the first Athenian who set foot upon the
island should be put to death without a trial. This
law had been passed by the prosecutor himself,
according to Favorinus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous
History.</hi>
But when some one urged, though in jest, that the
offender was a philosopher, the court acquitted him.
There is another version to the effect that he was
brought before the assembly and, being kept under
close scrutiny, he maintained an absolute silence and
awaited the issue with confidence. The assembly
decided not to put him to death but to sell him just
as if he were a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>Anniceris the Cyrenaic happened to be present
and ransomed him for twenty minae--according to
others the sum was thirty minae--and dispatched
him to Athens to his friends, who immediately remitted the money. But Anniceris declined it, saying
that the Athenians were not the only people worthy
of the privilege of providing for Plato. Others assert
that Dion sent the money and that Anniceris would
not take it, but bought for Plato the little garden
which is in the Academy. Pollis, however, is stated
to have been defeated by Chabrias and afterwards to
have been drowned at Helice,<note n='a'>In the tidal wave which

Dionysius, indeed, could not rest. On learning the
facts he wrote and enjoined upon Plato not to speak
evil of him. And Plato replied that he had not the
leisure to keep Dionysius in his mind.</p>
<pb n='297'/>
<p>The second time he visited the younger Dionysius,
requesting of him lands and settlers for the realization of his republic. Dionysius promised them but
did not keep his word. Some say that Plato was
also in great danger, being suspected of encouraging
Dion and Theodotas in a scheme for liberating the
whole island; on this occasion Archytas the Pythagorean wrote to Dionysius, procured his pardon, and
got him conveyed safe to Athens. The letter runs
as follows:</p>
<p>"Archytas to Dionysius, wishing him good health."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>
<p>"We, being all of us the friends of Plato, have
sent to you Lamiscus and Photidas in order to take
the philosopher away by the terms of the agreement
made with you. You will do well to remember the
zeal with which you urged us all to secure Plato's
coming to Sicily, determined as you were to persuade him and to undertake, amongst other things,
responsibility for his safety so long as he stayed with
you and on his return. Remember this too, that
you set great store by his coming, and from that time
had more regard for him than for any of those at
your court. If he has given you offence, it behoves
you to behave with humanity and restore him to us
unhurt. By so doing you will satisfy justice and at
the same time put us under an obligation."</p>

<p>The third time he came to reconcile Dion and
Dionysius, but, failing to do so, returned to his own
country without achieving anything. And there he
refrained from meddling with politics, although his
writings show that he was a statesman. The reason
was that the people had already been accustomed
to measures and institutions quite different from
his own. Pamphila in the twenty-fifth book of her
<pb n='299'/>
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi> says that the Arcadians and
Thebans,
when they were founding Megalopolis, invited Plato
to be their legislator; but that, when he discovered
that they were opposed to equality of possessions,
he refused to go.<note n='a'>Compare Aelian,
<hi rend='ital'>Var.
Hist.</hi> ii. 42.</note> There is a story that he pleaded
for Chabrias the general when he was tried for his
life, although no one else at Athens would do so,
<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>
and that, on this occasion, as he was going up to the
Acropolis along with Chabrias, Crobylus the informer
met him and said, "What, are you come to speak
for the defence? Don't you know that the hemlock
of Socrates awaits you?" To this Plato replied,
"As I faced dangers when serving in the cause of
my country, so I will face them now in the cause of
duty for a friend."</p>
<p>He was the first to introduce argument by means
of question and answer, says Favorinus in the eighth
book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History</hi>; he was the
first
to explain to Leodamas of Thasos the method of
solving problems by analysis<note n='b'>The same statement that Plato
made over to Leodamas

<p>He was also the first philosopher who controverted

has set out word for word in the

<hi rend='ital'>sqq.</hi></note> and the
first to study the significance of grammar. And, as
he was the first to attack the views of almost all his
predecessors, the question is raised why he makes
no mention of Democritus. Neanthes of Cyzicus
says that, on his going to Olympia, the eyes of all
<pb n='301'/>
the Greeks were turned towards him, and there he
met Dion, who was about to make his expedition
against Dionysius. In the first book of the
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi> of Favorinus there is a statement that
Mithradates the Persian set up a statue of Plato in
the Academy and inscribed upon it these words:
"Mithradates the Persian, the son of Orontobates,

Silanion."</p>

also to Dion who has been mentioned above, and, as
some aver, to Phaedrus too. His passionate affection
is revealed in the following epigrams which he is
said to have written upon them<note n='f'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.

<p>Star-gazing Aster, would I were the skies,</p>

<p>This, they say, was actually inscribed upon his tomb

<p>Further, Molon, being his enemy, said, "It is not

that Xenophon was not on good terms with him.
At any rate, they have written similar narratives as

Socrates, neither of them refers to the other, except
that Xenophon mentions Plato in the third book of
his
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia.</hi> 
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
It is said also that Antisthenes,
being about to read publicly something that he had
composed, invited Plato to be present. And on his
inquiring what he was about to read, Antisthenes
replied that it was something about the impossibility
of contradiction. "How then," said Plato, "can
you write on this subject?" thus showing him that
the argument refutes itself. Thereupon he wrote a
dialogue against Plato and entitled it
<hi rend='ital'>Sathon.</hi>
After
this they continued to be estranged from one another.
They say that, on hearing Plato read the
<hi rend='ital'>Lysis</hi>,
Socrates exclaimed, "By Heracles, what a number
of lies this young man is telling about me!" For
he has included in the dialogue much that Socrates
never said.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>
<p>Plato was also on bad terms with Aristippus. At
least in the dialogue
<hi rend='ital'>Of the Soul</hi><note n='c'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> ii. 65 with note.</note> he disparages him
by saying that he was not present at the death of
Socrates, though he was no farther off than Aegina.
Again, they say that he showed a certain jealousy of
Aeschines, because of his reputation with Dionysius,
and that, when he arrived at the court, he was
despised by Plato because of his poverty, but supported by Aristippus. And Idomeneus asserts that
the arguments used by Crito, when in the prison he
urges Socrates to escape, are really due to Aeschines,
<pb n='311'/>
and that Plato transferred them to Crito because of
his enmity to Aeschines.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>
<p>Nowhere in his writings does Plato mention himself
by name, except in the dialogue

the
<hi rend='ital'>Apology.</hi><note n='b'>34 a.</note> Aristotle
remarks that the style of
the dialogues is half-way between poetry and prose.
And according to Favorinus, when Plato read the
dialogue
<hi rend='ital'>On the Soul</hi>, Aristotle alone stayed to
the
end; the rest of the audience got up and went
away. Some say that Philippus of Opus copied out
the
<hi rend='ital'>Laws</hi>, which were left upon waxen tablets, and
it is said that he was the author of the
<hi rend='ital'>Epinomis.</hi>
Euphorion and Panaetius relate that the beginning of
the
<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> was found several times revised and
rewritten, and the
<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> itself Aristoxenus
declares
to have been nearly all of it included in the
<hi rend='ital'>Controversies</hi> of Protagoras. 
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>
There is a story that the
<hi rend='ital'>Phaedrus</hi> was his first dialogue. For the subject
has about it something of the freshness of youth.
Dicaearchus, however, censures its whole style as
vulgar.</p>
<p>A story is told that Plato once saw some one playing
at dice and rebuked him. And, upon his protesting
that he played for a trifle only, "But the habit,"
rejoined Plato, "is not a trifle." Being asked
whether there would be any memoirs of him as of
his predecessors, he replied, "A man must first
make a name, and he will have no lack of memoirs."
One day, when Xenocrates had come in, Plato asked
him to chastise his slave, since he was unable to do
it himself because he was in a passion. 
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>
Further, it
is alleged that he said to one of his slaves, "I would
have given you a flogging, had I not been in a
passion." Being mounted on horseback, he quickly
<pb n='313'/>
got down again, declaring that he was afraid he
would be infected with horse-pride. He advised
those who got drunk to view themselves in a mirror;
for they would then abandon the habit which so
disfigured them. To drink to excess was nowhere
becoming, he used to say, save at the feasts of the
god who was the giver of wine. He also disapproved
of over - sleeping. At any rate in the
<hi rend='ital'>Laws</hi><note
n='a'>808 b.</note> he
declares that 
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
"no one when asleep is good for anything." He also said that the truth is the pleasantest
of sounds. Another version of this saying is that the
pleasantest of all things is to speak the truth. Again,
of truth he speaks thus in the
<hi rend='ital'>Laws</hi><note n='b'>663
e.</note>: "Truth, O
stranger, is a fair and durable thing. But it is a
thing of which it is hard to persuade men." His wish
always was to leave a memorial of himself behind,
either in the hearts of his friends or in his books.
He was himself fond of seclusion according to some
authorities.</p>
<p>His death, the circumstances of which have already
been related, took place in the thirteenth year of
the reign of King Philip, as stated by Favorinus in
the third book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>, and according
to
Theopompus<note n='c'>The awkwardness of this last clause can be

but not excused, if we suppose that Diogenes Laertius got

<p>Now, as you are an enthusiastic Platonist, and
rightly so, and as you eagerly seek out that philosopher's doctrines in preference to all others, I have
thought it necessary to give some account of the
true nature of his discourses, the arrangement of the
dialogues, and the method of his inductive procedure, as far as possible in an elementary manner
and in main outline, in order that the facts I have
collected respecting his life may not suffer by the
omission of his doctrines. For, in the words of the
proverb, it would be taking owls to Athens, were
I to give you of all people the full particulars.</p>

<p>They say that Zeno the Eleatic was the first to
write dialogues. But, according to Favorinus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>, Aristotle in the first book of his
dialogue
<hi rend='ital'>On Poets</hi> asserts that it was Alexamenus of Styra
or
Teos. In my opinion Plato, who brought this form
of writing to perfection, ought to be adjudged the
prize for its invention as well as for its embellishment.
A dialogue is a discourse consisting of question and
answer on some philosophical or political subject,
with due regard to the characters of the persons
introduced and the choice of diction. Dialectic is
the art of discourse by which we either refute or
establish some proposition by means of question and
answer on the part of the interlocutors.</p>
<pb n='321'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>
<p>Of the Platonic dialogues there are two most
general types, the one adapted for instruction and
the other for inquiry. And the former is further
divided into two types, the theoretical and the
practical. And of these the theoretical is divided
into the physical and logical, and the practical into
the ethical and political. The dialogue of inquiry
also has two main divisions, the one of which aims at
training the mind and the other at victory in controversy. Again, the part which aims at training
the mind has two subdivisions, the one akin to the
midwife's art, the other merely tentative. And that
suited to controversy is also subdivided into one part
which raises critical objections, and another which
is subversive of the main position.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="50"/>
<p>I am not unaware that there are other ways in
which certain writers classify the dialogues. For
some dialogues they call dramatic, others narrative,
and others again a mixture of the two. But the
terms they employ in their classification of the
dialogues are better suited to the stage than to
philosophy. Physics is represented by the
<hi rend='ital'>Timaeus</hi>,
logic by the
<hi rend='ital'>Statesman, Cratylus, Parmenides</hi> and
<hi rend='ital'>Sophist</hi>, ethics by the
<hi rend='ital'>Apology,
Crito, Phaedo, Phaedrus</hi>
and
<hi rend='ital'>Symposium</hi>, as well as by the
<hi
rend='ital'>Menexenus, Clitophon</hi>,
the
<hi rend='ital'>Epistles, Philebus, Hipparchus</hi> and the
<hi
rend='ital'>Rivals</hi>, and
lastly politics by the
<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi>, 
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>
the
<hi
rend='ital'>Laws, Minos,
Epinomis</hi>, and the dialogue concerning Atlantis.<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>i.e. Critias.</hi></note>
To the class of mental obstetrics belong the two
<hi rend='ital'>Alcibiades, Theages, Lysis</hi> and
<hi
rend='ital'>Laches</hi>, while the
<hi rend='ital'>Euthyphro, Meno, Io, Charmides</hi> and
<hi
rend='ital'>Theaetetus</hi> illustrate the tentative method. In the
<hi rend='ital'>Protagoras</hi> is
seen the method of critical objections; in the
<pb n='323'/>
<hi rend='ital'>Euthydemus, Gorgias</hi>, and the two dialogues
entitled
<hi rend='ital'>Hippias</hi> that of subversive argument. So much then
for dialogue, its definition and varieties.</p>
<p>Again, as there is great division of opinion between
those who affirm and those who deny that Plato was
a dogmatist, let me proceed to deal with this further
question. To be a dogmatist in philosophy is to lay
down positive dogmas, just as to be a legislator is
to lay down laws. Further, under dogma two things
are included, the thing opined and the opinion itself.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
<p>Of these the former is a proposition, the latter a
conception. Now where he has a firm grasp Plato
expounds his own view and refutes the false one,
but, if the subject is obscure, he suspends judgement.
His own views are expounded by four persons,
Socrates, Timaeus, the Athenian Stranger,<note n='a'>In the
<hi
rend='ital'>Laws.</hi></note> the
Eleatic Stranger.<note n='b'>In the
<hi rend='ital'>Sophist</hi> and
the
<hi rend='ital'>Statesman.</hi></note> These strangers are not, as
some
hold, Plato and Parmenides, but imaginary characters
without names,<note n='c'>That the Eleatic Stranger is not Parmenides
is decisively
proved by
<hi rend='ital'>Soph.</hi> 241 e.</note> for, even when
Socrates and Timaeus
are the speakers, it is Plato's doctrines that are laid
down. To illustrate the refutation of false opinions,
he introduces Thrasymachus, Callicles, Polus, Gorgias,
Protagoras, or again Hippias, Euthydemus and the
like.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>	
<p>In constructing his proofs he makes most use of
induction, not always in the same way, but under
two forms. For induction is an argument which by
means of certain true premisses properly infers a
truth resembling them. And there are two kinds of
induction, the one proceeding by way of contradiction, the other from agreement. In the kind which
proceeds by contradiction the answer given to every
question will necessarily be the contrary of the
<pb n='325'/>
respondent's position,
<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "My father is
either other
than or the same as your father. If then your
father is other than my father, by being other than
a father he will not be a father. But if he is the
same as my father, then by being the same as my
father he will be my father." 
<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
And again: "If
man is not an animal, he will be either a stick or a
stone. But he is not a stick or a stone; for he is
animate and self-moved. Therefore he is an animal.
But if he is an animal, and if a dog or an ox is also
an animal, then man by being an animal will be a
dog and an ox as well." This is the kind of induction
which proceeds by contradiction and dispute, and
Plato used it, not for laying down positive doctrines
but for refutation. The other kind of induction by
agreement appears in two forms, the one proving
the particular conclusion under discussion from a
particular, the other proceeding by way of the universal [by means of particular facts]. The former is
suited to rhetoric, the latter to dialectic. For instance, under the first form the question is raised,
"Did so-and-so commit a murder?" The proof is
that he was found at the time with stains of blood
on him. 
<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
This is the rhetorical form of induction,
since rhetoric also is concerned with particular facts
and not with universals. It does not inquire about
justice in the abstract, but about particular cases of
justice. The other kind, where the general proposition is first established by means of particular
facts, is the induction of dialectic. For instance, the
question put is whether the soul is immortal, and
whether the living come back from the dead. And
this is proved in the dialogue
<hi rend='ital'>On the Soul</hi> by
means
of a certain general proposition, that opposites pro-
<pb n='327'/>
ceed from opposites. And the general proposition
itself is established by means of certain propositions
which are particular, as that sleep comes from
waking and
<hi rend='ital'>vice versa</hi>, the greater from the less
and
<hi rend='ital'>vice versa.</hi> This is the form which he used to
establish
his own views.</p>

<p>But, just as long ago in tragedy the chorus was
the only actor, and afterwards, in order to give the
chorus breathing space, Thespis devised a single
actor, Aeschylus a second, Sophocles a third, and
thus tragedy was completed, so too with philosophy: in early times it discoursed on one subject
only, namely physics, then Socrates added the second
subject, ethics, and Plato the third, dialectics, and
so brought philosophy to perfection. Thrasylus says
that he published his dialogues in tetralogies, like
those of the tragic poets. Thus they contended with
four plays at the Dionysia, the Lenaea, the Panathenaea and the festival of Chytri.<note n='a'>Pots.</note> Of the
four
plays the last was a satiric drama; and the four
together were called a tetralogy.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>
<p>Now, says Thrasylus, the genuine dialogues are
fifty-six in all, if the
<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> be divided into
ten and
the
<hi rend='ital'>Laws</hi> into twelve. Favorinus, however, in the
second book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History</hi> declares
that
nearly the whole of the
<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> is to be found in
a work of Protagoras entitled
<hi rend='ital'>Controversies.</hi><note
n='b'>From iii. 37 we infer that Favorinus drew upon Aristoxenus for this wildly improbable assertion.</note> This
gives nine tetralogies, if the
<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> takes the
place
of one single work and the
<hi rend='ital'>Laws</hi> of another. His
first tetralogy has a common plan underlying it, for
he wishes to describe what the life of the philosopher
<pb n='329'/>
will be. To each of the works Thrasylus affixes a
double title, the one taken from the name of the
interlocutor, the other from the subject. 
<milestone unit="section" n="58"/>
This
tetralogy, then, which is the first, begins with the
<hi rend='ital'>Euthyphro</hi> or

Aristodemus, two to Archytas, four to Dionysius,
one to Hermias, Erastus and Coriscus, one each to
Leodamas, Dion and Perdiccas, and two to Dion's

and some others.</p>
<p>Some, including Aristophanes the grammarian,
arrange the dialogues arbitrarily in trilogies.

In the

<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
<p>Plato has employed a variety of terms in order
to make his system less intelligible to the ignorant.
But in a special sense he considers wisdom to be the
science of those things which are objects of thought
and really existent, the science which, he says, is
concerned with God and the soul as separate from
the body. And especially by wisdom he means
philosophy, which is a yearning for divine wisdom.
And in a general sense all experience is also termed
by him wisdom,
<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> when he calls a craftsman
wise.
And he applies the same terms with very different
meanings. For instance, the word
<foreign lang='greek'>fau=los</foreign>
(slight,
plain) is employed by him<note n='b'>As
<hi rend='ital'>e.g.

<foreign lang='greek'>ou) pa/nu fau=lon a)lla\ xalepo\n pisteu=sai.</foreign></note> in the sense of
<foreign lang='greek'>a(plou=s</foreign>
(simple, honest), just as it is applied to Heracles in
the
<hi rend='ital'>Licymnius</hi> of Euripides in the following
passage<note n='c'>Nauck,
<hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi
rend='super'>2</hi>, Eur. 473.</note>:</p>
<p>Plain (<foreign lang='greek'>fau=los</foreign>), unaccomplished,
staunch to do great deeds,
unversed in talk, with all his store of wisdom curtailed to
action.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
<p>But sometimes Plato uses this same word (<foreign lang='greek'>fau=los</foreign>)
to mean what is bad, and at other times for what is
small or petty. Again, he often uses different terms
to express the same thing. For instance, he calls the
Idea form (<foreign lang='greek'>ei)=dos</foreign>), genus (<foreign lang='greek'>ge/nos</foreign>), archetype (<foreign lang='greek'>para/-deigma</foreign>), principle 
(<foreign lang='greek'>a)rxh/</foreign>) and
cause (<foreign lang='greek'>ai)/tion</foreign>). He also
uses contrary expressions for the same thing. Thus
he calls the sensible thing both existent and non-
<pb n='335'/>
existent, existent inasmuch as it comes into being,
non-existent because it is continually changing. And
he says the Idea is neither in motion nor at rest;
that it is uniformly the same and yet both one and
many. And it is his habit to do this in many more
instances.</p>

<p>The right interpretation of his dialogues includes
three things: first, the meaning of every statement
must be explained; next, its purpose, whether it is
made for a primary reason or by way of illustration,
and whether to establish his own doctrines or to
refute his interlocutor; in the third place it remains
to examine its truth.</p>
<p>And since certain critical marks are affixed to his
works let us now say a word about these. The cross
X is taken to indicate peculiar expressions and

usage; the

on all sides in a circle, and is compounded of elements,
and, being divided at harmonic intervals, it forms
two circles which touch one another twice; and the
interior circle, being slit six times over, makes seven
circles in all. And this interior circle moves by way
of the diagonal to the left, and the other by way of
the side to the right. Hence also the one is supreme,
being a single circle, for the other interior circle was
divided; the former is the circle of the Same, the
latter that of the Other, whereby he means that the
motion of the soul is the motion of the universe
together with the revolutions of the planets.<note n='d'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 36 d-37
c.</note>.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>
<p>And the division from the centre to the circumference which is adjusted in harmony with the soul
being thus determined, the soul knows that which
is, and adjusts it proportionately because she has the
elements proportionately disposed in herself. And
when the circle of the Other revolves aright, the
result is opinion; but from the regular motion of
the circle of the Same comes knowledge. He set
forth two universal principles, God and matter, and
he calls God mind and cause; he held that matter
is devoid of form and unlimited, and that composite
things arise out of it<note n='e'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi
rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 50 d. e; 51 a.</note>; and that it was once in
<pb n='339'/>
disorderly motion but, inasmuch as God preferred
order to disorder, was by him brought together in one
place.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi
rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 30 a, 69 b.</note> 
<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
This substance, he says, is
converted into
the four elements, fire, water, air, earth, of which
the world itself and all that therein is are formed.
Earth alone of these elements is not subject to
change, the assumed cause being the peculiarity of
its constituent triangles. For he thinks that in all
the other elements the figures employed are homogeneous, the scalene triangle out of which they are
all put together being one and the same, whereas
for earth a triangle of peculiar shape is employed;
the element of fire is a pyramid, of air an octahedron,
of water an icosahedron, of earth a cube. Hence
earth is not transmuted into the other three elements,
nor these three into earth.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
<p>But the elements are not separated each into its
own region of the universe, because the revolution
unites their minute particles, compressing and forcing
them together into the centre, at the same time as
it separates the larger masses. Hence as they change
their shapes, so also do they change the regions which
they occupy.<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,

<p>And there is one created universe,<note n='c'><hi

And it is animate because that which is animate is

<hi

shape of its maker.

For that maker contains the
other living things, and this universe the shapes of
<pb n='341'/>
them all.<note n='a'>A perversion of
<hi rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 33 b.
To that which is to comprehend all animals in itself that shape seems proper which
comprehends in itself all shapes. Diogenes Laertius opposes,
not universe and its shape, but maker and universe.</note> It is smooth
and has no organ all round
because it has no need of organs. Moreover, the
universe remains imperishable because it is not dissolved into the Deity.<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi
rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 33 a-d; 34 b; 32 c; 63 a.</note> And the creation
as a whole
is caused by God, because it is the nature of the good
to be beneficent,<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi
rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 32 c, 33 a; 38 b; 41 a, 43 d.</note> and the
creation of the universe
has the highest good for its cause. For the most
beautiful of created things is due to the best of
intelligible causes<note n='d'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi
rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 29 e-30 a; 42 e.</note>; so that, as God is of
this nature,
and the universe resembles the best in its perfect
beauty, it will not be in the likeness of anything
created, but only of God.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>
<p>The universe is composed of fire, water, air and
earth; of fire in order to be visible; of earth in
order to be solid; of water and air in order to be
proportional.<note n='e'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. Tim.</hi> 31 b-33 a. It
would be more correct to say
"in order that the bonds, the inserted terms (air and water),
which unite fire to earth, may be proportional." "For the
best of bonds is that which makes itself and the things which
it binds as complete a unity as possible; and the nature of
proportion is to accomplish this most perfectly" (<hi
rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 31 c).</note> For the powers represented by solids
are connected by two mean proportionals in a way
to secure the complete unity of the whole. And the
universe was made of all the elements in order to be
complete and indestructible.</p>
<p>Time was created as an image of eternity. And
while the latter remains for ever at rest, time consists in the motion of the universe. For night and
day and month and the like are all parts of time;
for which reason, apart from the nature of the
universe, time has no existence. But so soon as the
universe is fashioned time exists.<note n='f'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>
Plato,
<hi rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 37 d-38 b.</note></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>
<p>And the sun and moon and planets were created
<pb n='343'/>
as means to the creation of time. And God kindled
the light of the sun in order that the number of the
seasons might be definite and in order that animals
might possess number. The moon is in the circle
immediately above the earth, and the sun in that
which is next beyond that, and in the circles above
come the planets. Further, the universe is an
animate being, for it is bound fast in animate movement.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi
rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 38 c-39 d.</note> And in order that the universe
which had
been created in the likeness of the intelligible living
creature might be rendered complete, the nature
of all other animals was created. Since then its
pattern possesses them, the universe also ought to
have them. And thus it contains gods for the most
part of a fiery nature; of the rest there are three
kinds, winged, aquatic and terrestrial.<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 30 c-31 b; 39 c-40
a; 41 b, c.</note> 
<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>
And of all
the gods in heaven the earth is the oldest. And it
was fashioned to make night and day. And being
at the centre it moves round the centre.<note n='c'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 40 b, c.</note>
And since
there are two causes, it must be affirmed, he says,
that some things are due to reason and others have
a necessary cause,<note n='d'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi
rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 46 d, e; 47 e; 48 a; 68 e; 69 a.</note> the latter
being air, fire, earth
and water, which are not exactly elements but rather
recipients of form.<note n='e'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi
rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 49 a
<hi rend='ital'>sqq.;</hi> 50 b-51 b; 52 a,

and are resolved into triangles. The scalene triangle and the isosceles triangle are their constituent
elements.<note n='f'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi
rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 53 c-55 c.</note></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>
<p>The principles, then, and causes assumed are the
two above mentioned, of which God and matter are
the exemplar. Matter is of necessity formless like
the other recipients of form. Of all these there is
a necessary cause. For it somehow or other receives
the ideas and so generates substances, and it moves
because its power is not uniform, and, being in
<pb n='345'/>
motion, it in turn sets in motion those things which
are generated from it. And these were at first in
irrational and irregular motion, but after they began
to frame the universe, under the conditions possible
they were made by God symmetrical and regular.
<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
For the two causes existed even before the world
was made, as well as becoming in the third place, but
they were not distinct, merely traces of them being
found, and in disorder. When the world was made,
they too acquired order.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi
rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 52 d; 53 b; 57 c; 69 b, c.</note> And out of all
the bodies
there are the universe was fashioned. He holds God,
like the soul, to be incorporeal. For only thus is he
exempt from change and decay. As already stated,
he assumes the Ideas to be causes and principles
whereby the world of natural objects is what it is.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
<p>On good and evil he would discourse to this effect.
He maintained that the end to aim at is assimilation
to God, that virtue is in itself sufficient for happiness,
but that it needs in addition, as instruments for use,
first, bodily advantages like health and strength,
sound senses and the like, and, secondly, external
advantages such as wealth, good birth and reputation. But the wise man will be no less happy even
if he be without these things. Again, he will take
part in public affairs, will marry, and will refrain
from breaking the laws which have been made. And
as far as circumstances allow he will legislate for
his own country, unless in the extreme corruption of
the people he sees that the state of affairs completely
justifies his abstention. 
<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>
He thinks that the gods
take note of human life<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi
rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 30 b; 44 c.</note> and that there are superhuman beings.<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi
rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 40 d.</note> He was the first to define the
notion of good as that which is bound up with
<pb n='347'/>
whatever is praiseworthy and rational and useful
and proper and becoming. And all these are bound
up with that which is consistent and in accord with
nature.</p>
<p>He also discoursed on the propriety of names, and
indeed he was the first to frame a science for rightly
asking and answering questions, having employed it
himself to excess. And in the dialogues he conceived
righteousness to be the law of God because it is
stronger to incite men to do righteous acts, that
malefactors may not be punished after death also.
<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>
Hence to some he appeared too fond of myths.
These narratives he intermingles with his works in
order to deter men from wickedness, by reminding
them how little they know of what awaits them<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato,
<hi rend='ital'>Tim.</hi> 42 b.</note> after
death. Such, then, are the doctrines he approved.</p>
<p>He used also to divide things, according to Aristotle, in the following manner.<note n='b'> The third appendix begins
here, containing the
<foreign lang='greek'>diaire/seis</foreign>
which are also attributed to Aristotle; see Rose,
<hi
rend='ital'>Aristoteles
Pseudepigraphus,</hi> pp. 679
<hi rend='ital'>sqq.,</hi> who gives a
Christian recension. The original, the common source of Diogenes Laertius
and the Christian writer, he refers vaguely to the Hellenistio
age.</note> Goods are in the
mind or in the body, or external. For example,
justice, prudence, courage, temperance and such like
are in the mind; beauty, a good constitution, health
and strength in the body; while friends, the welfare
of one's country and riches are amongst external
things.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="81"/>
<p>Thus there are three kinds of goods: goods of the
mind, goods of the body and external goods. There
are three species of friendship: one species is natural,
another social, and another hospitable. By natural
friendship we mean the affection which parents have
for their offspring and kinsmen for each other. And
other animals besides man have inherited this form.</p>
<pb n='349'/>
<p>By the social form of friendship we mean that which
arises from intimacy and has nothing to do with
kinship; for instance, that of Pylades for Orestes.
The friendship of hospitality is that which is extended
to strangers owing to an introduction or letters of
recommendation. Thus friendship is either natural
or social or hospitable. Some add a fourth species,
that of love.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="82"/>
<p>There are five forms of civil government: one form
is democratic, another aristocratic, a third oligarchic,
a fourth monarchic, a fifth that of a tyrant. The
democratic form is that in which the people has control and chooses at its own pleasure both magistrates
and laws. The aristocratic form is that in which the
rulers are neither the rich nor the poor nor the
nobles, but the state is under the guidance of the
best. Oligarchy is that form in which there is a
property-qualification for the holding of office; for
the rich are fewer than the poor. Monarchy is
either regulated by law or hereditary. At Carthage
the kingship is regulated by law, the office being
put up for sale.<note n='a'>Plato probably refers to Carthage when he
mentions
<hi rend='ital'>purchasable</hi> kingship,
<foreign lang='greek'>w)nhtai\
basilei=ai</foreign>, amongst barbarians,
<hi rend='ital'>Rep.</hi> 544 d. Aristotle repeats the epithet in his
description
of the Carthaginian constitution,
<hi rend='ital'>Pol.</hi> ii. 11,
1273 a 36.
Polybius says that at Carthage magistrates attain office,
<foreign lang='greek'>dw=ra
fanerw=s dido/ntes</foreign>, vi. 56. 4. This phrase is some help
towards an explanation, but whether it means open bribery
--possibly of the people, more probably of the Council--
or whether it refers to very large fees payable upon taking
office, it is not easy to determine. In either case wealth
would preponderate over merit.</note> 
<milestone unit="section" n="83"/>
But the monarchy in Lacedaemon
and in Macedonia is hereditary, for they select the
king from a certain family. A tyranny is that form
in which the citizens are ruled either through fraud
or force by an individual. Thus civil government
is either democratic, aristocratic, oligarchic, or a
monarchy or a tyranny.</p>
<p>There are three species of justice. One is con-
<pb n='351'/>
cerned with gods, another with men, and the third
with the departed. For those who sacrifice according to the laws and take care of the temples are
obviously pious towards the gods. Those again who
repay loans and restore what they have received
upon trust act justly towards men. Lastly, those
who take care of tombs are obviously just towards
the departed. Thus one species of justice relates to
the gods, another to men, while a third species is
concerned with the departed.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="84"/>
<p>There are three species of knowledge or science,
one practical, another productive, and a third theoretical. For architecture and shipbuilding are productive arts, since the work produced by them can
be seen. Politics and flute-playing, harp-playing
and similar arts are practical. For nothing visible
is produced by them; yet they do or perform something. In the one case the artist plays the flute or
the harp, in the other the politician takes part in
politics. Geometry and harmonics and astronomy
are theoretical sciences. For they neither perform
nor produce anything. But the geometer considers
how lines are related to each other, the student of
harmony investigates sounds, the astronomer stars
and the universe. Thus some sciences are theoretical,
others are practical, and others are productive.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="85"/>
<p>There are five species of medicine : the first is
pharmacy, the second is surgery, the third deals
with diet and regimen, the fourth with diagnosis,
the fifth with remedies. Pharmacy cures sickness
by drugs, surgery heals by the use of knife and
cautery, the species concerned with diet prescribes
a regimen for the removal of disease, that concerned
with diagnosis proceeds by determining the nature
<pb n='353'/>
of the ailment, that concerned with remedies by
prescribing for the immediate removal of the pain.
The species of medicine, then, are pharmacy, surgery, diet and regimen, diagnosis, prescription of
remedies.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="86"/>
<p>There are two divisions of law, the one written
and the other unwritten. Written law is that under
which we live in different cities, but that which has
arisen out of custom is called unwritten law; for
instance, not to appear in the market-place undressed
or in women's attire. There is no statute forbidding
this, but nevertheless we abstain from such conduct
because it is prohibited by an unwritten law. Thus
law is either written or unwritten.</p>
<p>There are five kinds of speech, of which one is
that which politicians employ in the assemblies;
this is called political speech. 
<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>
The second division
is that which the rhetors employ in written compositions, whether composed for display or praise or
blame, or for accusation. Hence this division is
termed rhetorical. The third division of speech is
that of private persons conversing with one another;
this is called the mode of speech of ordinary life.
Another division of speech is the language of those
who converse by means of short questions and
answers; this kind is called dialectical. The fifth
division is the speech of craftsmen conversing about
their own subjects; this is called technical language.
Thus speech is either political, or rhetorical, or that
of ordinary conversation, or dialectical, or technical.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>
<p>Music has three divisions. One employs the mouth
alone, like singing. The second employs both the
<pb n='355'/>
mouth and the hands, as is the case with the harper
singing to his own accompaniment. The third
division employs the hands alone; for instance, the
music of the harp. Thus music employs either the
mouth alone, or the mouth and the hands, or the
hands alone.</p>
<p>Nobility has four divisions. First, when the ancestors are gentle and handsome and also just, their
descendants are said to be noble. Secondly, when
the ancestors have been princes or magistrates, their
descendants are said to be noble. The third kind
arises when the ancestors have been illustrious; for
instance, through having held military command or
through success in the national games. For then
we call the descendants noble. 
<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>
The last division
includes the man who is himself of a generous and
high-minded spirit. He too is said to be noble.
And this indeed is the highest form of nobility.
Thus, of nobility, one kind depends on excellent
ancestors, another on princely ancestors, a third on
illustrious ancestors, while the fourth is due to the
individual's own beauty and worth.</p>
<p>Beauty has three divisions. The first is the object
of praise, as of form fair to see. Another is serviceable; thus an instrument, a house and the like are
beautiful for use. Other things again which relate
to customs and pursuits and the like are beautiful
because beneficial. Of beauty, then, one kind is
matter for praise, another is for use, and another
for the benefit it procures.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="90"/>
<p>The soul has three divisions. One part of it is
rational, another appetitive, and a third irascible.
Of these the rational part is the cause of purpose,
reflection, understanding and the like. The appeti-
<pb n='357'/>
tive part of the soul is the cause of desire of eating,
sexual indulgence and the like, while the irascible
part is the cause of courage, of pleasure and pain,
and of anger. Thus one part of the soul is rational,
another appetitive, and a third irascible.</p>
<p>Of perfect virtue there are four species: prudence,
justice, bravery and temperance. 
<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>
Of these prudence
is the cause of right conduct, justice of just dealing
in partnerships and commercial transactions. Bravery
is the cause which makes a man not give way but
stand his ground in alarms and perils. Temperance
causes mastery over desires, so that we are never
enslaved by any pleasure, but lead an orderly life.
Thus virtue includes first prudence, next justice,
thirdly bravery, and lastly temperance.</p>
<p>Rule has five divisions, one that which is according
to law, another according to nature, another according to custom, a fourth by birth, a fifth by force.
<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>
Now the magistrates in cities when elected by their
fellow-citizens rule according to law. The natural
rulers are the males, not only among men, but
also among the other animals; for the males everywhere exert wide-reaching rule over the females.
Rule according to custom is such authority as
attendants exercise over children and teachers over
their pupils. Hereditary rule is exemplified by that
of the Lacedaemonian kings, for the office of king is
confined to a certain family. And the same system
is in force for the kingdom of Macedonia; for there
too the office of king goes by birth. Others have
<pb n='359'/>
acquired power by force or fraud, and govern the
citizens against their will; this kind of rule is called
forcible. Thus rule is either by law, or by nature,
or by custom, or by birth, or by force.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="93"/>
<p>There are six kinds of rhetoric. For when the
speakers urge war or alliance with a neighbouring
state, that species of rhetoric is called persuasion.
But when they speak against making war or alliance,
and urge their hearers to remain at peace, this kind
of rhetoric is called dissuasion. A third kind is
employed when a speaker asserts that he is wronged
by some one whom he makes out to have caused
him much mischief; accusation is the name applied
to the kind here defined. The fourth kind of rhetoric
is termed defence; here the speaker shows that he
has done no wrong and that his conduct is in no
respect abnormal; defence is the term applied in
such a case. 
<milestone unit="section" n="94"/>
A fifth kind of rhetoric is employed
when a speaker speaks well of some one and proves
him to be worthy and honourable; encomium is the
name given to this kind. A sixth kind is that
employed when the speaker shows some one to be unworthy; the name given to this is invective. Under
rhetoric, then, are included encomium, invective,
persuasion, dissuasion, accusation and defence.</p>
<p>Successful speaking has four divisions. The first
consists in speaking to the purpose, the next to the
requisite length, the third before the proper audience,
and the fourth at the proper moment. The things
to the purpose are those which are likely to be
expedient for speaker and hearer. The requisite
length is that which is neither more nor less than
enough. 
<milestone unit="section" n="95"/>
To speak to the proper audience means
this: in addressing persons older than yourself, the
<pb n='361'/>
discourse must be made suitable to the audience as
being elderly men; whereas in addressing juniors
the discourse must be suitable to young men.
The proper time of speaking is neither too soon nor
too late; otherwise you will miss the mark and not
speak with success.</p>
<p>Of conferring benefits there are four divisions.
For it takes place either by pecuniary aid or by
personal service, by means of knowledge or of speech.
Pecuniary aid is given when one assists a man in
need, so that he is relieved from all anxiety on the
score of money. Personal service is given when men
come up to those who are being beaten and rescue
them. 
<milestone unit="section" n="96"/>
Those who train or heal, or who teach something valuable, confer benefit by means of knowledge.
But when men enter a law-court and one appears as
advocate for another and delivers an effective speech
on his behalf, he is benefiting him by speech. Thus
benefits are conferred by means either of money or
of personal service, or of knowledge, or of speech.</p>
<p>There are four ways in which things are completed
and brought to an end. The first is by legal enactment, when a decree is passed and this decree is
confirmed by law. The second is in the course of
nature, as the day, the year and the seasons are
completed. The third is by the rules of art, say the
builder's art, for so a house is completed; and so it
is with shipbuilding, whereby vessels are completed.
<milestone unit="section" n="97"/>
Fourthly, matters are brought to an end by chance
or accident, when they turn out otherwise than is
expected. Thus the completion of things is due
either to law, or to nature, or to art, or to chance.</p>
<p>Of power or ability there are four divisions. First,
whatever we can do with the mind, namely calculate
<pb n='363'/>
or anticipate; next, whatever we can effect with the
body, for instance, marching, giving, taking and the
like. Thirdly, whatever we can do by a multitude
of soldiers or a plentiful supply of money; hence a
king is said to have great power. The fourth division
of power or influence is doing, or being done by, well
or ill; thus we can become ill or be educated, be
restored to health and the like. Power, then, is
either in the mind, or the body, or in armies and
resources, or in acting and being acted upon.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="98"/>
<p>Philanthropy is of three kinds. One is by way of
salutations, as when certain people address every one
they meet and, stretching out their hand, give him
a hearty greeting; another mode is seen when one
is given to assisting every one in distress; another
mode of philanthropy is that which makes certain
people fond of giving dinners. Thus philanthropy is
shown either by a courteous address, or by conferring
benefits, or by hospitality and the promotion of social
intercourse.</p>
<p>Welfare or happiness includes five parts. One
part of it is good counsel, a second soundness of the
senses and bodily health, a third success in one's
undertakings, a fourth a reputation with one's
fellow-men, a fifth ample means in money and in
whatever else subserves the end of life. 
<milestone unit="section" n="99"/>
Now deliberating well is a result of education and of having
experience of many things. Soundness of the senses
depends upon the bodily organs: I mean, if one sees
with his eyes, hears with his ears, and perceives
with his nostrils and his mouth the appropriate
objects, then such a condition is soundness of the
senses. Success is attained when a man does what
he aims at in the right way, as becomes a good man.</p>
<pb n='365'/>
<p>A man has a good reputation when he is well spoken
of. A man has ample means when he is so equipped
for the needs of life that he can afford to benefit his
friends and discharge his public services with lavish
display. If a man has all these things, he is completely happy. Thus of welfare or happiness one
part is good counsel, another soundness of senses
and bodily health, a third success, a fourth a good
reputation, a fifth ample means.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="100"/>
<p>There are three divisions of the arts and crafts.
The first division consists of mining and forestry,
which are productive arts. The second includes
the smith's and carpenter's arts which transform
material; for the smith makes weapons out of iron,
and the carpenter transforms timber into flutes and
lyres. The third division is that which uses what is
thus made, as horsemanship employs bridles, the art
of war employs weapons, and music flutes and the
lyre. Thus of art there are three several species,
those above-mentioned in the first, second and third
place.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="101"/>
<p>Good is divided into four kinds. One is the possessor of virtue, whom we affirm to be individually
good. Another is virtue itself and justice; these
we affirm to be good. A third includes such things
as food, suitable exercises and drugs. The fourth
kind which we affirm to be good includes the arts of
flute-playing, acting and the like. Thus there are
four kinds of good: the possession of virtue; virtue
itself; thirdly, food and beneficial exercises; lastly,
flute-playing, acting, and the poetic art. 
<milestone unit="section" n="102"/>
Whatever
is is either evil or good or indifferent. We call that
evil which is capable of invariably doing harm; for
<pb n='367'/>
instance, bad judgement and folly and injustice and
the like. The contraries of these things are good.
But the things which can sometimes benefit and
sometimes harm, such as walking and sitting and
eating, or which can neither do any benefit nor
harm at all, these are things indifferent, neither
good nor evil. Thus all things whatever are either
good, or evil, or neither good nor evil.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>
<p>Good order in the state falls under three heads.
First, if the laws are good, we say that there is good
government. Secondly, if the citizens obey the
established laws, we also call this good government.
Thirdly, if, without the aid of laws, the people
manage their affairs well under the guidance of
customs and institutions, we call this again good
government. Thus three forms of good government may exist, (1) when the laws are good, (2) when
the existing laws are obeyed, (3) when the people
live under salutary customs and institutions.</p>
<p>Disorder in a state has three forms. The first
arises when the laws affecting citizens and strangers
are alike bad, 
<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>
the second when the existing laws are
not obeyed, and the third when there is no law at
all. Thus the state is badly governed when the laws
are bad or not obeyed, or lastly, when there is no law.</p>
<p>Contraries are divided into three species. For
instance, we say that goods are contrary to evils, as
justice to injustice, wisdom to folly, and the like.
Again, evils are contrary to evils, prodigality is
contrary to niggardliness, and to be unjustly tortured
is the contrary of being justly tortured, and so with
similar evils. Again, heavy is the contrary of light,
<pb n='369'/>
quick of slow, black of white, and these pairs are
contraries, while they are neither good nor evil. 
<milestone unit="section" n="105"/>
Thus,
of contraries, some are opposed as goods to evils,
others as evils to evils, and others, as things which are
neither good nor evil, are opposed to one another.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of goods, those which can
be exclusively possessed, those which can be shared
with others, and those which simply exist. To the
first division, namely, those which can be exclusively
possessed, belong such things as justice and health.
To the next belong all those which, though they
cannot be exclusively possessed, can be shared with
others. Thus we cannot possess the absolute good,
but we can participate in it. The third division
includes those goods the existence of which is
necessary, though we can neither possess them exclusively nor participate in them. The mere existence of worth and justice is a good; and these things
cannot be shared or had in exclusive possession, but
must simply exist. Of goods, then, some are possessed exclusively, some shared, and others merely
subsist.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="106"/>
<p>Counsel is divided under three heads. One is
taken from past time, one from the future, and the
third from the present. That from past time consists of examples; for instance, what the Lacedaemonians suffered through trusting others. Counsel
drawn from the present is to show, for instance, that
the walls are weak, the men cowards, and the
supplies running short. Counsel from the future is.
for instance, to urge that we should not wrong the
embassies by suspicions, lest the fair fame of Hellas
be stained. Thus counsel is derived from the past,
the present and the future.</p>
<pb n='371'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="107"/>
<p>Vocal sound falls into two divisions according as it
is animate or inanimate. The voice of living things
is animate sound; notes of instruments and noises
are inanimate. And of the animate voice part is
articulate, part inarticulate, that of men being
articulate speech, that of the animals inarticulate.
Thus vocal sound is either animate or inanimate.</p>
<p>Whatever exists is either divisible or indivisible.
Of divisible things some are divisible into similar
and others into dissimilar parts. Those things are
indivisible which cannot be divided and are not
compounded of elements, for example, the unit,
the point and the musical note; whereas those which
have constituent parts, for instance, syllables, concords in music, animals, water, gold, are divisible.
<milestone unit="section" n="108"/>
If they are composed of similar parts, so that the
whole does not differ from the part except in bulk,
as water, gold and all that is fusible, and the like,
then they are termed homogeneous. But whatever
is composed of dissimilar parts, as a house and the
like, is termed heterogeneous. Thus all things whatever are either divisible or indivisible, and of those
which are divisible some are homogeneous, others
heterogeneous in their parts.</p>
<p>Of existing things some are absolute and some are
called relative. Things said to exist absolutely are
those which need nothing else to explain them, as
man, horse, and all other animals. 
<milestone unit="section" n="109"/>
For none of these
gains by explanation. To those which are called
relative belong all which stand in need of some
explanation, as that which is greater than something
or quicker than something, or more beautiful and
the like. For the greater implies a less, and the
quicker is quicker than something. Thus existing
<pb n='373'/>
things are either absolute or relative. And in this
way, according to Aristotle, Plato used to divide the
primary conceptions also.</p>
<p>There was also another man named Plato, a
philosopher of Rhodes, a pupil of Panaetius, as is
stated by Seleucus the grammarian in his first book
<hi rend='ital'>On Philosophy</hi>; another a Peripatetic and pupil of
Aristotle; and another who was a pupil of Praxiphanes; and lastly, there was Plato, the poet of the
Old Comedy.</p>

<p>The foregoing is the best account of Plato that we
were able to compile after a diligent examination of
the authorities. He was succeeded by Speusippus,
an Athenian and son of Eurymedon, who belonged

sister Potone. He was head of the school for eight
years beginning in the 108th Olympiad.<note n='a'>348-344 b.c.</note>
He set
up statues of the Graces in the shrine of the Muses
erected by Plato in the Academy. He adhered
faithfully to Plato's doctrines. In character, however,
he was unlike him, being prone to anger and easily
overcome by pleasures. At any rate there is a story
that in a fit of passion he flung his favourite dog
into the well, and that pleasure was the sole motive
for his journey to Macedonia to be present at the
wedding-feast of Casander.</p>

<p>It was said that among those who attended his
lectures were the two women who had been pupils
of Plato, Lastheneia of Mantinea and Axiothea of

derisively, "We may judge of your wisdom by the
Arcadian girl who is your pupil. And, whereas
Plato exempted from fees all who came to him, you

<head>Chapter 2. XENOCRATES (396-314 B.C.)
(Head of the Academy 339-314 B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="6">
<p>Xenocrates, the son of Agathenor, was a native of
Chalcedon. He was a pupil of Plato from his earliest
youth; moreover he accompanied him on his journey
to Sicily. He was naturally slow and clumsy. Hence
Plato, comparing him to Aristotle, said, "The one
needed a spur, the other a bridle." And again,
"See what an ass I am training and what a horse
he has to run against." However, Xenocrates was
in all besides dignified and grave of demeanour,
which made Plato say to him continually, "Xenocrates, sacrifice to the Graces." He spent most of
his time in the Academy; and whenever he was going
to betake himself to the city, it is said that all the
noisy rabble and hired porters made way for him as
he passed. 
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
And that once the notorious Phryne
tried to make his acquaintance and, as if she were
being chased by some people, took refuge under his
roof; that he admitted her out of ordinary humanity
and, there being but one small couch in the room,
permitted her to share it with him, and at last, after
<pb n='383'/>
many importunities, she retired without success,
telling those who inquired that he whom she quitted
was not a man but a statue. Another version of the
story is that his pupils induced La&iuml;s to invade his
couch; and that so great was his endurance that he
many times submitted to amputation and cautery.
His words were entirely worthy of credit, so much
so that, although it was illegal for witnesses to give
evidence unsworn, the Athenians allowed Xenocrates
alone to do so. 
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
Furthermore, he was extremely
independent; at all events, when Alexander sent
him a large sum of money, he took three thousand
Attic drachmas and sent back the rest to Alexander,
whose needs, he said, were greater than his own,
because he had a greater number of people to keep.
Again, he would not accept the present sent him by
Antipater, as Myronianus attests in his
<hi rend='ital'>Parallels.</hi>
And when he had been honoured at the court of
Dionysius with a golden crown as the prize for his
prowess in drinking at the Feast of Pitchers, he went
out and placed it on the statue of Hermes just as
he had been accustomed to place there garlands of
flowers. There is a story that, when he was sent,
along with others also, on an embassy to Philip, his
colleagues, being bribed, accepted Philip's invitations to feasts and talked with him. Xenocrates
did neither the one nor the other. Indeed on this
account Philip declined to see him. 
<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
Hence, when
the envoys returned to Athens, they complained
that Xenocrates had accompanied them without
rendering any service. Thereupon the people were
ready to fine him. But when he told them that
now more than ever they ought to consider the
interests of the state--"for," said he, "Philip knew
<pb n='385'/>
that the others had accepted his bribes, but that he
would never win me over"--then the people paid
him double honours. And afterwards Philip said that,
of all who had arrived at his court, Xenocrates was
the only man whom he could not bribe. Moreover,
when he went as envoy to Antipater to plead for
Athenians taken prisoners in the Lamian war,<note n='a'>322 b.c.</note>
being
invited to dine with Antipater, he quoted to him
the following lines<note n='b'>Hom.
<hi rend='ital'>Od.</hi> x.
383-5.</note>:</p>
<p>O Circe! what righteous man would have the heart to
taste meat and drink ere he had redeemed his company and
beheld them face to face?</p>
<p>and so pleased Antipater with his ready wit that he
at once released them.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
<p>When a little sparrow was pursued by a hawk and
rushed into his bosom, he stroked it and let it go,
declaring that a suppliant must not be betrayed.
When bantered by Bion, he said he would make no
reply. For neither, said he, does tragedy deign to
answer the banter of comedy. To some one who had
never learnt either music or geometry or astronomy,
but nevertheless wished to attend his lectures,
Xenocrates said, "Go your ways, for you offer
philosophy nothing to lay hold of." Others report
him as saying, "It is not to me that you come for
the carding of a fleece."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>
<p>When Dionysius told Plato that he would lose his
head, Xenocrates, who was present, pointed to his
own and added, "No man shall touch it till he cut
off mine." They say too that, when Antipater came
to Athens and greeted him, he did not address him
in return until he had finished what he was saying.
He was singularly free from pride; more than once
<pb n='387'/>
a day he would retire into himself, and he assigned,
it is said, a whole hour to silence.</p>
<p>He left a very large number of treatises, poems

<p>Polemo, the son of Philostratus, was an Athenian

Even in
the Academy a piece of three obols was found close
to a pillar, where he had buried it for the same
purpose. And one day, by agreement with his
young friends, he burst into the school of Xenocrates
quite drunk, with a garland on his head. Xenocrates,
however, without being at all disturbed, went on
with his discourse as before, the subject being
temperance. The lad, as he listened, by degrees
was taken in the toils. He became so industrious
<pb n='395'/>
as to surpass all the other scholars, and rose to be
himself head of the school in the 116th Olympiad.<note n='a'>316-312
b.c.</note></p>
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
<p>Antigonus of Carystus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Biographies</hi> says
that
his father was foremost among the citizens and kept
horses to compete in the chariot-race; that Polemo
himself had been defendant in an action brought by
his wife, who charged him with cruelty owing to the
irregularities of his life; but that, from the time
when he began to study philosophy, he acquired
such strength of character as always to maintain the
same unruffled calm of demeanour. Nay more, he
never lost control of his voice. This in fact accounts
for the fascination which he exercised over Crantor.
<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. infra,</hi> &sect;24.</note>
Certain it is that, when a mad dog bit him in the
back of his thigh, he did not even turn pale, but
remained undisturbed by all the clamour which
arose in the city at the news of what had happened.
In the theatre too he was singularly unmoved. 
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
For
instance, Nicostratus, who was nicknamed Clytemnestra, was once reading to him and Crates something from Homer; and, while Crates was deeply
affected, he was no more moved than if he had
not heard him. Altogether he was a man such as
Melanthius the painter describes in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On
Painting.</hi> There he says that a certain wilfulness
and stubbornness should be stamped on works of
art, and that the same holds good of character.
Polemo used to say that we should exercise ourselves with facts and not with mere logical speculations, which leave us, like a man who has got by
heart some paltry handbook on harmony but never
practised, able, indeed, to win admiration for skill
in asking questions, but utterly at variance with
ourselves in the ordering of our lives.</p>
<pb n='397'/>
<p>He was, then, refined and generous, and would beg
to be excused, in the words of Aristophanes about
Euripides, the "acid, pungent style," 
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>
which, as the
same author says, is "strong seasoning for meat when
it is high."<note n='a'>Frag. 180 Dind.</note> Further, he would not,
they say, even
sit down to deal with the themes of his pupils, but
would argue walking up and down. It was, then,
for his love of what is noble that he was honoured
in the state. Nevertheless would he withdraw from
society
<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra,</hi>i. &sect; 112 note.</note>
and confine himself to the Garden of the
Academy, while close by his scholars made themselves little huts and lived not far from the shrine of
the Muses and the lecture-hall. It would seem that
in all respects Polemo emulated Xenocrates. And
Aristippus in the fourth book of his work
<hi rend='ital'>On the
Luxury of the Ancients</hi> affirms him to have been his
favourite. Certainly he always kept his predecessor
before his mind and, like him, wore that simple
austere dignity which is proper to the Dorian mode.
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>
He loved Sophocles, particularly in those passages
where it seemed as if, in the phrase of the comic
poet,</p>

<p>Nor must, nor blended vintage, but true Pramnian.</p>
<p>Thus he would call Homer the Sophocles of epic, and
Sophocles the Homer of tragedy</p>
<p>He died at an advanced age of gradual decay,
leaving behind him a considerable number of works.
I have composed the following epigram upon him<note n='d'><hi

<p>Crates, whose father was Antigenes, was an
Athenian belonging to the deme of Thria. He was
a pupil and at the same time a favourite of Polemo,
whom he succeeded in the headship of the school.
The two were so much attached to each other that
they not only shared the same pursuits in life but
grew more and more alike to their latest breath, and,
dying, shared the same tomb. Hence Antagoras,
writing of both, employed this figure<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.

<p>Passing stranger, say that in this tomb rest godlike

<p>Hence Arcesilaus, who had quitted Theophrastus
and gone over to their school, said of them that they
were gods or a remnant of the Golden Age. They
did not side with the popular party, but were such
as Dionysodorus the flute-player is said to have
claimed to be, when he boasted that no one ever
heard his melodies, as those of Ismenias were heard,
either on shipboard or at the fountain. According
to Antigonus, their common table was in the house
of Crantor; and these two and Arcesilaus lived in
harmony together. Arcesilaus and Crantor shared
the same house, while Polemo and Crates lived with
<pb n='401'/>
Lysicles, one of the citizens. Crates, as already
stated, was the favourite of Polemo and Arcesilaus
of Crantor.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>
<p>According to Apollodorus in the third book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi>, Crates at his death left behind him
works,
some of a philosophical kind, others on comedy,
others again speeches delivered in the assembly or
when he was envoy. He also left distinguished
pupils; among them Arcesilaus, of whom we shall
speak presently--for he was also a pupil of Crates;
another was Bion of Borysthenes, who was afterwards
known as the Theodorean, from the school which he
joined; of him too we shall have occasion to speak
next after Arcesilaus.</p>
<p>There have been ten men who bore the name of
Crates: (1) the poet of the Old Comedy; (2) a
rhetorician of Tralles, a pupil of Isocrates; (3) a
sapper and miner who accompanied Alexander; (4)
the Cynic, of whom more hereafter; (5) a Peripatetic
philosopher; (6) the Academic philosopher described
above; (7) a grammarian of Malos; (8) the author of
a geometrical work; (9) a composer of epigrams;
(10) an Academic philosopher of Tarsus.</p>

<div3 type="section" n="24">
<p>Crantor of Soli, though he was much esteemed in
his native country, left it for Athens and attended
the lectures of Xenocrates at the same time as
Polemo. He left memoirs extending to 30,000
lines, some of which are by some critics attributed
to Arcesilaus. He is said to have been asked what
it was in Polemo that attracted him, and to have
<pb n='403'/>
replied, "The fact that I never heard him raise or
lower his voice in speaking." He happened to fall
ill, and retired to the temple of Asclepius, where he
proceeded to walk about. At once people flocked
round him in the belief that he had retired thither,
not on account of illness, but in order to open a
school. Among them was Arcesilaus, who wished to
be introduced by his means to Polemo, notwithstanding the affection which united the two, as will be
related in the Life of Arcesilaus. 
<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>
However, when
he recovered, he continued to attend Polemo's
lectures, and for this he was universally praised. He
is also said to have left Arcesilaus his property, to
the value of twelve talents. And when asked by
him where he wished to be buried, he answered<note n='a'>Nauck,
<hi

<hi
rend='ital'>Adesp.</hi> 281.</note>:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>Sweet in some nook of native soil to

<p>It is also said that he wrote poems and deposited
them under seal in the temple of Athena in his
native place. And Theaetetus the poet writes thus
of him<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> ii. 28.</note>:</p>
<p>Pleasing to men, more pleasing to the Muses, lived Crantor,
and never saw old age. Receive, O earth, the hallowed
dead; gently may he live and thrive even in the world
below.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>
<p>Crantor admired Homer and Euripides above all
other poets; it is hard, he said, at once to write
tragedy and to stir the emotions in the language of
everyday life. And he would quote the line from
the story of Bellerophon<note n='c'>Nauck,
<hi
rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi rend='super'>2</hi>,
<hi
rend='ital'>Eur.</hi> 300.</note>:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>Alas! But why Alas? We have suffered the lot of
mortals.</hi></p>
<p>And it is said that there are extant<note n='d'><hi
rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> iii. 60.</note> these lines of the
poet Antagoras, spoken by Crantor on Love:
<pb n='405'/>
My mind is in doubt, since thy birth is disputed, whether
I am to call thee, Love, the first of the immortal gods, the
eldest of all the children whom old Erebus and queenly
Night brought to birth in the depths beneath wide Ocean;
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>
or art thou the child of wise Cypris, or of Earth, or of the
Winds? So many are the goods and ills thou devisest for
men in thy wanderings. Therefore hast thou a body of
double form.</p>
<p>He was also clever at inventing terms. For instance, he said of a tragic player's voice that it
was unpolished and unpeeled. And of a certain poet
that his verses abounded in miserliness. And that
the disquisitions of Theophrastus were written with
an oyster-shell. His most highly esteemed work is
the treatise
<hi rend='ital'>On Grief.</hi><note n='a'>"Legimus omnes

Crates, his end being hastened by dropsy. I have
composed upon him the following epigram<note n='b'><hi

<p>The worst of maladies overwhelmed you, Crantor, and

<div2 n="6" type="chapter">
<head>Chapter 6. ARCESILAUS (c. 318-242 B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="28">
<p>Arcesilaus, the son of Seuthes, according to Apollodorus in the third book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi>, came
from
Pitane in Aeolis. With him begins the Middle
Academy; he was the first to suspend his judgement
owing to the contradictions of opposing arguments.
He was also the first to argue on both sides of a
question, and the first to meddle with the system
handed down by Plato and, by means of question
and answer, to make it more closely resemble eristic.</p>
<pb n='407'/>
<p>He came across Crantor in this way. He was the
youngest of four brothers, two of them being his
brothers by the same father, and two by the same
mother. Of the last two Pylades was the elder, and
of the former two Moereas, and Moereas was his
guardian. 
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
At first, before he left Pitane for Athens,
he was a pupil of the mathematician Autolycus, his
fellow-countryman, and with him he also travelled
to Sardis. Next he studied under Xanthus, the
musician, of Athens; then he was a pupil of Theophrastus. Lastly, he crossed over to the Academy
and joined Crantor. For while his brother Moereas,
who has already been mentioned, wanted to make
him a rhetorician, he was himself devoted to philosophy, and Crantor, being enamoured of him, cited
the line from the
<hi rend='ital'>Andromeda</hi> of Euripides<note
n='a'>Nauck,
<hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi rend='super'>2</hi>,
<hi
rend='ital'>Eur.</hi> 129.</note>:</p>
<p>O maiden, if I save thee, wilt thou be grateful to me?</p>
<p>and was answered with the next line<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Ib.</hi> 132.</note>:</p>
<p>Take me, stranger, whether for maidservant or for wife.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>
<p>After that they lived together. Whereupon Theophrastus, nettled at his loss, is said to have remarked,
"What a quick-witted and ready pupil has left my
school!" For, besides being most effective in argument and decidedly fond of writing books, he also
took up poetry. And there is extant an epigram of
his upon Attalus which runs thus<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Plan.</hi> iii. 56.</note>:</p>
<p>Pergamos, not famous in arms alone, is often celebrated
for its steeds in divine Pisa. And if a mortal may make
bold to utter the will of heaven, it will be much more sung
by bards in days to come.</p>
<pb n='409'/>
<p>And again upon Menodorus, the favourite of
Eugamus, one of his fellow-students<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Plan.</hi> ii. 382.</note>:</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
<p>Far, far away are Phrygia and sacred Thyatira, thy
native land, Menodorus, son of Cadanus. But to unspeakable Acheron the ways are equal, from whatever place they be
measured, as the proverb saith. To thee Eugamus raised
this far-seen monument, for thou wert dearest to him of all
who for him toiled.</p>
<p>He esteemed Homer above all the poets and would
always read a passage from him before going to
sleep. And in the morning he would say, whenever
he wanted to read Homer, that he would pay a visit
to his dear love. Pindar too he declared matchless
for imparting fullness of diction and for affording a
copious store of words and phrases. And in his youth
he made a special study of Ion.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>
<p>He also attended the lectures of the geometer
Hipponicus, at whom he pointed a jest as one who
was in all besides a listless, yawning sluggard but
yet proficient in his subject. "Geometry," he said,
"must have flown into his mouth while it was agape."
When this man's mind gave way, Arcesilaus took him
to his house and nursed him until he was completely
restored. He took over the school on the death of
Crates, a certain Socratides having retired in his
favour. According to some, one result of his suspending judgement on all matters was that he never
so much as wrote a book.<note n='b'>If this be so, the study of the
poet Ion
( &sect; 31) must have remained unpublished.</note>
Others relate that he was
caught revising some works of Crantor, which
according to some he published, according to others
he burnt. He would seem to have held Plato in
admiration, and he possessed a copy of his works.
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
Some represent him as emulous of Pyrrho as well.
He was devoted to dialectic and adopted the methods
<pb n='411'/>
of argument introduced by the Eretrian school. On
account of this Ariston said of him:</p>
<p>Plato the head of him, Pyrrho the tail, midway Diodorus.<note
n='a'>A parody of Homer,
<hi rend='ital'>Il.</hi> vi. 181: a chimaera
has a lion's
front, a dragon's tail, and the body of a goat.</note></p>
<p>And Timon speaks of him thus<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>
Hom.
<hi rend='ital'>Od.</hi> v. 346.</note>:</p>
<p>Having the lead of Menedemus at his heart, he will run
either to that mass of flesh, Pyrrho, or to Diodorus.</p>
<p>And a little farther on he introduces him as saying:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>I shall swim to Pyrrho and to crooked
Diodorus.</hi></p>
<p>He was highly axiomatic and concise, and in his discourse fond of distinguishing the meaning of terms.
He was satirical enough, and outspoken.
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
This is why
Timon speaks of him again as follows:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>And mixing sound sense with wily cavils.<note
n='c'>Or possibly with Wachsmuth: "mixing jest in wily
fashion (<foreign lang='greek'>ai(muli/ws</foreign>) with
abuse."</note></hi></p>
<p>Hence, when a young man talked more boldly
than was becoming, Arcesilaus exclaimed, "Will no
one beat him at a game of knuckle-bone?" Again,
when some one of immodest life denied that one
thing seemed to him greater than another, he
rejoined, "Then six inches and ten inches are all
the same to you?" There was a certain Hemon,
a Chian, who, though ugly, fancied himself to be
handsome, and always went about in fine clothes.
He having propounded as his opinion that the wise
man will never fall in love, Arcesilaus replied,
"What, not with one so handsome as you and so
handsomely dressed?" And when one of loose life,
to imply that Arcesilaus was arrogant, addressed
him thus<note n='d'>Nauck,
<hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi
rend='super'>2</hi>,
<hi rend='ital'>Adesp.</hi> 282.</note>:

<p>his reply was<note n='a'>Nauck,
<hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi

<hi rend='ital'>Adesp.</hi> 283:
<hi

<p>Woman, why talk so harshly, not as thou art wont?</p>
<p>When some talkative person of no family caused
him considerable trouble, he cited the line<note n='b'>Nauck,

<p><hi rend='center'>Right ill to live with are the sons of

<p>Of another who talked much nonsense he said that
he could not have had even a nurse to scold him.
And some persons he would not so much as answer.
To a money-lending student, upon his confessing
ignorance of something or other, Arcesilaus replied
with two lines from the
<hi rend='ital'>Oenomaus</hi> of Sophocles<note
n='c'>Nauck,
<hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi rend='super'>2</hi>, Soph.

<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>
<p>A certain dialectic, a follower of Alexinus, was
unable to repeat properly some argument of his
teacher, whereupon Arcesilaus reminded him of the
story of Philoxenus and the brickmakers. He found
them singing some of his melodies out of tune; so he
retaliated by trampling on the bricks they were
making, saying, "If you spoil my work, I'll spoil
yours." He was, moreover, genuinely annoyed with
any who took up their studies too late. By some
natural impulse he was betrayed into using such
phrases as "I assert," and "So-and-so" (mentioning
the name) "will not assent to this."<note n='e'>The use of these
phrases was inconsistent with the
suspension of judgement professed by Arcesilaus.</note> And this
trait
<pb n='415'/>
many of his pupils imitated, as they did also his
style of speaking and his whole address.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>
<p>Very fertile in invention, he could meet objection
acutely or bring the course of discussion back to
the point at issue, and fit it to every occasion.
In persuasiveness he had no equal, and this all the
more drew pupils to the school, although they were
in terror of his pungent wit. But they willingly put
up with that; for his goodness was extraordinary,
and he inspired his pupils with hopes. He showed
the greatest generosity in private life, being ever
ready to confer benefits, yet most modestly anxious
to conceal the favour. For instance, he once called
upon Ctesibius when he was ill and, seeing in what
straits he was, quietly put a purse under his pillow.
He, when he found it, said, "This is the joke of
Arcesilaus." Moreover, on another occasion, he sent
him 1000 drachmas.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>
<p>Again, by introducing Archias the Arcadian to
Eumenes, he caused him to be advanced to great
dignity. And, as he was very liberal, caring very
little for money, so he was the first to attend performances where seats were paid for, and he was above all
eager to go to those of Archecrates and Callicrates, for
which the fee was a gold piece. And he helped many
people and collected subscriptions for them. Some one
once borrowed his silver plate in order to entertain
friends and never brought it back, but Arcesilaus did
not ask him for it and pretended it had not been
borrowed. Another version of the story is that he lent
it on purpose, and, when it was returned, made the
borrower a present of it because he was poor. He
had property in Pitane from which his brother
Pylades sent him supplies. Furthermore, Eumenes,
<pb n='417'/>
the son of Philetaerus, furnished him with large sums,
and for this reason Eumenes was the only one of
the contemporary kings to whom he dedicated any
of his works.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>
<p>And whereas many persons courted Antigonus and
went to meet him whenever he came to Athens,
Arcesilaus remained at home, not wishing to thrust
himself upon his acquaintance. He was on the best
of terms with Hierocles, the commandant in Munichia
and Piraeus, and at every festival would go down to
see him. And though Hierocles joined in urging
him to pay his respects to Antigonus, he was not
prevailed upon, but, after going as far as the gates,
turned back. And after the battle at sea,<note n='a'>The reference may
be to one of the naval victories gained
by Antigonus over the Egyptian fleet towards the end of
his reign, at Cos and again at Andros. See W. W. Tarn,
<hi rend='ital'>Antigonus Gonatas</hi>, pp. 378, 461-6.</note> when
many went to Antigonus or wrote him flattering
letters, he held his peace. However, on behalf of
his native city, he did go to Demetrias as envoy to
Antigonus, but failed in his mission. He spent his
time wholly in the Academy, shunning politics.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
<p>Once indeed, when at Athens, he stopped too long
in the Piraeus, discussing themes, out of friendship
for Hierocles, and for this he was censured by certain
persons.<note n='b'>It has been suggested that the sense would be

another
Aristippus, and he was fond of dining well, but only
with those who shared his tastes. He lived openly
with Theodete and Phila, the Elean courtesans, and
to those who censured him he quoted the maxims of
Aristippus. He was also fond of boys and very
susceptible. Hence he was accused by Ariston of
<pb n='419'/>
Chios, the Stoic, and his followers, who called him a
corrupter of youth and a shameless teacher of
immorality. 
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
He is said to have been particularly
enamoured of Demetrius who sailed to Cyrene, and
of Cleochares of Myrlea; of him the story is told
that, when a band of revellers came to the door, he
told them that for his part he was willing to admit
them but that Cleochares would not let him. This
same youth had amongst his admirers Demochares
the son of Laches, and Pythocles the son of Bugelus,
and once when Arcesilaus had caught them, with
great forbearance he ordered them off. For all this
he was assailed and ridiculed by the critics abovementioned, as a friend of the mob who courted
popularity. The most virulent attacks were made
upon him in the circle of Hieronymus the Peripatetic,<note
n='a'><foreign lang='greek'>oi( peri\ *(ierw/numon to\n

whenever he collected his friends to keep the birthday of Halcyoneus, son of Antigonus, an occasion
for which Antigonus used to send large sums of
money to be spent in merrymaking.
<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>
There he had
always shunned discussion over the wine; and when
Aridices, proposing a certain question, requested
him to speak upon it, he replied, "The peculiar
province of philosophy is just this, to know that there
is a time for all things." As to the charge brought
against him that he was the friend of the mob, Timon,
among many other things, has the following<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf. infra</hi>, v. 59.</note>:</p>
<p>So saying, he plunged into the surrounding crowd. And
they were amazed at him, like chaffinches about an owl,
pointing him out as vain, because he was a flatterer of the
mob. And why, insignificant thing that you are, do you
puff yourself out like a simpleton?<note n='c'>Frag. 34 D.
<hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> the rhythm, Hom.
<hi rend='ital'>Il.</hi> i. 326
and iv. 482.</note></p>
<p>And yet for all that he was modest enough to
<pb n='421'/>
recommend his pupils to hear other philosophers.
And when a certain youth from Chios was not well
pleased with his lectures and preferred those of
the above-mentioned Hieronymus, Arcesilaus himself
took him and introduced him to that philosopher,
with an injunction to behave well.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>
<p>Another pleasant story told of him is this. Some
one had inquired why it was that pupils from all the
other schools went over to Epicurus, but converts
were never made from the Epicureans: "Because
men may become eunuchs, but a eunuch never
becomes a man," was his answer.</p>
<p>At last, being near his end, he left all his property
to his brother Pylades, because, unknown to Moereas,
he had taken him to Chios and thence brought him
to Athens. In all his life he never married nor had
any children. He made three wills: the first he
left at Eretria in the charge of Amphicritus, the
second at Athens in the charge of certain friends,
while the third he dispatched to his home to
Thaumasias, one of his relatives, with the request
that he would keep it safe. To this man he also
wrote as follows:</p>
<p>"Arcesilaus to Thaumasias greeting."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>
<p>"I have given Diogenes my will to be conveyed
to you. For, owing to my frequent illnesses and the
weak state of my body, I decided to make a will,
in order that, if anything untoward should happen,
you, who have been so devotedly attached to me,
should not suffer by my decease. You are the most
deserving of all those in this place to be entrusted
with the will, on the score both of age and of relationship to me. Remember then that I have reposed
the most absolute confidence in you, and strive to
<pb n='423'/>
deal justly by me, in order that, so far as you are
concerned, the provisions I have made may be
carried out with fitting dignity. A copy is deposited
at Athens with some of my acquaintance, and another
in Eretria with Amphicritus."</p>
<p>He died, according to Hermippus, through drinking
too freely of unmixed wine which affected his reason;
he was already seventy-five and regarded by the
Athenians with unparalleled good-will.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>
<p>I have written upon him as follows<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> vii. 104.</note>:</p>
<p>Why, pray, Arcesilaus, didst thou quaff so unsparingly
unmixed wine as to go out of thy mind? I pity thee not so
much for thy death as because thou didst insult the Muses
by immoderate potations.</p>
<p>Three other men have borne the name of Arcesilaus: a poet of the Old Comedy, another poet who
wrote elegies, and a sculptor besides, on whom
Simonides composed this epigram<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Plan.</hi> iii. 9.</note>:</p>
<p>This is a statue of Artemis and its cost two hundred

practised in the arts of Athena.</p>
<p>According to Apollodorus in his

about the 120th Olympiad.<note n='c'>300-296 b.c.</note></p>

inquired:</p>

<p>he, knowing that he had already been maligned to
the king, replied, "My father was a freedman, who
wiped his nose on his sleeve"--meaning that he
was a dealer in salt fish--"a native of Borysthenes,
with no face to show, but only the writing on his
face, a token of his master's severity. My mother
was such as a man like my father would marry, from
a brothel. Afterwards my father, who had cheated
the revenue in some way, was sold with all his
family. And I, then a not ungraceful youngster,
was bought by a certain rhetorician, who on his
death left me all he had.

<p>In truth Bion was in other respects a shifty
character, a subtle sophist, and one who had given
the enemies of philosophy many an occasion to
blaspheme, while in certain respects he was even
pompous and able to indulge in arrogance. He left
very many memoirs, and also sayings of useful
application. For example, when he was reproached
for not paying court to a youth, his excuse was,
"You can't get hold of a soft cheese with a hook."
<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>
Being once asked who suffers most from anxiety, he
<pb n='427'/>
replied, "He who is ambitious of the greatest prosperity." Being consulted by some one as to whether
he should marry--for this story is also told of Bion--
he made answer, "If the wife you marry be ugly,
she will be your bane; if beautiful, you will not
keep her to yourself."<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. infra</hi>, vi.

said, "The earth swallowed Amphiaraus, but you
have swallowed your land." To be unable to bear
an ill is itself a great ill. He used to condemn those
who burnt men alive as if they could not feel, and
yet cauterized them as if they could. 
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>
He used
repeatedly to say that to grant favours to another
was preferable to enjoying the favours of others.
For the latter means ruin to both body and soul.
He even abused Socrates, declaring that, if he felt
desire for Alcibiades and abstained, he was a fool; if he
did not, his conduct was in no way remarkable. The
road to Hades, he used to say, was easy to travel;
at any rate men passed away with their eyes shut.
He said in censure of Alcibiades that in his boyhood
he drew away the husbands from their wives, and as
a young man the wives from their husbands. When
the Athenians were absorbed in the practice of
rhetoric, he taught philosophy at Rhodes. To some
one who found fault with him for this he replied,
"How can I sell barley when what I brought to
market is wheat?"</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="50"/>
<p>He used to say that those in Hades would be
more severely punished if the vessels in which they
drew water were whole instead of being pierced with
<pb n='429'/>
holes. To an importunate talker who wanted his
help he said, "I will satisfy your demand, if you will
only get others to plead your cause and stay away
yourself." On a voyage in bad company he fell in
with pirates. When his companions said, "We are
lost if we are discovered," "And I too," he replied,
"unless I am discovered." Conceit he styled a
hindrance to progress. Referring to a wealthy miser
he said, "He has not acquired a fortune; the fortune
has acquired him." Misers, he said, took care of
property as if it belonged to them, but derived no
more benefit from it than if it belonged to others.
"When we are young," said he, "we are courageous,
but it is only in old age that prudence is at its height."
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>
Prudence, he said, excels the other virtues as much
as sight excels the other senses. He used to say
that we ought not to heap reproaches on old age,
seeing that, as he said, we all hope to reach it. To
a slanderer who showed a grave face his words were,
"I don't know whether you have met with ill luck,
or your neighbour with good." He used to say that
low birth made a bad partner for free speech, for--</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>It cows a man, however bold his heart.<note
n='a'>Eur.
<hi rend='ital'>Hipp.</hi> 424.</note></hi></p>
<p>We ought, he remarked, to watch our friends and
see what manner of men they are, in order that we
may not be thought to associate with the bad or to
decline the friendship of the good.</p>
<p>Bion at the outset used to deprecate the Academic
doctrines,<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> he had his doubts.
Reiske, however, by his conjecture
<foreign lang='greek'>proh/|rhto</foreign> gives the statement a
totally different turn,
viz. that Bion
<hi rend='ital'>had</hi> at the outset
<hi
rend='ital'>preferred</hi> the Academy.</note> even at the time when he
was a pupil of
Crates. Then he adopted the Cynic discipline,
donning cloak and wallet. 
<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
For little else was needed
to convert him to the doctrine of entire insensibility.</p>
<pb n='431'/>
<p>Next he went over to Theodorean views, after he
had heard the lectures of Theodorus the Atheist,
who used every kind of sophistical argument. And
after Theodorus he attended the lectures of Theophrastus the Peripatetic. He was fond of display
and great at cutting up anything with a jest, using
vulgar names for things. Because he employed every
style of speech in combination, Eratosthenes, we
hear, said of him that he was the first to deck
philosophy with bright-flowered robes. He was
clever also at parody. Here is a specimen of his
style:</p>
<p>O gentle Archytas, musician-born, blessed in thine own

<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>
<p>And in general he made sport of music and geometry.
He lived extravagantly, and for this reason he
would move from one city to another, sometimes
contriving to make a great show. Thus at Rhodes
he persuaded the sailors to put on students' garb
and follow in his train. And when, attended by
them, he made his way into the gymnasium, all
eyes were fixed on him. It was his custom also to
adopt certain young men for the gratification of his
appetite and in order that he might be protected
by their goodwill.<note n='b'>See, however,
<hi rend='ital'>supra</hi>,
49.</note> He was extremely selfish and
insisted strongly on the maxim that "friends share in
common." And hence it came about that he is not
credited with a single disciple, out of all the crowds
who attended his lectures. And yet there were
some who followed his lead in shamelessness. 
<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
For
instance, Betion, one of his intimates, is said once to
have addressed Menedemus in these words: "For
my part, Menedemus, I pass the night with Bion,
and I don't think I am any the worse for it." In
<pb n='433'/>
his familiar talk he would often vehemently assail
belief in the gods, a taste which he had derived from
Theodorus. Afterwards, when he fell ill (so it was
said by the people of Chalcis where he died), he was
persuaded to wear an amulet and to repent of his
offences against religion. And even for want of
nurses he was in a sad plight, until Antigonus sent
him two servants. And it is stated by Favorinus
in his
<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History</hi> that the king himself
followed in a litter.</p>
<p>Even so he died, and in these lines<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Plan.</hi> v. 37.</note> I have taken
him to task:</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
<p>We hear that Bion, to whom the Scythian land of Borysthenes gave birth, denied that the gods really exist. Had
he persisted in holding this opinion, it would have been right
to say, "He thinks as he pleases: wrongly, to be sure, but
still he does think so." But in fact, when he fell ill of a
lingering disease and feared death, he who denied the existence of the gods, and would not even look at a temple, 
<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>
who
often mocked at mortals for sacrificing to deities, not only over
hearth and high altars and table, with sweet savour and fat
and incense did he gladden the nostrils of the gods; nor
was he content to say "I have sinned, forgive the past,"
<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>
but he cheerfully allowed an old woman to put a charm
round his neck, and in full faith bound his arms with leather
and placed the rhamnus and the laurel-branch over the
door, being ready to submit to anything sooner than die.
Fool for wishing that the divine favour might be purchased
at a certain price, as if the gods existed just when Bion chose
to recognize them! It was then with vain wisdom that,
when the driveller was all ashes, he stretched out his hand
and said "Hail, Pluto, hail!"</p>
<pb n='435'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="58"/>
<p>Ten men have borne the name of Bion: (1) the
contemporary of Pherecydes of Syria, to whom are
assigned two books in the Ionic dialect; he was of
Proconnesus; (2) a Syracusan, who wrote rhetorical
handbooks; (3) our philosopher; (4) a follower of
Democritus and mathematician of Abdera, who
wrote both in Attic and in Ionic: he was the first
to affirm that there are places where the night lasts
for six months and the day for six months<note n='a'>Possibly Pytheas
of Massilia in his "Northern Voyage"
had had experience of Arctic winters and summers.</note>; (5) a
native of Soli, who wrote a work on Aethiopia;
(6) a rhetorician, the author of nine books called
after the Muses; (7) a lyric poet; (8) a Milesian
sculptor, mentioned by Polemo; (9) a tragic poet,

a sculptor of Clazomenae or Chios, mentioned by

<head>Chapter 8. LACYDES
(Head of the Academy c. 242-216 B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="59">
<p>Lacydes, son of Alexander, was a native of Cyrene
He was the founder of the New Academy and the
successor of Arcesilaus: a man of very serious
character who found numerous admirers; industrious
from his youth up and, though poor, of pleasant
manners and pleasant conversation. A most amusing
story is told of his housekeeping. Whenever he
brought anything out of the store-room, he would
seal the door up again and throw his signet-ring
inside through the opening, to ensure that nothing
laid up there should be stolen or carried off. So
soon, then, as his rogues of servants got to know this,
they broke the seal and carried off what they pleased,
afterwards throwing the ring in the same way through
<pb n='437'/>
the opening into the store-room. Nor were they ever
detected in this.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="60"/>
<p>Lacydes used to lecture in the Academy, in the
garden which had been laid out by King Attalus,
and from him it derived its name of Lacydeum. He
did what none of his predecessors had ever done;
in his lifetime he handed over the school to Telecles
and Evander, both of Phocaea. Evander was succeeded by Hegesinus of Pergamum, and he again by
Carneades. A good saying is attributed to Lacydes.
When Attalus sent for him, he is said to have
remarked that statues are best seen from a distance.
He stadied geometry late, and some one said to him,
"Is this a proper time?" To which he replied,
"Nay, is it not even yet the proper time?"</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>
<p>He assumed the headship of the school in the
fourth year of the 134th Olympiad,<note n='a'>July 241-June 240
b.c.</note> and at his death
he had been head for twenty-six years. His end
was a palsy brought on by drinking too freely. And
here is a quip of my own upon the fact<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> vii. 105.</note>:</p>
<p>Of thee too, O Lacydes, I have heard a tale, that Bacchus
seized thee and dragged thee on tip-toe<note n='c'>Or "with trailing
toes." The vases show bodies carried
in the arms or flung over the shoulders with the toes just
touching the ground.</note> to the underworld.
Nay, was it not clear that when the wine-god comes in force
into the frame, he loosens our limbs? Perhaps this is why
he gets his name of the Loosener.</p>

<div2 n="9" type="chapter">
<head>Chapter 9. CARNEADES (c. 213-129 B C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="62">
<p>Carneades, the son of Epicomus or (according
to Alexander in his
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers</hi>)
of
Philocomus, was a native of Cyrene. He studied
<pb n='439'/>
carefully the writings of the Stoics and particularly
those of Chrysippus, and by combating these successfully he became so famous that he would often say:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>Without Chrysippus where should I have
been?</hi></p>
<p>The man's industry was unparalleled, although in
physics he was not so strong as in ethics. Hence he
would let his hair and nails grow long from intense
devotion to study. Such was his predominance in
philosophy that even the rhetoricians would dismiss
their classes and repair to him to hear him lecture.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
<p>His voice was extremely powerful, so that the
keeper of the gymnasium sent to him and requested
him not to shout so loud. To which he replied,
"Then give me something by which to regulate
my voice." Thereupon by a happy hit the man
replied in the words, "You have a regulator in your
audience." His talent for criticizing opponents was
remarkable, and he was a formidable controversialist.
And for the reasons already given he further declined
invitations to dine out. One of his pupils was Mentor
the Bithynian, who tried to ingratiate himself with
a concubine of Carneades; so on one occasion
(according to Favorinus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous
History</hi>),
when Mentor came to lecture, Carneades in the
course of his remarks let fall these lines by way of
parody at his expense:</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
<p>Hither comes an old man of the sea, infallible, like to
Mentor in person and in voice.<note n='a'>Carneades applies two lines
from the
<hi rend='ital'>Odyssey</hi>, namely
iv. 384 and (with a change to the masculine participle) ii. 268

<p>Thereupon the other got up and replied:
<pb n='441'/>
Those on their part made proclamation, and these speedily
assembled.<note n='a'>Hom.
<hi rend='ital'>Il.</hi> ii. 52.</note></p>
<p>He seems to have shown some want of courage in
the face of death, repeating often the words, "Nature
which framed this whole will also destroy it." When
he learnt that Antipater committed suicide by
drinking a potion, he was greatly moved by the
constancy with which he met his end, and exclaimed,
"Give it then to me also." And when those about
him asked "What?" "A honeyed draught," said
he. At the time he died the moon is said to have
been eclipsed, and one might well say that the
brightest luminary in heaven next to the sun thereby
gave token of her sympathy.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>
<p>According to Apollodorus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi>, he
departed this life in the fourth year of the 162nd
Olympiad<note n='b'>129-128 b.c.</note> at the age of eighty-five
years. Letters
of his to Ariarathes, king of Cappadocia, are extant.
Everything else was compiled by his pupils; he
himself left nothing in writing. I have written upon
him in logaoedic metre as follows<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Plan.</hi> v. 39.</note>:</p>
<p>Why, Muse, oh why wouldst thou have me censure
Carneades? For he is ignorant who knoweth not how he
feared death. When wasting away with the worst of
diseases, he would not find release. But when he heard
that Antipater's life was quenched by drinking a potion,
<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>
"Give me too," he cried, "a draught to drink." "What?
pray what?" "Give me a draught of honeyed wine."
He had often on his lips the words, "Nature which holds
this frame together will surely dissolve it." None the less
he too went down to the grave, and he might have got there
sooner by cutting short his tale of woes.</p>
<p>It is said that his eyes went blind at night without
<pb n='443'/>
his knowing it, and he ordered the slave to light the
lamp. The latter brought it and said, "Here it is."
"Then," said Carneades, "read."</p>
<p>He had many other disciples, but the most illustrious of them all was Clitomachus, of whom we have
next to speak.</p>
<p>There was another Carneades, a frigid elegiac poet.</p>

<div2 n="10" type="chapter">
<head>Chapter 10. CLITOMACHUS
(Head of the Academy from 129 B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="67">
<p>Clitomachus was a Carthaginian, his real name
being Hasdrubal, and he taught philosophy at
Carthage in his native tongue. He had reached his
fortieth year when he went to Athens and became
a pupil of Carneades. And Carneades, recognizing
his industry, caused him to be educated and took
part in training him. And to such lengths did his
diligence go that he composed more than four
hundred treatises. He succeeded Carneades in the
headship of the school, and by his writings did much
to elucidate his opinions. He was eminently well
acquainted with the three sects--the Academy, the
Peripatetics, and the Stoics.</p>
<p>The Academics in general are assailed by Timon
in the line:</p>
<p><hi rend='center'>The prolixity of the Academics unseasoned by

<head>Chapter 1. ARISTOTLE (384-322 B.C.)</head>
<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
<p>Aristotle, son of Nicomachus and Phaestis, was
a native of Stagira. His father, Nicomachus, as
Hermippus relates in his book
<hi rend='ital'>On Aristotle</hi>, traced
his descent from Nicomachus who was the son of
Machaon and grandson of Asclepius; and he resided
with Amyntas, the king of Macedon, in the capacity
of physician and friend. Aristotle was Plato's most
genuine disciple; he spoke with a lisp, as we learn
from Timotheus the Athenian in his book
<hi rend='ital'>On Lives</hi>;
further, his calves were slender (so they say), his
eyes small, and he was conspicuous by his attire, his
rings, and the cut of his hair. According to
Timaeus, he had a son by Herpyllis, his concubine,
who was also called Nicomachus.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
<p>He seceded from the Academy while Plato was
still alive. Hence the remark attributed to the
latter: "Aristotle spurns me, as colts kick out at
the mother who bore them."<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Aelian,
<hi rend='ital'>V.H.</hi> iv. 9.</note> Hermippus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Lives</hi> mentions that he was absent as Athenian
envoy at the court of Philip when Xenocrates became
head of the Academy, and that on his return, when
he saw the school under a new head, he made choice
of a public walk in the Lyceum where he would walk
<pb n='447'/>
up and down discussing philosophy with his pupils
until it was time to rub themselves with oil. Hence
the name "Peripatetic." But others say that it was
given to him because, when Alexander was recovering from an illness and taking daily walks, Aristotle
joined him and talked with him on certain matters.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
<p>In time the circle about him grew larger; he then
sat down to lecture, remarking<note n='a'>Eur.

<p><hi rend='center'>It were base to keep silence and let

<p>He also taught his pupils to discourse upon a set
theme, besides practising them in oratory. Afterwards, however, he departed to Hermias the eunuch,
who was tyrant of Atarneus, and there is one story
that he was on very affectionate terms with Hermias;
according to another, Hermias bound him by ties of
kinship, giving him his daughter or his niece in
marriage, and so Demetrius of Magnesia narrates in
his work on
<hi rend='ital'>Poets and Writers of the Same Name.</hi>
The
same author tells us that Hermias had been the slave
of Eubulus, and that he was of Bithynian origin and
had murdered his master. Aristippus in his first
book
<hi rend='ital'>On the Luxury of the Ancients</hi> says that
Aristotle
fell in love with a concubine of Hermias, 
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
and married
her with his consent, and in an excess of delight
sacrificed to a weak woman as the Athenians did to
Demeter of Eleusis<note n='c'>This story comes ultimately from Lyco the

; and that he composed a paean
in honour of Hermias, which is given below; next that
he stayed in Macedonia at Philip's court and received
from him his son Alexander as his pupil; that he
petitioned Alexander to restore his native city which
had been destroyed by Philip and obtained his
<pb n='449'/>
request; and that he also drew up a code of laws for
the inhabitants. We learn further that, following the
example of Xenocrates, he made it a rule in his
school that every ten days a new president should be
appointed. When he thought that he had stayed
long enough with Alexander, he departed to Athens,
having first presented to Alexander his kinsman
Callisthenes of Olynthus. 
<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
But when Callisthenes
talked with too much freedom to the king and disregarded his own advice, Aristotle is said to have
rebuked him by citing the line<note n='a'>Hom.
<hi rend='ital'>Il.</hi>
xviii. 95.</note>:</p>
<p>Short-lived, I ween, wilt thou be, my child, by what thou
sayest.</p>
<p>And so indeed it fell out. For he, being suspected
of complicity in the plot of Hermolaus against the
life of Alexander, was confined in an iron cage and
carried about until he became infested with vermin
through lack of proper attention; and finally he was
thrown to a lion and so met his end.</p>
<p>To return to Aristotle: he came to Athens, was
head of his school for thirteen years, and then
withdrew to Chalcis because he was indicted for
impiety by Eurymedon the hierophant, or, according to Favorinus<note n='b'>As in ii. 78, iii. 19 and v. 77, Favorinus
is curious to
state the names of the accusers of philosophers put upon trial.</note>
in his
<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History,</hi> by
Demophilus, the ground of the charge being the
hymn he composed to the aforesaid Hermias, 
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
as well
as the following inscription for his statue at Delphi<note n='c'><hi

<p>This man in violation of the hallowed law of the immortals
was unrighteously slain by the king of the bow-bearing
Persians, who overcame him, not openly with a spear in
murderous combat, but by treachery with the aid of one in
whom he trusted.</p>
<p>At Chalcis he died, according to Eumelus in the
<pb n='451'/>
fifth book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Histories,</hi> by drinking
aconite, at the
age of seventy. The same authority makes him
thirty years old when he came to Plato; but here he
is mistaken. For Aristotle lived to be sixty-three,
and he was seventeen when he became Plato's pupil.</p>
<p>The hymn in question runs as follows:</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
<p>O virtue, toilsome for the generation of mortals to achieve,
the fairest prize that life can win, for thy beauty, O virgin,
it were a doom glorious in Hellas even to die and to endure
fierce, untiring labours. Such courage dost thou implant
in the mind, imperishable, better than gold, dearer than
parents or soft-eyed sleep. For thy sake Heracles, son
of Zeus, and the sons of Leda endured much in the tasks
whereby they pursued thy might. 
<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
And yearning after thee
came Achilles and Ajax to the house of Hades, and for the
sake of thy dear form the nursling of Atarneus too was
bereft of the light of the sun. Therefore shall his deeds be
sung, and the Muses, the daughters of Memory, shall make
him immortal, exalting the majesty of Zeus, guardian of
strangers, and the grace of lasting friendship.</p>
<p>There is, too, something of my own upon the
philosopher which I will quote<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> vii. 107.</note>:</p>
<p>Eurymedon, the priest of Deo's mysteries, was once about
to indict Aristotle for impiety, but he, by a draught of

of vanquishing unjust calumnies.</p>

He attached himself to Plato and resided with him

died a natural

the king's displeasure because he had introduced
Callisthenes to him, and that Alexander, in order to
cause him annoyance, honoured Anaximenes

<p>"All will be well; but, in case anything should
happen, Aristotle has made these dispositions.
Antipater is to be executor in all matters and in
general; 
<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>
but, until Nicanor shall arrive, Aristomenes,
Timarchus, Hipparchus, Dioteles and (if he consent
and if circumstances permit him) Theophrastus shall
take charge as well of Herpyllis and the children as
of the property. And when the girl shall be grown
up she shall be given in marriage to Nicanor; but
if anything happen to the girl (which heaven forbid
and no such thing will happen) before her marriage,
or when she is married but before there are children,
Nicanor shall have full powers, both with regard to
the child and with regard to everything else, to
administer in a manner worthy both of himself and
of us. Nicanor shall take charge of the girl and of
the boy Nicomachus as he shall think fit in all that
concerns them as if he were father and brother.
And if anything should happen to Nicanor (which
heaven forbid!) either before he marries the girl, or
<pb n='457'/>
when he has married her but before there are children, any arrangements that he may make shall be
valid.
<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
And if Theophrastus is willing to live with her,
he shall have the same rights as Nicanor. Otherwise the executors in consultation with Antipater
shall administer as regards the daughter and the boy
as seems to them to be best. The executors and
Nicanor, in memory of me and of the steady affection
which Herpyllis has borne towards me, shall take
care of her in every other respect and, if she desires
to be married, shall see that she be given to one
not unworthy; and besides what she has already
received they shall give her a talent of silver out of
the estate and three handmaids whomsoever she
shall choose besides the maid she has at present and
the man-servant Pyrrhaeus; 
<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>
and if she chooses to
remain at Chalcis, the lodge by the garden, if in
Stagira, my father's house. Whichever of these two
houses she chooses, the executors shall furnish with
such furniture as they think proper and as Herpyllis
herself may approve. Nicanor shall take charge of
the boy Myrmex, that he be taken to his own friends
in a manner worthy of me with the property of his
which we received. Ambracis shall be given her
freedom, and on my daughter's marriage shall
receive 500 drachmas and the maid whom she now
has. And to Thale shall be given, in addition
to the maid whom she has and who was bought,
a thousand drachmas and a maid. 
<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
And Simon, in
addition to the money before paid to him towards
another servant, shall either have a servant purchased
for him or receive a further sum of money. And
Tycho, Philo, Olympius and his child shall have their
freedom when my daughter is married. None of
<pb n='459'/>
the servants who waited upon me shall be sold but
they shall continue to be employed; and when
they arrive at the proper age they shall have their
freedom if they deserve it. My executors shall see to
it, when the images which Gryllion has been commissioned to execute are finished, that they be set
up, namely that of Nicanor, that of Proxenus, which
it was my intention to have executed, and that of
Nicanor's mother; also they shall set up the bust
which has been executed of Arimnestus, to be a
memorial of him seeing that he died childless, 
<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>
and
shall dedicate my mother's statue to Demeter at
Nemea or wherever they think best. And wherever
they bury me, there the bones of Pythias shall be
laid, in accordance with her own instructions. And
to commemorate Nicanor's safe return, as I vowed
on his behalf, they shall set up in Stagira stone
statues of life size to Zeus and Athena the Saviours."<note n='a'>The
last clause was curiously misunderstood by three
eminent authorities on Aristotle, namely Grant, Grote and
Zeller, who took
<foreign lang='greek'>zw=|a tetraph/xh</foreign> to mean
"four animal
figures," instead of "figures four cubits high"; see
<hi
rend='ital'>Journ.
of Phil.</hi> vol. xxxii. 303. The article "Verify your quotations," although modestly followed by two asterisks, was
written, I believe, by the late Ingram Bywater, then one of
the editors of the journal. This concession by Aristotle to
the popular faith (for the statues from their size seem those
of deities) some critics regard with suspicion, because they
see in it a resemblance to the last words of Socrates (Plato,
<hi rend='ital'>Phaedo,</hi> 118). Accordingly they are disposed to
doubt the
genuineness of the will. But see C. G. Bruns,

<p>Such is the tenor of Aristotle's will. It is said that
a very large number of dishes belonging to him were
found, and that Lyco mentioned his bathing in a
bath of warm oil and then selling the oil. Some
relate that he placed a skin of warm oil on his
stomach, and that, when he went to sleep, a bronze
ball was placed in his hand with a vessel under it,
in order that, when the ball dropped from his hand
into the vessel, he might be waked up by the sound.<note n='b'>Next

<pb n='461'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
<p>Some exceedingly happy sayings are attributed
to him, which I proceed to quote. To the question,
"What do people gain by telling lies?" his answer
was, "Just this, that when they speak the truth
they are not believed." Being once reproached for
giving alms to a bad man, he rejoined, "It was the
man and not his character that I pitied."
<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. infra,</hi>&sect; 21.</note>
He used constantly to say to his friends and pupils, whenever
or wherever he happened to be lecturing, "As sight
takes in light from the surrounding air, so does the
soul from mathematics." Frequently and at some
length he would say that the Athenians were the
discoverers of wheat and of laws; but, though they
used wheat, they had no use for laws.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
<p>"The roots of education," he said, "are bitter,
but the fruit is sweet." Being asked, "What is it
that soon grows old?" he answered, "Gratitude."
He was asked to define hope, and he replied, "It is
a waking dream." When Diogenes offered him dried
figs, he saw that he had prepared something caustic
to say if he did not take them; so he took them
and said Diogenes had lost his figs and his jest into
the bargain. And on another occasion he took them
when they were offered, lifted them up aloft, as you
do babies, and returned them with the exclamation,
"Great is Diogenes." Three things he declared to
be indispensable for education: natural endowment,
study, and constant practice. On hearing that some
one abused him, he rejoined, "He may even scourge
me so it be in my absence." Beauty he declared to
be a greater recommendation than any letter of
introduction. 
<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>
Others attribute this definition to
Diogenes; Aristotle, they say, defined good looks
as the gift of god, Socrates as a short-lived reign,
<pb n='463'/>
Plato as natural superiority, Theophrastus as a mute
deception, Theocritus as an evil in an ivory setting,
Carneades as a monarchy that needs no bodyguard.
Being asked how the educated differ from the uneducated, "As much," he said, "as the living from
the dead."<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra,</hi> i. &sect; 69, ii.
&sect; 69.</note>
He used to declare education to be an
ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity.
Teachers who educated children deserved, he said,
more honour than parents who merely gave them
birth; for bare life is furnished by the one, the
other ensures a good life. To one who boasted that
he belonged to a great city his reply was, "That is
not the point to consider, but who it is that is worthy
of a great country." 
<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>
To the query, "What is a
friend?" his reply was, "A single soul dwelling in
two bodies." Mankind, he used to say, were divided
into those who were as thrifty as if they would live
for ever, and those who were as extravagant as if
they were going to die the next day. When some one
inquired why we spend much time with the beautiful,
"That," he said, "is a blind man's question." When
asked what advantage he had ever gained from
philosophy, he replied, "This, that I do without
being ordered what some are constrained to do by
their fear of the law."<note n='b'>Cicero ascribed a similar reply to
Xenocrates: "ut id sua
sponte facerent, quod cogerentur facere legibus"
(Cic.
<hi rend='ital'>De rep.</hi>
i. &sect; 3).</note> The question being put,
how can students make progress, he replied, "By
pressing hard on those in front and not waiting for
those behind." To the chatterbox who poured out
a flood of talk upon him and then inquired, "Have
I bored you to death with my chatter?" he replied,
"No, indeed; for I was not attending to you."

<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra,</hi>
&sect;
17.</note>--"It was not the man," said he,
"that I assisted, but humanity." To the question
how we should behave to friends, he answered, "As
we should wish them to behave to us." Justice he
defined as a virtue of soul which distributes according
to merit. Education he declared to be the best
provision for old age. Favorinus in the second book
of his
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi> mentions as one of his habitual
sayings that "He who has friends can have no true
friend." Further, this is found in the seventh book

<p>Such is the number of the works written by him.
And in them he puts forward the following views.
There are two divisions of philosophy, the practical
and the theoretical. The practical part includes
ethics and politics, and in the latter not only the
doctrine of the state but also that of the household
is sketched. The theoretical part includes physics
and logic, although logic is not an independent
science, but is elaborated as an instrument to the
rest of science. And he clearly laid down that it
has a twofold aim, probability and truth. For each
of these he employed two faculties, dialectic and
rhetoric where probability is aimed at, analytic and
<pb n='477'/>
philosophy where the end is truth; he neglects
nothing which makes either for discovery or for
judgement or for utility. 
<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
As making for discovery
he left in the
<hi rend='ital'>Topics</hi> and
<hi
rend='ital'>Methodics</hi> a number of
propositions, whereby the student can be well supplied with probable arguments for the solution of
problems. As an aid to judgement he left the
<hi rend='ital'>Prior</hi>
and
<hi rend='ital'>Posterior Analytics.</hi> By the Prior Analytics
the
premisses are judged, by the Posterior the process of
inference is tested. For practical use there are the
precepts on controversy and the works dealing with
question and answer, with sophistical fallacies,
syllogisms and the like. The test of truth which he
put forward was sensation in the sphere of objects
actually presented, but in the sphere of morals
dealing with the state, the household and the laws,
it was reason.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>
<p>The one ethical end he held to be the exercise
of virtue in a completed life. And happiness he
maintained to be made up of goods of three sorts:
goods of the soul, which indeed he designates as
of the highest value; in the second place bodily
goods, health and strength, beauty and the like;
and thirdly external goods, such as wealth, good
birth, reputation and the like. And he regarded
virtue as not of itself sufficient to ensure happiness;
bodily goods and external goods were also necessary,
for the wise man would be miserable if he lived in
the midst of pains, poverty, and similar circumstances.
Vice, however, is sufficient in itself to secure misery,
even if it be ever so abundantly furnished with
corporeal and external goods. 
<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
He held that the
virtues are not mutually interdependent. For a man
might be prudent, or again just, and at the same
<pb n='479'/>
time profligate and unable to control his passions.
He said too that the wise man was not exempt from
all passions, but indulged them in moderation.</p>
<p>He defined friendship as an equality of reciprocal
good-will, including under the term as one species
the friendship of kinsmen, as another that of lovers,
and as a third that of host and guest.
<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra,</hi> iii. 81. and Aristotle,
<hi rend='ital'>Rhet.</hi>
ii. 4 &sect; 28, 1381 b 33</note>
The end of love was not merely intercourse but also philosophy.
According to him the wise man would fall in love
and take part in politics; furthermore he would
marry and reside at a king's court. Of three kinds
of life, the contemplative, the practical, and the
pleasure-loving life, he gave the preference to the
contemplative. He held that the studies which make
up the ordinary education are of service for the
attainment of virtue.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>
<p>In the sphere of natural science he surpassed all
other philosophers in the investigation of causes, so
that even the most insignificant phenomena were
explained by him. Hence the unusual number of
scientific notebooks which he compiled. Like Plato
he held that God was incorporeal; that his providence extended to the heavenly bodies, that he is
unmoved, and that earthly events are regulated by
their affinity with them (the heavenly bodies).
Besides the four elements he held that there is a
fifth, of which the celestial bodies are composed.
Its motion is of a different kind from that of the
other elements, being circular. Further, he maintained the soul to be incorporeal, defining it as the
first entelechy [<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> realization] of a natural
organic
body potentially possessed of life.<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>De
anima,</hi> ii. 1, 412 a 27.</note> 
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
By the term
realization he means that which has an incorporeal
form. This realization, according to him, is twofold.</p>
<pb n='481'/>
<p>Either it is potential, as that of Hermes in the
wax, provided the wax be adapted to receive the
proper mouldings, or as that of the statue implicit
in the bronze; or again it is determinate, which is
the case with the completed figure of Hermes or
the finished statue. The soul is the realization "of
a natural body," since bodies may be divided into
(a) artificial bodies made by the hands of craftsmen,
as a tower or a ship, and (b) natural bodies which
are the work of nature, such as plants and the bodies
of animals. And when he said "organic" he meant
constructed as means to an end, as sight is adapted
for seeing and the ear for hearing. Of a body
"potentially possessed of life," that is, in itself.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
<p>There are two senses of "potential," one answering to a formed state and the other to its exercise
in act. In the latter sense of the term he who is
awake is said to have soul, in the former he who is
asleep. It was then in order to include the sleeper
that Aristotle added the word "potential."</p>
<p>He held many other opinions on a variety of
subjects which it would be tedious to enumerate.
For altogether his industry and invention were remarkable, as is shown by the catalogue of his writings
given above, which come to nearly 400 in number,
<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> counting those only the genuineness of which
is
not disputed. For many other written works and
pointed oral sayings are attributed to him.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
<p>There were in all eight Aristotles: (1) our philosopher himself; (2) an Athenian statesman,<note n='a'>Probably this is
the Aristotle who appears in Plato's
dialogue
<hi rend='ital'>Parmenides.</hi></note> the
author of graceful forensic speeches; (3) a scholar
who commented on the
<hi rend='ital'>Iliad</hi>; (4) a Sicilian rhetorician, who wrote a reply to the Panegyric of Isocrates;
(5) a disciple of Aeschines the Socratic philosopher,
<pb n='483'/>
surnamed Myth; (6) a native of Cyrene, who wrote
upon the art of poetry; (7) a trainer of boys, mentioned by Aristoxenus in his Life of Plato; (8) an
obscure grammarian, whose handbook
<hi rend='ital'>On Redundancy</hi> is still extant.</p>
<p>Aristotle of Stagira had many disciples; the most
distinguished was Theophrastus, of whom we have

the comic poet. 
<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>
Furthermore, he was ever ready
to do a kindness and fond of discussion. Casander
certainly granted him audience and Ptolemy made
overtures to him. And so highly was he valued at
Athens that, when Agnonides ventured to prosecute
him for impiety, the prosecutor himself narrowly
escaped punishment. About 2000 pupils used to
attend his lectures. In a letter to Phanias the
<pb n='485'/>
Peripatetic, among other topics, he speaks of a
tribunal as follows<note n='a'>In the extract from the letter
Theophrastus seems to be
considering the best means of preparing for publication what
he has to say, possibly in lecture, before the large class
which, as we have just been informed, sometimes numbered
2000. It is difficult to see how this topic can have been
worked into a letter on the law courts as such, and there is
much to be said for Mr. Wyse's emendation
<foreign lang='greek'>didaskali/ou.</foreign>
If this be accepted, the whole letter would be about means
or subjects of instruction in lecture.</note>: "To get a public or even
a
select circle such as one desires is not easy. If an
author reads his work, he must re-write it. Always
to shirk revision and ignore criticism is a course
which the present generation of pupils will no longer
tolerate." And in this letter he has called some
one "pedant."</p>

<p>Although his reputation stood so high, nevertheless
for a short time he had to leave the country with all
the other philosophers, when Sophocles the son of
Amphiclides proposed a law that no philosopher
should preside over a school except by permission
of the Senate and the people, under penalty of death.
The next year, however, the philosophers returned,
as Philo had prosecuted Sophocles for making an
illegal proposal. Whereupon the Athenians repealed
the law, fined Sophocles five talents, and voted the
recall of the philosophers, in order that Theophrastus
also might return and live there as before. He bore
the name of Tyrtamus, and it was Aristotle who
re-named him Theophrastus on account of his
graceful style. 
<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>
And Aristippus, in his fourth book
<hi rend='ital'>On the Luxury of the Ancients</hi>, asserts that he was
enamoured of Aristotle's son Nicomachus, although
he was his teacher. It is said that Aristotle applied
to him and Callisthenes what Plato had said of
Xenocrates and himself (as already related), namely,
that the one needed a bridle and the other a goad;
for Theophrastus interpreted all his meaning with
<pb n='487'/>
an excess of cleverness, whereas the other was
naturally backward. He is said to have become
the owner of a garden of his own after Aristotle's
death, through the intervention of his friend
Demetrius of Phalerum. There are pithy sayings of
his in circulation as follows: "An unbridled horse,"
he said, "ought to be trusted sooner than a
badly-arranged discourse." 
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
To some one who never
opened his lips at a banquet he remarked: "Yours
is a wise course for an ignoramus, but in an educated
man it is sheer folly." He used constantly to say
that in our expenditure the item that costs most is
time.</p>
<p>He died at the age of eighty-five, not long after
he had relinquished his labours. My verses upon
him are these<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal</hi> vii.
110.</note>:</p>
<p>Not in vain was the word spoken to one of human kind,
"Slacken the bow of wisdom and it breaks." Of a truth, so
long as Theophrastus laboured he was sound of limb, but
when released from toil his limbs failed him and he died.</p>
<p>It is said that his disciples asked him if he had
any last message for them, to which he replied:
"Nothing else but this, that many of the pleasures
which life boasts are but in the seeming. 
<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
For when
we are just beginning to live, lo! we die. Nothing
then is so unprofitable as the love of glory. Farewell,
and may you be happy. Either drop my doctrine,
which involves a world of labour, or stand forth its
worthy champions, for you will win great glory.
Life holds more disappointment than advantage.
But, as I can no longer discuss what we ought to do,
do you go on with the inquiry into right conduct."</p>
<pb n='489'/>
<p>With these words, they say, he breathed his last.
And according to the story all the Athenians, out of
respect for the man, escorted his bier on foot. And
Favorinus tells that he had in his old age to be carried
about in a litter<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> a similar
statement about Bion, also attributed to
Favorinus.</note>; and this he says on the authority
of Hermippus, whose account is taken from a remark
of Arcesilaus of Pitane to Lacydes of Cyrene.</p>

<p>I have also come across his will, couched in the
following terms:</p>
<p>"All will be well; but in case anything should
happen, I make these dispositions. I give and bequeath all my property at home<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> at
Eresus.</note> to Melantes and
Pancreon, the sons of Leon. It is my wish that out
of the trust funds at the disposal of Hipparchus
<note n='b'>Mentioned below,
&sect;&sect;
53, 54, 55, 66. We infer that he
had been acting as trustee not only for Theophrastus but
for the School, which in the eye of the law was a religious
foundation.</note>
the following appropriations should be made. First,
they should be applied to finish the rebuilding of
the Museum with the statues of the goddesses, and
to add any improvements which seem practicable to
beautify them.<note n='c'>Evidently the Museum had suffered in some
recent
political troubles, perhaps the second siege of Athens by
Demetrius Poliorcetes, 296-294 b.c. Plut.
<hi rend='ital'>Demetr.</hi>
33, 34;
Paus. i. 25. 8. There was, however, a serious disturbance
when Athens revolted from Macedon, 289-287, for which see
Plut.
<hi rend='ital'>Demetr.</hi> 46, and Paus. i. 25. 2; 26. 1 f.
This latter
event is nearer to the death of Theophrastus in Ol. 123.</note>
Secondly, to replace in the temple
the bust of Aristotle with the rest of the dedicated
offerings which formerly were in the temple. Next,
to rebuild the small cloister adjoining the Museum
<pb n='505'/>
at least as handsomely as before, and to replace in
the lower cloister the tablets containing maps of the
countries traversed by explorers.
<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
Further, to repair
the altar so that it may be perfect and elegant. It
is also my wish that the statue of Nicomachus should
be completed of life size. The price agreed upon
for the making of the statue itself has been paid to
Praxiteles, but the rest of the cost should be defrayed
from the source above mentioned. The statue should
be set up in whatever place seems desirable to the
executors entrusted with carrying out my other
testamentary dispositions. Let all that concerns the
temple and the offerings set up be arranged in this
manner. The estate at Stagira belonging to me I
give and bequeath to Callinus. The whole of my
library I give to Neleus. The garden and the walk
and the houses adjoining the garden, all and sundry,
I give and bequeath to such of my friends hereinafter named as may wish to study literature and
philosophy there in common,
<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>iv. &sect; 70.</note>
<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>
since it is not possible
for all men to be always in residence, on condition
that no one alienates the property or devotes it to
his private use, but so that they hold it like a temple
in joint possession and live, as is right and proper,
on terms of familiarity and friendship. Let the
community consist of Hipparchus, Neleus, Strato,
Callinus, Demotimus, Demaratus, Callisthenes,
Melantes, Pancreon, Nicippus. Aristotle, the son
of Metrodorus and Pythias, shall also have the right
to study and associate with them if he so desire.
And the oldest of them shall pay every attention to
him, in order to ensure for him the utmost proficiency in philosophy. Let me be buried in any
spot in the garden which seems most suitable,
<pb n='507'/>
without unnecessary outlay upon my funeral or
upon my monument. 
<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
And according to previous
agreement let the charge of attending, after my
decease, to the temple and the monument and the
garden and the walk be shared by Pompylus in
person, living close by as he does, and exercising the
same supervision over all other matters as before;
and those who hold the property shall watch over
his interests. Pompylus and Threpta have long been
emancipated and have done me much service; and
I think that 2000 drachmas certainly ought to belong
to them from previous payments made to them by
me, from their own earnings, and my present bequest
to them to be paid by Hipparchus, as I stated many
times in conversation with Melantes and Pancreon
themselves, who agreed with me. I give and bequeath to them the maidservant Somatale. 
<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
And of
my slaves I at once emancipate Molon and Timon
and Parmeno; to Manes and Callias I give their
freedom on condition that they stay four years in the
garden and work there together and that their conduct is free from blame. Of my household furniture
let so much as the executors think right be given to
Pompylus and let the rest be sold. I also devise
Carion to Demotimus, and Donax to Neleus. But
Euboeus must be sold. Let Hipparchus pay to
Callinus 3000 drachmas. And if I had not seen that
Hipparchus had done great service to Melantes and
Pancreon and formerly to me, and that now in his
private affairs he has made shipwreck, I would have
appointed him jointly with Melantes and Pancreon
to carry out my wishes. 
<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>
But, since I saw that it
<pb n='509'/>
was not easy for them to share the management
with him, and I thought it more advantageous for
them to receive a fixed sum from Hipparchus, let
Hipparchus pay Melantes and Pancreon one talent
each and let Hipparchus provide funds for the
executors to defray the expenses set down in the
will, as each disbursement falls due. And when
Hipparchus shall have carried out all these injunctions, he shall be released in full from his liabilities
to me. And any advance that he has made in
Chalcis in my name belongs to him alone. Let
Hipparchus, Neleus, Strato, Callinus, Demotimus,
Callisthenes and Ctesarchus be executors to carry out
the terms of the will. 
<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>
One copy of the will, sealed
with the signet-ring of Theophrastus, is deposited
with Hegesias, the son of Hipparchus, the witnesses
being Callippus of Pallene, Philomelus of Euonymaea,
Lysander of Hyba, and Philo of Alopece. Olympiodorus has another copy, the witnesses being the
same. The third copy was received by Adeimantus,
the bearer being Androsthenes junior; and the
witnesses are Arimnestus the son of Cleobulus,
Lysistratus the son of Pheidon of Thasos, Strato
the son of Arcesilaus of Lampsacus, Thesippus the
son of Thesippus of Cerameis, and Dioscurides the
son of Dionysius of Epicephisia."</p>

physician was also a pupil of his, and it is not

<p>But to return to Strato the physicist. His will is
also extant and it runs as follows:</p>
<p>"In case anything should happen to me I make
these dispositions. All the goods in my house I
give and bequeath to Lampyrio and Arcesilaus.
From the money belonging to me in Athens, in the
first place my executors shall provide for my funeral
and for all that custom requires to be done after the
funeral, without extravagance on the one hand or
meanness on the other. 
<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>
The executors of this my
will shall be Olympichus, Aristides, Mnesigenes,
Hippocrates, Epicrates, Gorgylus, Diocles, Lyco,
Athanes. I leave the school to Lyco, since of the
rest some are too old and others too busy. But it
would be well if the others would co-operate with him.
I also give and bequeath to him all my books, except
those of which I am the author, and all the furniture
in the dining-hall, the cushions and the drinking-cups.
The trustees shall give Epicrates 500 drachmas and
one of the servants whom Arcesilaus shall approve.
<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
And in the first place Lampyrio and Arcesilaus shall
<pb n='517'/>
cancel the agreement which Da&iuml;ppus made on behalf
of Iraeus. And he shall not owe anything either to
Lampyrio or to Lampyrio's heirs, but shall have a
full discharge from the whole transaction. Next,
the executors shall give him 500 drachmas in money
and one of the servants whom Arcesilaus shall
approve, so that, in return for all the toil he has
shared with me and all the services he has rendered
me, he may have the means to maintain himself
respectably. Further, I emancipate Diophantus,
Diocles and Abus; and Simias I make over to
Arcesilaus. I also emancipate Dromo. 
<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
As soon as
Arcesilaus has arrived, Iraeus shall, with Olympichus,
Epicrates, and the other executors, prepare an
account of the money expended upon the funeral
and the other customary charges. Whatever money
remains over, Arcesilaus shall take over from
Olympichus, without however pressing him as to
times and seasons. Arcesilaus shall also cancel
the agreement made by Strato with Olympichus
and Ameinias and deposited with Philocrates the
son of Tisamenus. With regard to my monument
they shall make it as Arcesilaus, Olympichus and
Lyco shall approve."</p>
<p>Such are the terms of his extant will, according
to the Collection of Ariston of Ceos. Strato himself,
however, was, as stated above, a man entitled to
full approbation,<note n='a'><foreign lang='greek'>pollh=s th=s a)podoxh=s
a)/cios.</foreign> This phrase might be taken
as Diogenes Laertius's defence for his inclusion of the Life of
Strato. According to the scheme of i. 14, 15, the Peripatetics
ended with Theophrastus, whose successors were often held
to be vastly inferior, and unworthy to rank beside him; see
Cicero,
<hi rend='ital'>De Fin.</hi>v. &sect;&sect; 12, 13; Strabo xiii. 609. The latter
alleges as the reason for this decline the well-known story
that the school was deprived of Aristotle's library, which
had been carried away to Scepsis.</note> since he excelled in every
branch
of learning, and most of all in that which is styled
<pb n='519'/>
"physics," a branch of philosophy more ancient and
important than the others.</p>

<head>Chapter 4. LYCO (299-225 B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="65">
<p>Strato's successor was Lyco, the son of Astyanax of
Troas, a master of expression and of the foremost
rank in the education of boys. For he used to say
that modesty and love of honour were as necessary an
equipment for boys as spur and bridle for horses.
His eloquence and sonorousness of diction appear
from the following fact; he speaks of a penniless
maiden as follows: "A grievous burden to a father
is a girl, when for lack of a dowry she runs past
the flower of her age." Hence the remark which
Antigonus is said to have made about him, that it
was not possible to transfer elsewhere the fragrance
and charm of the apple, but each separate expression
must be contemplated in the speaker himself as
every single apple is on the tree.
<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>
This was because
Lyco's voice was exceedingly sweet, so that some
persons altered his name to Glyco, by prefixing a
G. But in writing he fell off sadly. For instance,
those who regretted their neglect to learn when they
had the opportunity and wished they had done so
he would hit off neatly as follows, remarking that
"they were their own accusers, betraying, by vain
regret, repentance for an incorrigible laziness."
Those who deliberated wrongly he used to say
were out in their calculations, as if they had used a
crooked rule to test something straight, or looked
at the reflection of a face in troubled water or a
distorting mirror. Again, "Many go in search of
the garland of the market-place; few or none seek
<pb n='521'/>
the crown at Olympia." He often gave the Athenians
advice on various subjects and thus conferred on
them the greatest benefits.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="67"/>
<p>In his dress he was most immaculate, so that the
clothes he wore were unsurpassed for the softness
of the material, according to Hermippus. Furthermore, he was well practised in gymnastics and kept
himself in condition, displaying all an athlete's habit
of body, with battered ears and skin begrimed with
oil, so we are told by Antigonus of Carystus. Hence
it is said that he not only wrestled but played the
game of ball common in his birthplace of Ilium. He
was esteemed beyond all other philosophers by
Eumenes and Attalus, who also did him very great
service. Antiochus too tried to get hold of him, but
without success. 
<milestone unit="section" n="68"/>
He was so hostile to Hieronymus
the Peripatetic that he alone declined to meet him
on the anniversary which we have mentioned in the
Life of Arcesilaus.<note n='a'>iv. 41.</note></p>
<p>He presided over the school forty-four years after
Strato had bequeathed it to him by his will in the
127th Olympiad.<note n='b'>274-270 b.c.</note> Not but what he also
attended
the lectures of the logician Panthoides. He died at
the age of seventy-four after severe sufferings from
gout. This is my epitaph upon him<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> vii. 112.</note>:</p>
<p>Nor, I swear! will I pass over Lyco either, for all that he
died of the gout. But this it is which amazes me the most,
if he who formerly could walk only with the feet of others,
did in a single night traverse the long, long road to Hades.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>
<p>Other men have borne the name of Lyco: (1)
a Pythagorean, (2) our present subject, (3) an epic
poet, (4) a poet who wrote epigrams.</p>
<pb n='523'/>
<p>I have also come across this philosopher's will.
It is this:</p>
<p>"These are my dispositions concerning my
property, in case I should be unable to sustain my
present ailment. All the goods in my house I give
to my brothers Astyanax and Lyco, and from this
source should, I think, be paid all the money I have
laid out at Athens, whether by borrowing or by
purchase, as well as all the cost of my funeral and the
other customary charges. 
<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
But my property in town
and at Aegina I give to Lyco because he bears the
same name with me, and has resided for a long time
with me to my entire satisfaction, as became one
whom I treated as my son. I leave the Peripatus
to such of my friends as choose to make use of it,
to Bulo, Callinus, Ariston, Amphion, Lyco, Pytho,
Aristomachus, Heracleus, Lycomedes, and my nephew
Lyco. They shall put over it any such person as
in their opinion will persevere in the work of the
school and will be most capable of extending it.
And all my other friends should co-operate for love
of me and of the spot. Bulo and Callinus, together
with their colleagues, shall provide for my funeral
and cremation, so as to avoid meanness on the
one hand and extravagance on the other. 
<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
After
my decease Lyco shall make over, for the use of the
young men, the oil from the olive-trees belonging
to me in Aegina for the due commemoration--so
long as they use it--of myself and the benefactor
who did me honour. He shall also set up my statue,
and shall choose a convenient site where it shall
be erected, with the assistance of Diophantus and
Heraclides the son of Demetrius. From my property
in town Lyco shall repay all from whom I have
<pb n='525'/>
borrowed anything after his departure. Bulo and
Callinus shall provide the sums expended upon my
funeral and other customary charges. These sums
they shall recover from the moneys in the house
bequeathed by me to them both in common. 
<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>
They
shall also remunerate the physicians Pasithemis and
Medias who for their attention to me and their skill
deserve far higher reward. I bequeath to the child
of Callinus a pair of Thericlean cups, and to his wife
a pair of Rhodian vessels, a smooth carpet, a rug with
nap on both sides, a sofa cover and two cushions the
best that are left, that, so far as I have the means
of recompensing them, I may prove not ungrateful.
With regard to the servants who have waited upon
me, my wishes are as follows. To Demetrius I
remit the purchase-money for the freedom which he
has long enjoyed, and bequeath to him five minas
and a suit of clothes to ensure him a decent maintenance, in return for all the toil he has borne with me.
To Crito of Chalcedon I also remit the purchasemoney for his freedom and bequeath to him four
minas. And Micrus I emancipate; and Lyco shall
keep him and educate him for the next six years.
<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>
And Chares I emancipate, and Lyco shall maintain
him, and I bequeath him two minas and my published
writings, while those which have not been given to
the world I entrust to Callinus, that he may carefully
edit them. To Syrus who has been set free I give
four minas and Menodora, and I remit to him any
debt he owes me. And to Hilara I give five minas
and a double-napped rug, two cushions, a sofa-cover
and a bed, whichever she prefers. I also set free the
mother of Micrus as well as No&euml;mon, Dion, Theon,
Euphranor and Hermias. Agathon should be set
<pb n='527'/>
free after two years, and the litter-bearers Ophelio
and Posidonius after four years' further service.
<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>
To Demetrius, to Crito and to Syrus I give a bed
apiece and such bed-furniture out of my estate as
Lyco shall think proper. These shall be given them
for properly performing their appointed tasks. As
regards my burial, let Lyco bury me here if he
chooses, or if he prefers to bury me at home let him
do so, for I am persuaded that his regard for propriety
is not less than my own. When he has managed all
these things, he can dispose of the property there,
and such disposition shall be binding. Witnesses are
Callinus of Hermione, Ariston of Ceos, Euphronius
of Paeania."</p>
<p>Thus while his shrewdness is seen in all his actions,
in his teaching and in all his studies, in some ways
his will is no less remarkable for carefulness and wise
management, so that in this respect also he is to be
admired</p>

<head>Chapter 5. DEMETRIUS (perhaps 350-280 B.C.;
supreme in Athens 318-307 B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="75">
<p>Demetrius, the son of Phanostratus, was a native
of Phalerum. He was a pupil of Theophrastus, but
by his speeches in the Athenian assembly he held
the chief power in the State for ten years and was
decreed 360 bronze statues, most of them representing him either on horseback or else driving a chariot
or a pair of horses. And these statues were completed in less than 300 days, so much was he
esteemed. He entered politics, says Demetrius of
Magnesia in his work on
<hi rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name,</hi>
<pb n='529'/>
when Harpalus, fleeing from Alexander,<note n='a'>324 b.c.</note>
came to
Athens. As a statesman he rendered his country
many splendid services. For he enriched the city
with revenues and buildings, though he was not of
noble birth. 
<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>
For he was one of Conon's household
servants,<note n='b'>The first sentence is paralleled by Aelian,
<hi

xii. 43

gene/sqai le/gousin
e)k th=s oi)ki/as th=s *timoqe/ou kai\ *ko/nwnos.</foreign> The insertion of this
reference to the family of Conon has had the effect of
separating two clauses which ought to be closely joined:

&sect; 75)
and
<foreign lang='greek'>a)sth=| kai\ eu)genei=</foreign>(in &sect; 76). Hesychius in
Suidas
emphasizes the beauty of Demetrius. 

In a modern book the statement
that,
according to Favorinus, Demetrius was in Conon's family
would find a more suitable place in a footnote.</note> according to
Favorinus in
the first book
of his
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>; yet Lamia, with whom he lived,
was a citizen of noble family, as Favorinus also
states in his first book. Further, in his second book
Favorinus alleges that he suffered violence from
Cleon, while Didymus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Table-talk</hi> relates how
a certain courtesan nicknamed him Charito-Blepharos
("having the eyelids of the Graces"), and Lampito
("of shining eyes"). He is said to have lost his sight
when in Alexandria and to have recovered it by the
gift of Sarapis; whereupon he composed the paeans
which are sung to this day.</p>
<p>For all his popularity with the Athenians he
nevertheless suffered eclipse through all-devouring
envy. 
<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
Having been indicted by some persons on a
capital charge, he let judgement go by default; and,
when his accusers could not get hold of his person,
they disgorged their venom on the bronze of his
statues. These they tore down from their pedestals;
some were sold, some cast into the sea, and others were
even, it is said, broken up to make bedroom-utensils.
Only one is preserved in the Acropolis. In his
<hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History</hi> Favorinus tells us that the
Athenians did this at the bidding of King Demetrius.</p>
<pb n='531'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
<p>And in the official list the year in which he was
archon was styled "the year of lawlessness," according to this same Favorinus.</p>
<p>Hermippus tells us that upon the death of Casander,
being in fear of Antigonus, he fled to Ptolemy Soter.
There he spent a considerable time and advised
Ptolemy, among other things, to invest with sovereign power his children by Eurydice. To this
Ptolemy would not agree, but bestowed the diadem
on his son by Berenice, who, after Ptolemy's death,
thought fit to detain Demetrius as a prisoner in the
country until some decision should be taken concerning him. There he lived in great dejection, and
somehow, in his sleep, received an asp-bite on the
hand which proved fatal. He is buried in the district of Busiris near Diospolis.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>
<p>Here are my lines upon him<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> vii. 113.</note>:</p>
<p>A venomous asp was the death of the wise Demetrius,
an asp withal of sticky venom, darting, not light from its
eyes, but black death.</p>
<p>Heraclides in his epitome of Sotion's
<hi rend='ital'>Successions of
Philosophers</hi> says that Ptolemy himself wished to transmit the kingdom to Philadelphus, but that Demetrius
tried to dissuade him, saying, "If you give it to another, you will not have it yourself." At the time
when he was being continually attacked in Athens,
Menander, the Comic poet, as I have also learnt, was
very nearly brought to trial for no other cause than
that he was a friend of Demetrius. However, Telesphorus, the nephew of Demetrius, begged him off.</p>
<p>In the number of his works and their total length
in lines he has surpassed almost all contemporary
Peripatetics. For in learning and versatility he has
<pb n='533'/>
<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>
no equal. Some of these works are historical and
others political; there are some dealing with poets,
others with rhetoric. Then there are public speeches
and reports of embassies, besides collections of
Aesop's fables and much else. He wrote:</p>
<p>Of Legislation at Athens, five books.</p>

<p>His style is philosophical, with an admixture of
rhetorical vigour and force. When he heard that
the Athenians had destroyed his statues, "That they
may do," said he, "but the merits which caused
them to be erected they cannot destroy." He used
to say that the eyebrows formed but a small part
of the face, and yet they can darken the whole of
life by the scorn they express. Again, he said that
not only was Plutus blind, but his guide, Fortune, as
well; that all that steel could achieve in war was
won in politics by eloquence. On seeing a young
dandy, "There," quoth he, "is a four-square
Hermes for you, with trailing robe, belly, beard and
<pb n='537'/>
all."<note n='a'>Since Herms at Athens show neither drapery nor
belly,
but archaic hair, this saying would seem either to be incorrectly reported or to need a fresh interpretation. It has
been suggested that a long lock pendent over the shoulder

made by cutting down a larger, draped, statue; or perhaps
on festal days Herms were decked with robes. In Stobaeus,
<hi rend='ital'>Flor.</hi> iv. 68, Philip is credited with a sneer to
the same
effect on Athenians at large.</note> When men are haughty and arrogant,
he
declared we should cut down their tall stature and
leave them their spirit unimpaired. Children should
honour their parents at home, out-of-doors everyone
they meet, and in solitude themselves. 
<milestone unit="section" n="83"/>
In prosperity
friends do not leave you unless desired, whereas in
adversity they stay away of their own accord. All
these sayings seem to be set down to his credit.</p>
<p>There have been twenty noteworthy men called
Demetrius: (1) a rhetorician of Chalcedon, older than
Thrasymachus; (2) the subject of this notice; (3) a
Peripatetic of Byzantium; (4) one called the graphic
writer, clear in narrative; he was also a painter;
(5) a native of Aspendus, a pupil of Apollonius of
Soli; (6) a native of Callatis, who wrote a geography
of Asia and Europe in twenty books; (7) a Byzantine,
who wrote a history of the migration of the Gauls
from Europe into Asia in thirteen books, and another
work in eight books dealing with Antiochus and
Ptolemy and their settlement of Libya; 
<milestone unit="section" n="84"/>
(8) the
sophist who lived at Alexandria, author of handbooks of rhetoric; (9) a grammarian of Adramyttium,
surnamed Ixion because he was thought to be unjust
to Hera; (10) a grammarian of Cyrene, surnamed
Wine-jar, an eminent man; (11) a native of Scepsis,
a man of wealth and good birth, ardently devoted
to learning; he was also the means of bringing his
countryman Metrodorus into prominence; (12) a
grammarian of Erythrae enrolled as a citizen of
<pb n='539'/>
Mnos; (13) a Bithynian, son of Diphilus the Stoic
and pupil of Panaetius of Rhodes; 
<milestone unit="section" n="85"/>
(14) a rhetorician
of Smyrna. The foregoing were prose authors. Of
poets bearing this name the first belonged to the
Old Comedy; the second was an epic poet whose
lines to the envious alone survive:</p>
<p>While he lives they scorn the man whom they regret when
he is gone; yet, some day, for the honour of his tomb and
lifeless image, contention seizes cities and the people set up
strife;</p>
<p>the third of Tarsus, writer of satires; the fourth, a

procession and were loud in his praise, the snake,
hearing the uproar, popped up out of the shroud,
creating widespread confusion. Subsequently, however, all was revealed, and they saw Heraclides, not
as he appeared, but as he really was."</p>
<p>I have written of him as follows<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> vii. 104.</note>:</p>
<p>You wished, Heraclides, to leave to all mankind a reputation that after death you lived as a snake.<note n='b'>Or, reading
<foreign lang='greek'>a)/parti</foreign> for
<foreign lang='greek'>a)/pasi</foreign>, "wished to leave a report
behind you that immediately after death you became a
living snake."</note> But you were
deceived, you sophist, for the snake was really a brute beast,
and you were detected as more of a beast than a sage.</p>
<p>Hippobotus too has this tale.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>
<p>Hermippus relates that, when their territory was
visited by famine, the people of Heraclea besought
the Pythian priestess for relief, but Heraclides bribed
the sacred envoys as well as the aforesaid priestess
to reply that they would be rid of the calamity if
Heraclides, the son of Euthyphro, were crowned with
a crown of gold in his lifetime and after his death
received heroic honours. The pretended oracle was
brought home, but its forgers got nothing by it.
For directly Heraclides was crowned in the theatre,
<pb n='547'/>
he was seized with apoplexy, whereupon the envoys
to the oracle were stoned to death. Moreover, at
the very same time the Pythian priestess, after she
had gone down to the shrine and taken her seat,
was bitten by one of the snakes and died instantly.
Such are the tales told about his death.</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>
<p>Aristoxenus the musician asserts that Heraclides
also composed tragedies, inscribing upon them the
name of Thespis. Chamaeleon complains that
Heraclides' treatise on the works of Homer and
Hesiod was plagiarized from his own. Furthermore,
Autodorus the Epicurean criticizes him in a polemic
against his tract Of Justice. Again, Dionysius the
Renegade, or, as some people call him, the "Spark,"
when he wrote the Parthenopaeus, entitled it a play
of Sophocles; and Heraclides, such was his credulity,
in one of his own works drew upon this forged play
as Sophoclean evidence.
<milestone unit="section" n="93"/>
Dionysius, on perceiving
this, confessed what he had done; and, when the
other denied the fact and would not believe him,
called his attention to the acrostic which gave the
name of Pancalus, of whom Dionysius was very fond.
Heraclides was still unconvinced. Such a thing, he
said, might very well happen by chance. To this
Dionysius, "You will also find these lines:</p>
<p>a. An old monkey is not caught by a trap.<note n='a'>We should say,
"An old bird is not caught with chaff."</note></p>
<p>b. Oh yes, he's caught at last, but it takes time."</p>
<p>And this besides: "Heraclides is ignorant of letters
and not ashamed of his ignorance."<note n='b'>Von Arnim's emendation
(<foreign lang='greek'>o( de\</foreign>) gives a different turn to
the story, viz. "And this besides: `Heraclides is ignorant of
letters.' This made Heraclides blush."</note></p>

ANTISTHENES (c. 446-366 B.C.)</head> 
<milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
<p>Antisthenes,<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Clem. Alex. <hi rend='ital'>Strom.</hi> i.
66.</note> the son of Antisthenes, was an Athenian. It was said,
however, that he was not of pure Attic blood. Hence his reply to one
who taunted him with this: "The mother of the gods too is a
Phrygian."<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plutarch, <hi
rend='ital'>De exilio</hi>, 607 a; Sen. <hi rend='ital'>De const.
sap.</hi> c. 18, 5.</note> For his mother was supposed to have
been a Thracian. Hence it was that, when he had distinguished
himself in the battle of Tanagra,<note n='c'>Probably the battle in
426 b.c. mentioned in Thuc. iii. 91.</note> he gave Socrates
occasion to remark that, if both his parents had been Athenians, he
would not have turned out so brave. He himself showed his contempt
for the airs which the Athenians gave themselves on the strength of
being sprung from the soil by the remark that this did not make them
any better born than snails or wingless locusts.
</p> 
<p>To begin
with, he became a pupil of Gorgias the rhetorician, and hence the
rhetorical style that he introduces in his dialogues, and especially
in his <hi rend='ital'>Truth</hi> and in his <hi
rend='ital'>Exhortations.</hi> 

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>

According to Hermippus he intended
at the public gathering for the Isthmian games to discourse on the
faults and merits of Athenians, Thebans and Lacedaemonians,
</p> <pb
n='5'/> 
<p>but begged to be excused when he saw throngs arriving
from those cities.
</p> 
<p>Later on, however, he came into touch with
Socrates, and derived so much benefit from him that he used to
advise his own disciples to become fellow-pupils with him of
Socrates. He lived in the Peiraeus, and every day would tramp the
five miles to Athens in order to hear Socrates. From Socrates he
learned his hardihood, emulating his disregard of feeling, and thus
he inaugurated the Cynic way of life. He demonstrated that pain is a
good thing by instancing the great Heracles and Cyrus, drawing the
one example from the Greek world and the other from the
barbarians.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
<p>He was the first to define statement (or
assertion) by saying that a statement is that which sets forth what
a thing was or is. He used repeatedly to say, "I'd rather be mad
than feel pleasure," and "We ought to make love to such women as
will feel a proper gratitude." When a lad from Pontus was about to
attend his lectures, and asked him what he required, the answer was,
"Come with a new book, a new pen, and new tablets, if you have a
mind to" (implying the need of brains as well).<note n='a'>There is
the same untranslateable pun upon <foreign lang='greek'>
kainou==</foreign> "new" and <foreign lang='greek'>kai\
nou=</foreign>="a mind too," as in ii. &sect; 118.</note> When someone inquired what sort of wife he ought to marry, he said, "If she's
beautiful, you'll not have her to yourself; if she's ugly, you'll
pay for it dearly." Being told that Plato was abusing him, he
remarked, "It is a royal privilege to do good and be ill spoken
of."<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> M. Anton. vii. 36 <foreign lang='greek'> *)antisq eniko/n, basili ko\n me\n eu)- pra/ttei n, kakw=s de\

<p>When he was being initiated into the
Orphic mysteries, the priest said that those admitted into these
rites would be partakers of many good things in Hades. "Why then,"
said he, "don't you die ?"
</p> <pb n='7'/> 
<p>Being reproached
because his parents were not both free-born, "Nor were they both
wrestlers," quoth he, "but yet I am a wrestler." To the question why
he had but few disciples he replied, "Because I use a silver rod to
eject them." When he was asked why he was so bitter in reproving his
pupils he replied, "Physicians are just the same with their
patients." One day upon seeing an adulterer running for his life
he exclaimed, "Poor wretch, what peril you might have escaped at the
price of an obol." He used to say, as we learn from Hecato in his
<hi rend='ital'>Anecdotes</hi>, that it is better to fall in with
crows than with flatterers; for in the one case you are devoured
when dead, in the other case while alive.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
<p>Being asked what
was the height of human bliss, he replied, "To die happy." When a
friend complained to him that he had lost his notes, "You should
have inscribed them," said he, "on your mind instead of on paper."
As iron is eaten away by rust, so, said he, the envious are consumed
by their own passion. Those who would fain be immortal must, he
declared, live piously and justly. States, said he, are doomed when
they are unable to distinguish good men from bad. Once, when he was
applauded by rascals, he remarked, "I am horribly afraid I have done
something wrong."
</p> 

<milestone unit ="section" n="6"/>
<p>When brothers agree, no fortress is so
strong as their common life, he said. The right outfit for a voyage,
he said, is such as, even if you are shipwrecked, will go through
the water with you. One day when he was censured for keeping company
with evil men, the reply he made was, "Well, physicians are in
attendance on their patients without getting
<pb n='9'/> 
the
fever themselves." "It is strange," said he, "that we weed out the
darnel from the corn and the unfit in war, but do not excuse evil
men from the service of the state." When he was asked what advantage
had accrued to him from philosophy, his answer was, "The ability to
hold converse with myself." Some one having called upon him over
the wine for a song, he replied, "Then you must accompany me on
the pipe." When Diogenes begged a coat of him, he bade him fold his
cloak around him double. 

<milestone unit ="section" n="7"/>

Being asked what learning is the most
necessary, he replied, "How to get rid of having anything to
unlearn." And he advised that when men are slandered, they should
endure it more courageously than if they were pelted with
stones.
</p> 
<p>And he used to taunt Plato with being conceited. At
all events when in a procession he spied a spirited charger he said,
turning to Plato, "It seems to me that you would have made just such
a proud, showy steed." This because Plato was constantly praising
horseflesh. And one day he visited Plato, who was ill, and seeing
the basin into which Plato had vomited, remarked, "The bile I see,
but not the pride." 

<milestone unit ="section" n="8"/>

He used to recommend the Athenians to vote that
asses are horses.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Plato, <hi
rend='ital'>Phaedrus</hi> 260 c.</note> When they deemed this
absurd, his reply was, "But yet generals are found among you who had
had no training, but were merely elected." "Many men praise you,"
said one. "Why, what wrong have I done?" was his rejoinder. When he
turned the torn part of his cloak so that it came into view,
Socrates no sooner saw this than he said, "I spy your love of fame
peeping through your cloak."<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>
Aelian, <hi rend='ital'>Var. Hist.</hi> ix. 35.</note> Phanias in
his work on the Socratics tells us how some one asked him
</p> <pb
n='11'/> 
<p>what he must do to be good and noble, and he replied,
"You must learn from those who know that the faults you have are to
be avoided." When some one extolled luxury his reply was, "May the
sons of your enemies live in luxury."
</p> 

<milestone unit ="section" n="9"/>
<p>To the youth who was
posing fantastically as an artist's model he put this question,
"Tell me, if the bronze could speak, on what, think you, would it
pride itself most?" "On its beauty," was the reply. "Then," said he,
"are you not ashamed of delighting in the very same quality as an
inanimate object?" When a young man from Pontus promised to treat
him with great consideration as soon as his boat with its freight of
salt fish should arrive, he took him and an empty wallet to a
flour-dealer's, got it filled, and was going away. When the woman
asked for the money, "The young man will pay," said he, "when his
boatload of salt fish arrives."
</p> 
<p>Antisthenes is held
responsible for the exile of Anytus and the execution of Meletus.

<milestone unit ="section" n="10"/>
For he fell in with some youths from Pontus whom the fame of
Socrates had brought to Athens, and he led them off to Anytus, whom
he ironically declared to be wiser than Socrates; whereupon (it is
said) those about him with much indignation drove Anytus out of the
city. If he saw a woman anywhere decked out with ornaments, he would
hasten to her house and bid her husband bring out his horse and
arms, and then, if the man possessed them, let his extravagance
alone, for (he said) the man could with these defend himself; but,
if he had none, he would bid him strip off the finery.
</p>

<p>Favourite themes<note n='a'>Here follow three extracts of Cynic
maxims or rules of conduct; for, strictly speaking, they had no
tenets proper ( <foreign lang='greek'>do/cai, do/gmat a</foreign>).
The last ( &sect; 13) seems to be derived from Diocles.</note> with
him were the following. He would prove that virtue can be taught;
that
<pb n='13'/> 
nobility belongs to none other than the
virtuous. 

<milestone unit ="section" n="11"/>

And he held virtue to be sufficient in itself to ensure
happiness, since it needed nothing else except the strength of a
Socrates. And he maintained that virtue is an affair of deeds and
does not need a store of words or learning; that the wise man is
selfsufficing, for all the goods of others are his; that ill
repute is a good thing and much the same as pain; that the wise man
will be guided in his public acts not by the established laws but by
the law of virtue; that he will also marry in order to have children
from union with the handsomest women; furthermore that he will not
disdain to love, for only the wise man knows who are worthy to be
loved.
</p> 

<milestone unit ="section" n="12"/>
<p>Diocles records the following sayings of his: To the
wise man nothing is foreign or impracticable. A good man deserves
to be loved. Men of worth are friends. Make allies of men who are at
once brave and just. Virtue is a weapon that cannot be taken away.
It is better to be with a handful of good men fighting against all
the bad, than with hosts of bad men against a handful of good men.
Pay attention to your enemies, for they are the first to discover
your mistakes. Esteem an honest man above a kinsman. Virtue is the
same for women as for men. Good actions are fair and evil actions
foul. Count all wickedness foreign and alien.
</p> 

<milestone unit ="section" n="13"/>
<p>Wisdom is a
most sure stronghold which never crumbles away nor is betrayed.
Walls of defence must be constructed in our own impregnable reasonings. He used to converse in the gymnasium of Cynosarges (White
hound) at no great distance from the gates, and some think that the
Cynic school derived its name from Cynosarges. Antisthenes
</p> <pb
n='15'/> 
<p>himself too was nicknamed a hound pure and simple. And
he was the first, Diocles tells us, to double his cloak and be
content with that one garment and to take up a staff and a wallet.
Neanthes too asserts that he was the first to double his mantle.
Sosicrates, however, in the third book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers</hi> says this was first
done by Diodorus of Aspendus, who also let his beard grow and used a
staff and a wallet.
</p> 

<milestone unit ="section" n="14"/>

<p>Of all the Socratics Antisthenes alone is
praised by Theopompus, who says he had consummate skill and could by
means of agreeable discourse win over whomsoever he pleased. And
this is clear from his writings and from Xenophon's <hi
rend='ital'>Banquet.</hi> It would seem that the most manly section
of the Stoic School owed its origin to him. Hence Athenaeus the
epigrammatist writes thus of them<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> ix. 496.</note>:
</p> 
<p>Ye experts in Stoic story, ye who
commit to sacred pages most excellent doctrines--that virtue alone
is the good of the soul: for virtue alone saves man's life and
cities. But that Muse<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> Erato;

<p>Antisthenes<note n='c'>It seems clear that the passage
which begins here is not from the same source as that (in &sect; 14)

you need of a friend?" Once too Diogenes, when he came to him,
brought a dagger. And when Antisthenes cried out, "Who will release
me from these pains?" replied, "This," showing him the dagger. "I
said," quoth the other, "from my pains, not from life."

<milestone unit ="section" n="19"/>

It was
thought that he showed some weakness in bearing his malady through
love of life. And here are my verses upon him<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 115.</note>:
</p> 
<p>Such was your
nature, Antisthenes, that in your lifetime you were a very bulldog
to rend the heart with words, if not with teeth. Yet you died of
consumption. Maybe some one will say, What of that? We must anyhow
have some guide to the world below.
</p> 
<p>There have been three
other men named Antisthenes: one a follower of Heraclitus, another
a
<pb n='23'/> 
native of Ephesus, and the third of Rhodes, a
historian.
</p> 
<p>And whereas we have enumerated the pupils of
Aristippus and of Phaedo, we will now append an account of the
Cynics and Stoics who derive from Antisthenes. And let it be in the
following order.
</p></div2> 
<div2 n="2" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 2. DIOGENES (404-323
B.C.)</head> 

<div3 type="section" n="20">
<p>Diogenes was a native of Sinope, son of Hicesius, a
banker. Diocles relates that he went into exile because his father
was entrusted with the money of the state and adulterated the
coinage. But Eubulides in his book on Diogenes says that Diogenes
himself did this and was forced to leave home along with his father.
Moreover Diogenes himself actually confesses in his <hi
rend='ital'>Pordalus</hi> that he adulterated the coinage. Some say
that having been appointed to superintend the workmen he was
persuaded by them, and that he went to Delphi or to the Delian
oracle in his own city and inquired of Apollo whether he should do
what he was urged to do. When the god gave him permission to alter
the political currency, not understanding what this meant, he
adulterated the state coinage, and when he was detected, according
to some he was banished, while according to others he voluntarily
quitted the city for fear of consequences. 

<milestone unit ="section" n="21"/>

One version is that his
father entrusted him with the money and that he debased it, in
consequence of which the father was imprisoned and died, while the
son fled, came to Delphi, and inquired, not whether he should
falsify the coinage, but what he should do to gain the greatest
reputation ; and that then it was that he received the oracle.
</p>
<pb n='25'/> 
<p>On reaching Athens he fell in with Antisthenes.
Being repulsed by him, because he never welcomed pupils, by sheer
persistence Diogenes wore him out. Once when he stretched out his
staff against him, the pupil offered his head with the words,
"Strike, for you will find no wood hard enough to keep me away from
you, so long as I think you've something to say." From that time
forward he was his pupil, and, exile as he was, set out upon a
simple life.

<milestone unit ="section" n="22"/>
<p>Through watching a mouse running about, says
Theophrastus in the Megarian dialogue, not looking for a place to
lie down in, not afraid of the dark, not seeking any of the things
which are considered to be dainties, he discovered the means of
adapting himself to circumstances. He was the first, say some, to
fold his cloak because he was obliged to sleep in it as well, and he
carried a wallet to hold his victuals, and he used any place for any
purpose, for breakfasting, sleeping, or conversing. And then he
would say, pointing to the portico of Zeus and the Hall of
Processions, that the Athenians had provided him with places to live
in. 

<milestone unit ="section" n="23"/>

He did not lean upon a staff until he grew infirm ; but
afterwards he would carry it everywhere, not indeed in the city, but
when walking along the road with it and with his wallet ; so say
Olympiodorus,<note n='a'>An eminent politician. Pausanias, i. cc.

He was
great at pouring scorn on his contemporaries. The school of
Euclides he called bilious, and Plato's lectures waste of time, the
performances at the Dionysia great peep-shows for fools, and the

physicians, philosophers and pilots at their work, he deemed man the
most intelligent of all animals ; but when again he saw interpreters
of dreams and diviners and those who attended to them, or those who
were puffed up with conceit of wealth, he thought no animal more
silly. He would continually say<note n='a'>Some of the stories which

taking olives, "How is it," he said,<note n='b'>Obviously Favorinus
was not the author (<hi rend='ital'>vide infra</hi>) whom Laertius
followed here.</note> "that you the philosopher who sailed to Sicily
for the sake of these dishes, now when they are before you do not
enjoy them ?" "Nay, by the gods, Diogenes," replied Plato, "there
also for the most part I lived upon olives and such like." "Why
then," said Diogenes, "did you need to go to Syracuse ? Was it that
Attica at that time did not grow olives ?" But Favorinus in his <hi
rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History</hi> attributes this to
Aristippus. Again, another time he was eating dried figs when he
encountered Plato and offered him a share of them. When Plato took
them and ate them, he said, "I said you might share them, not that
you might eat them all up."

<milestone unit ="section" n="26"/>
<p>And one day when Plato had
invited to his house
<pb n='29'/> 
friends coming from
Dionysius, Diogenes trampled upon his carpets and said, "I trample
upon Plato's vainglory." Plato's reply was, "How much pride you
expose to view, Diogenes, by seeming not to be proud." Others tell
us that what Diogenes said was, "I trample upon the pride of Plato,"
who retorted, "Yes, Diogenes, with pride of another sort."

asked him for wine, and after that also for some dried figs ; and
Plato sent him a whole jar full. Then the other said, "If some one
asks you how many two and two are, will you answer, Twenty ? So, it
seems, you neither give as you are asked nor answer as you are
questioned." Thus he scoffed at him as one who talked without
end.

<p>Being asked where in Greece he saw good men, he replied,
"Good men nowhere, but good boys at Lacedaemon." When one day he was
gravely discoursing and nobody attended to him, he began
whistling, and as people clustered about him, he reproached them
with coming in all seriousness to hear nonsense, but slowly and
contemptuously when the theme was serious. He would say that men
strive in digging<note n='b'>From Epictetus iii. 15. 4 it is evident
that competition in digging trenches (<foreign lang='greek'>e)n tw=|
a)gw=ni paroru/s sesqai</foreign> ) formed a part of the course of
preparation which athletes underwent at Olympia.</note> and kicking
to outdo one another, but no one strives to become a good man and
true. And he would wonder that the grammarians should investigate
the ills of Odysseus, while they were ignorant of their own. Or that
the musicians should tune the strings of the lyre, while leaving the
dispositions of their own souls discordant ;

<milestone unit ="section" n="28"/>

that the mathematicians
should gaze at the sun
<pb n='31'/> 
and the moon, but
overlook matters close at hand; that the orators should make a fuss
about justice in their speeches, but never practise it ; or that the
avaricious should cry out against money, while inordinately fond of
it. He used also to condemn those who praised honest men for being
superior to money, while themselves envying the very rich. He was
moved to anger that men should sacrifice to the gods to ensure
health and in the midst of the sacrifice should feast to the
detriment of health. He was astonished that when slaves saw their
masters were gluttons, they did not steal some of the viands. 

<milestone unit ="section" n="29"/>

He
would praise those who were about to marry and refrained, those who
intending to go a voyage never set sail, those who thinking to
engage in politics do no such thing, those also who purposing to
rear a family do not do so, and those who make ready to live with
potentates, yet never come near them after all. He used to say,
moreover, that we ought to stretch out our hands to our friends with
the fingers open and not closed.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>

"let not thine hand be stretched out to receive, and shut when thou
shouldest repay."</note> Menippus<note n='b'>Menagius, followed by
H&uuml;bner, on the authority of Ambrosius, reads "Hermippus"; for among
the works of Menippus enumerated by Laertius below (&sect; 101) there is no
mention of a "Sale of Diogenes."</note> in his <hi rend='ital'>Sale
of Diogenes</hi> tells how, when he was captured and put up for
sale, he was asked what he could do. He replied, "Govern men." And
he told the crier to give notice in case anybody wanted to purchase
a master for himself. Having been forbidden to sit down, "It makes
no difference," said he, "for in whatever position fishes lie, they
still find purchasers." 

<milestone unit ="section" n="30"/>

And he said he marvelled that before we buy
a jar or dish we try whether it rings true, but if it is a man are
content merely to look
<pb n='33'/> 
at him. To Xeniades who
purchased him he said, "You must obey me, although I am a slave ;
for, if a physician or a steersman were in slavery, he would be
obeyed." Eubulus in his book entitled <hi rend='ital'>The Sale of
Diogenes</hi> tells us that this was how he trained the sons of
Xeniades. After their other studies he taught them to ride, to shoot
with the bow, to sling stones and to hurl javelins. Later, when they
reached the wrestling-school, he would not permit the master to give
them full athletic training, but only so much as to heighten their
colour and keep them in good condition.

The boys used to get
by heart many passages from poets, historians, and the writings of
Diogenes himself ; and he would practise them in every short cut to
a good memory. In the house too he taught them to wait upon
themselves, and to be content with plain fare and water to drink. He
used to make them crop their hair close and to wear it unadorned,
and to go lightly clad, barefoot, silent, and not looking about them
in the streets. He would also take them out hunting. They on their
part had a great regard for Diogenes and made requests of their
parents for him. The same Eubulus relates that he grew old in the
house of Xeniades, and when he died was buried by his sons. There
Xeniades once asked him how he wished to be buried. To which he
replied, "On my face." 

<milestone unit ="section" n="32"/>

"Why ?" inquired the other. "Because," said
he, "after a little time down will be converted into up." This
because the Macedonians had now got the supremacy, that is, had
risen high from a humble position. Some one took him into a
magnificent house and warned him not to expectorate, whereupon
having cleared his throat
<pb n='35'/> 
he discharged the
phlegm into the man's face, being unable, he said, to find a meaner
receptacle. Others father this upon Aristippus. One day he shouted
out for men, and when people collected, hit out at them with his
stick, saying, "It was men I called for, not scoundrels." This is
told by Hecato in the first book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Anecdotes.</hi> Alexander is reported to have said, "Had
I not been Alexander, I should have liked to be Diogenes."
</p>
<milestone unit ="section" n="33"/>
<p>The word "disabled" (<foreign lang='greek'> a)naph/ro

blind, but to those who have no wallet (<foreign lang='greek'>ph/ra</foreign>). One day he made his way with head half
shaven into a party of young revellers, as Metrocles relates in his
<hi rend='ital'>Anecdotes,</hi> and was roughly handled by them.
Afterwards he entered on a tablet the names of those who had struck
him and went about with the tablet hung round his neck, till he had
covered them with ridicule and brought universal blame and discredit
upon them. He described himself as a hound of the sort which all men
praise, but no one, he added, of his admirers dared go out hunting
along with him. When some one boasted that at the Pythian games he
had vanquished men, Diogenes replied, "Nay, I defeat men, you defeat
slaves."

<p>To those who said to him, "You are an old man ; take
a rest," "What ?" he replied, "if I were running in the stadium,
ought I to slacken my pace when approaching the goal ? ought I not
rather to put on speed ?" Having been invited to a dinner, he
declared that he wouldn't go ; for, the last time he went, his host
had not expressed a proper gratitude. He would walk upon snow
barefoot and do the other things mentioned above. Not only so ;
he
<pb n='37'/> 
even attempted to eat meat raw, but could not
manage to digest it. He once found Demosthenes the orator lunching
at an inn, and, when he retired within, Diogenes said, "All the more
you will be inside the tavern." When some strangers expressed a wish
to see Demosthenes, he stretched out his middle finger and said,
"There goes the demagogue of Athens."

Some one dropped a loaf of
bread and was ashamed to pick it up ; whereupon Diogenes, wishing to
read him a lesson, tied a rope to the neck of a wine-jar and
proceeded to drag it across the Ceramicus.
</p> 
<p>He used to say
that he followed the example of the trainers of choruses ; for they
too set the note a little high, to ensure that the rest should hit
the right note. Most people, he would say, are so nearly mad that a
finger makes all the difference. For, if you go along with your
middle finger stretched out, some one will think you mad, but, if
it's the little finger, he will not think so. Very valuable things,
said he, were bartered for things of no value, and <hi

</p>

<p>Diogenes asked, "If you had been ill and had purchased a doctor,
would you then, instead of obeying him, have said 'Backward the
streams flow to their founts'" ? Some one wanted to study philosophy
under him. Diogenes gave him a tunny to carry and told him to follow
him. And when for shame the man threw it away and departed,
</p> <pb
n='39'/> 
<p>some time after on meeting him he laughed and said, "The
friendship between you and me was broken by a tunny." The version
given by Diocles, however, is as follows. Some one having said to
him, "Lay your commands upon us, Diogenes," he took him away and
gave him a cheese to carry, which cost half an obol. The other
declined ; whereupon he remarked, "The friendship between you and
me is broken by a little cheese worth half an obol."

<p>One day,
observing a child drinking out of his hands, he cast away the cup
from his wallet with the words, "A child has beaten me in plainness
of living." He also threw away his bowl when in like manner he saw a
child who had broken his plate taking up his lentils with the hollow
part of a morsel of bread. He used also to reason thus: "All things
belong to the gods. The wise are friends of the gods, and friends
hold things in common. Therefore all things belong to the wise." One
day he saw a woman kneeling before the gods in an ungraceful
attitude, and wishing to free her of superstition, according to
Zo&iuml;lus of Perga, he came forward and said, "Are you not afraid, my
good woman, that a god may be standing behind you ?--for all things
are full of his presence--and you may be put to shame ?"

like." To which he replied, "Stand out of my light."<note n='a'><hi

Some one had been reading aloud for a very long time, and when he
was near the end of the roll pointed to a space with no writing on
it. "Cheer up, my men," cried Diogenes ; "there's land in sight." To
one who by argument had proved conclusively that he had horns, he
said, touching his forehead, "Well, I for my part don't see any."

<milestone unit ="section" n="39"/>

In
like manner, when somebody declared that there is no such thing as
motion, he got up and walked about. When some one was discoursing on
celestial phenomena, "How many days," asked Diogenes, "were you in
coming from the sky ?" A eunuch of bad character had inscribed on
his door the words, "Let nothing evil enter." "How then," he asked,
"is the master of the house to get in ?" When he had anointed his
feet with unguent, he declared that from his head the unguent passed
into the air, but from his feet into his nostrils. The Athenians
urged him to become initiated, and told him that in the other world
those who have been initiated enjoy a special privilege. "It would
be ludicrous," quoth he, "if Agesilaus and Epaminondas are to dwell
in the mire, while certain folk of no account will live in the Isles
of the Blest because they have been initiated."

<p>When mice

As he was leaving the public
<pb n='43'/> 
baths, somebody
inquired if many men were bathing. He said, No. But to another who
asked if there was a great crowd of bathers, he said, Yes. Plato had
defined Man as an animal, biped and featherless, and was applauded.
Diogenes plucked a fowl and brought it into the lecture-room with
the words, "Here is Plato's man." In consequence of which there was
added to the definition, "having broad nails." To one who asked what
was the proper time for lunch, he said, "If a rich man, when you
will; if a poor man, when you can."

<p>At Megara he saw the

were protected by coverings of skin, partly against damage from
brambles and partly to preserve the colour (Varro, <hi

when he heard of the execution of Antipater, "It is better to be
Herod's pig than his son."</note> To one who had brandished a beam
at him and then cried, "Look out," he replied, "What, are you
intending to strike me again?" He used to call the demagogues the
lackeys of the people and the crowns awarded to them the
efflorescence of fame. He lit a lamp in broad daylight and said, as
he went about, "I am looking for a man." One day he got a thorough
drenching where he stood, and, when the bystanders pitied him, Plato
said, if they really pitied him, they should move away, alluding to
his vanity. When some one hit him a blow with his fist, "Heracles,"
said he, "how came I to forget to put on a helmet when I walked

<p>When
Lysias the druggist asked him if he believed in the gods, "How can I
help believing in them," said he, "when I see a god-forsaken wretch
like you?" Others give this retort to Theodorus. Seeing some one
perform religious purification, he said, "Unhappy man, don't you
know that you can no more get rid of errors of conduct by
sprinklings than you can of mistakes in grammar?" He would rebuke
men in general with regard to their prayers, declaring that they
asked for those things which seemed to them to be good, not for such
as are truly good.

As for those who were excited over their dreams
he would say that they cared nothing for what they did in their
waking hours, but kept their curiosity for the visions called up in
their sleep. At Olympia, when the herald proclaimed Dioxippus to be
victor over the men, Diogenes protested, "Nay, he is victorious over
slaves, I over men."
</p> 
<p>Still he was loved by the Athenians. At
all events, when a youngster broke up his tub, they gave the boy a
flogging and presented Diogenes with another. Dionysius the Stoic
says that after Chaeronea he was seized and dragged off to Philip,
and being asked who he was, replied, "A spy upon your insatiable
greed." For this he was admired and set free.

would have expected the threat to be that Perdiccas would be quite
happy to do without his company. He would often insist loudly that
the gods had given to men the means of living easily, but this had
been put out of sight, because we require honeyed cakes, unguents
and the like. Hence to a man whose shoes were being put on by his

were, "Leave off dishonouring the habiliments of courage." When
some one was extolling the good fortune of Callisthenes and saying

him, he declined to answer unless he pulled up his robe and showed
whether he was man or woman. A youth was playing cottabos in the

public bath which was dirty he said, "When people have bathed here,

standing right opposite to him. Having thus drawn off the

that they should desert the orator to look at
himself. A very superstitious person addressed him thus, "With one
blow I will break your head." "And I," said Diogenes, "by a sneeze
from the left will make you tremble." Hegesias having asked him to

was the right time to marry, Diogenes replied, "For a young man not
yet: for an old man never at all." Being asked what he would take to
be soundly cuffed, he replied, "A helmet." Seeing a youth dressing
with elaborate care, he said, "If it's for men, you're a fool; if
for women, a knave." One day he detected a youth blushing.
"Courage," quoth he, "that is the hue
<pb n='57'/> 
of
virtue." One day after listening to a couple of lawyers disputing,
he condemned them both, saying that the one had no doubt stolen, but
the other had not lost anything. To the question what wine he found
pleasant to drink, he replied, "That for which other people pay."
When he was told that many people laughed at him, he made answer,
"But I am not laughed down."

<p>When some one declared that life
is an evil, he corrected him: "Not life itself, but living ill."
When he was advised to go in pursuit of his runaway slave, he
replied, "It would be absurd, if Manes can live without Diogenes,
but Diogenes cannot get on without Manes." When breakfasting on
olives amongst which a cake had been inserted, he flung it away and
addressed it thus:

<p>Being asked what kind of hound he was, he

<p>Being asked if
the wise eat cakes, "Yes," he said, "cakes of all kinds, just like

was begging of a miserly man who was slow to respond; so he
</p> <pb

<p>said, "My friend, it's for food that I'm asking, not for
funeral expenses." Being reproached one day for having falsified the
currency, he said, "That was the time when I was such as you are
now; but such as I am now, you will never be." To another who
reproached him for the same offence he made a more scurrilous

fat, and said, "Let us beggars have something of your paunch ; it
will be a relief to you, and we shall get advantage." And when the
same man was discoursing, Diogenes distracted his audience by
producing some salt fish. This annoyed the lecturer, and Diogenes
said, "An obol's worth of salt fish has broken up Anaximenes'
lecture-class."

<p>Being reproached for eating in the

quietly said to him, "Had you paid court to Dionysius, you wouldn't
now be washing lettuces," and that he with equal calmness made
answer, "If you had washed lettuces,
<pb n='61'/> 
you

people laugh at you," his reply was, "And so very likely do the
asses at them; but as they don't care for the asses, so neither do I

<p>When some one
expressed astonishment at the votive offerings in Samothrace, his
comment was, "There would have been far more, if those who were not

Diagoras of Melos. To a handsome youth, who was going out to dinner,
he said, "You will come back a worse man." When he came back and
said next day, "I went and am none the worse for it," Diogenes said,
"Not Worse-man (Chiron), but Lax-man (Eurytion)."<note n='a'>As
Chiron was the wisest and best, so Eurytion was the most
intemperate, of the Centaurs: "Eurytion, ebriosus ille Centaurus"

said, "Yes, if you can persuade me." "If I could have persuaded
you," said Diogenes, "I would have persuaded you to hang yourself."
He was returning from Lacedaemon to Athens; and on some one
asking, "Whither and whence?" he replied, "From the men's apartments to the women's."

<p>He was returning from Olympia, and
when somebody inquired whether there was a great crowd, "Yes," he
said, "a great crowd, but few who could be called men." Libertines
he compared to figtrees growing upon a cliff: whose fruit is not
enjoyed by any man, but is eaten by ravens and vultures. When Phryne
set up a golden statue of Aphrodite in Delphi, Diogenes is said to
have written upon it: "From the licentiousness of Greece."

glances at a courtesan, "See," he said, "yonder ram frenzied for
battle, how he is held fast by the neck fascinated by a common
minx." Handsome courtesans he would compare to a deadly honeyed
potion. He was breakfasting in the marketplace, and the bystanders
gathered round him with cries of "dog." "It is you who are dogs,"
cried he, "when you stand round and watch me at my breakfast." When
two cowards hid away from him, he called out, "Don't be afraid, a
hound is not fond of beetroot."

After seeing a stupid wrestler practising as a doctor he inquired of him, "What does this mean ? Is it
that you may now have your revenge on the rivals who formerly beat
you ?" Seeing the child of a courtesan throw stones at a crowd, he
cried out, "Take care you don't hit your father."
</p> 
<p>A boy
having shown him a dagger that he had received from an admirer,
Diogenes remarked, "A pretty blade with an ugly handle." When some
people commended a person who had given him a gratuity, he broke in
with "You have no praise for me who was worthy to receive it." When
some one asked that he might have back his cloak, "If it was
</p> <pb

<p>a gift," replied Diogenes, "I possess it ; while, if it
was a loan, I am using it." A supposititious son having told him
that he had gold in the pocket of his dress, "True," said he, "and
therefore you sleep with it under your pillow."

On being asked what
he had gained from philosophy, he replied, "This at least, if
nothing else--to be prepared for every fortune." Asked where he came
from, he said, "I am a citizen of the world."<note n='a'>If this
answer is authentic, it apparently shows that the famous term
"cosmopolitan" originated with Diogenes.</note> Certain parents were
sacrificing to the gods, that a son might be born to them. "But,"
said he, "do you not sacrifice to ensure what manner of man he shall
turn out to be ?" When asked for a subscription towards a club, he
said to the president :
</p> 
<p><hi rend='center'>Despoil the rest ;

<p>There is no such line in
our mss. of Homer ; it is unknown to the Scholiasts and to
Eustathius. Joshua Barnes, in his edition of the <hi

about 1718, as follows (<hi rend='ital'>Il.</hi> xvi. 86):
</p>

<p>"Rage uncontrolled through all the hostile crew, But touch not
Hector, Hector is my due."

<p>In Clarke's edition of 1740 it is
expelled from the text and relegated to a footnote. J. H. Voss,

regarded it as Homeric, but found a fresh place for it, after xvi.

<p>The mistresses of kings he designated
queens ; for, said he, they make the kings do their bidding. When
the Athenians gave Alexander the title of Dionysus, he said, "Me too
you might make Sarapis."<note n='c'>"Sarapis" was represented, like
Pluto, as seated with an animal by his side having the head of a

<p>When he was dining in a

him, "You don't know anything, although you are a philosopher," he
replied, "Even if I am but a pretender to wisdom,
<pb n='67'/>

that in itself is philosophy." When some one brought a child to
him and declared him to be highly gifted and of excellent character,
"What need then," said he, "has he of me ?" Those who say admirable
things, but fail to do them, he compared to a harp ; for the harp,
like them, he said, has neither hearing nor perception. He was going
into a theatre, meeting face to face those who were coming out, and
being asked why, "This," he said, "is what I practise doing all my

"Are you not ashamed," said he, "to give this wood concordant

who protested that he was ill adapted for the study of philosophy,
he said, "Why then do you live, if you do not care to live well ?"
To one who despised his father, "Are you not ashamed," he said, "to

man, are you at such pains to gain your suit, when it would be

"Beware lest the sweet scent on your head cause an ill odour in your

for a mina. "Because," said Diogenes, "I expect to receive from

replying "A good thing," "Who then," said Diogenes, "is afraid of

the young, consolation to the
<pb n='71'/> 
old, wealth to the
poor, and ornament to the rich. When Didymon, who was a rake, was
once treating a girl's eye, "Beware," says Diogenes, "lest the
oculist instead of curing the eye should ruin the pupil." On
somebody declaring that his own friends were plotting against him,
Diogenes exclaimed, "What is to be done then, if you have to treat
friends and enemies alike ?"

<p>Being asked what was the most
beautiful thing in the world, he replied, "Freedom of speech." On
entering a boys' school, he found there many statues of the Muses,
but few pupils. "By the help of the gods," said he, "schoolmaster,
you have plenty of pupils." It was his habit to do everything in
public, the works of Demeter and of Aphrodite alike. He used to draw
out the following arguments. "If to breakfast be not absurd, neither
is it absurd in the market-place ; but to breakfast is not absurd,
therefore it is not absurd to breakfast in the marketplace."
Behaving indecently in public, he wished "it were as easy to banish
hunger by rubbing the belly." Many other sayings are attributed to
him, which it would take long to enumerate.<note n='a'>&sect;&sect; 70-73. As &sect; 74

<p>He used to affirm that
training was of two kinds, mental and bodily : the latter being that
whereby, with constant exercise, perceptions are formed such as
secure freedom of movement for virtuous deeds ; and the one half of
this training is incomplete without the other, good health and
strength being just as much included among the essential things,
whether for body or soul. And he would adduce indisputable evidence
to show how easily from
<pb n='73'/> 
gymnastic training we
arrive at virtue. For in the manual crafts and other arts it can be
seen that the craftsmen develop extraordinary manual skill through
practice. Again, take the case of flute-players and of athletes :
what surpassing skill they acquire by their own incessant toil ;
and, if they had transferred their efforts to the training of the
mind, how certainly their labours would not have been unprofitable
or ineffective.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
<p>Nothing in life, however, he maintained, has
any chance of succeeding without strenuous practice ; and this is
capable of overcoming anything. Accordingly, instead of useless
toils men should choose such as nature recommends, whereby they
might have lived happily. Yet such is their madness that they choose
to be miserable. For even the despising of pleasure is itself most
pleasurable, when we are habituated to it ; and just as those
accustomed to a life of pleasure feel disgust when they pass over to
the opposite experience, so those whose training has been of the
opposite kind derive more pleasure from despising pleasure than from
the pleasures themselves. This was the gist of his conversation ;
and it was plain that he acted accordingly, adulterating currency in
very truth, allowing convention no such authority as he allowed to
natural right, and asserting that the manner of life he lived was
the same as that of Heracles when he preferred liberty to
everything.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>
<p>He maintained that all things are the property of
the wise, and employed such arguments as those cited above. All
things belong to the gods. The gods are friends to the wise, and
friends share all property in common ; therefore all things are the
property of the wise. Again as to law : that it is
<pb n='75'/>

impossible for society to exist without law ; for without a city
no benefit can be derived from that which is civilized. But the city
is civilized, and there is no advantage in law without a city ;
therefore law is something civilized. He would ridicule good birth
and fame and all such distinctions, calling them showy ornaments of
vice. The only true commonwealth was, he said, that which is as wide
as the universe. He advocated community of wives, recognizing no
other marriage than a union of the man who persuades with the woman
who consents. And for this reason he thought sons too should be held
in common.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>
<p>And he saw no impropriety either in stealing anything from a temple or in eating the flesh of any animal ; nor even
anything impious in touching human flesh, this, he said, being clear
from the custom of some foreign nations. Moreover, according to
right reason, as he put it, all elements are contained in all things
and pervade everything : since not only is meat a constituent of
bread, but bread of vegetables ; and all other bodies also, by means
of certain invisible passages and particles, find their way in and
unite with all substances in the form of vapour. This he makes plain
in the <hi rend='ital'>Thyestes</hi>, if the tragedies are really
his and not the work of his friend Philiscus of Aegina or of
Pasiphon, the son of Lucian,<note n='a'>It has been conjectured that
the Pasiphon meant was the philosopher of Eretria, to whom Persaeus
attributed the composition of spurious Socratic Dialogues (<hi

regard him as the author of the <foreign lang='greek'>*pi/nac</foreign> attributed to Cebes by D. L. ii. 125 (v. Susemihl, <hi

<p>He became very ready also at repartee in verbal debates, as is
evident from what has been said above.
</p> 
<p>Further, when he was
sold as a slave, he endured it most nobly. For on a voyage to Aegina
he was captured by pirates under the command of Scirpalus,<note
n='a'>"Harpalus" according to Cic. <hi rend='ital'>N.D.</hi> iii.
34. 83.</note> conveyed to Crete and exposed for sale. When the
auctioneer asked in what he was proficient, he replied, "In ruling
men." Thereupon he pointed to a certain Corinthian with a fine
purple border to his robe, the man named Xeniades above-mentioned,
and said, "Sell me to this man ; he needs a master." Thus Xeniades
came to buy him, and took him to Corinth and set him over his own
children and entrusted his whole household to him. And he
administered it in all respects in such a manner that Xeniades used
to go about saying, "A good genius has entered my house."
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>
<p>Cleomenes in his work entitled <hi rend='ital'>Concerning Pedagogues</hi> says that the friends of Diogenes wanted to ransom him,
whereupon he called them simpletons ; for, said he, lions are not
the slaves of those who feed them, but rather those who feed them
are at the mercy of the lions : for fear is the mark of the slave,
whereas wild beasts make men afraid of them. The man had in fact a
wonderful gift of persuasion, so that he could easily vanquish
anyone he liked in argument. At all events a certain Onesicritus of
Aegina is said to have sent to Athens the one of his two sons named
Androsthenes, and he having become a pupil of Diogenes stayed there
; the father then sent the other also, the aforesaid Philiscus, who
was the elder, in search of him ; but Philiscus also was detained in
the same way. 

<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>

When, thirdly, the father himself arrived, he was just
as much attracted to the
<pb n='79'/> 
pursuit of philosophy
as his sons and joined the circle--so magical was the spell which
the discourses of Diogenes exerted. Amongst his hearers was Phocion
surnamed the Honest, and Stilpo the Megarian, and many other men
prominent in political life.
</p> 
<p>Diogenes is said to have been
nearly ninety years old when he died. Regarding his death there are
several different accounts. One is that he was seized with colic
after eating an octopus raw and so met his end. Another is that he
died voluntarily by holding his breath. This account was followed by
Cercidas of Megalopolis (or of Crete), who in his meliambics writes
thus :
</p> 
<p>Not so he who aforetime was a citizen of Sinope,
</p>

<p>That famous one who carried a staff, doubled his cloak, and lived
in the open air.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
<p>But he soared aloft with his lip tightly
pressed against his teeth
</p> 
<p>And holding his breath withal. For
in truth he was rightly named
</p> 
<p>Diogenes, a true-born son of
Zeus, a hound of heaven.
</p> 
<p>Another version is that, while
trying to divide an octopus amongst the dogs, he was so severely
bitten on the sinew of the foot that it caused his death. His
friends, however, according to Antisthenes in his <hi
rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers</hi>, conjectured that it
was due to the retention of his breath. For he happened to be living
in the Craneum, the gymnasium in front of Corinth. When his friends
came according to custom and found him wrapped up in his cloak, they
thought that he must be asleep, although he was by no means of a
drowsy or somnolent habit. They therefore drew aside his cloak and
found that
<pb n='81'/> 
he was dead. This they supposed to
have been his deliberate act in order to escape thenceforward from
life.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
<p>Hence, it is said, arose a quarrel among his disciples as to who should bury him : nay, they even came to blows ;
but, when their fathers and men of influence arrived, under their
direction he was buried beside the gate leading to the Isthmus. Over
his grave they set up a pillar and a dog in Parian marble upon it.
Subsequently his fellow-citizens honoured him with bronze statues,
on which these verses were inscribed :
</p> 
<p>Time makes even bronze
grow old : but thy glory, Diogenes, all eternity will never destroy.
Since thou alone didst point out to mortals the lesson of
self-sufficingness and the easiest path of life.<note n='a'><hi

<p>But some say that when dying he left instructions
that they should throw him out unburied, that every wild beast might
feed on him, or thrust him into a ditch and sprinkle a little dust
over him. But according to others his instructions were that they
should throw him into the Ilissus, in order that he might be useful
to his brethren.
</p> 
<p>Demetrius in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Men

laid down is unquestionable." The second--of Sicyon--who wrote an

century B.C.)</head> 

<div3 type="section" n="82">
<p>Monimus of Syracuse was a pupil of Diogenes
; and, according to Sosicrates, he was in the service of a certain
Corinthian banker, to whom Xeniades, the purchaser of Diogenes, made
frequent visits, and by the account which he gave of his goodness in
word and deed, excited in Monimus a passionate admiration of
Diogenes. For he forthwith pretended to be mad and proceeded to
fling away the small change and all the money on the banker's table,
until at length his master dismissed him ; and he then straightway
devoted himself to Diogenes. He often followed Crates the Cynic as
well, and embraced the like pursuits ; whereupon his master, seeing
him do this, was all the more persuaded that he was mad.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="83"/>
<p>He
came to be a distinguished man ; so much so that he is even
mentioned by the comic poet Menander. At any rate in one of his
plays, <hi rend='ital'>The Groom</hi>, his words are :
</p> <pb
n='87'/> 
<p>One Monimus there was, a wise man, Philo,
</p> 
<p>But not
so very famous.
</p> 
<p>a. He, you mean,
</p> 
<p>Who carried the scrip
?
</p> 
<p>b. Nay, not one scrip, but three.
</p> 
<p>Yet never a word,
so help me Zeus, spake he
</p> 
<p>To match the saying, Know thyself,
nor such
</p> 
<p>Famed watchwords. Far beyond all these he went,
</p>

<p>Your dusty mendicant, pronouncing wholly vain
</p> 
<p>All man's
supposings.
</p> 
<p>Monimus indeed showed himself a very grave
moralist, so that he ever despised mere opinion and sought only
truth.
</p> 
<p>He has left us, besides some trifles blended with
covert earnestness, two books, <hi rend='ital'>On Impulses</hi> and
an <hi rend='ital'>Exhortation to Philosophy.</hi>

<div2 n="4" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 4. ONESICRITUS (flor. 330 B.C.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="84">
<p>Onesicritus some report to have been an Aeginetan, but Demetrius
of Magnesia says that he was a native of Astypalaea. He too was one
of the distinguished pupils of Diogenes. His career seems to have
resembled that of Xenophon ; for Xenophon joined the expedition of
Cyrus, Onesicritus that of Alexander ; and the former wrote the <hi
rend='ital'>Cyropaedia, or Education of Cyrus</hi>, while the latter
has described how Alexander was educated : the one a laudation of
Cyrus, the other of Alexander. And in their diction they are not
unlike : except that Onesicritus, as is to be expected in an
imitator, falls short of his model.
</p> 
<p>Amongst other pupils of
Diogenes were Menander, who was nicknamed Drymus or "Oakwood," a
great
<pb n='89'/> 
admirer of Homer ; Hegesias of Sinope,
nicknamed "Dog-collar" ; and Philiscus of Aegina mentioned
above.

<p>Crates, son of Ascondas, was a Theban. He too
was amongst the Cynic's famous pupils. Hippobotus, however, alleges
that he was a pupil not of Diogenes, but of Bryson<note n='a'>Not
the same as Bryson of Heracleia, whom we know from the Platonic
Epistles, from Aristotle, and from Athenaeus (xi. p. 508). He may,

to him<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> v. 13.</note>
:
</p> 
<p>There is a city Pera in the midst of wine-dark vapour,

</p> 
<p>For which things' sake men fight not each with
other,
</p> 
<p>Nor stand to arms for money or for fame.
</p> 
<p>There
is also his widely circulated day-book, which runs as follows :

<p>A talent, for a philosopher three obols.
</p>

<p>He was known as the "Door-opener"--the caller to whom all doors
fly open--from his habit of entering every house and admonishing
those within. Here is another specimen of his composition<note
n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 326.</note> :

<p>And again he says that what he has
gained from philosophy is
</p> 
<p>A quart of lupins and to care for
no one.
</p> 
<p>This too is quoted as his<note n='a'><hi

<p>He flourished in the 113th Olympiad.<note
n='b'>328-324 b.c.</note>
</p> 
<p>According to Antisthenes in his <hi
rend='ital'>Successions</hi>, the first impulse to the Cynic
philosophy was given to him when he saw Telephus in a certain
tragedy carrying a little basket and altogether in a wretched
plight. So he turned his property into money,--for he belonged to a
distinguished family,--and having thus collected about 200 talents,
distributed that sum among his fellow-citizens. And (it is added) so
sturdy a philosopher did he become that he is mentioned by the
comic poet Philemon. At all events the latter says :
</p> 
<p>In
summer-time a thick cloak he would wear
</p> 
<p>To be like Crates,
and in winter rags.
</p> 
<p>Diocles relates how Diogenes persuaded
Crates to give up his fields to sheep pasture, and throw into the
sea any money he had.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>
<p>In the home of Crates Alexander is said
to have lodged, as Philip once lived in Hipparchia's. Often, too,
certain of his kinsmen would come to visit him and try to divert him
from his purpose. These he would drive from him with his stick, and
his resolution was unshaken. Demetrius of Magnesia tells a story
that he entrusted a banker with a sum of money on condition that, if
his sons proved ordinary men he was to pay it to them, but, if they
became
<pb n='93'/> 
philosophers, then to distribute it among
the people : for his sons would need nothing, if they took to
philosophy. Eratosthenes tells us that by Hipparchia, of whom we
shall presently speak, he had a son born to him named Pasicles, and
after he had ceased to be a cadet on service, Crates took him to a
brothel and told him that was how his father had married. 

<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>

The
marriage of intrigue and adultery, he said, belonged to tragedy,
having exile or assassination as its rewards ; while the weddings
of those who take up with courtesans are material for comedy, for as
a result of extravagance and drunkenness they bring about
madness.
</p> 
<p>This man had a brother named Pasicles, who was a
disciple of Euclides.
</p> 
<p>Favorinus, in the second book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>, tells a pleasant story of Crates.
For he relates how, when making some request of the master of the
gymnasium, he laid hold on his hips ; and when he demurred, said,
"What, are not these hip-joints yours as much as your knees ?" It
was, he used to say, impossible to find anybody wholly free from
flaws ; but, just as in a pomegranate, one of the seeds is always
going bad. Having exasperated the musician Nicodromus, he was
struck by him on the face. So he stuck a plaster on his forehead
with these words on it, "Nicodromus's handiwork." 

<milestone unit="section" n="90"/>

He carried on a
regular campaign of invective against the courtesans, habituating
himself to meet their abuse.
</p> 
<p>When Demetrius of Phalerum sent
him loaves of bread and some wine, he reproached him, saying, "Oh
that the springs yielded bread as well as water!" It is clear, then,
that he was a water-drinker. When
<pb n='95'/> 
the
police-inspectors found fault with him for wearing muslin, his
answer was, "I'll show you that Theophrastus also wears muslin."
This they would not believe : so he led them to a barber's shop and
showed them Theophrastus being shaved. At Thebes he was flogged by
the master of the gymnasium--another version being that it was by
Euthycrates and at Corinth ; and being dragged by the heels, he
called out, as if it did not affect him<note n='a'>Hom. <hi
rend='ital'>Il.</hi> i. 591.</note> :
</p> 
<p>Seized by the foot and
dragged o'er heaven's high threshold :
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>
<p>Diocles, however, says
that it was by Menedemus of Eretria that he was thus dragged. For he
being handsome and being thought to be intimate with Asclepiades the
Phliasian, Crates slapped him on the side with a brutal taunt;
whereupon Menedemus, full of indignation, dragged him along, and he
declaimed as above.
</p> 
<p>Zeno of Citium in his <hi
rend='ital'>Anecdotes</hi> relates that in a fit of heedlessness he
sewed a sheepskin to his cloak. He was ugly to look at, and when
performing his gymnastic exercises used to be laughed at. He was
accustomed to say, raising his hands, "Take heart, Crates, for it is
for the good of your eyes and of the rest of your body. 

<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>

You will see
these men, who are laughing at you, tortured before long by disease,
counting you happy, and reproaching themselves for their
sluggishness." He used to say that we should study philosophy to the
point of seeing in generals nothing but donkey-drivers. Those who
live with flatterers he declared to be as defenceless as calves in
the midst of wolves ; for neither these nor those have any to
protect them, but only such as plot against them. Perceiving that he
was
<pb n='97'/> 
dying, he would chant over himself this
charm, "You are going, dear hunchback, you are off to the house of
Hades,--bent crooked by old age." For his years had bowed him
down.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="93"/>
<p>When Alexander inquired whether he would like his
native city to be rebuilt, his answer was, "Why should it be ?
Perhaps another Alexander will destroy it again." Ignominy and
Poverty he declared to be his country, which Fortune could never
take captive. He was, he said, a fellow-citizen of Diogenes, who
defied all the plots of envy. Menander alludes to him in the <hi
rend='ital'>Twin Sisters</hi> in the following lines :
</p>

<p>Wearing a cloak you'll go about with me,
</p> 
<p>As once with
Cynic Crates went his wife :
</p> 
<p>His daughter too, as he himself
declared,
</p> 
<p>He gave in marriage for a month on trial.

<p>We

<div2 n="6" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 6. METROCLES
(c. 300 B.C.)</head> 

<div3 type="section" n="94">
<p>Metrocles of Maroneia was the brother of
Hipparchia. He had been formerly a pupil of Theophrastus the
Peripatetic, and had been so far corrupted by weakness that, when
he made a breach of good manners in the course of rehearsing a
speech, it drove him to despair, and he shut himself up at home,
intending to starve himself to death. On learning this Crates came
to visit him as he had been asked to do, and after advisedly making
a meal of lupins, he tried to persuade him by argument as well that
he had committed no crime, for a prodigy would have happened if he
had not taken the natural means of relieving
<pb n='99'/>

himself. At last by reproducing the action he succeeded in
lifting him from his dejection, using for his consolation the
likeness of the occurrences. From that time forward Metrocles was
his pupil, and became proficient in philosophy.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="95"/>
<p>Hecato in the
first book of his <hi rend='ital'>Anecdotes</hi> tells us he burned
his compositions with the words<note n='a'>Nauck, <hi

</p> 
<p>Others say that when he set fire
to his notes of Theophrastus's lectures, he added the line :
</p>

<p><hi rend='center'>Come hither, Hephaestus, Thetis now needeth
thee.</hi>
</p> 
<p>He divided things into such as are procurable for
money, like a house, and such as can be procured by time and
trouble, like education. Wealth, he said, is harmful, unless we put
it to a worthy use.
</p> 
<p>He died of old age, having choked
himself.
</p> 
<p>His disciples were Theombrotus and Cleomenes :
Theombrotus had for his pupil Demetrius of Alexandria, while
Cleomenes instructed Timarchus of Alexandria and Echecles of
Ephesus. Not but what Echecles also heard Theombrotus, whose
lectures were attended by Menedemus, of whom we shall speak
presently. Menippus of Sinope also became renowned amongst
them.

<div2 n="7" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 7. HIPPARCHIA (c. 300
B.C				.)</head> 

<div3 type="section" n="96">
<p>Hipparchia too, sister of Metrocles, was captured by
their doctrines. Both of them were born at Maroneia.
</p> 
<p>She fell
in love with the discourses and the life of Crates, and would not
pay attention to any of her
<pb n='101'/> 
suitors, their
wealth, their high birth or their beauty. But to her Crates was
everything. She used even to threaten her parents she would make
away with herself, unless she were given in marriage to him. Crates
therefore was implored by her parents to dissuade the girl, and did
all he could, and at last, failing to persuade her, got up, took off
his clothes before her face and said, "This is the bridegroom, here
are his possessions ; make your choice accordingly ; for you will
be no helpmeet of mine, unless you share my pursuits."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="97"/>
<p>The
girl chose and, adopting the same dress, went about with her husband
and lived with him in public and went out to dinners with him.
Accordingly she appeared at the banquet given by Lysimachus, and
there put down Theodorus, known as the atheist, by means of the
following sophism. Any action which would not be called wrong if
done by Theodorus, would not be called wrong if done by Hipparchia.
Now Theodorus does no wrong when he strikes himself : therefore
neither does Hipparchia do wrong when she strikes Theodorus. He had
no reply wherewith to meet the argument, but tried to strip her of
her cloak. But Hipparchia showed no sign of alarm or of the
perturbation natural in a woman. 

<milestone unit="section" n="98"/>

And when he said to her :
</p>

<p>"Is this she
</p> 
<p>Who quitting woof and warp and comb and
loom?"<note n='a'>Eur. <hi rend='ital'>Bacch.</hi> 1236.</note>
</p>

<p>she replied, "It is I, Theodorus,--but do you suppose that I
have been ill advised about myself, if instead of wasting further
time upon the loom I spent it in education ?" These tales and
countless others are told of the female philosopher.
</p> 
<p>There is
current a work of Crates entitled <hi rend='ital'>Epistles</hi>,

<pb n='103'/> 
containing excellent philosophy in a style which
sometimes resembles that of Plato. He has also written tragedies,
stamped with a very lofty kind of philosophy ; as, for example, the
following passage<note n='a'>Nauck, <hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.<hi

At last, however, he fell a victim to a plot, was robbed of all, and in despair

<pb n='105'/> 
<p>May be, you know Menippus,

</p> 
<p>Some authorities
question the genuineness of the books attributed to him, alleging

<div2 n="9" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 9. MENEDEMUS</head> 

<div3 type="section" n="102">
<p>Menedemus was a pupil of
Colotes of Lampsacus. According to Hippobotus he had attained such
a
<pb n='107'/> 
degree of audacity in wonder-working that he
went about in the guise of a Fury, saying that he had come from
Hades to take cognisance of sins committed, and was going to
return and report them to the powers down below. This was his attire
: a grey tunic reaching to the feet, about it a crimson girdle ; an
Arcadian hat on his head with the twelve signs of the zodiac
inwrought in it ; buskins of tragedy ; and he wore a very long beard
and carried an ashen staff in his hand.
</p> 
<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>
<p>Such are the lives of
the several Cynics. But we will go on to append the doctrines which
they held in common--if, that is, we decide that Cynicism is really
a philosophy, and not, as some maintain, just a way of life. They
are content then, like Ariston of Chios, to do away with the
subjects of Logic and Physics and to devote their whole attention to
Ethics. And what some assert of Socrates, Diocles records of
Diogenes, representing him as saying : "We must inquire into
</p>

<p><hi rend='center'>Whate'er of good or ill within our halls is
wrought."<note n='a'>Hom. <hi rend='ital'>Od.</hi> iv.
392.</note></hi>
</p> 
<p>They also dispense with the ordinary
subjects of instruction. At least Antisthenes used to say that
those who had attained discretion had better not study literature,
lest they should be perverted by alien influences. 

<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>

So they get rid
of geometry and music and all such studies. Anyhow, when somebody
showed Diogenes a clock, he pronounced it a serviceable instrument
to save one from being late for dinner. Again, to a man who gave a
musical recital before him he said<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Eur. <hi rend='ital'>Antiope,</hi> Frag. 205
Dind.</note> :
</p> 
<p>By men's minds states are ordered well, and
households,
</p> 
<p>Not by the lyre's twanged strings or flute's
trilled notes.
</p> <pb n='109'/> 

<milestone unit="section" n="105"/>
<p>They hold further that "Life
according to Virtue" is the End to be sought, as Antisthenes says in
his <hi rend='ital'>Heracles</hi> : exactly like the Stoics. For
indeed there is a certain close relationship between the two
schools. Hence it has been said that Cynicism is a short cut to
virtue ; and after the same pattern did Zeno of Citium live his
life.
</p> 
<p>They also hold that we should live frugally, eating
food for nourishment only and wearing a single garment. Wealth and
fame and high birth they despise. Some at all events are vegetarians
and drink cold water only and are content with any kind of shelter
or tubs, like Diogenes, who used to say that it was the privilege of
the gods to need nothing and of god-like men to want but little.
</p>

<p>They hold, further, that virtue can be taught, as Antisthenes
maintains in his <hi rend='ital'>Heracles</hi>, and when once
acquired cannot be lost ; and that the wise man is worthy to be
loved, impeccable, and a friend to his like ; and that we should
entrust nothing to fortune. Whatever is intermediate between Virtue
and Vice they, in agreement with Ariston of Chios, account
indifferent.
</p> 
<p>So much, then, for the Cynics. We must now pass
on to the Stoics, whose founder was Zeno, a disciple of
Crates.

<div3 type="section" n="1">
<p>Zeno, the son
of Mnaseas (or Demeas), was a native of Citium in Cyprus, a Greek
city which had received Phoenician settlers. He had a wry neck, says
Timotheus of Athens in his book <hi rend='ital'>On Lives.</hi>
Moreover, Apollonius of Tyre says he was lean, fairly tall, and
swarthy--hence some one called him an Egyptian vine-branch,
according to Chrysippus in the first book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Proverbs.</hi> He had thick legs ; he was flabby and
delicate. Hence Persaeus in his <hi rend='ital'>Convivial
Reminiscences</hi> relates that he declined most invitations to
dinner. They say he was fond of eating green figs and of basking in
the sun.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
<p>He was a pupil of Crates, as stated above. Next they
say he attended the lectures of Stilpo and Xenocrates for ten
years--so Timocrates says in his <hi rend='ital'>Dion</hi>--and
Polemo as well. It is stated by Hecato and by Apollonius of Tyre in
his first book on Zeno that he consulted the oracle to know what he
should do to attain the best life, and that the god's response was
that he should take on the complexion of the dead. Whereupon,
perceiving what this meant, he studied ancient authors. Now the way
he came
<pb n='113'/> 
across Crates was this. He was
shipwrecked on a voyage from Phoenicia to Peiraeus with a cargo of
purple. He went up into Athens and sat down in a bookseller's shop,
being then a man of thirty. As he went on reading the second book of
Xenophon's <hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>, he was so pleased that
he inquired where men like Socrates were to be found. 

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>

Crates passed
by in the nick of time, so the bookseller pointed to him and said,
"Follow yonder man." From that day he became Crates's pupil, showing
in other respects a strong bent for philosophy, though with too much
native modesty to assimilate Cynic shamelessness. Hence Crates,
desirous of curing this defect in him, gave him a potful of
lentil-soup to carry through the Ceramicus ; and when he saw that
he was ashamed and tried to keep it out of sight, with a blow of his
staff he broke the pot. As Zeno took to flight with the lentil-soup
flowing down his legs, "Why run away, my little Phoenician ?" quoth
Crates, "nothing terrible has befallen you."

<p>For a certain
space, then, he was instructed by Crates, and when at this time he
had written his <hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi>, some said in jest
that he had written it on Cynosura, <hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> on the
dog's tail.<note n='a'>Cynosura, Dog's Tail, like Dog's Head,
Cynoscephalus, was the name of several promontories, notably one in
Athens and one in Salamis. Relatively to Cynicism, "holding on by
the dog's tail" would seem a more appropriate interpretation.</note> Besides the <hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> he wrote
the following works :
</p> 
<p>Of Life according to Nature.
</p> 
<p>Of
Impulse, or Human Nature.
</p> 
<p>Of Emotions.

<p>Ethics.
</p> 
<p>This is a list of
his writings. But at last he left Crates, and the men above
mentioned were his masters for twenty years. Hence he is reported to
have said, "I made a prosperous voyage when I suffered shipwreck."
But others attribute this saying of his to the time when he was
under Crates. 

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>

A different version of the story is that he was
staying at Athens when he heard his ship was wrecked and said, "It
is well done of thee, Fortune, thus to drive me to philosophy." But
some say that he disposed of his cargo in Athens, before he turned
his attention to philosophy.
</p> 
<p>He used then to discourse,
pacing up and down in the painted colonnade, which is also called
the colonnade or Portico<note n='a'>Our word "colonnade" better
describes a roofed building, supported at least on one side by
pillars and thus affording a public thoroughfare like an arcade or
cloister, but open to the sun and air. Owing, however, to the Latin
"porticus" Zeno's school has received in English literature the
appellation of "the Porch." The frescoes or pictures, with which the
Stoa was adorned, made it in some sense the National Gallery of
Athens. For further information see by all means Frazer's note on
Pausanias i. 15 (vol. ii. pp. 132-137).</note> of Pisianax, but
which received its name
<pb n='117'/> 
from the painting of
Polygnotus ; his object being to keep the spot clear of a concourse
of idlers. It was the spot where in the time of the Thirty 1400
Athenian citizens had been put to death.<note n='a'>Probably the
Thirty met in the Stoa and passed sentence of death there. It is not
likely that this was the place of execution.</note> Hither, then,
people came henceforth to hear Zeno, and this is why they were known
as men of the Stoa, or Stoics ; and the same name was given to his
followers, who had formerly been known as Zenonians. So it is stated
by Epicurus in his letters. According to Eratosthenes in his eighth
book <hi rend='ital'>On the Old Comedy,</hi> the name of Stoic had
formerly been applied to the poets who passed their time there, and
they had made the name of Stoic still more famous.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
<p>The people
of Athens held Zeno in high honour, as is proved by their depositing
with him the keys of the city walls, and their honouring him with a
golden crown and a bronze statue. This last mark of respect was also
shown to him by citizens of his native town, who deemed his statue
an ornament to their city,<note n='b'>Pliny, <hi
rend='ital'>N.H.</hi> xxxiv. 92.</note> and the men of Citium living
in Sidon were also proud to claim him for their own. Antigonus
(Gonatas) also favoured him, and whenever he came to Athens would
hear him lecture and often invited him to come to his court. This
offer he declined but dispatched thither one of his friends,
Persaeus, the son of Demetrius and a native of Citium, who
flourished in the 130th Olympiad (260-256 b.c.), at which time Zeno
was already an old man. According to Apollonius of Tyre in his work
upon Zeno, the letter of Antigonus was couched in the following
terms :
</p> <pb n='119'/> 

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
<p>"King Antigonus to Zeno the
philosopher, greeting.
</p> 
<p>"While in fortune and fame I deem
myself your superior, in reason and education I own myself inferior,
as well as in the perfect happiness which you have attained.
Wherefore I have decided to ask you to pay me a visit, being
persuaded that you will not refuse the request. By all means, then,
do your best to hold conference with me, understanding clearly that
you will not be the instructor of myself alone but of all the
Macedonians taken together. For it is obvious that whoever instructs
the ruler of Macedonia and guides him in the paths of virtue will
also be training his subjects to be good men. As is the ruler, such
for the most part it may be expected that his subjects will
become."
</p> 
<p>And Zeno's reply is as follows :
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
<p>"Zeno to
King Antigonus, greeting.
</p> 
<p>"I welcome your love of learning in
so far as you cleave to that true education which tends to advantage and not to that popular counterfeit of it which serves only
to corrupt morals. But if anyone has yearned for philosophy, turning
away from much-vaunted pleasure which renders effeminate the souls
of some of the young, it is evident that not by nature only, but
also by the bent of his will he is inclined to nobility of
character. But if a noble nature be aided by moderate exercise and
further receive ungrudging instruction, it easily comes to acquire
virtue in perfection. 

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>

But I am constrained by bodily weakness, due
to old age, for I am eighty years old ; and for that reason I am
unable to join you. But I send you certain companions of my studies
whose mental powers are not inferior to mine, while their
</p> <pb
n='121'/> 
<p>bodily strength is far greater, and if you associate
with these you will in no way fall short of the conditions necessary
to perfect happiness."
</p> 
<p>So he sent Persaeus and Philonides the
Theban ; and Epicurus in his letter to his brother Aristobulus
mentions them both as living with Antigonus. I have thought it well
to append the decree also which the Athenians passed concerning him.

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
It reads as follows<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Tarn, <hi
rend='ital'>Antig. Gon.</hi> p. 309, especially note 106 ; he
considers the decree, as we have it, a fusion of two genuine
decrees, (1) voting a crown to Zeno in his life-time, (2) decreeing a public funeral after his death.</note> :
</p> 
<p>"In the
archonship of Arrhenides, in the fifth prytany of the tribe
Acamantis on the twenty-first day of Maemacterion, at the
twenty-third plenary assembly of the prytany, one of the presidents,
Hippo, the son of Cratistoteles, of the deme Xypetaeon, and his
co-presidents put the question to the vote ; Thraso, the son of
Thraso of the deme Anacaea, moved :"
</p> 
<p>"Whereas Zeno of Citium,
son of Mnaseas, has for many years been devoted to philosophy in the
city and has continued to be a man of worth in all other respects,
exhorting to virtue and temperance those of the youth who come to
him to be taught, directing them to what is best, affording to all
in his own conduct a pattern for imitation in perfect consistency
with his teaching, 

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>

it has seemed good to the people-- and may it
turn out well--to bestow praise upon Zeno of Citium, the son of
Mnaseas, and to crown him with a golden crown according to the law,
for his goodness and temperance, and to build him a tomb in the
Ceramicus at the public cost. And that for the making of the crown
and the building of the tomb, the people shall now elect five
commissioners
<pb n='123'/> 
from all Athenians, and the
Secretary of State shall inscribe this decree on two stone pillars
and it shall be lawful for him to set up one in the Academy and the
other in the Lyceum. And that the magistrate presiding over the
administration shall apportion the expense incurred upon the
pillars, that all may know that the Athenian people honour the good
both in their life and after their death. 

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>

Thraso of the deme
Anacaea, Philocles of Peiraeus, Phaedrus of Anaphlystus, Medon of
Acharnae, Micythus of Sypalettus, and Dion of Paeania have been
elected commissioners for the making of the crown and the
building."
</p> 
<p>These are the terms of the decree.
</p>

<p>Antigonus of Carystus tells us that he never denied that he was a
citizen of Citium. For when he was one of those who contributed to
the restoration of the baths and his name was inscribed upon the
pillar as "Zeno the philosopher," he requested that the words "of
Citium" should be added. He made a hollow lid for a flask and used
to carry about money in it, in order that there might be provision
at hand for the necessities of his master Crates. 

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>

It is said that he
had more than a thousand talents when he came to Greece, and that he
lent this money on bottomry.<note n='a'>The security for the loan
was either the cargo shipped or the vessel itself. As the risk was
great, the interest was proportionately high. Demosth. <hi
rend='ital'>Or.</hi> xxxiv. 23, l. 17, lvi. 17.</note> He used to
eat little loaves and honey and to drink a little wine of good
bouquet. He rarely employed men-servants; once or twice indeed he
might have a young girl to wait on him in order not to seem a
misogynist. He shared the same house with Persaeus, and when the
latter brought in a little flute-player he lost no time in leading
her straight to Persaeus. They tell us he readily adapted himself to
circum-
<pb n='125'/> 
stances, so much so that King Antigonus
often broke in on him with a noisy party, and once took him along
with other revellers to Aristocles the musician ; Zeno, however, in
a little while gave them the slip. 

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>

He disliked, they say, to be
brought too near to people, so that he would take the end seat of a
couch, thus saving himself at any rate from one half of such
inconvenience. Nor indeed would he walk about with more than two or
three. He would occasionally ask the bystanders for coppers, in
order that, for fear of being asked to give, people might desist
from mobbing him, as Cleanthes says in his work <hi rend='ital'>On
Bronze.</hi> When several persons stood about him in the Colonnade
he pointed to the wooden railing at the top round the altar and
said, "This was once open to all, but because it was found to be a
hindrance it was railed off. If you then will take yourselves off
out of the way you will be the less annoyance to us."
</p> 
<p>When
Demochares, the son of Laches, greeted him and told him he had only
to speak or write for anything he wanted to Antigonus, who would
be sure to grant all his requests, Zeno after hearing this would
have nothing more to do with him.<note n='a'>Zeno must have foreseen
that this compliment would be followed by a request to use his
undoubted influence with the king on behalf of Demochares. who, as
an Athenian patriot and the nephew of Demosthenes, was out of favour
at the Macedonian court. Indeed the fact of his making such advances
at all is so strange that Ferguson (p. 172) and Tarn (p. 94, note
11) feel constrained to offer hypothetical explanations.</note>

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
After Zeno's death Antigonus is reported to have said, "What an
audience I have lost."<note n='b'>Tarn, <hi rend='ital'>Antig.
Gon.</hi> p. 310, well compares Plato, <hi
rend='ital'>Politicus</hi> 260 c, and Epicurus (<hi
rend='ital'>ap.</hi> Senec. <hi rend='ital'>Ep.</hi> 7. 11), "satis
enim magnum alter alteri theatrum sumus."</note> Hence too he
employed Thraso as his agent to request the Athenians to bury Zeno
in the Ceramicus. And when asked why he admired him, "Because,"
said
<pb n='127'/> 
he, "the many ample gifts I offered him
never made him conceited nor yet appear poor-spirited."
</p> 
<p>His
bent was towards inquiry, and he was an exact reasoner on all
subjects. Hence the words of Timon in his <hi
rend='ital'>Silli</hi><note n='a'>Frag. 38 D.</note>:
</p> 
<p>A
Phoenician too I saw, a pampered old woman ensconced in gloomy
pride, longing for all things; but the meshes of her subtle web have
perished, and she had no more intelligence than a banjo.<note
n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. Od.</hi> xi. 281, 271.</note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>
<p>He
used to dispute very carefully with Philo the logician and study
along with him. Hence Zeno, who was the junior, had as great an
admiration for Philo as his master Diodorus. And he had about him
certain ragged dirty fellows, as Timon says<note n='c'>Frag. 39
D.</note> in these lines :
</p> 
<p>The while he got together a crowd
of ignorant serfs, who surpassed all men in beggary and were the
emptiest of townsfolk.<note n='d'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. Il.</hi> ii.
831, xxiii. 133.</note>
</p> 
<p>Zeno himself was sour and of a
frowning countenance. He was very niggardly too, clinging to
meanness unworthy of a Greek, on the plea of economy, If he pitched
into anyone he would do it concisely, and not effusively, keeping
him rather at arm's length. I mean, for example, his remark upon the
fop showing himself off. 

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>

When he was slowly picking his way across a
watercourse, "With good reason," quoth Zeno, "he looks askance at
the mud, for he can't see his face in it." When a certain Cynic
declared he had no oil in his flask and begged some of him, Zeno
refused to give him any. However, as the man went away, Zeno bade
him consider which of
<pb n='129'/> 
the two was the more
impudent. Being enamoured of Chremonides, as he and Cleanthes were
sitting beside the youth, he got up, and upon Cleanthes expressing
surprise, "Good physicians tell us," said he, "that the best cure
for inflammation is repose." When of two reclining next to each
other over the wine, the one who was neighbour to Zeno kicked the
guest below him, Zeno himself nudged the man with his knee, and upon
the man turning round, inquired, "How do you think your neighbour
liked what you did to him?" 

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>

To a lover of boys he remarked, "Just as
schoolmasters lose their common-sense by spending all their time
with boys, so it is with people like you." He used to say that the
very exact expressions used by those who avoided solecisms were like
the coins struck by Alexander : they were beautiful in appearance
and well-rounded like the coins, but none the better on that
account. Words of the opposite kind he would compare to the Attic
tetradrachms, which, though struck carelessly and inartistically,
nevertheless outweighed the ornate phrases. When his pupil Ariston
discoursed at length in an uninspired manner, sometimes in a
headstrong and over - confident way. "Your father," said he, "must
have been drunk when he begat you." Hence he would call him a
chatterbox, being himself concise in speech.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>
<p>There was a
gourmand so greedy that he left nothing for his table companions. A
large fish having been served, Zeno took it up as if he were about
to eat the whole. When the other looked at him, "What do you
suppose," said he, "those who live with you feel every day, if you
cannot put up with my gourmandise in this single instance?" A

<pb n='131'/> 
youth was putting a question with more curiosity
than became his years, whereupon Zeno led him to a mirror, and bade
him look in it; after which he inquired if he thought it became
anyone who looked like that to ask such questions. Some one said
that he did not in general agree with Antisthenes, whereupon Zeno
produced that author's essay on Sophocles, and asked him if he
thought it had any excellence ; to which the reply was that he did
not know. "Then are you not ashamed," quoth he, "to pick out and
mention anything wrong said by Antisthenes, while you suppress his
good things without giving them a thought?"
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>
<p>Some one having
said that he thought the chainarguments of the philosophers seemed
brief and curt, Zeno replied, "You are quite right ; indeed, the
very syllables ought, if possible, to be clipped." Some one remarked
to him about Polemo, that his discourse was different from the
subject he announced. He replied with a frown, "Well, what value
would you have set upon what was given out?" He said that when
conversing we ought to be earnest and, like actors, we should have a
loud voice and great strength ; but we ought not to open the mouth
too wide, which is what your senseless chatterbox does. "Telling
periods," he said, "unlike the works of good craftsmen, should need
no pause for the contemplation of their excellences ; on the
contrary, the hearer should be so absorbed in the discourse itself
as to have no leisure even to take notes."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>
<p>Once when a young
man was talking a good deal, he said, "Your ears have slid down and
merged in your tongue." To the fair youth, who gave it as his
opinion that the wise man would not fall in love,
<pb n='133'/>

his reply was: "Then who can be more hapless than you fair
youths?" He used to say that even of philosophers the greater number
were in most things unwise, while about small and casual things they
were quite ignorant. And he used to cite the saying of Caphisius,
who, when one of his pupils was endeavouring to blow the flute
lustily, gave him a slap and told him that to play well does not
depend on loudness, though playing loudly may follow upon playing
well.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Athen. xiv. p. 629
b.</note> And to a youth who was talking somewhat saucily his
rejoinder was, "I would rather not tell you what I am thinking, my
lad."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>
<p>A Rhodian, who was handsome and rich, but nothing more,
insisted on joining his class; but so unwelcome was this pupil, that
first of all Zeno made him sit on the benches that were dusty, that
he might soil his cloak, and then he consigned him to the place
where the beggars sat, that he might rub shoulders with their rags ;
so at last the young man went away. Nothing, he declared, was more
unbecoming than arrogance, especially in the young. He used also to
say that it was not the words and expressions that we ought to
remember, but we should exercise our mind in disposing to advantage
of what we hear, instead of, as it were, tasting a well-cooked dish
or well-dressed meal. The young, he thought, should behave with
perfect propriety in walk, gait and dress, and he used continually
to quote the lines of Euripides about Capaneus :
</p> 
<p>Large means
had he, yet not the haughtiness
</p> 
<p>That springs from wealth, nor
cherished prouder thoughts

<p>Of vain ambition than the poorest

<p>Again he would say that if we want to master the sciences there
is nothing so fatal as conceit, and
<pb n='135'/> 
again there
is nothing we stand so much in need of as time. To the question "Who
is a friend?" his answer was, "A second self (<hi rend='ital'>alter
ego</hi>)." We are told that he was once chastising a slave for
stealing, and when the latter pleaded that it was his fate to steal,
"Yes, and to be beaten too," said Zeno. Beauty he called the flower
of chastity, while according to others it was chastity which he
called the flower of beauty.<note n='a'>The change of <foreign lang='greek'>fwnh=s fwnh/n</foreign> to <foreign lang='greek'> swfros1

closely to the mss., would replace <foreign lang='greek'>fwnh=s</foreign> by <foreign lang='greek'>r(w/mhs</foreign> and
retain<foreign lang='greek'>fwnh/n,</foreign> which would give the
meaning, "Beauty he called the flower of strength, while according
to others it was the voice which he called the flower of
beauty."</note> Once when he saw the slave of one of his
acquaintance marked with weals, "I see," said he, "the imprints of
your anger." To one who had been drenched with unguent, "Who is
this," quoth he, "who smells of woman?" When Dionysius the Renegade
asked, "Why am I the only pupil you do not correct?" the reply was,
"Because I mistrust you." To a stripling who was talking nonsense
his words were, "The reason why we have two ears and only one mouth
is that we may listen the more and talk the less." 

<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>

One day at a
banquet he was reclining in silence and was asked the reason :
whereupon he bade his critic carry word to the king that there was
one present who knew how to hold his tongue. Now those who inquired
of him were ambassadors from King Ptolemy, and they wanted to know
what message they should take back from him to the king. On being
asked how he felt about abuse, he replied, "As an envoy feels who is
dismissed without an answer." Apollonius of Tyre tells us how,
when Crates laid hold on him by the cloak to drag him from Stilpo,
Zeno said, "The right way to seize a philosopher, Crates, is by the
ears :
<pb n='137'/> 
persuade me then and drag me off by them
; but, if you use violence, my body will be with you, but my mind
with Stilpo."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="25"/>
<p>According to Hippobotus he forgathered with
Diodorus, with whom he worked hard at dialectic. And when he was
already making progress, he would enter Polemo's school : so far
from all selfconceit was he. In consequence Polemo is said to have
addressed him thus : "You slip in, Zeno, by the garden door--I'm
quite aware of it--you filch my doctrines and give them a Phoenician
make-up." A dialectician once showed him seven logical forms
concerned with the sophism known as "The Reaper," and Zeno asked him
how much he wanted for them. Being told a hundred drachmas, he
promptly paid two hundred : to such lengths would he go in his love
of learning. They say too that he first introduced the word Duty and
wrote a treatise on the subject. It is said, moreover, that he
corrected Hesiod's lines thus:
</p> 
<p>He is best of all men who
follows good advice: good too is he who finds out all things for
himself.<note n='a'>
<p>Hesiod's lines as they stand (<hi
rend='ital'>Works and Days</hi>, 293 f.) run thus :
</p> 
<p>"He is
best of all, who finds out everything for himself; that man too is
good who follows good advice."
</p></note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>
<p>The reason he gave
for this was that the man capable of giving a proper hearing to what
is said and profiting by it was superior to him who discovers
everything himself. For the one had merely a right apprehension, the
other in obeying good counsel superadded conduct.
</p> 
<p>When he was
asked why he, though so austere, relaxed at a drinking-party, he
said, "Lupins too are bitter, but when they are soaked become
sweet." Hecato too in the second book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Anecdotes</hi> says that he indulged freely at such
gatherings. And he would say, "Better to trip with the feet than
with
<pb n='139'/> 
the tongue." "Well-being is attained by
little and little, and nevertheless it is no little thing itself."
[Others attribute this<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> ii.

</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>
<p>He showed the utmost endurance, and
the greatest frugality ; the food he used required no fire to dress,
and the cloak he wore was thin. Hence it was said of him :
</p>

<p>The cold of winter and the ceaseless rain
</p> 
<p>Come powerless
against him : weak the dart
</p> 
<p>Of the fierce summer sun or
racking pain
</p> 
<p>To bend that iron frame. He stands apart
</p>

<p>Unspoiled by public feast and jollity :
</p> 
<p>Patient, unwearied
night and day doth he
</p> 
<p>Cling to his studies of philosophy.
</p>

<p>Nay more : the comic poets by their very jests at his expense
praised him without intending it. Thus Philemon says in a play, <hi
rend='ital'>Philosophers</hi> :
</p> 
<p>This man adopts a new

</p> 
<p>He teaches to go hungry : yet he gets

<p>Disciples. One sole loaf of bread his food ;
</p> 
<p>His best
dessert dried figs ; water his drink.
</p> 
<p>Others attribute these
lines to Poseidippus.
</p> 
<p>By this time he had almost become a
proverb. At all events, "More temperate than Zeno the philosopher"
was a current saying about him. Poseidippus also writes in his <hi
rend='ital'>Men Transported</hi> :
</p> 
<p>So that for ten whole
days
</p> 
<p>More temperate than Zeno's self he seemed.
</p>

<p>And in
very truth in this species of virtue and in dignity he surpassed all
mankind, ay, and in happiness ; for he was ninety-eight when he
died and had enjoyed good health without an ailment to the

<p>last. Persaeus, however, in his ethical lectures makes
him die at the age of seventy-two, having come to Athens at the age
of twenty-two. But Apollonius says that he presided over the school
for fifty-eight years. The manner of his death was as follows. As he
was leaving the school he tripped and fell, breaking a toe. Striking
the ground with his fist, he quoted the line from the <hi

labours of Heracles, but this was the path he found out to the
stars--the way of temperance alone.

<p>We have ourselves mentioned
the manner of Zeno's death in the <hi rend='ital'>Pammetros</hi> (a
collection of poems in various metres) :
</p> 
<p>The story goes that
Zeno of Citium after enduring many hardships by reason of old age
was set free, some say by ceasing to take food; others say that once
when he had tripped he beat with his hand upon the earth and cried,
"I come of my own accord; why then call me?"<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 118.</note>
</p> 
<p>For there are
some who hold this to have been the manner of his death.
</p> 
<p>So
much then concerning his death.
</p> 
<p>Demetrius the Magnesian, in
his work on <hi rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name</hi>, says of him :
his father, Mnaseas, being a merchant often went to Athens and
brought away many books about Socrates for Zeno while still a boy.

<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>
Hence he had been well trained even before he left his native place.
And thus it came about that on his arrival at Athens he attached
himself to Crates. And it seems, he adds, that, when the rest were
at a loss how to express their views, Zeno framed a definition of
the end. They say that he was in the habit of swearing by "capers"
just as Socrates used to swear by "the dog." Some there are, and
among them Cassius the Sceptic and his disciples, who accuse Zeno at
length. Their first count is that in the beginning of his <hi
rend='ital'>Republic</hi> he
<pb n='145'/> 
pronounced the
ordinary education useless : the next is that he applies to all men
who are not virtuous the opprobrious epithets of foemen, enemies,
slaves, and aliens to one another, parents to children, brothers to
brothers, friends to friends.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
<p>Again, in the <hi
rend='ital'>Republic</hi>, making an invidious contrast, he
declares the good alone to be true citizens or friends or kindred or
free men ; and accordingly in the view of the Stoics parents and
children are enemies, not being wise. Again, it is objected, in the
<hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> he lays down community of wives, and
at line 200 prohibits the building of temples, lawcourts and
gymnasia in cities ; while as regards a currency he writes that we
should not think it need be introduced either for purposes of
exchange or for travelling abroad. Further, he bids men and women
wear the same dress and keep no part of the body entirely covered.

<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
That the <hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> is the work of Zeno is
attested by Chrysippus in his <hi rend='ital'>De Republica.</hi> And
he discussed amatory subjects in the beginning of that book of his
which is entitled "The Art of Love." Moreover, he writes much the
same in his <hi rend='ital'>Interludes.</hi> So much for the
criticisms to be found not only in Cassius but in Isidorus of
Pergamum, the rhetorician. Isidorus likewise affirms that the
passages disapproved by the school were expunged from his works by
Athenodorus the Stoic, who was in charge of the Pergamene library ;
and that afterwards, when Athenodorus was detected and compromised,
they were replaced. So much concerning the passages in his writings
which are regarded as spurious.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
<p>There have been eight persons
of the name of Zeno. First the Eleatic, of whom more hereafter ; the
second our present subject ; the third a Rhodian
<pb n='147'/>

who wrote a local history in one volume ; the fourth a historian
who wrote about the expedition of Pyrrhus into Italy and Sicily, and
besides that an epitome of the political history of Rome and
Carthage ; the fifth a pupil of Chrysippus, who left few writings
but many disciples ; the sixth a physician of the school of
Herophilus, a competent practitioner, though a poor writer; the
seventh a grammarian, who besides other writings has left behind him
epigrams; the eighth a Sidonian by birth and an Epicurean
philosopher, lucid both in thinking and in style.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>
<p>Of the many
disciples of Zeno the following are the most famous : Persaeus, son
of Demetrius, of Citium, whom some call a pupil and others one of
the household, one of those sent him by Antigonus to act as
secretary ; he had been tutor to Antigonus's son Halcyoneus. And
Antigonus once, wishing to make trial of him, caused some false news
to be brought to him that his estate had been ravaged by the enemy,
and as his countenance fell, "Do you see," said he, "that wealth is
not a matter of indifference ?"
</p> 
<p>The following works are by
Persaeus :
</p> 
<p>Of Kingship.
</p> 
<p>The Spartan Constitution.

<p>Ariston,
the son of Miltiades and a native of Chios, who introduced the
doctrine of things morally indifferent ; Herillus of Carthage, who
affirmed knowledge to be the end; Dionysius, who became a renegade
to the doctrine of pleasure, for owing to the severity of his
ophthalmia he had no longer the nerve to call pain a thing
indifferent : his native place was Heraclea ; Sphaerus of Bosporus;
Cleanthes, son of Phanias, of Assos, his successor in the school :
him Zeno used to compare to hard waxen tablets which are difficult
to write upon, but retain the characters written upon them. Sphaerus
also became the pupil of Cleanthes after Zeno's death, and we
shall have occasion to mention him in the <hi rend='ital'>Life of
Cleanthes.</hi> 

<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>

And furthermore the following according to
Hippobotus were pupils of Zeno : Philonides of Thebes ; Callippus of
Corinth ; Posidonius of Alexandria ; Athenodorus of Soli ; and
Zeno of Sidon.<note n='a'>Perhaps an error for Zeno of
Tarsus.</note>
</p> 
<p>I have decided to give a general account of
all the Stoic doctrines in the life of Zeno because he was the
founder of the School. I have already given a list of his numerous
writings, in which he has spoken as has no other of the Stoics. And
his tenets in general are as follows. In accordance with my usual
practice a summary statement must suffice.<note n='b'>Laertius
adheres to his plan of arranging doctrine under two heads : (1) a
general or summary, (2) a particular, treatment ; <hi
rend='ital'>cf. inf.</hi> vii. 48 <foreign lang='greek'> kefala
iwdw=s kata\ me/ros.</foreign> Here follows a valuable and full
doxography, extending to &sect; 160, collected from various sources; &sect;&sect; 49-83
come from Diocles. The classification is roughly as follows :
divisions of Philosophy, &sect;&sect; 39-41; Logic, &sect;&sect; 42-83; Ethics, &sect;&sect; 84-131;
Physics, &sect;&sect; 132-160.</note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>
<p>Philosophic doctrine, say the
Stoics, falls into three parts : one physical, another ethical, and
the third logical. Zeno of Citium was the first to make this
division in his <hi rend='ital'>Exposition of Doctrine</hi>, and
Chrysippus too did so in the first book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Exposition of Doctrine</hi> and the first book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>; and so
<pb n='151'/> 
too
Apollodorus and Syllus in the first part of their <hi
rend='ital'>Introductions to Stoic Doctrine</hi>, as also Eudromus
in his <hi rend='ital'>Elementary Treatise on Ethics</hi>, Diogenes
the Babylonian, and Posidonius.
</p> 
<p>These parts are called by
Apollodorus "Heads of Commonplace"; by Chrysippus and Eudromus
specific divisions ; by others generic divisions. 

<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>

Philosophy, they
say, is like an animal, Logic corresponding to the bones and
sinews, Ethics to the fleshy parts, Physics to the soul. Another
simile they use is that of an egg : the shell is Logic, next comes
the white, Ethics, and the yolk in the centre is Physics. Or, again,
they liken Philosophy to a fertile field : Logic being the
encircling fence, Ethics the crop, Physics the soil or the trees.
Or, again, to a city strongly walled and governed by reason.
</p>

<p>No single part, some Stoics declare, is independent of any other
part, but all blend together. Nor was it usual to teach them
separately. Others, however, start their course with Logic, go on to
Physics, and finish with Ethics ; and among those who so do are Zeno
in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Exposition</hi>, Chrysippus,
Archedemus and Eudromus.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
<p>Diogenes of Ptolema&iuml;s, it is true,
begins with Ethics ; but Apollodorus puts Ethics second, while
Panaetius and Posidonius begin with Physics, as stated by Phanias,
the pupil of Posidonius, in the first book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Lectures of Posidonius.</hi> Cleanthes makes not three,
but six parts, Dialectic, Rhetoric, Ethics, Politics, Physics,
Theology. But others say that these are divisions not of philosophic
exposition, but of philosophy itself : so, for instance, Zeno of
Tarsus. Some divide the logical part of the system into the two
sciences of rhetoric and dialectic ; while
<pb n='153'/> 
some
would add that which deals with definitions and another part
concerning canons or criteria : some, however, dispense with the
part about definitions.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>
<p>Now the part which deals with canons
or criteria they admit as a means for the discovery of truth, since
in the course of it they explain the different kinds of perceptions
that we have. And similarly the part about definitions is accepted
as a means of recognizing truth, inasmuch as things are apprehended by means of general notions. Further, by rhetoric they
understand the science of speaking well on matters set forth by
plain narrative, and by dialectic that of correctly discussing
subjects by question and answer ; hence their alternative definition of it as the science of statements true, false, and neither
true nor false.
</p> 
<p>Rhetoric itself, they say, has three
divisions : deliberative, forensic, and panegyric.
</p> 
<p>Rhetoric
according to them may be divided into invention of arguments, their
expression in words, their arrangement, and delivery ; and a
rhetorical speech into introduction, narrative, replies to opponents, and peroration.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>
<p>Dialectic (they hold) falls under
two heads : subjects of discourse and language. And the subjects
fall under the following headings : presentations<note n='a'>The
word <foreign lang='greek'> fantas i/a</foreign> (=appearance or
appearing) is a technical term in Stoic logic for which no one
English equivalent is as yet unanimously adopted. It denotes the
immediate datum of consciousness or experience, whether presented to
sense or in certain cases to the mind. Hence "presentation" is
nearer than "perception" or "impression." It might be thought to
correspond to Locke's "simple ideas," for which Hume substituted
"impressions and ideas" ; but this is hardly so ; for <foreign lang='greek'> fantas i/ai</foreign> are "given" as it were from
without, and then with them as materials the mind itself constructs
general notions and concepts.</note> and the various products to
which they give rise, propositions enunciated and their constituent
subjects and predicates, and similar terms whether direct or
reversed, genera and species, arguments
<pb n='155'/> 
too,
moods, syllogisms and fallacies whether due to the subject matter or
to the language ; 

<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>

these including both false and true and negative
arguments, sorites and the like, whether defective, insoluble, or
conclusive, and the fallacies known as the Veiled, or Horned, No
man, and The Mowers.
</p> 
<p>The second main head mentioned above as
belonging to Dialectic is that of language, wherein are included
written language and the parts of speech, with a discussion of
errors in syntax and in single words, poetical diction, verbal
ambiguities, euphony and music, and according to some writers
chapters on terms, divisions, and style.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>
<p>The study of
syllogisms they declare to be of the greatest service, as showing us
what is capable of yielding demonstration ; and this contributes
much to the formation of correct judgements, and their arrangement
and retention in memory give a scientific character to our
conception of things.
</p> 
<p>An argument is in itself a whole
containing premisses and conclusion, and an inference (or syllogism)
is an inferential argument composed of these. Demonstration is an
argument inferring by means of what is better apprehended something
less clearly apprehended.
</p> 
<p>A presentation (or mental
impression) is an imprint on the soul : the name having been
appropriately borrowed from the imprint made by the seal upon the
wax. 

<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>

There are two species of presentation, the one apprehending a
real object, the other not. The former, which they take to be the
test of reality, is defined as that which proceeds from a real
object, agrees with that object itself, and has been imprinted
seal-fashion and stamped upon the mind :
<pb n='157'/> 
the
latter, or non-apprehending, that which does not proceed from any
real object, or, if it does, fails to agree with the reality itself,
not being clear or distinct.
</p> 
<p>Dialectic, they said, is
indispensable and is itself a virtue, embracing other particular
virtues under it.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>Plut.<hi
rend='ital'>Mor.</hi>874 e, and <hi rend='ital'>inf.</hi> &sect;&sect; 62,
83.</note> Freedom from precipitancy is a knowledge when to give or
withhold the mind's assent to impressions. By wariness they mean a
strong presumption against what at the moment seems probable, so as
not to be taken in by it. 

<milestone unit="section" n="47"/>

Irrefutability is strength in argument so
as not to be brought over by it to the opposite side. Earnestness
(or absence of frivolity) is a habit of referring presentations to
right reason. Knowledge itself they define either as unerring
apprehension or as a habit or state which in reception of
presentations cannot be shaken by argument. Without the study of
dialectic, they say, the wise man cannot guard himself in argument
so as never to fall ; for it enables him to distinguish between
truth and falsehood, and to discriminate what is merely plausible
and what is ambiguously expressed, and without it he cannot
methodically put questions and give answers.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>
<p>Overhastiness in
assertion affects the actual course of events, so that, unless we
have our perceptions well trained, we are liable to fall into
unseemly conduct and heedlessness ; and in no other way will the
wise man approve himself acute, nimblewitted, and generally
skilful in argument ; for it belongs to the same person to converse
well and to argue well, to put questions to the purpose and to
respond to the questions put ; and all these qualifications are
qualifications belonging to the skilled dialectician.
</p> <pb
n='159'/> 
<p>Such is, summarily stated, the substance of their
logical teaching. And in order to give it also in detail, <note
n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra</hi>,&sect; 38 note. This distinction
between the general and particular treatment is also frequent in
Sextus Empiricus : <hi rend='ital'>e.g. Pyrrh. Hyp.</hi> i. 5
<foreign lang='greek'>o( kaqo/lo u lo/gos</foreign> as opposed to
<foreign lang='greek'>o( ei)diko\ s lo/gos.</foreign></note> let me now
cite as much of it as comes within the scope of their introductory
handbook. I will quote verbatim what Diocles the Magnesian says in
his <hi rend='ital'>Synopsis of Philosophers.</hi> These are his
words :
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>
<p>"The Stoics agree to put in the forefront the
doctrine of presentation and sensation, inasmuch as the standard by
which the truth of things is tested is generically a presentation,
and again the theory of assent and that of apprehension and thought,
which precedes all the rest, cannot be stated apart from
presentation. For presentation comes first ; then thought, which is
capable of expressing itself, puts into the form of a proposition
that which the subject receives from a presentation."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="50"/>
<p>There
is a difference between the process and the outcome of presentation.
The latter is a semblance in the mind such as may occur in sleep,
while the former is the act of imprinting something on the soul,
that is a process of change, as is set forth by Chrysippus in the
second book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>Of the Soul (De
anima).</hi> For, says he, we must not take "impression" in the
literal sense of the stamp of a seal, because it is impossible to
suppose that a number of such impressions should be in one and the
same spot at one and the same time. The presentation meant is that
which comes from a real object, agrees with that object, and has
been stamped, imprinted and pressed seal-fashion on the soul, as
would not be the case if it came from an unreal object.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>
<p>According to them some presentations are data of
</p> <pb
n='161'/> 
<p>sense and others are not : the former are the impressions conveyed through one or more sense-organs ; while the
latter, which are not data of sense, are those received through the
mind itself, as is the case with incorporeal things and all the
other presentations which are received by reason. Of sensuous
impressions some are from real objects and are accompanied by
yielding and assent on our part. But there are also presentations
that are appearances and no more, purporting, as it were, to come
from real objects.
</p> 

<p>Another division of presentations is into
rational and irrational, the former being those of rational
creatures, the latter those of the irrational. Those which are
rational are processes of thought, while those which are irrational
have no name. Again, some of our impressions are scientific, others
unscientific : at all events a statue is viewed in a totally
different way by the trained eye of a sculptor and by an ordinary
man.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
<p>The Stoics apply the term sense or sensation (<foreign lang='greek'> ai)/sqhs is</foreign>) to three things: (1) the current
passing from the principal part of the soul to the senses, (2)
apprehension by means of the senses, (3) the apparatus of the
sense-organs, in which some persons are deficient. Moreover, the
activity of the sense-organs is itself also called sensation.
According to them it is by sense that we apprehend black and white,
rough and smooth, whereas it is by reason that we apprehend the
conclusions of demonstration, for instance the existence of gods
and their providence. General notions, indeed, are gained in the
following ways : some by direct contact, some by resemblance, some
by analogy, some by transposition, some by composition, and some by
contrariety.
</p> <pb n='163'/> 

<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>
<p>By incidence or direct contact
have come our notions of sensible things ; by resemblance notions
whose origin is something before us, as the notion of Socrates which
we get from his bust ; while under notions derived from analogy come
those which we get (1) by way of enlargement, like that of Tityos or
the Cyclops, or (2) by way of diminution, like that of the Pygmy.
And thus, too, the centre of the earth was originally conceived on
the analogy of smaller spheres. Of notions obtained by transposition creatures with eyes on the chest would be an instance, while
the centaur exemplifies those reached by composition, and death
those due to contrariety. Furthermore, there are notions which imply
a sort of transition to the realm of the imperceptible : such are
those of space and of the meaning of terms. The notions of justice
and goodness come by nature. Again, privation originates notions ;
for instance, that of the man without hands. Such are their tenets
concerning presentation, sensation, and thought.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>

<p>The standard
of truth they declare to be the apprehending presentation, <hi
rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> that which comes from a real object--according
to Chrysippus in the twelfth book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Physics</hi> and to Antipater and Apollodorus. Bo&euml;thus,
on the other hand, admits a plurality of standards, namely
intelligence, senseperception, appetency, and knowledge ; while
Chrysippus in the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>Exposition of
Doctrine</hi> contradicts himself and declares that sensation and
preconception are the only standards, preconception being a general
notion which comes by the gift of nature (an innate conception of
universals or general concepts). Again, certain others of the older
Stoics make Right Reason the
<pb n='165'/> 
standard ; so also
does Posidonius in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On the
Standard.</hi>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
<p>In their theory of dialectic most of them see
fit to take as their starting-point the topic of voice. Now voice is
a percussion of the air or the proper object of the sense of
hearing, as Diogenes the Babylonian says in his handbook <hi
rend='ital'>On Voice.</hi> While the voice or cry of an animal is
just a percussion of air brought about by natural impulse, man's
voice is articulate and, as Diogenes puts it, an utterance of
reason, having the quality of coming to maturity at the age of
fourteen. Furthermore, voice according to the Stoics is something
corporeal : I may cite for this Archedemus in his treatise <hi
rend='ital'>On Voice</hi>, Diogenes, Antipater and Chrysippus in the
second book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physics.</hi> 

<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>

For whatever
produces an effect is body ; and voice, as it proceeds from those
who utter it to those who hear it, does produce an effect. Reduced
to writing, what was voice becomes a verbal expression, as "day";
so says Diogenes. A statement or proposition is speech that issues
from the mind and signifies something, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "It
is day." Dialect (<foreign lang='greek'>dia/- lektos</foreign> )
means a variety of speech which is stamped on one part of the Greek
world as distinct from another, or on the Greeks as distinct from
other races ; or, again, it means a form peculiar to some particular
region, that is to say, it has a certain linguistic quality ; <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> in Attic the word for "sea" is not <foreign lang='greek'> qa/lass a</foreign> but <foreign lang='greek'> qa/latt
a,</foreign> and in Ionic "day" is not <foreign lang='greek'>h(me/ra</foreign> but <foreign lang='greek'>h(me/rh.</foreign>
</p> 
<p>Elements
of language are the four-and-twenty letters. "Letter," however, has
three meanings : (1) the particular sound or element of speech ; (2)
its written symbol or character ; (3) its name, as
<pb n='167'/>

Alpha is the name of the sound A. 

<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>

Seven of the letters are
vowels, <hi rend='ital'>a, e, &emacr; i, o, u, &omacr;,</hi> and six
are mutes, <hi rend='ital'>b, g, d, k, p, t.</hi> There is a
difference between voice and speech ; because, while voice may
include mere noise, speech is always articulate. Speech again
differs from a sentence or statement, because the latter always
signifies something, whereas a spoken word, as for example <foreign lang='greek'> bli/tur i,</foreign> may be unintelligible-- which a
sentence never is. And to frame a sentence is more than mere
utterance, for while vocal sounds are uttered, things are meant,
that is, are matters of discourse.
</p> 
<p>There are, as stated by
Diogenes<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the Babylonian.</note>
in his treatise on <hi rend='ital'>Language</hi> and by Chrysippus,
five parts of speech : proper name, common noun, verb, conjunction,
article. To these Antipater in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Words and
their Meaning</hi> adds another part, the "mean."<note
n='b'>Probably "adverb."</note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="58"/>
<p>A common noun or appellative
is defined by Diogenes as part of a sentence signifying a common
quality, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> man, horse ; whereas a name is a
part of speech expressing a quality peculiar to an individual, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> Diogenes, Socrates. A verb is, according to
Diogenes, a part of speech signifying an isolated predicate, or, as
others<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Sc.</hi> Apollodorus and his
school; <hi rend='ital'>cf. inf.</hi> &sect; 64.</note>define it, an
un-declined part of a sentence, signifying something that can be
attached to one or more subjects, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "I
write," "I speak." A conjunction is an indeclinable part of speech,
binding the various parts of a statement together ; and an article
is a declinable part of speech, distinguishing the genders and
numbers of nouns, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> <foreign lang='greek'>o(,
h(, to/, oi(, ai(, ta/.</foreign><note n='d'>= "the," masc., fem. and
neut., singular and plural.</note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>
<p>There are five excellences
of speech--pure Greek, lucidity, conciseness, appropriateness,
distinction. By good Greek is meant language faultless in point

<pb n='169'/> 
of grammar and free from careless vulgarity.
Lucidity is a style which presents the thought in a way easily
understood ; conciseness a style that employs no more words than are
necessary for setting forth the subject in hand ; appropriateness
lies in a style akin to the subject ; distinction in the avoidance
of colloquialism. Among vices of style barbarism is violation of the
usage of Greeks of good standing ; while there is solecism when the
sentence has an incongruous construction.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="60"/>
<p>Posidonius in his
treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Style</hi> defines a poetical phrase as
one that is metrical or rhythmical, thus mechanically avoiding the
character of prose ; an example of such rhythmical phrase is :
</p>

<p><hi rend='center'>O mightiest earth, O sky, God's canopy.<note
n='a'>Nauck, <hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi rend='super'>2</hi>, <hi
rend='ital'>Eur.</hi> 839.</note></hi>
</p> 
<p>And if such poetical
phraseology is significant and includes a portrayal or
representation of things human and divine, it is poetry.
</p> 
<p>A
term is, as stated by Antipater in his first book <hi rend='ital'>On
Terms</hi>, a word which, when a sentence is analysed, is uttered
with complete meaning ; or, according to Chrysippus in his book <hi
rend='ital'>On Definitions</hi>, is a rendering back one's
own.<note n='b'>The author seems to have confused "term," which
Antipater defines, with "definition," which, as Chrysippus says, is
simply "giving back" the meaning in other words. Zeller's correction
<foreign lang='greek'>i)di/ou a)po/dosi s</foreign> for <foreign lang='greek'>kai\ h( a)po/dosi s</foreign> comes from a scholion on
Dionysius Thrax.</note> Delineation is a statement which brings one
to a knowledge of the subject in outline, or it may be called a
definition which embodies the force of the definition proper in a
simpler form. Genus (in logic) is the comprehension in one of a
number of inseparable objects of thought : <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
Animal ; for this includes all particular animals.

<p>A notion
or object of thought is a presentation to the intellect, which
though not really substance nor
<pb n='171'/> 
attribute is
quasi-substance or quasi-attribute.<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Stob. <hi rend='ital'>Ecl.</hi> i. 136. 21
W.</note> Thus an image of a horse may rise before the mind,
although there is no horse present.
</p> 
<p>Species is that which is
comprehended under genus : thus Man is included under Animal. The
highest or most universal genus is that which, being itself a genus,
has no genus above : namely, reality or the real ; and the lowest
and most particular species is that which, being itself a species,
has no species below it, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> Socrates.
</p>

<p>Division of a genus means dissection of it into its proximate
species, thus : Animals are either rational or irrational
(dichotomy). Contrary division dissects the genus into species by
contrary qualities : for example, by means of negation, as when all
things that are are divided into good and not good. Subdivision is
division applied to a previous division : for instance, after
saying, "Of things that are some are good, some are not good," we
proceed, "and of the not good some are bad, some are neither good
nor bad (morally indifferent)."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>
<p>Partition in logic is
(according to Crinis) classification or distribution of a genus
under heads : for instance, Of goods some are mental, others
bodily.
</p> 
<p>Verbal ambiguity arises when a word properly, rightfully, and in accordance with fixed usage denotes two or more
different things, so that at one and the same time we may take it in
several distinct senses : <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> in Greek, where
by the same verbal expression may be meant in the one case that "A
house has three times" fallen, in the other that "a dancing-girl"
has fallen.
</p> 
<p>Posidonius defines Dialectic as the science
dealing with truth, falsehood, and that which is neither true

<pb n='173'/> 
nor false ; whereas Chrysippus takes its subject to
be signs and things signified. Such then is the gist of what the
Stoics say in their theory of language.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
<p>To the department
dealing with things as such and things signified is assigned the
doctrine of expressions, including those which are complete in
themselves, as well as judgements and syllogisms and that of
defective expressions comprising predicates both direct and
reversed.<note n='a'>"Direct Predicate" answers to our Active Verb,
"Predicate reversed" to our Passive ; <hi rend='ital'>cf.
supra</hi>, 43.</note>
</p> 
<p>By verbal expression they mean that of
which the content corresponds to some rational presentation. Of such
expressions the Stoics say that some are complete in themselves and
others defective. Those are defective the enunciation of which is
unfinished, as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "writes," for we inquire
"Who ?" Whereas in those that are complete in themselves the
enunciation is finished, as "Socrates writes." And so under the
head of defective expressions are ranged all predicates, while
under those complete in themselves fall judgements, syllogisms,
questions, and inquiries.
</p> <milestone unit="section" n="64"/>
<p>A predicate is, according to the
followers of Apollodorus, what is said of something ; in other
words, a thing associated with one or more subjects ; or, again, it
may be defined as a defective expression which has to be joined on
to a nominative case in order to yield a judgement. Of predicates
some are adjectival [and so have personal subjects], as <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "to sail through rocks."<note n='b'>We should
expect <foreign lang='greek'>ta\ de\ parasum ba/mata</foreign> to
follow (<hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Luc. <hi rend='ital'>Vit.
Auct.</hi> 21). By <foreign lang='greek'> parasu/m bama</foreign> is
meant an impersonal verb with subject in oblique case, as <foreign lang='greek'>me/lei moi.</foreign> For other conjectures see Zeller,
<hi rend='ital'>Phil. der Gr.</hi> iii. 1<hi rend='super'>3</hi>, 89
note 2, 90.</note> Again, some predicates are direct, some reversed,
some neither. Now direct predicates are those that are constructed
with one of the oblique cases, as "hears," "sees," "con-
</p> <pb
n='175'/> 
<p>verses"; while reversed are those constructed with the
passive voice, as "I am heard," "I am seen." Neutral are such as
correspond to neither of these, as "thinks," "walks." Reflexive
predicates are those among the passive, which, although in form
passive, are yet active operations,<note n='a'>An attempt to
distinguish what we call the Middle Voice from the Passive--as <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> <foreign lang='greek'> sune/qe nto,</foreign>

<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>

for here the agent includes
himself in the sphere of his action. The oblique cases are genitive,
dative, and accusative.
</p> 
<p>A judgement is that which is either
true or false, or a thing complete in itself, capable of being
denied in and by itself, as Chrysippus says in his <hi
rend='ital'>Dialectical Definitions</hi> : "A judgement is that
which in and by itself can be denied or affirmed, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> `It is day,' `Dion is walking.'" The Greek
word for judgement (<foreign lang='greek'> a)ci/wma</foreign> ) is
derived from the verb <foreign lang='greek'> a)ciou=n,</foreign> as
signifying acceptance or rejection ; for when you say "It is day,"
you seem to accept the fact that it is day. Now, if it really is
day, the judgement before us is true, but if not, it is false. 

<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>

There
is a difference between judgement, interrogation, and inquiry, as
also between imperative, adjurative, optative, hypothetical,
vocative, whether that to which these terms are applied be a thing
or a judgement. For a judgement is that which, when we set it
forth in speech, becomes an assertion, and is either false or true :
an interrogation is a thing complete in itself like a judgement but
demanding an answer, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Is it day ?" and
this is so far neither true nor false. Thus "It is day" is a
judgement ; "Is it day ?" an interrogation. An inquiry is
something to which we cannot reply by signs, as you can nod Yes to
an interroga-
<pb n='177'/> 
tion ; but you must express the
answer in words, "He lives in this or that place."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="67"/>
<p>An
imperative is something which conveys a command : <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
</p> 
<p><hi rend='center'>Go thou to the waters
of Inachus.<note n='a'>Nauck, <hi rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi
rend='super'>2</hi>, <hi rend='ital'>Adesp.</hi> 177 ; <hi
rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Galen, xiii. p. 363 K.</note></hi>
</p> 
<p>An
adjurative utterance is something ... A vocative utterance is
something the use of which implies that you are addressing some one
; for instance :
</p> 
<p><hi rend='center'>Most glorious son of
Atreus, Agamemnon, lord of men.<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Iliad</hi> ix. 96.</note></hi>
</p> 
<p>A
quasi-proposition is that which, having the enunciation of a
judgement, yet in consequence of the intensified tone or emotion of
one of its parts falls outside the class of judgements proper, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
</p> 
<p>Yea, fair indeed the Parthenon !
</p>

<p>How like to Priam's sons the cowherd is!<note n='c'>Nauck, <hi
rend='ital'>T.G.F.</hi><hi rend='super'>2</hi>, <hi
rend='ital'>Adesp.</hi> 286.</note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="68"/>
<p>There is also, differing
from a proposition or judgement, what may be called a timid
suggestion, the expression of which leaves one at a loss, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
</p> 
<p>Can it be that pain and life are in
some sort akin ?
</p> 
<p>Interrogations, inquiries and the like are
neither true nor false, whereas judgements (or propositions) are
always either true or false.
</p> 
<p>The followers of Chrysippus,
Archedemus, Athenodorus, Antipater and Crinis divide propositions
into simple and not simple. Simple are those that consist of one or
more propositions which are not ambiguous, as "It is day." Not
simple are those that consist of one or more ambiguous propositions.
<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>
They
<pb n='179'/> 
may, that is, consist either of a single
ambiguous proposition, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If it is day, it
is day," or of more than one proposition, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
"If it is day, it is light."
</p> 
<p>With simple propositions are
classed those of negation, denial, privation, affirmation, the
definitive and the indefinitive ; with those that are not simple the
hypothetical, the inferential, the coupled or complex, the
disjunctive, the causal, and that which indicates more or less. An
example of a negative proposition is "It is not day." Of the
negative proposition one species is the double negative. By double
negative is meant the negation of a negation, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "It is not not-day." Now this presupposes that
it is day.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
<p>A denial contains a negative part or particle and
a predication : such as this, "No one is walking." A privative
proposition is one that contains a privative particle reversing the
effect of a judgement, as, for example, "This man is unkind." An
affirmative or assertory proposition is one that consists of a noun
in the nominative case and a predicate, as "Dion is walking." A
definitive proposition is one that consists of a demonstrative in
the nominative case and a predicate, as "This man is walking." An
indefinitive proposition is one that consists of an indefinite
word or words and a predicate, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Some one
is walking," or "There's some one walking"; "He is in motion."
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
<p>Of propositions that are not simple the hypothetical, according
to Chrysippus in his <hi rend='ital'>Dialectics</hi> and Diogenes in
his <hi rend='ital'>Art of Dialectic</hi>, is one that is formed by
means of the conditional conjunction "If." Now this conjunction
promises that the second of two things follows consequentially upon
the first, as, for instance,
<pb n='181'/> 
"If it is day, it
is light." An inferential proposition according to Crinis in his <hi
rend='ital'>Art of Dialectic</hi> is one which is introduced by the
conjunction "Since" and consists of an initial proposition and a
conclusion ; for example, "Since it is day-time, it is light." This
conjunction guarantees both that the second thing follows from the
first and that the first is really a fact. 

<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>

A coupled proposition is
one which is put together by certain coupling conjunctions, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "It is day-time and it is light." A
disjunctive proposition is one which is constituted such by the
disjunctive conjunction "Either," as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
"Either it is day or it is night." This conjunction guarantees that
one or other of the alternatives is false. A causal proposition is
constructed by means of the conjunction "Because," <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Because it is day, it is light." For the
first clause is, as it were, the cause of the second. A proposition
which indicates more or less is one that is formed by the word
signifying "rather" and the word "than" in between the clauses, as,
for example, "It is rather day-time than night." 

<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>

Opposite in
character to the foregoing is a proposition which declares what is
less the fact, as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "It is less or not so
much night as day." Further, among propositions there are some which
in respect of truth and falsehood stand opposed to one another, of
which the one is the negative of the other, as <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the propositions "It is day" and "It is not
day." A hypothetical proposition is therefore true, if the
contradictory of its conclusion is incompatible with its premiss,
<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If it is day, it is light." This is true.
For the statement "It is not light," contradicting the conclusion,
is incompatible with the premiss "It is day." On the other hand, a
hypo-
<pb n='183'/> 
thetical proposition is false, if the
contradictory of its conclusion does not conflict with the premiss,
<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If it is day, Dion is walking." For the
statement "Dion is not walking" does not conflict with the premiss
"It is day."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>
<p>An inferential proposition is true if starting
from a true premiss it also has a consequent conclusion, as <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Since it is day, the sun is above the
horizon." But it is false if it starts from a false premiss or has
an inconsequent conclusion, as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Since it
is night, Dion is walking," if this be said in day-time. A causal
proposition is true if its conclusion really follows from a premiss
itself true, though the premiss does not follow conversely from the
conclusion, as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Because it is day, it is
light," where from the "it is day" the "it is light" duly follows,
though from the statement "it is light" it would not follow that "it
is day." But a causal proposition is false if it either starts from
a false premiss or has an inconsequent conclusion or has a premiss
that does not correspond with the conclusion, as <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Because it is night, Dion is walking." 

<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>

A
probable judgement is one which induces to assent, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Whoever gave birth to anything, is that
thing's mother." This, however, is not necessarily true ; for the
hen is not mother of an egg.
</p> 
<p>Again, some things are possible,
others impossible ; and some things are necessary, others are not
necessary. A proposition is possible which admits of being true,
there being nothing in external circumstances to prevent it being
true, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Diocles is alive." Impossible is
one which does not admit of being true, as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
"The earth flies." That is necessary which besides being true does
not admit of being
<pb n='185'/> 
false or, while it may admit
of being false, is prevented from being false by circumstances
external to itself, as "Virtue is beneficial." Not necessary is that
which, while true, yet is capable of being false if there are no
external conditions to prevent, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Dion is
walking." 

<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>

A reasonable proposition is one which has to start with
more chances of being true than not, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "I
shall be alive to-morrow."
</p> 
<p>And there are other shades of
difference in propositions and grades of transition from true to
false-- and conversions of their terms--which we now go on to
describe broadly.
</p> 
<p>An argument, according to the followers of
Crinis, consists of a major premiss, a minor premiss, and a
conclusion, such as for example this : "If it is day, it is light ;
but it is day, therefore it is light." Here the sentence "If it is
day, it is light" is the major premiss, the clause "it is day" is
the minor premiss, and "therefore it is light" is the conclusion. A
mood is a sort of outline of an argument, like the following : "If
the first, then the second ; but the first is, therefore the second
is."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
<p>Symbolical argument is a combination of full argument
and mood ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If Plato is alive, he breathes
; but the first is true, therefore the second is true." This mode of
argument was introduced in order that when dealing with long complex
arguments we should not have to repeat the minor premiss, if it be
long, and then state the conclusion, but may arrive at the
conclusion as concisely as possible : if A, then B.
</p> 
<p>Of
arguments some are conclusive, others inconclusive. Inconclusive
are such that the contradictory of the conclusion is not
incompatible with combina-
<pb n='187'/> 
tion of the
premisses, as in the following : "If it is day, it is light ; but it
is day, therefore Dion walks."<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>
Sext. Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Adv. math.</hi> viii. 429.</note>
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
<p>Of conclusive some are denoted by the common name of the whole
class, "conclusive proper," others are called syllogistic. The
syllogistic are such as either do not admit of, or are reducible to
such as do not admit of, immediate proof in respect of one or more
of the premisses ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If Dion walks, then
Dion is in motion ; but Dion is walking, therefore Dion is in
motion." Conclusive specifically are those which draw conclusions,
but not by syllogism ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the statement "It
is both day and night" is false : "now it is day ; therefore it is
not night." Arguments not syllogistic are those which plausibly
resemble syllogistic arguments, but are not cogent proof ; <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If Dion is a horse, he is an animal ; but
Dion is not a horse, therefore he is not an animal."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>
<p>Further,
arguments may be divided into true and false. The former draw their
conclusions by means of true premisses ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>
"If virtue does good, vice does harm ; but virtue does good,
therefore vice does harm."<note n='b'>The example is badly chosen,
confusing contrary with contradictory.</note> Those are false which
have error in the premisses or are inconclusive ; <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If it is day, it is light ; but it is day,
therefore Dion is alive." Arguments may also be divided into
possible and impossible, necessary and not necessary. Further, there
are statements which are indemonstrable because they do not need
demonstration ; they are employed in the construction of every
argument. As to the number of these, authorities differ ; Chrysippus
makes them five. These are assumed alike in reason-
</p> <pb
n='189'/> 
<p>ing specifically conclusive and in syllogisms both
categorical and hypothetical. 

<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>

The first kind of indemonstrable
statement is that in which the whole argument is constructed of a
hypothetical proposition and the clause with which the
hypothetical proposition begins, while the final clause is the conclusion ; as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If the first, then the
second ; but the first is, therefore the second is."<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Sext. Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Pyrrh. Hyp.</hi> ii.
157 <hi rend='ital'>sq.</hi></note> The second is that which employs
a hypothetical proposition and the contradictory of the consequent,
while the conclusion is the contradictory of the antecedent ; <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "If it is day, it is light ; but it is night,
therefore it is not day." Here the minor premiss is the contradictory of the consequent ; the conclusion the contradictory of
the antecedent. The third kind of indemonstrable employs a
conjunction of negative propositions for major premiss and one of
the conjoined propositions for minor premiss, concluding thence
the contradictory of the remaining proposition ; <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "It is not the case that Plato is both dead
and alive ; but he is dead, therefore Plato is not alive." 

<milestone unit="section" n="81"/>

The
fourth kind employs a disjunctive proposition and one of the two
alternatives in the disjunction as premisses, and its conclusion is
the contradictory of the other alternative ; <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Either A or B ; but A is, therefore B is
not." The fifth kind is that in which the argument as a whole is
constructed of a disjunctive proposition and the contradictory of
one of the alternatives in the disjunction, its conclusion being
the other alternative ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "Either it is day
or it is night ; but it is not night, therefore it is day."
</p>

<p>From a truth a truth follows, according to the Stoics, as <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "It is light" from "It is day" ; and
</p> <pb
n='191'/> 
<p>from a falsehood a falsehood, as "It is dark" from "It
is night," if this latter be untrue. Also a truth may follow from a
falsehood ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> from "The earth flies" will
follow "The earth exists" ; whereas from a truth no falsehood will
follow, for from the existence of the earth it does not follow
that the earth flies aloft.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="82"/>
<p>There are also certain insoluble
arguments<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra,</hi> &sect; 44.</note>: the
Veiled Men, the Concealed, Sorites, Horned Folk, the Nobodies. The
Veiled is as follows<note n='b'>Here Laertius, as the text stands,
gives examples of the Sorites and the Nobody, but none of the other
three fallacies, the Veiled, Concealed, Horned.</note> : . . . "It
cannot be that if two is few, three is not so likewise, nor that if
two or three are few, four is not so ; and so on up to ten. But two
is few, therefore so also is ten." . . . The Nobody argument is an
argument whose major premiss consists of an indefinite and a
definite clause, followed by a minor premiss and conclusion ; for
example, "If anyone is here, he is not in Rhodes ; but there is some
one here, therefore there is not anyone in Rhodes." . . .
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="83"/>
<p>Such, then, is the logic of the Stoics, by which they seek to
establish their point that the wise man is the true dialectician.
For all things, they say, are discerned by means of logical study,
including whatever falls within the province of Physics, and again
whatever belongs to that of Ethics. For else, say they, as regards
statement and reasoning Physics and Ethics could not tell how to
express themselves, or again concerning the proper use of terms, how
the laws have defined various actions.<note n='c'>
<p>The vulgate, in
which I have made no change, has been regarded with suspicion. Von
Arnim conjectures :
</p> 
<p>"For if the logician ought to have
something to say about the correct use of terms, how could he fail
to lay down the proper names for actions?"
</p></note> Moreover, of
the two kinds of common-sense inquiry included under Virtue one
considers the nature of each
<pb n='193'/> 
particular thing,
the other asks what it is called. Thus much for their logic.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="84"/>
<p>The ethical branch of philosophy they divide as follows : (1) the
topic of impulse ; (2) the topic of things good and evil ; (3) that
of the passions ; (4) that of virtue ; (5) that of the end ; (6)
that of primary value and of actions ; (7) that of duties or the
befitting ; and (8) of inducements to act or refrain from acting.
The foregoing is the subdivision adopted by Chrysippus, Archedemus,
Zeno of Tarsus, Apollodorus, Diogenes, Antipater, and Posidonius,
and their disciples. Zeno of Citium and Cleanthes treated the
subject somewhat less elaborately, as might be expected in an older
generation. They, however, did subdivide Logic and Physics as well
as Ethics.
</p> <milestone unit="section" n="85"/>
<p>An animal's first impulse, say the Stoics, is to
selfpreservation, because nature from the outset endears it to
itself, as Chrysippus affirms in the first book of his work <hi
rend='ital'>On Ends</hi> : his words are, "The dearest thing to
every animal is its own constitution and its consciousness thereof"
; for it was not likely that nature should estrange the living thing
from itself or that she should leave the creature she has made
without either estrangement from or affection for its own
constitution. We are forced then to conclude that nature in
constituting the animal made it near and dear to itself ; for so it
comes to repel all that is injurious and give free access to all
that is serviceable or akin to it.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="86"/>
<p>As for the assertion made
by some people that pleasure is the object to which the first
impulse of animals is directed, it is shown by the Stoics to be
false. For pleasure, if it is really felt, they declare
</p> <pb
n='195'/> 
<p>to be a by-product, which never comes until nature by
itself has sought and found the means suitable to the animal's
existence or constitution ; it is an aftermath comparable to the
condition of animals thriving and plants in full bloom. And nature,
they say, made no difference originally between plants and animals,
for she regulates the life of plants too, in their case without
impulse and sensation, just as also certain processes go on of a
vegetative kind in us. But when in the case of animals impulse has
been superadded, whereby they are enabled to go in quest of their
proper aliment, for them, say the Stoics, Nature's rule is to follow
the direction of impulse. But when reason by way of a more perfect
leadership has been bestowed on the beings we call rational, for
them life according to reason rightly becomes the natural life. For
reason supervenes to shape impulse scientifically.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>
<p>This is
why Zeno was the first (in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On the
Nature of Man</hi>) to designate as the end "life in agreement with
nature" (or living agreeably to nature), which is the same as a
virtuous life, virtue being the goal towards which nature guides us.
So too Cleanthes in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Pleasure,</hi>
as also Posidonius, and Hecato in his work <hi rend='ital'>On
Ends.</hi> Again, living virtuously is equivalent to living in
accordance with experience of the actual course of nature, as
Chrysippus says in the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>De
finibus</hi> ; for our individual natures are parts of the nature of
the whole universe. 

<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>

And this is why the end may be defined as life
in accordance with nature, or, in other words, in accordance with
our own human nature as well as that of the universe, a life in
which we refrain from every action forbidden
<pb n='197'/> 
by
the law common to all things, that is to say, the right reason which
pervades all things, and is identical with this Zeus, lord and ruler
of all that is. And this very thing constitutes the virtue of the
happy man and the smooth current of life, when all actions promote
the harmony of the spirit dwelling in the individual man with the
will of him who orders the universe. Diogenes then expressly declares the end to be to act with good reason in the selection of
what is natural. Archedemus says the end is to live in the
performance of all befitting actions.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>
<p>By the nature with
which our life ought to be in accord, Chrysippus understands both
universal nature and more particularly the nature of man, whereas
Cleanthes takes the nature of the universe alone as that which
should be followed, without adding the nature of the individual.
</p>

<p>And virtue, he holds, is a harmonious disposition, choice-worthy
for its own sake and not from hope or fear or any external motive.
Moreover, it is in virtue that happiness consists ; for virtue is
the state of mind which tends to make the whole of life harmonious. When a rational being is perverted, this is due to the
deceptiveness of external pursuits or sometimes to the influence of
associates. For the starting-points of nature are never
perverse.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="90"/>
<p>Virtue, in the first place, is in one sense the
perfection of anything in general, say of a statue ; again, it may
be non-intellectual, like health, or intellectual, like prudence.
For Hecato says in his first book <hi rend='ital'>On the
Virtues</hi> that some are scientific and based upon theory, namely,
those which have a structure of theoretical principles, such as
prudence
<pb n='199'/> 
and justice ; others are
non-intellectual, those that are regarded as co-extensive and
parallel with the former, like health and strength. For health is
found to attend upon and be co-extensive with the intellectual
virtue of temperance, just as strength is a result of the building
of an arch. 

<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>

These are called non-intellectual, because they do not
require the mind's assent ; they supervene and they occur even in
bad men : for instance, health, courage. The proof, says Posidonius
in the first book of his treatise on <hi rend='ital'>Ethics,</hi>
that virtue really exists is the fact that Socrates, Diogenes, and
Antisthenes and their followers made moral progress. And for the
existence of vice as a fundamental fact the proof is that it is the
opposite of virtue. That it, virtue, can be taught is laid down by
Chrysippus in the first book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On the
End,</hi> by Cleanthes, by Posidonius in his <hi
rend='ital'>Protreptica,</hi> and by Hecato ; that it can be taught
is clear from the case of bad men becoming good.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>
<p>Panaetius,
however, divides virtue into two kinds, theoretical and practical ;
others make a threefold division of it into logical, physical, and
ethical ; while by the school of Posidonius four types are
recognized, and more than four by Cleanthes, Chrysippus, Antipater,
and their followers. Apollophanes<note n='a'>One of the older
Stoics ; <hi rend='ital'>cf. Frag. Vet. Stoic.</hi> i. 90.</note>
for his part counts but one, namely, practical wisdom.
</p>

<p>Amongst the virtues some are primary, some are subordinate to
these. The following are the primary : wisdom, courage, justice,
temperance. Particular virtues are magnanimity, continence,
endurance, presence of mind, good counsel. And wisdom they define as
the knowledge of things good and evil and
<pb n='201'/> 
of
what is neither good nor evil ; courage<note n='a'>It is obviously
not courage which is here defined, but apparently wisdom over again.
Hence I have marked a lacuna.</note> as knowledge of what we ought
to choose, what we ought to beware of, and what is indifferent ;


<milestone unit="section" n="93"/>
justice . . . ; magnanimity as the knowledge or habit of mind which
makes one superior to anything that happens, whether good or evil
equally ; continence as a disposition never overcome in that which
concerns right reason, or a habit which no pleasures can get the
better of ; endurance as a knowledge or habit which suggests what we
are to hold fast to, what not, and what is indifferent ; presence
of mind as a habit prompt to find out what is meet to be done at any
moment ; good counsel as knowledge by which we see what to do and
how to do it if we would consult our own interests.
</p>

<p>Similarly, of vices some are primary, others subordinate : <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> folly, cowardice, injustice, profligacy are
accounted primary ; but incontinence, stupidity, ill-advisedness
subordinate. Further, they hold that the vices are forms of
ignorance of those things whereof the corresponding virtues are the
knowledge.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="94"/>
<p>Good in general is that from which some advantage comes, and more particularly what is either identical with
or not distinct from benefit. Whence it follows that virtue itself
and whatever partakes of virtue is called good in these three
senses--viz. as being (1) the source from which benefit results ; or
(2) that in respect of which benefit results, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the virtuous act ; or (3) that by the agency
of which benefit results, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the good man who
partakes in virtue.
</p> 
<p>Another particular definition of good
which they give is "the natural perfection of a rational being <hi
rend='ital'>qua</hi> rational." To this answers virtue and, as
being
<pb n='203'/> 
partakers in virtue, virtuous acts and
good men ; as also its supervening accessories, joy and gladness and
the like. 

<milestone unit="section" n="95"/>

So with evils : either they are vices, folly, cowardice,
injustice, and the like ; or things which partake of vice, including
vicious acts and wicked persons as well as their accompaniments,
despair, moroseness, and the like.
</p> 
<p>Again, some goods are
goods of the mind and others external, while some are neither mental
nor external. The former include the virtues and virtuous acts ;
external goods are such as having a good country or a good friend,
and the prosperity of such. Whereas to be good and happy oneself is
of the class of goods neither mental nor external. 

<milestone unit="section" n="96"/>

Similarly of
things evil some are mental evils, namely, vices and vicious actions
; others are outward evils, as to have a foolish country or a
foolish friend and the unhappiness of such ; other evils again are
neither mental nor outward, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> to be yourself
bad and unhappy.
</p> 
<p>Again, goods are either of the nature of
ends or they are the means to these ends, or they are at the same
time end and means. A friend and the advantages derived from him are
means to good, whereas confidence, high - spirit, liberty, delight,
gladness, freedom from pain, and every virtuous act are of the
nature of ends.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="97"/>
<p>The virtues (they say) are goods of the
nature at once of ends and of means. On the one hand, in so far as
they cause happiness they are means, and on the other hand, in so
far as they make it complete, and so are themselves part of it, they
are ends. Similarly of evils some are of the nature of ends and some
of means, while others are at once both means and ends. Your enemy
and the harm he
<pb n='205'/> 
does you are means ;
consternation, abasement, slavery, gloom, despair, excess of grief,
and every vicious action are of the nature of ends. Vices are evils
both as ends and as means, since in so far as they cause misery they
are means, but in so far as they make it complete, so that they
become part of it, they are ends.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="98"/>
<p>Of mental goods some are
habits, others are dispositions, while others again are neither
the one nor the other. The virtues are dispositions, while accomplishments or avocations are matters of habit, and activities as
such or exercise of faculty neither the one nor the other. And in
general there are some mixed goods : <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> to be
happy in one's children or in one's old age. But knowledge is a pure
good. Again, some goods are permanent like the virtues, others
transitory like joy and walking-exercise.
</p> 
<p>All good (they say)
is expedient, binding, profitable, useful, serviceable, beautiful,
beneficial, desirable, and just or right. 

<milestone unit="section" n="99"/>

It is expedient, because
it brings about things of such a kind that by their occurrence we
are benefited. It is binding, because it causes unity where unity is
needed ; profitable, because it defrays what is expended on it, so
that the return yields a balance of benefit on the transaction. It
is useful, because it secures the use of benefit ; it is
serviceable, because the utility it affords is worthy of all praise.
It is beautiful, because the good is proportionate to the use made
of it ; beneficial, because by its inherent nature it benefits ;
choiceworthy, because it is such that to choose it is reasonable. It
is also just or right, inasmuch as it is in harmony with law and
tends to draw men together.
</p> <pb n='207'/> 

<milestone unit="section" n="100"/>
<p>The reason why they
characterize the perfect good as beautiful is that it has in full
all the "factors" required by nature or has perfect proportion. Of
the beautiful there are (say they) four species, namely, what is
just, courageous, orderly and wise ; for it is under these forms
that fair deeds are accomplished. Similarly there are four species
of the base or ugly, namely, what is unjust, cowardly, disorderly,
and unwise. By the beautiful is meant properly and in an unique
sense that good which renders its possessors praiseworthy, or
briefly, good which is worthy of praise ; though in another sense it
signifies a good aptitude for one's proper function ; while in yet
another sense the beautiful is that which lends new grace to
anything, as when we say of the wise man that he alone is good and
beautiful.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="101"/>
<p>And they say that only the morally beautiful is
good. So Hecato in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Goods</hi>, book
iii., and Chrysippus in his work <hi rend='ital'>On the Morally
Beautiful.</hi> They hold, that is, that virtue and whatever
partakes of virtue consists in this : which is equivalent to saying
that all that is good is beautiful, or that the term "good" has
equal force with the term "beautiful," which comes to the same
thing. "Since a thing is good, it is beautiful ; now it is
beautiful, therefore it is good." They hold that all goods are equal
and that all good is desirable in the highest degree and admits of
no lowering or heightening of intensity. Of things that are, some,
they say, are good, some are evil, and some neither good nor evil
(that is, morally indifferent).
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="102"/>
<p>Goods comprise the virtues of
prudence, justice, courage, temperance, and the rest ; while the
opposites of these are evils, namely, folly, injustice, and

<pb n='209'/> 
the rest. Neutral (neither good nor evil, that is)
are all those things which neither benefit nor harm a man : such as
life, health, pleasure, beauty, strength, wealth, fair fame and
noble birth, and their opposites, death, disease, pain, ugliness,
weakness, poverty, ignominy, low birth, and the like. This Hecato
affirms in his <hi rend='ital'>De fine</hi>, book vii., and also
Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Ethics.</hi> and Chrysippus. For,
say they, such things (as life, health, and pleasure) are not in
themselves goods, but are morally indifferent, though falling under
the species or subdivision "things preferred." 

<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>

For as the property
of hot is to warm, not to cool, so the property of good is to
benefit, not to injure ; but wealth and health do no more benefit
than injury, therefore neither wealth nor health is good. Further,
they say that that is not good of which both good and bad use can be
made ; but of wealth and health both good and bad use can be made ;
therefore wealth and health are not goods. On the other hand,
Posidonius maintains that these things too are among goods. Hecato
in the ninth book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Goods</hi>, and
Chrysippus in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Pleasure</hi>, deny that
pleasure is a good either ; for some pleasures are disgraceful,
and nothing disgraceful is good. 

<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>

To benefit is to set in motion or
sustain in accordance with virtue ; whereas to harm is to set in
motion or sustain in accordance with vice.
</p> 
<p>The term
"indifferent" has two meanings : in the first it denotes the things
which do not contribute either to happiness or to misery, as wealth,
fame, health, strength, and the like ; for it is possible to be
happy without having these, although, if they are used in a certain
way, such use of them tends to
<pb n='211'/> 
happiness or
misery. In quite another sense those things are said to be
indifferent which are without the power of stirring inclination or
aversion ; <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> the fact that the number of
hairs on one's head is odd or even or whether you hold out your
finger straight or bent. But it was not in this sense that the
things mentioned above were termed indifferent, they being quite
capable of exciting inclination or aversion. 

<milestone unit="section" n="105"/>

Hence of these latter
some are taken by preference, others are rejected, whereas
indifference in the other sense affords no ground for either
choosing or avoiding.
</p> 
<p>Of things indifferent, as they express
it, some are "preferred," others "rejected." Such as have value,
they say, are "preferred," while such as have negative, instead of
positive, value are "rejected." Value they define as, first, any
contribution to harmonious living, such as attaches to every good ;
secondly, some faculty or use which indirectly<note
n='a'>"Indirectly" : more literally "contributing, as intermediary
(<foreign lang='greek'>me/shn</foreign>), to."</note> contributes
to the life according to nature : which is as much as to say "any
assistance brought by wealth or health towards living a natural
life" ; thirdly, value is the full equivalent of an appraiser, as
fixed by an expert acquainted with the facts--as when it is said
that wheat exchanges for so much barley with a mule thrown in.<note
n='b'>With Arnim's correction, wheat would exchange for 1 1/2 times
the quantity of barley. The three meanings of <foreign lang='greek'>a)ci/a</foreign> are also given, but in a different
order, by Stobaeus, <hi rend='ital'>Ecl.</hi> ii. 83. 10, who
explains this as <foreign lang='greek'> a)moibh\ n tou= dokima
stou=.</foreign></note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="106"/>
<p>Thus things of the preferred class are
those which have positive value, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> amongst
mental qualities, natural ability, skill, moral improvement, and the
like ; among bodily qualities, life, health, strength, good
condition, soundness of organs, beauty, and so forth ; and in the
sphere of external things, wealth,
<pb n='213'/> 
fame, noble
birth, and the like. To the class of things "rejected" belong, of
mental qualities, lack of ability, want of skill, and the like ;
among bodily qualities, death, disease, weakness, being out of
condition, mutilation, ugliness, and the like ; in the sphere of
external things, poverty, ignominy, low birth, and so forth. But
again there are things belonging to neither class ; such are not
preferred, neither are they rejected.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="107"/>
<p>Again, of things
preferred some are preferred for their own sake, some for the sake
of something else, and others again both for their own sake and for
the sake of something else. To the first of these classes belong
natural ability, moral improvement, and the like ; to the second
wealth, noble birth, and the like ; to the last strength, perfect
faculties, soundness of bodily organs. Things are preferred for
their own sake because they accord with nature ; not for their own
sake, but for the sake of something else, because they secure not a
few utilities. And similarly with the class of things rejected under
the contrary heads.
</p> 
<p>Furthermore, the term Duty is applied to
that for which, when done,<note n='a'>The reading <foreign lang='greek'> praxqe/n</foreign> is now accepted in place of
<foreign lang='greek'> proaxqe/ n.</foreign> "Duty," it should be
noted, is a very inadequate rendering of <foreign lang='greek'>
kaqh=ko n,</foreign> which in the present passage applies to the
proper behaviour of plants and animals no less than to that of human
beings. <hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Stob. <hi rend='ital'>Ecl.</hi> ii.
85. 13 <foreign lang='greek'>o)\ praxqe\n eu)/logo n a)pologi/ an e)/xei
;</foreign> Sext. Emp. vii. 158.</note> a reasonable defence can be
adduced, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> harmony in the tenor of life's
process, which indeed pervades the growth of plants and animals. For
even in plants and animals, they hold, you may discern fitness of
behaviour.
</p> <milestone unit="section" n="108"/>
<p>Zeno was the first to use this term <foreign lang='greek'> kaqh=ko n</foreign> of conduct. Etymologically it is
derived from <foreign lang='greek'>kata/ tinas h(/kein,</foreign> <hi
rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> reaching as far as, being up to, or incumbent
on so and so.<note n='b'>The ordinary meaning of the verb <foreign lang='greek'> kaqh/ke in</foreign> is well seen in Hdt. vii. 22
<foreign lang='greek'>o( ga\r *)/aqws e)sti\ o)/ros me/ga te kai\ o)nomas1 to\n e)s
qa/lass1 an kath=ko n</foreign> ("for Athos is a great and famous
mountain, reaching down to the sea"). The term seems to have passed
from this meaning to signify figuratively that which extends to,
affects, or is incumbent on us : as near an approach, perhaps, to
the idea of duty as can be expected in any ancient system of Ethics,
which regards human conduct not as obedience to law, but as
determination and pursuit of good.</note> And it is an action in
itself adapted
<pb n='215'/> 
to nature's arrangements. For of
the acts done at the prompting of impulse some, they observe, are
fit and meet, others the reverse, while there is a third class which
is neither the one nor the other.
</p> 
<p>Befitting acts are all
those which reason prevails with us to do ; and this is the case
with honouring one's parents, brothers and country, and intercourse
with friends. 

<milestone unit="section" n="109"/>

Unbefitting, or contrary to duty, are all acts that
reason deprecates, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> to neglect one's
parents, to be indifferent to one's brothers, not to agree with
friends, to disregard the interests of one's country, and so forth.
Acts which fall under neither of the foregoing classes are those
which reason neither urges us to do nor forbids, such as picking up
a twig, holding a style or a scraper, and the like.
</p> 
<p>Again,
some duties are incumbent unconditionally, others in certain
circumstances. Unconditional duties are the following : to take
proper care of health and one's organs of sense, and things of that
sort. Duties imposed by circumstances are such as maiming oneself
and sacrifice of property. And so likewise with acts which are
violations of duty. Another division is into duties which are always
incumbent and those which are not. To live in accordance with virtue
is always a duty, whereas dialectic by question and answer or
walking-exercise and the like are not at all times incumbent. The
same may be said of the violations of duty. 

<milestone unit="section" n="110"/>

And in things
intermediate also there are duties ; as that boys should obey the
attendants who have charge of them.
</p> 
<p>According to the Stoics
there is an eight-fold
<pb n='217'/> 
division of the soul :
the five senses, the faculty of speech, the intellectual faculty,
which is the mind itself, and the generative faculty, being all
parts of the soul. Now from falsehood there results perversion,
which extends to the mind ; and from this perversion arise many
passions or emotions, which are causes of instability. Passion, or
emotion, is defined by Zeno as an irrational and unnatural movement
in the soul, or again as impulse in excess.
</p> 
<p>The main, or most
universal, emotions, according to Hecato in his treatise <hi
rend='ital'>On the Passions</hi>, book ii., and Zeno in his treatise
with the same title, constitute four great classes, grief, fear,
desire or craving, pleasure. 

<milestone unit="section" n="111"/>

They hold the emotions to be
judgements, as is stated by Chrysippus in his treatise <hi
rend='ital'>On the Passions</hi> : avarice being a supposition that
money is a good, while the case is similar with drunkenness and
profligacy and all the other emotions.
</p> 
<p>And grief or pain they
hold to be an irrational mental contraction. Its species are pity,
envy, jealousy, rivalry, heaviness, annoyance, distress, anguish,
distraction. Pity is grief felt at undeserved suffering ; envy,
grief at others' prosperity ; jealousy, grief at the possession by
another of that which one desires for oneself ; rivalry, pain at the
possession by another of what one has oneself. 

<milestone unit="section" n="112"/>

Heaviness or vexation
is grief which weighs us down, annoyance that which coops us up and
straitens us for want of room, distress a pain brought on by anxious
thought that lasts and increases, anguish painful grief, distraction
irrational grief, rasping and hindering us from viewing the
situation as a whole.
</p> <pb n='219'/> 
<p>Fear is an expectation of
evil. Under fear are ranged the following emotions : terror, nervous
shrinking, shame, consternation, panic, mental agony. Terror is a
fear which produces fright ; shame is fear of disgrace ; nervous
shrinking is a fear that one will have to act ; consternation is
fear due to a presentation of some unusual occurrence ; 

<milestone unit="section" n="113"/>

panic is
fear with pressure exercised by sound ; mental agony is fear felt
when some issue is still in suspense.
</p> 
<p>Desire or craving is
irrational appetency, and under it are ranged the following states :
want, hatred, contentiousness, anger, love, wrath, resentment.
Want, then, is a craving when it is baulked and, as it were, cut off
from its object, but kept at full stretch and attracted towards it
in vain. Hatred is a growing and lasting desire or craving that it
should go ill with somebody. Contentiousness is a craving or desire
connected with partisanship ; anger a craving or desire to punish
one who is thought to have done you an undeserved injury. The
passion of love is a craving from which good men are free ; for it
is an effort to win affection due to the visible presence of beauty.

<milestone unit="section" n="114"/>
Wrath is anger which has long rankled and has become malicious,
waiting for its opportunity, as is illustrated by the lines<note
n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Il.</hi> i. 81, 82.</note> :
</p> 
<p>Even
though for the one day he swallow his anger, yet doth he still keep
his displeasure thereafter in his heart, till he accomplish it.
</p>

<p>Resentment is anger in an early stage.
</p> 
<p>Pleasure is an
irrational elation at the accruing of what seems to be choiceworthy
; and under it are ranged ravishment, malevolent joy, delight,
transport. Ravishment is pleasure which charms the ear. Malevolent
joy is pleasure at another's ills. Delight
<pb n='221'/> 
is
the mind's propulsion to weakness, its name in Greek (<foreign lang='greek'> te/ryis</foreign> ) being akin to <foreign lang='greek'> tre/yis</foreign> or turning. To be in transports of
delight is the melting away of virtue.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="115"/>
<p>And as there are said
to be certain infirmities in the body, as for instance gout and
arthritic disorders, so too there is in the soul love of fame,
love of pleasure, and the like. By infirmity is meant disease
accompanied by weakness ; and by disease is meant a fond imagining
of something that seems desirable. And as in the body there are
tendencies to certain maladies such as colds and diarrhoea, so it is
with the soul, there are tendencies like enviousness, pitifulness,
quarrelsomeness, and the like.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="116"/>
<p>Also they say that there are
three emotional states which are good, namely, joy, caution, and
wishing. Joy, the counterpart of pleasure, is rational elation ;
caution, the counterpart of fear, rational avoidance ; for though
the wise man will never feel fear, he will yet use caution. And they
make wishing the counterpart of desire (or craving), inasmuch as it
is rational appetency. And accordingly, as under the primary
passions are classed certain others subordinate to them, so too is
it with the primary eupathies or good emotional states. Thus under
wishing they bring well-wishing or benevolence, friendliness,
respect, affection ; under caution, reverence and modesty ; under
joy, delight, mirth, cheerfulness.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="117"/>
<p>Now they say that the wise
man is passionless, because he is not prone to fall into such
infirmity. But they add that in another sense the term apathy is
applied to the bad man, when, that is, it means that he is callous
and relentless. Further, the wise
<pb n='223'/> 
man is said
to be free from vanity ; for he is indifferent to good or evil
report. However, he is not alone in this, there being another who is
also free from vanity, he who is ranged among the rash, and that is
the bad man. Again, they tell us that all good men are austere or
harsh, because they neither have dealings with pleasure themselves
nor tolerate those who have. The term harsh is applied, however, to
others as well, and in much the same sense as a wine is said to be
harsh when it is employed medicinally and not for drinking at
all.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="118"/>
<p>Again, the good are genuinely in earnest and vigilant
for their own improvement, using a manner of life which banishes
evil out of sight and makes what good there is in things appear. At
the same time they are free from pretence; for they have stripped
off all pretence or "make-up" whether in voice or in look. Free too
are they from all business cares, declining to do anything which
conflicts with duty. They will take wine, but not get drunk. Nay
more, they will not be liable to madness either; not but what
there will at times occur to the good man strange impressions due to
melancholy or delirium, ideas not determined by the principle of
what is choiceworthy but contrary to nature. Nor indeed will the
wise man ever feel grief; seeing that grief is irrational
contraction of the soul, as Apollodorus says in his <hi
rend='ital'>Ethics</hi>.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="119"/>
<p>They are also, it is declared,
godlike; for they have a something divine within them ; whereas the
bad man is godless. And yet of this word--godless or ungodly--there
are two senses, one in which it is the opposite of the term "godly,"
the other denoting the man who ignores the divine altogether : in
this
<pb n='225'/> 
latter sense, as they note, the term does
not apply to every bad man. The good, it is added, are also
worshippers of God ; for they have acquaintance with the rites of
the gods, and piety is the knowledge of how to serve the gods.
Further, they will sacrifice to the gods and they keep themselves
pure ; for they avoid all acts that are offences against the gods,
and the gods think highly of them : for they are holy and just in
what concerns the gods. The wise too are the only priests; for they
have made sacrifices their study, as also the building of temples,
purifications, and all the other matters appertaining to the
gods.
</p> <milestone unit="section" n="120"/>
<p>The Stoics approve also of honouring parents and
brothers in the second place next after the gods. They further
maintain that parental affection for children is natural to the
good, but not to the bad. It is one of their tenets that sins are
all equal : so Chrysippus in the fourth book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Ethical Questions,</hi> as well as Persaeus and Zeno.
For if one truth is not more true than another, neither is one
falsehood more false than another, and in the same way one deceit
is not more so than another, nor sin than sin. For he who is a
hundred furlongs from Canopus and he who is only one furlong away
are equally not in Canopus, and so too he who commits the greater
sin and he who commits the less are equally not in the path of right
conduct. 

<milestone unit="section" n="121"/>

But Heraclides of Tarsus, who was the disciple of Antipater
of Tarsus, and Athenodorus both assert that sins are not equal.
</p>

<p>Again, the Stoics say that the wise man will take part in
politics, if nothing hinders him--so, for instance, Chrysippus in
the first book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On Various Types of
Life</hi>--since thus he will restrain vice and promote virtue. Also
(they maintain) he
<pb n='227'/> 
will marry, as Zeno says in
his <hi rend='ital'>Republic,</hi> and beget children. Moreover,
they say that the wise man will never form mere opinions, that is to
say, he will never give assent to anything that is false ; that he
will also play the Cynic, Cynicism being a short cut to virtue, as
Apollodorus calls it in his <hi rend='ital'>Ethics</hi> ; that he
will even turn cannibal under stress of circumstances. They
declare that he alone is free and bad men are slaves, freedom being
power of independent action, whereas slavery is privation of the

though indeed there is also a second form of slavery
consisting in subordination, and a third which implies possession of
the slave as well as his subordination; the correlative of such
servitude being lordship ; and this too is evil. Moreover, according
to them not only are the wise free, they are also kings ; kingship
being irresponsible rule, which none but the wise can maintain: so
Chrysippus in his treatise vindicating Zeno's use of terminology.
For he holds that knowledge of good and evil is a necessary
attribute of the ruler, and that no bad man is acquainted with this
science. Similarly the wise and good alone are fit to be
magistrates, judges, or orators, whereas among the bad there is not
one so qualified. Furthermore, the wise are infallible, not being
liable to error. 

<milestone unit="section" n="123"/>

They are also without offence; for they do no hurt
to others or to themselves. At the same time they are not pitiful
and make no allowance for anyone; they never relax the penalties
fixed by the laws, since indulgence and pity and even equitable
consideration are marks of a weak mind, which affects kindness in
place of chastizing. Nor do they deem punishments too severe. Again,
they say that the wise man never wonders at any of the
</p> <pb
n='229'/> 
<p>things which appear extraordinary, such as Charon's
mephitic caverns,<note n='a'>Regarded as passages down to the
underworld; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Virg. <hi rend='ital'>Aen.</hi>
vi. 240 <hi rend='ital'>seq.,</hi> 299.</note> ebbings of the tide,
hot springs or fiery eruptions. Nor yet, they go on to say, will the
wise man live in solitude ; for he is naturally made for society and
action. He will, however, submit to training to augment his powers
of bodily endurance.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="124"/>
<p>And the wise man, they say, will offer
prayers, and ask for good things from the gods : so Posidonius in
the first book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Duties,</hi> and
Hecato in his third book <hi rend='ital'>On Paradoxes.</hi>
Friendship, they declare, exists only between the wise and good, by
reason of their likeness to one another. And by friendship they mean
a common use of all that has to do with life, wherein we treat our
friends as we should ourselves. They argue that a friend is worth
having for his own sake and that it is a good thing to have many
friends. But among the bad there is, they hold, no such thing as
friendship, and thus no bad man has a friend. Another of their
tenets is that the unwise are all mad, inasmuch as they are not wise
but do what they do from that madness which is the equivalent of
their folly.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="125"/>
<p>Furthermore, the wise man does all things well,
just as we say that Ismenias plays all airs on the flute well. Also
everything belongs to the wise. For the law, they say, has conferred
upon them a perfect right to all things. It is true that certain
things are said to belong to the bad, just as what has been
dishonestly acquired may be said, in one sense, to belong to the
state, in another sense to those who are enjoying it.
</p> 
<p>They
hold that the virtues involve one another, and that the possessor of
one is the possessor of all,
<pb n='231'/> 
inasmuch as they
have common principles, as Chrysippus says in the first book of his
work <hi rend='ital'>On Virtues,</hi> Apollodorus in his <hi
rend='ital'>Physics according to the Early School,</hi> and Hecato
in the third book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Virtues.</hi>
<milestone unit="section" n="126"/>

For if a man be possessed of virtue, he is at once able to discover
and to put into practice what he ought to do. Now such rules of
conduct comprise rules for choosing, enduring, staying, and
distributing ; so that if a man does some things by intelligent
choice, some things with fortitude, some things by way of just
distribution, and some steadily, he is at once wise, courageous,
just, and temperate. And each of the virtues has a particular
subject with which it deals, as, for instance, courage is concerned
with things that must be endured, practical wisdom with acts to be
done, acts from which one must abstain, and those which fall under
neither head. Similarly each of the other virtues is concerned with
its own proper sphere. To wisdom are subordinate good counsel and
understanding ; to temperance, good discipline and orderliness ; to
justice, equality and fair-mindedness ; to courage, constancy and
vigour.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="127"/>
<p>It is a tenet of theirs that between virtue and vice
there is nothing intermediate, whereas according to the Peripatetics
there is, namely, the state of moral improvement. For, say the
Stoics, just as a stick must be either straight or crooked, so a man
must be either just or unjust. Nor again are there degrees of
justice and injustice ; and the same rule applies to the other
virtues. Further, while Chrysippus holds that virtue can be lost,
Cleanthes maintains that it cannot. According to the former it may
be lost in consequence of drunkenness or melancholy ;
</p> <pb
n='233'/> 
<p>the latter takes it to be inalienable owing to the
certainty of our mental apprehension. And virtue in itself they hold
to be worthy of choice for its own sake. At all events we are
ashamed of bad conduct as if we knew that nothing is really good but
the morally beautiful. Moreover, they hold that it is in itself
sufficient to ensure well-being : thus Zeno, and Chrysippus in the
first book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Virtues,</hi> and
Hecato in the second book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On
Goods:</hi> 

<milestone unit="section" n="128"/>

"For if magnanimity by itself alone can raise us far
above everything, and if magnanimity is but a part of virtue, then
too virtue as a whole will be sufficient in itself for well-being
--despising all things that seem troublesome." Panaetius, however,
and Posidonius deny that virtue is self-sufficing : on the contrary,
health is necessary, and some means of living and strength.
</p>

<p>Another tenet of theirs is the perpetual exercise of virtue, as
held by Cleanthes and his followers. For virtue can never be lost,
and the good man is always exercising his mind, which is perfect.
Again, they say that justice, as well as law and right reason,
exists by nature and not by convention : so Chrysippus in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On the Morally Beautiful.</hi> 

<milestone unit="section" n="129"/>

Neither do they think
that the divergence of opinion between philosophers is any reason
for abandoning the study of philosophy, since at that rate we should
have to give up life altogether : so Posidonius in his <hi
rend='ital'>Exhortations.</hi> Chrysippus allows that the ordinary
Greek education is serviceable.
</p> 
<p>It is their doctrine that
there can be no question of right as between man and the lower
animals, because of their unlikeness. Thus Chrysippus in the first
book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Justice,</hi> and Posi-

<pb n='235'/> 
donius in the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>De
officio.</hi> Further, they say that the wise man will feel
affection for the youths who by their countenance show a natural
endowment for virtue. So Zeno in his <hi rend='ital'>Republic,</hi>
Chrysippus in book i. of his work <hi rend='ital'>On Modes of
Life,</hi> and Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Ethics.</hi>
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="130"/>
<p>Their definition of love is an effort toward friendliness due
to visible beauty appearing, its sole end being friendship, not
bodily enjoyment. At all events, they allege that Thrasonides,
although he had his mistress in his power, abstained from her
because she hated him. By which it is shown, they think, that love
depends upon regard, as Chrysippus says in his treatise <hi
rend='ital'>Of Love,</hi> and is not sent by the gods. And beauty
they describe as the bloom or flower of virtue.
</p> 
<p>Of the three
kinds of life, the contemplative, the practical, and the rational,
they declare that we ought to choose the last, for that a rational
being is expressly produced by nature for contemplation and for
action. They tell us that the wise man will for reasonable cause
make his own exit from life, on his country's behalf or for the sake
of his friends, or if he suffer intolerable pain, mutilation, or
incurable disease.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="131"/>
<p>It is also their doctrine that amongst the
wise there should be a community of wives with free choice of
partners, as Zeno says in his <hi rend='ital'>Republic</hi> and
Chrysippus in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Government</hi> [and
not only they, but also Diogenes the Cynic and Plato].<note
n='a'>The words in brackets read like a marginal note, afterwards
inserted in the text.</note> Under such circumstances we shall feel
paternal affection for all the children alike, and there will be an
end of the jealousies arising from adultery. The best form of
government they hold to be a mixture
<pb n='237'/> 
of
democracy, kingship, and aristocracy (or the rule of the best).
</p>

<p>Such, then, are the statements they make in their ethical
doctrines, with much more besides, together with their proper proofs
: let this, however, suffice for a statement of them in a summary
and elementary form.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="132"/>
<p>Their physical doctrine they divide into
sections (1) about bodies; (2) about principles; (3) about elements;
(4) about the gods; (5) about bounding surfaces and space whether
filled or empty. This is a division into species; but the generic
division is into three parts, dealing with (i.) the universe; (ii.)
the elements; (iii.) the subject of causation.
</p> 
<p>The part
dealing with the universe admits, they say, of division into two :
for with one aspect of it the mathematicians also are concerned, in
so far as they treat questions relating to the fixed stars and the
planets, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> whether the sun is or is not just
so large as it appears to be, and the same about the moon, the
question of their revolutions, and other inquiries of the same sort.
But there is another aspect or field of cosmological<note
n='a'><foreign lang='greek'>au)tou== tou= ko/smou.</foreign></note>
inquiry, which belongs to the physicists alone : 

<milestone unit="section" n="133"/>

this includes such
questions as what the substance of the universe is, whether the sun
and the stars are made up of form and matter, whether the world has
had a beginning in time or not, whether it is animate or inanimate,
whether it is destructible or indestructible, whether it is governed
by providence, and all the rest. The part concerned with causation,
again, is itself subdivided into two. And in one of its aspects
medical inquiries have a share in it, in so far as it involves
investigation of the ruling principle of the soul and the phenomena
of
<pb n='239'/> 
soul, seeds, and the like. Whereas the other
part is claimed by the mathematicians also, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> how vision is to be explained, what causes the
image on the mirror, what is the origin of clouds, thunder,
rainbows, halos, comets, and the like.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="134"/>
<p>They hold that there
are two principles in the universe, the active principle and the
passive. The passive principle, then, is a substance without
quality, <hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> matter, whereas the active is the
reason inherent in this substance, that is God. For he is
everlasting and is the artificer of each several thing throughout
the whole extent of matter. This doctrine is laid down by Zeno of
Citium in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Existence,</hi> Cleanthes
in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Atoms,</hi> Chrysippus in the first
book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi> towards the end, Archedemus
in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Elements,</hi> and Posidonius in
the second book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Exposition.</hi>
There is a difference, according to them, between principles and
elements ; the former being without generation or destruction,
whereas the elements are destroyed when all things are resolved into
fire. Moreover, the principles are incorporeal and destitute of
form, while the elements have been endowed with form.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="135"/>
<p>Body is
defined by Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi> as that
which is extended in three dimensions, length, breadth, and depth.
This is also called solid body. But surface is the extremity of a
solid body, or that which has length and breadth only without depth.
That surface exists not only in our thought but also in reality is
maintained by Posidonius in the third book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Celestial Phenomena.</hi> A line is the extremity of a
surface or length without breadth, or that which has length alone. A
point is the extremity of a line, the smallest possible mark or
dot.
</p> <pb n='241'/> 
<p>God is one and the same with Reason, Fate,
and Zeus ; he is also called by many other names. 

<milestone unit="section" n="136"/>

In the beginning
he was by himself ; he transformed the whole of substance through
air into water, and just as in animal generation the seed has a
moist vehicle, so in cosmic moisture God, who is the seminal reason
of the universe, remains behind in the moisture as such an agent,
adapting matter to himself with a view to the next stage of
creation. Thereupon he created first of all the four elements, fire,
water, air, earth. They are discussed by Zeno in his treatise <hi
rend='ital'>On the Whole</hi>, by Chrysippus in the first book of
his <hi rend='ital'>Physics,</hi> and by Archedemus in a work <hi
rend='ital'>On Elements.</hi> An element is defined as that from
which particular things first come to be at their birth and into
which they are finally resolved. 

<milestone unit="section" n="137"/>

The four elements together
constitute unqualified substance or matter. Fire is the hot element,
water the moist, air the cold, earth the dry. Not but what the
quality of dryness is also found in the air.<note n='a'>"The same
part" <foreign lang='greek'>(to\ au)to\ me/ros)</foreign> may refer to
the quality of dryness last mentioned.</note> Fire has the uppermost
place ; it is also called aether, and in it the sphere of the fixed
stars is first created ; then comes the sphere of the planets, next
to that the air, then the water, and lowest of all the earth, which
is at the centre of all things.
</p> 
<p>The term universe or cosmos
is used by them in three senses : (1) of God himself, the individual
being whose quality is derived from the whole of substance ; he is
indestructible and ingenerable, being the artificer of this orderly
arrangement, who at stated periods of time absorbs into himself the
whole of substance and again creates it from himself.

<milestone unit="section" n="138"/>

(2) Again,
they give the name of cosmos to the orderly
<pb n='243'/>

arrangement of the heavenly bodies in itself as such ; and (3) in
the third place to that whole of which these two are parts. Again,
the cosmos is defined as the individual being qualifying the whole
of substance, or, in the words of Posidonius in his elementary
treatise on <hi rend='ital'>Celestial Phenomena</hi>, a system made
up of heaven and earth and the natures in them, or, again, as a
system constituted by gods and men and all things created for their
sake. By heaven is meant the extreme circumference or ring in which
the deity has his seat.
</p> 
<p>The world,<note n='a'>"World" is
normally the best rendering of <foreign lang='greek'>
ko/smos.</foreign> "Universe," which some prefer, better suits
<foreign lang='greek'>to\ o(/lon.</foreign></note> in their view, is
ordered by reason and providence : so says Chrysippus in the fifth
book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Providence</hi> and
Posidonius in his work <hi rend='ital'>On the Gods</hi>, book
iii.--inasmuch as reason pervades every part of it, just as does the
soul in us. Only there is a difference of degree ; in some parts
there is more of it, in others less. 

<milestone unit="section" n="139"/>

For through some parts it
passes as a "hold" or containing force, as is the case with our
bones and sinews ; while through others it passes as intelligence,
as in the ruling part of the soul. Thus, then, the whole world is a
living being, endowed with soul and reason, and having aether for
its ruling principle : so says Antipater of Tyre in the eighth book
of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On the Cosmos.</hi> Chrysippus in
the first book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On Providence</hi> and
Posidonius in his book <hi rend='ital'>On the Gods</hi> say that the
heaven, but Cleanthes that the sun, is the ruling power of the
world. Chrysippus, however, in the course of the same work gives a
somewhat different account, namely, that it is the purer part of the
aether ; the same which they declare to be preeminently God and
always to have, as it were in sensible fashion, pervaded all that is
in the air, all
<pb n='245'/> 
animals and plants, and also
the earth itself, as a principle of cohesion.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="140"/>
<p>The world, they
say, is one and finite, having a spherical shape, such a shape being
the most suitable for motion, as Posidonius says in the fifth book
of his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Discourse</hi> and the disciples of
Antipater in their works on the Cosmos. Outside of the world is
diffused the infinite void, which is incorporeal. By incorporeal is
meant that which, though capable of being occupied by body, is not
so occupied. The world has no empty space within it, but forms one
united whole. This is a necessary result of the sympathy and tension
which binds together things in heaven and earth. Chrysippus
discusses the void in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Void</hi> and in
the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Sciences</hi> ; so
too Apollophanes in his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>, Apollodorus,
and Posidonius in his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Discourse</hi>, book
ii. But these, it is added [<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> sympathy and
tension], are likewise bodies.<note n='a'>The reading <foreign lang='greek'> a)sw/mat a</foreign> can be retained if we alter
<foreign lang='greek'>tau=ta</foreign> to <foreign lang='greek'>lekta/,</foreign>the sense thus being "the meanings of
spoken words are also incorporeal." Yet a parallel change is
required in &sect; 134. Professor Pearson suggests<foreign lang='greek'>ei)=nai de\ kai\ ta\ a)sw/mat a o(moi/ws,</foreign>introducing
&sect; 141.</note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="141"/>
<p>Time too is incorporeal, being the measure of the
world's motion. And time past and time future are infinite, but time
present is finite. They hold that the world must come to an end,
inasmuch as it had a beginning, on the analogy of those things which
are understood by the senses. And that of which the parts are
perishable is perishable as a whole. Now the parts of the world are
perishable, seeing that they are transformed one into the other.
Therefore the world itself is doomed to perish. Moreover, anything
is destructible if it admits of deterioration ; therefore the world
is so, for it is first evaporated and again dissolved into
water.
</p> <pb n='247'/> 

<milestone unit="section" n="142"/>
<p>The world, they hold, comes into being
when its substance has first been converted from fire through air
into moisture and then the coarser part of the moisture has
condensed as earth, while that whose particles are fine has been
turned into air, and this process of rarefaction goes on increasing
till it generates fire. Thereupon out of these elements animals and
plants and all other natural kinds are formed by their mixture. The
generation and the destruction of the world are discussed by Zeno in
his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On the Whole</hi>, by Chrysippus in the
first book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>, by Posidonius in the
first book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On the Cosmos</hi>, by
Cleanthes, and by Antipater in his tenth book <hi rend='ital'>On the
Cosmos.</hi> Panaetius, however, maintained that the world is
indestructible.
</p> 
<p>The doctrine that the world is a living
being, rational, animate and intelligent, is laid down by Chrysippus
in the first book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On
Providence</hi>, by Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>,
and by Posidonius. 

<milestone unit="section" n="143"/>

It is a living thing in the sense of an animate
substance endowed with sensation ; for animal is better than
non-animal, and nothing is better than the world, <hi
rend='ital'>ergo</hi> the world is a living being. And it is endowed
with soul, as is clear from our several souls being each a fragment
of it. Bo&euml;thus, however, denies that the world is a living thing. The
unity of the world is maintained by Zeno in his treatise <hi
rend='ital'>On the Whole</hi>, by Chrysippus, by Apollodorus in his
<hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>, and by Posidonius in the first book of
his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Discourse.</hi> By the totality of
things, the All, is meant, according to Apollodorus, (1) the world,
and in another sense (2) the system composed of the world and the
void outside it. The world then is finite, the void infinite.

<pb n='249'/> 

<milestone unit="section" n="144"/>
<p>Of the stars some are fixed, and are carried round
with the whole heaven ; others, the wandering stars or planets, have
their special motions. The sun travels in an oblique path through
the zodiac. Similarly the moon travels in a spiral path. The sun is
pure fire : so Posidonius in the seventh book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Celestial Phenomena.</hi> And it is larger than the
earth, as the same author says in the sixth book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Physical Discourse.</hi> Moreover it is spherical in
shape like the world itself according to this same author and his
school. That it is fire is proved by its producing all the effects
of fire ; that it is larger than the earth by the fact that all the
earth is illuminated by it ; nay more, the heaven beside. The fact
too that the earth casts a conical shadow proves that the sun is
greater than it. And it is because of its great size that it is seen
from every part of the earth.
</p> 
<p>The moon, however, is of a more
earthy composition, since it is nearer to the earth. These fiery
bodies and the stars generally derive their nutriment, the sun from
the wide ocean, being a fiery kindling, though intelligent ; the
moon from fresh waters, with an admixture of air, close to the earth
as it is : thus Posidonius in the sixth book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Physics</hi> ; the other heavenly bodies being nourished
from the earth. They hold that the stars are spherical in shape and
that the earth too is so and is at rest ; and that the moon does not
shine by her own light, but by the borrowed light of the sun when he
shines upon her.
</p> 
<p>An eclipse of the sun takes place when the
moon passes in front of it on the side towards us, as shown by Zeno
with a diagram in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On the Whole.</hi>
<milestone unit="section" n="146"/>

For the moon is seen approaching at conjunctions and
</p> <pb
n='251'/> 
<p>occulting it and then again receding from it. This can
best be observed when they are mirrored in a basin of water. The
moon is eclipsed when she falls into the earth's shadow : for which
reason it is only at the full moon that an eclipse happens [and not
always then], although she is in opposition to the sun every month ;
because the moon moves in an oblique orbit, diverging in latitude
relatively to the orbit of the sun, and she accordingly goes farther
to the north or to the south. When, however, the moon's motion in
latitude has brought her into the sun's path through the zodiac, and
she thus comes diametrically opposite to the sun, there is an
eclipse. Now the moon is in latitude right on the zodiac,<note
n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the moon's latitude relatively to
the zodiac is nil.</note> when she is in the constellations of
Cancer, Scorpio, Aries and Taurus : so Posidonius and his followers
tell us.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="147"/>
<p>The deity, say they, is a living being, immortal,
rational, perfect or intelligent in happiness, admitting nothing
evil [into him], taking providential care of the world and all that
therein is, but he is not of human shape. He is, however, the
artificer of the universe and, as it were, the father of all, both
in general and in that particular part of him which is
all-pervading, and which is called many names according to its
various powers. They give the name Dia (<foreign lang='greek'>*di/a</foreign>) because all things are due to (<foreign lang='greek'>dia/</foreign>) him ; Zeus (<foreign lang='greek'>*zh=na</foreign>) in so far as he is the cause of life
(<foreign lang='greek'>zh=n</foreign>) or pervades all life ; the
name Athena is given, because the ruling part of the divinity
extends to the aether ; the name Hera marks its extension to the air
; he is called Hephaestus since it spreads to the creative fire ;
Poseidon, since it stretches to the sea ; Demeter, since it reaches
to the earth. Similarly men have
<pb n='253'/> 
given the
deity his other titles, fastening, as best they can, on some one or
other of his peculiar attributes.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="148"/>
<p>The substance of God is
declared by Zeno to be the whole world and the heaven, as well as by
Chrysippus in his first book <hi rend='ital'>Of the Gods</hi>, and
by Posidonius in his first book with the same title. Again,
Antipater in the seventh book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On the
Cosmos</hi> says that the substance of God is akin to air, while
Bo&euml;thus in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Nature</hi> speaks of the
sphere of the fixed stars as the substance of God. Now the term
Nature is used by them to mean sometimes that which holds the world
together, sometimes that which causes terrestrial things to spring
up. Nature is defined as a force moving of itself, producing and
preserving in being its offspring in accordance with seminal principles<note n='a'>Or perhaps "seminal proportions." This obscure expression would seem intended to assimilate all development and
evolution to the growth, whether of plants or animals, from
seed.</note> within definite periods, and effecting results
homogeneous with their sources. 

<milestone unit="section" n="149"/>

Nature, they hold, aims both at
utility and at pleasure, as is clear from the analogy of human
craftsmanship. That all things happen by fate or destiny is maintained by Chrysippus in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>De fato</hi>,
by Posidonius in his <hi rend='ital'>De fato</hi>, book ii., by Zeno
and by Bo&euml;thus in his <hi rend='ital'>De fato</hi>, book i. Fate is
defined as an endless chain of causation, whereby things are, or as
the reason or formula by which the world goes on. What is more, they
say that divination in all its forms is a real and substantial
fact, if there is really Providence. And they prove it to be
actually a science on the evidence of certain results : so Zeno,
Chrysippus in the second book of his <hi rend='ital'>De
divinatione</hi>, Athenodorus, and Posidonius in the second book of
his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Discourse</hi> and the fifth book of
his <hi rend='ital'>De divinatione.</hi> But Panaetius denies that
divination has any real existence.
</p> <pb n='255'/> 

<milestone unit="section" n="150"/>
<p>The
primary matter they make the substratum of all things : so
Chrysippus in the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>,
and Zeno. By matter is meant that out of which anything whatsoever
is produced. Both substance and matter are terms used in a twofold
sense according as they signify (1) universal or (2) particular
substance or matter. The former neither increases nor diminishes,
while the matter of particular things both increases and diminishes.
Body according to them is substance which is finite : so Antipater
in his second book <hi rend='ital'>On Substance</hi>, and
Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Physics.</hi> Matter can also be
acted upon, as the same author says, for if it were immutable, the
things which are produced would never have been produced out of it.
Hence the further doctrine that matter is divisible <hi
rend='ital'>ad infinitum.</hi> Chrysippus says that the division is
not <hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi>, but itself infinite ; for
there is nothing infinitely small to which the division can extend.
But nevertheless the division goes on without ceasing.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="151"/>
<p>Hence,
again, their explanation of the mixture of two substances is,
according to Chrysippus in the third book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Physics</hi>, that they permeate each other through and
through, and that the particles of the one do not merely surround
those of the other or lie beside them. Thus, if a little drop of
wine be thrown into the sea, it will be equally diffused over the
whole sea for a while and then will be blended<note n='a'>For the
meaning of this verb (<foreign lang='greek'> sumfqe i/resqa

the changes which go on in the air, they describe winter as the
cooling of the air above the earth due to the sun's departure to a
distance from the earth ; 

<milestone unit="section" n="152"/>

spring as the right temperature of the air
consequent upon his approach to us ; summer as the heating of the
air above the earth when he travels to the north ; while autumn they
attribute to the receding of the sun from us. As for the winds, they
are streams of air, differently named<note n='a'>The lacuna of the
mss. can be filled from the parallel passage of Aetius, Diels, <hi
rend='ital'>Doxographi Graeci</hi>, p. 374 a 23.</note> according to
the localities from which they blow. And the cause of their
production is the sun through the evaporation of the clouds. The
rainbow is explained as the reflection of the sun's rays from watery
clouds or, as Posidonius says in his <hi
rend='ital'>Meteorology</hi>, an image of a segment of the sun or
moon in a cloud suffused with dew, which is hollow and visible
without intermission, the image showing itself as if in a mirror in
the form of a circular arch. Comets, bearded stars, and meteors are
fires which arise when dense air is carried up to the region of
aether. 

<milestone unit="section" n="153"/>

A shooting star is the sudden kindling of a mass of fire in
rapid motion through the air, which leaves a trail behind it
presenting an appearance of length. Rain is the transformation of
cloud into water, when moisture drawn up by the sun from land or sea
has been only partially evaporated. If this is cooled down, it is
called hoar-frost. Hail is frozen cloud, crumbled by a wind ; while
snow is moist matter from a cloud which has congealed : so
Posidonius in the eighth book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physical Discourse.</hi> Lightning is a kindling of clouds from being rubbed
together or being rent by wind, as Zeno says in his treatise <hi
rend='ital'>On the Whole</hi> ; thunder the noise these clouds make
when they rub against each other or burst. 

<milestone unit="section" n="154"/>

Thunderbolt is the term
used when the fire is
<pb n='259'/> 
violently kindled and
hurled to the ground with great force as the clouds grind against
each other or are torn by the wind. Others say that it is a
compression of fiery air descending with great force. A typhoon is a
great and violent thunderstorm whirlwind-like, or a whirlwind of
smoke from a cloud that has burst. A "prester" is a cloud rent all
round by the force of fire and wind. Earthquakes, say they, happen
when the wind finds its way into, or is imprisoned in, the hollow
parts of the earth : so Posidonius in his eighth book ; and some of
them are tremblings, others openings of the earth, others again
lateral displacements,<note n='a'>For <foreign lang='greek'>

displacements.

<p>They maintain that the parts of the world are
arranged thus. The earth is in the middle answering to a centre ;
next comes the water, which is shaped like a sphere all round it,
concentric with the earth, so that the earth is in water. After the
water comes a spherical layer of air. There are five celestial
circles : first, the arctic circle, which is always visible ;
second, the summer tropic ; third, the circle of the equinox ;
fourth, the winter tropic ; and fifth, the antarctic, which is
invisible to us. They are called parallel, because they do not
incline towards one another ; yet they are described round the same
centre.<note n='b'>The <foreign lang='greek'> ke/ntro n</foreign> is
rather an axis (namely, a diameter of the celestial sphere) than a
point.</note> The zodiac is an oblique circle, as it crosses the
parallel circles. 

<milestone unit="section" n="156"/>

And there are five terrestrial zones : first, the
northern zone which is beyond the arctic circle, uninhabitable
because of the cold ; second, a temperate zone ; a third, uninhabitable because of great heats, called the torrid zone ; fourth,
a counter-temperate zone ; fifth, the southern zone, uninhabitable
because of its cold.
</p> <pb n='261'/> 
<p>Nature in their view is an
artistically working fire, going on its way to create ; which is
equivalent to a fiery, creative, or fashioning breath. And the soul
is a nature capable of perception. And they regard it as the breath
of life, congenital with us ; from which they infer first that it is
a body and secondly that it survives death. Yet it is perishable,
though the soul of the universe, of which the individual souls of
animals are parts, is indestructible. 

<milestone unit="section" n="157"/>

Zeno of Citium and
Antipater, in their treatises <hi rend='ital'>De anima</hi>, and
Posidonius define the soul as a warm breath ; for by this we become
animate and this enables us to move. Cleanthes indeed holds that all
souls continue to exist until the general conflagration ; but
Chrysippus says that only the souls of the wise do so.<note
n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Aet. <hi rend='ital'>Plac.</hi> iv.
19. 4 (Arnim, ii. p. 140).</note>
</p> 
<p>They count eight parts of
the soul : the five senses, the generative power in us, our power of
speech, and that of reasoning. They hold that we see when the light
between the visual organ and the object stretches in the form of a
cone : so Chrysippus in the second book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Physics</hi> and Apollodorus. The apex of the cone in
the air is at the eye, the base at the object seen. Thus the thing
seen is reported to us by the medium of the air stretching out
towards it, as if by a stick.
</p> <milestone unit="section" n="158"/>
<p>We hear when the air between
the sonant body and the organ of hearing suffers concussion, a
vibration which spreads spherically and then forms waves and strikes
upon the ears, just as the water in a reservoir forms wavy circles
when a stone is thrown into it. Sleep is caused, they say, by the
slackening of the tension in our senses, which affects the ruling
part of
<pb n='263'/> 
the soul. They consider that the
passions are caused by the variations of the vital breath.
</p>

<p>Semen is by them defined as that which is capable of generating
offspring like the parent. And the human semen which is emitted by a
human parent in a moist vehicle is mingled with parts of the soul,
blended in the same ratio in which they are present in the parent.
<milestone unit="section" n="159"/>

Chrysippus in the second book of his <hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi>
declares it to be in substance identical with vital breath or
spirit. This, he thinks, can be seen from the seeds cast into the
earth, which, if kept till they are old, do not germinate, plainly
because their fertility has evaporated. Sphaerus and his followers
also maintain that semen derives its origin from the whole of the
body ; at all events every part of the body can be reproduced from
it. That of the female is according to them sterile, being, as
Sphaerus says, without tension, scanty, and watery. By ruling part
of the soul is meant that which is most truly soul proper, in which
arise presentations and impulses and from which issues rational
speech. And it has its seat in the heart.

<p>Such is the summary

preserve a due proportion in my work. But the points on which
certain of the Stoics differed from the rest are the
following.

<div2 n="2" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 2. ARISTON (c. 320-250
b.c.)</head> 
<div3 type="section" n="160">
<p>Ariston the Bald, of Chios, who was also called the
Siren, declared the end of action to be a life of perfect
indifference to everything which is neither virtue nor vice ;
recognizing no distinction whatever
<pb n='265'/> 
in things
indifferent, but treating them all alike. The wise man he compared
to a good actor, who, if called upon to take the part of a Thersites
or of an Agamemnon, will impersonate them both becomingly. He
wished to discard both Logic and Physics, saying that Physics was
beyond our reach and Logic did not concern us : all that did concern
us was Ethics.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="161"/>
<p>Dialectical reasonings, he said, are like
spiders' webs, which, though they seem to display some artistic
workmanship, are yet of no use. He would not admit a plurality of
virtues with Zeno, nor again with the Megarians one single virtue
called by many names ; but he treated virtue in accordance with the
category of relative modes. Teaching this sort of philosophy, and
lecturing in the Cynosarges, he acquired such influence as to be
called the founder of a sect. At any rate Miltiades and Diphilus
were denominated Aristoneans. He was a plausible speaker and suited
the taste of the general public. Hence Timon's verse about him<note
n='a'>Frag. 40 D.</note>:
</p> 
<p>One who from wily Ariston's line
boasts his descent.<note n='b'>So Wachsmuth. Diels would prefer :
"deriving winning manners from the wiles of Ariston."</note>
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="162"/>
<p>After meeting Polemo, says Diocles of Magnesia, while Zeno was
suffering from a protracted illness, he recanted his views. The
Stoic doctrine to which he attached most importance was the wise
man's refusal to hold mere opinions. And against this doctrine
Persaeus was contending when he induced one of a pair of twins to
deposit a certain sum with Ariston and afterwards got the other to
reclaim it. Ariston being thus reduced to perplexity was refuted. He
was at variance with Arcesilaus ; and one day when he saw an
abortion in the shape of a bull with
<pb n='267'/> 
a uterus,
he said, "Alas, here Arcesilaus has had given into his hand an
argument against the evidence of the senses."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="163"/>
<p>When some
Academic alleged that he had no certainty of anything, Ariston said,
"Do you not even see your neighbour sitting by you ?" and when the
other answered "No," he rejoined,
</p> 
<p>Who can have blinded you ?
who robbed you of luminous eyesight ?
</p> 
<p>The books attributed to
him are as follows :
</p> 
<p>Exhortations, two books.
</p> 
<p>Of
Zeno's Doctrines.

<div2 n="3" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 3. HERILLUS (flor. c. 260 b.c.)</head>
<div3 type="section" n="165">
<p>Herillus of Carthage declared the end of action to be Knowledge,
that is, so to live always as to make the scientific life the
standard in all things and not to be misled by ignorance. Knowledge
he defined as a habit of mind, not to be upset by argument, in the
acceptance of presentations. Sometimes he used to say there was no
single end of action, but it shifted according to varying
circumstances and objects, as the same bronze might become a statue
either of Alexander or of Socrates. He made a distinction between
end-in-chief and subordinate end : even the unwise may aim at the
latter, but only the wise seek the true end of life. Everything that
lies between virtue and vice he pronounced indifferent. His
writings, though they do not occupy much space, are full of vigour
and contain some controversial passages in reply to Zeno.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="166"/>

<div3 type="section" n="167a">
<p>Dionysius, the
Renegade,<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> &sect; 37.</note> declared
that pleasure was the end of action ; this under the trying circumstance of an attack of ophthalmia. For so violent was his suffering
that he could not bring himself to call pain a thing
indifferent.
</p> 
<p>He was the son of Theophantus and a native of
Heraclea. At first, as Diocles relates, he was a pupil of his
fellow-townsman, Heraclides, next of Alexinus and Menedemus, and
lastly of Zeno.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="167"/>
<p>At the outset of his career he was fond of
literature and tried his hand at all kinds of poetry ; afterwards he
took Aratus<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the author of the
astronomical poem <foreign lang='greek'> *faino/m ena</foreign>, not
the statesman of that name, the protagonist of the Achaean League,
whose Life we have in Plutarch.</note> for his model, whom he strove
to imitate. When he fell away from Zeno, he went over to the
Cyrenaics, and used to frequent houses of ill fame and indulge in
all other excesses without disguise. After living till he was nearly
eighty years of age, he committed suicide by starving himself.
</p>
<pb n='273'/> 
<p>The following works are attributed to him :

<p>Of Apathy, two books

<div2 n="5" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 5. CLEANTHES
(331-232 b.c.)</head> 
<div3 type="section" n="168">
<p>Cleanthes, son of Phanias, was a native of
Assos. This man, says Antisthenes in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions
of Philosophers</hi>, was at first a pugilist. He arrived in Athens,
as some people say, with four drachmas only, and meeting with Zeno
he studied philosophy right nobly and adhered to the same doctrines
throughout. He was renowned for his industry, being indeed driven by
extreme poverty to work for a living. Thus, while by night he used
to draw water in gardens, by day he exercised himself in arguments :
hence the nickname Phreantles or Welllifter was given him. He is
said to have been brought into court to answer the inquiry how so
sturdy a fellow as he made his living, and then to have been
acquitted on producing as his witnesses the gardener in whose garden
he drew water 

<milestone unit="section" n="169"/>

and the woman who sold the meal which he used to
crush. The Areopagites were satisfied and voted him a
</p> <pb
n='275'/> 
<p>donation of ten minas, which Zeno forbade him to
accept. We are also told that Antigonus made him a present of three
thousand drachmas. Once, as he was conducting some youths to a
public spectacle, the wind blew his cloak aside and disclosed the
fact that he wore no shirt, whereupon he was applauded by the
Athenians, as is stated by Demetrius of Magnesia in his work on <hi
rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name.</hi> This then also increased the
admiration felt for him. There is another story that Antigonus when
attending his lectures inquired of him why he drew water and
received the reply, "Is drawing water all I do ? What ? Do I not dig
? What ? Do I not water the garden ? or undertake any other labour
for the love of philosophy ?" For Zeno used to discipline him to
this and bid him return him an obol from his wages.<note n='a'>A
slave allowed by his master to hire himself out to another master

claimed a part of his pupil's earnings.</note> 

<milestone unit="section" n="170"/>

And one day he
produced a handful of small coin before his acquaintance and said,
"Cleanthes could even maintain a second Cleanthes, if he liked,
whereas those who possess the means to keep themselves yet seek to
live at the expense of others, and that too though they have plenty
of time to spare from their studies." Hence Cleanthes was called a
second Heracles. He had industry, but no natural aptitude for
physics, and was extraordinarily slow. On which account Timon
describes him thus<note n='b'>Frag. 41 D.</note> :
</p> 
<p>Who is
this that like a bell-wether ranges over the ranks of men, a
dullard, lover of verse, hailing from Assos,<note n='c'>Diels'
reading <foreign lang='greek'>li/qos</foreign> gives the line a far
better rhythm.</note> a mass of rock, unventuresome.
</p> 
<p>And he
used to put up with gibes from his fellowpupils and did not mind
being called the ass, telling
<pb n='277'/> 
them that he
alone was strong enough to carry the load of Zeno. 

<milestone unit="section" n="171"/>

Once when he was
reproached with cowardice, he replied, "That is why I so seldom go
wrong." Again, when extolling his own manner of life above that of
the wealthy, he used to say that, while they were playing at ball,
he was at work digging hard and barren ground. He would often find
fault with himself too, and one day when Ariston heard him doing
this and asked, "Who is it you are scolding so ?" he, laughing,
said, "An old man with grey hairs and no wits." To some one who
declared that Arcesilaus did not do what he ought, his reply was,
"No more of this ; do not censure him. For if by his words he does
away with duty, he maintains it at all events by his deeds." And
Arcesilaus rejoined, "I am not to be won by flattery." Whereupon
Cleanthes said, "True, but my flattery consists in alleging that
your theory is incompatible with your practice."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="172"/>
<p>When some
one inquired of him what lesson he ought to give his son, Cleanthes
in reply quoted words from the <hi rend='ital'>Electra</hi> :
</p>

<p><hi rend='center'>Silence, silence, light be thy step.<note
n='a'>Eur. <hi rend='ital'>El.</hi> 140.</note></hi>

coxizationes : nempe vocabula quae conveniunt analogia non semper
etiam significatione conveniunt. Once in conversation with a youth
he put the question, "Do you see ?" and when the
<pb n='279'/>

youth nodded assent, he went on, "Why, then, don't I see that you
see ?"
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="173"/>
<p>He was present in the theatre when the poet Sositheus
uttered the verse--
</p>

</p> 
<p>and he remained unmoved in the same
attitude. At which the audience were so astonished that they
applauded him and drove Sositheus off the stage. Afterwards when the
poet apologized for the insult, he accepted the apology, saying
that, when Dionysus and Heracles were ridiculed by the poets without
getting angry, it would be absurd for him to be annoyed at casual
abuse. He used to say that the Peripatetics were in the same case as
lyres which, although they give forth sweet sounds, never hear
themselves. It is said that when he laid it down as Zeno's opinion
that a man's character could be known from his looks, certain witty
young men brought before him a rake with hands horny from toil in
the country and requested him to state what the man's character was.
Cleanthes was perplexed and ordered the man to go away ; but when,
as he was making off, he sneezed, "I have it," cried Cleanthes, "he
is effeminate." 

<milestone unit="section" n="174"/>

To the solitary man who talked to himself he
remarked, "You are not talking to a bad man." When some one twitted
him on his old age, his reply was, "I too am ready to depart ; but
when again I consider that I am in all points in good health and
that I can still write and read, I am content to wait." We are told
that he wrote down Zeno's lectures on oyster-shells and the
blade-bones of oxen through lack of money to buy paper. Such was he
; and yet, although Zeno
<pb n='281'/> 
had many other eminent
disciples, he was able to succeed him in the headship of the
school.

<p>His end was as follows. He had severe
inflammation of the gums, and by the advice of his doctors he
abstained from food for two whole days. As it happened, this
treatment succeeded, so that the doctors were for allowing him to
resume his usual diet. To this, however, he would not consent, but
declaring that he had already got too far on the road, he went on
fasting the rest of his days until his death at the same age as Zeno

Sphaerus was taken in and the king cried out, "You have given your
assent to a presentation which is false." But Sphaerus was ready
with a neat answer. "I assented not to the proposition that they are
pomegranates, but to another, that there are good grounds for
thinking them to be pomegranates. Certainty of presentation and
reasonable probability are two totally different things." Mnesistratus having accused him of denying that Ptolemy was a king, his
reply was, "Being of such quality as he is, Ptolemy is indeed a
king."

CHRYSIPPUS (c. 282-206 B.C.)</head> 

<div3 type="section" n="179">
<p>Chrysippus, the son of
Apollonius, came either from Soli or from Tarsus, as Alexander
relates in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions.</hi> He was a pupil of
Cleanthes. Before this he used to practise as a long-distance runner
;
<pb n='289'/> 
but afterwards he came to hear Zeno, or, as
Diocles and most people say, Cleanthes ; and then, while Cleanthes
was still living, withdrew from his school and attained exceptional
eminence as a philosopher. He had good natural parts and showed the
greatest acuteness in every branch of the subject ; so much so that
he differed on most points from Zeno, and from Cleanthes as well, to
whom he often used to say that all he wanted was to be told what the
doctrines were ; he would find out the proofs for himself.
Nevertheless, whenever he had contended against Cleanthes, he would
afterwards feel remorse, so that he constantly came out with the
lines<note n='a'>Eur. <hi rend='ital'>Or.</hi> 540-1.</note> :
</p>

<p>Blest in all else am I, save only where
</p> 
<p>I touch Cleanthes
: there I am ill-fortuned.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="180"/>
<p>So renowned was he for dialectic
that most people thought, if the gods took to dialectic, they would
adopt no other system than that of Chrysippus. He had abundance of
matter, but in style he was not successful. In industry he surpassed
every one, as the list of his writings shows ; for there are more
than 705 of them. He increased their number by arguing repeatedly on
the same subject, setting down anything that occurred to him, making
many corrections and citing numerous authorities. So much so that in
one of his treatises he copied out nearly the whole of Euripides'
<hi rend='ital'>Medea</hi>, and some one who had taken up the
volume, being asked what he was reading, replied, "The <hi
rend='ital'>Medea</hi> of Chrysippus."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="181"/>
<p>Apollodorus of Athens
in his <hi rend='ital'>Collection of Doctrines</hi>, wishing to show
that what Epicurus wrote with force and originality unaided by
quotations was far greater in amount than the books of Chrysippus,
says, to
<pb n='291'/> 
quote his exact words, "If one were to
strip the books of Chrysippus of all extraneous quotations, his
pages would be left bare." So much for Apollodorus. Of Chrysippus
the old woman who sat beside him used to say, according to Diocles,
that he wrote 500 lines a day. Hecato says that he came to the study
of philosophy, because the property which he had inherited from
his father had been confiscated to the king's treasury.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="182"/>
<p>In
person he was insignificant, as is shown by the statue in the
Ceramicus, which is almost hidden by an equestrian statue hard by ;
and this is why Carneades called him Crypsippus or Horse-hidden.
Once when somebody reproached him for not going with the multitude
to hear Ariston, he rejoined, "If I had followed the multitude, I
should not have studied philosophy." When some dialectician got up
and attacked Cleanthes, proposing sophistical fallacies to him,
Chrysippus called to him, "Cease to distract your elder from matters
of importance ; propound such quibbles to us juniors." Again, when
somebody who had a question to ask was steadily conversing with him
in private, and then upon seeing a crowd approaching began to be
more contentious, he said :
</p> 
<p>Ah! brother mine, thine eye is
growing wild :
</p> 
<p>To madness fast thou'rt changing, sane but
now.<note n='a'>Eur. <hi rend='ital'>Or.</hi> 253.</note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="183"/>
<p>At
wine-parties he used to behave quietly, though he was unsteady on
his legs ; which caused the woman-slave to say, "As for Chrysippus,
only his legs get tipsy." His opinion of himself was so high that
when some one inquired, "To whom shall I entrust my son ?" he
replied, "To me : for, if I had dreamt of there being anyone better
than
<pb n='293'/> 
myself, I should myself be studying with
him." Hence, it is said, the application to him of the line<note
n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Od.</hi> x. 495.</note> :
</p> 
<p>He alone has
understanding ; the others flit shadow-like around ;
</p> 
<p>and
</p>

<p><hi rend='center'>But for Chrysippus, there had been no
Porch.</hi>
</p> 
<p>At last, however,--so we are told by Sotion in
his eighth book,--he joined Arcesilaus and Lacydes and studied
philosophy under them in the Academy. 

<milestone unit="section" n="184"/>

And this explains his arguing
at one time against, and at another in support of, ordinary
experience, and his use of the method of the Academy when treating
of magnitudes and numbers.
</p> 
<p>On one occasion, as Hermippus
relates, when he had his school in the Odeum, he was invited by his
pupils to a sacrificial feast. There after he had taken a draught of
sweet wine unmixed with water, he was seized with dizziness and
departed this life five days afterwards, having reached the age of
seventy-three years, in the 143rd Olympiad.<note n='b'>208-204
b.c.</note> This is the date given by Apollodorus in his <hi
rend='ital'>Chronology.</hi> I have toyed with the subject in the
following verses<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii.
706.</note> :
</p> 
<p>Chrysippus turned giddy after gulping down a
draught of Bacchus ; he spared not the Porch nor his country nor his
own life, but fared straight to the house of Hades.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="185"/>
<p>Another
account is that his death was caused by a violent fit of laughter ;
for after an ass had eaten up his figs, he cried out to the old
woman, "Now give the ass a drink of pure wine to wash down the
figs." And thereupon he laughed so heartily that he died.
</p> <pb
n='295'/> 
<p>He appears to have been a very arrogant man.<note
n='a'>In &sect;&sect; 185-189; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Wilamowitz,<hi
rend='ital'>Antig. von K.</hi>pp. 104<hi
rend='ital'>sq.</hi></note>At any rate, of all his many writings he
dedicated none to any of the kings. And he was satisfied with one
old woman's judgement, says Demetrius in his work called <hi
rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name.</hi> When Ptolemy wrote to
Cleanthes requesting him to come himself or else to send some one to
his court, Sphaerus undertook the journey, while Chrysippus declined
to go. On the other hand, he sent for his sister's sons, Aristocreon
and Philocrates, and educated them. Demetrius above mentioned is
also our authority for the statement that Chrysippus was the first
who ventured to hold a lecture-class in the open air in the
Lyceum.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="186"/>
<p>There was another Chrysippus, a native of Cnidus, a
physician,<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> viii. 89-90, and note
<hi rend='ital'>ad loc.</hi> ; also Pliny, <hi rend='ital'>N.H.</hi>
xxix. 5.</note> to whom Erasistratus says that he was under great
obligation. And another besides, a son<note n='c'>Or perhaps a
grandson, as Wilamowitz suggests, <hi rend='ital'>Antig. von
Kar.</hi> p. 326.</note> of the former, court-physician to Ptolemy,
who on a false charge was dragged about and castigated with the
lash. And yet another was a pupil of Erasistratus, and another the
author of a work on <hi rend='ital'>Agriculture.</hi>
</p> 
<p>To
return to the philosopher. He used to propound arguments such as
the following : "He who divulges the mysteries to the uninitiated is
guilty of impiety. Now the hierophant certainly does reveal the
mysteries to the uninitiated, <hi rend='ital'>ergo</hi> he is guilty
of impiety."<note n='d'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. supr.</hi> ii.
101.</note> Or again : "What is not in the city is not in the house
either : now there is no well in the city, <hi rend='ital'>ergo</hi>
there is none in the house either." Yet another : "There is a
certain head, and that head you have not. Now this being so, there
is a head which you have not, therefore you are without a head."

<milestone unit="section" n="187"/>
Again : "If anyone is in Megara, he is not in Athens : now there is
a man in Megara,
<pb n='297'/> 
therefore there is not a man
in Athens." Again : "If you say something, it passes through your
lips : now you say wagon, consequently a wagon passes through your
lips." And further : "If you never lost something, you have it still
; but you never lost horns, <hi rend='ital'>ergo</hi> you have
horns." Others attribute this to Eubulides.
</p> 
<p>There are people
who run Chrysippus down as having written much in a tone that is
gross and indecent. For in his work <hi rend='ital'>On the ancient
Natural Philosophers</hi> at line 600 or thereabouts he interprets
the story of Hera and Zeus coarsely, with details which no one would
soil his lips by repeating. 

<milestone unit="section" n="188"/>

Indeed, his interpretation of the story
is condemned as most indecent. He may be commending physical doctrine ; but the language used is more appropriate to street-walkers
than to deities ; and it is moreover not even mentioned by
bibliographers, who wrote on the titles of books. What Chrysippus
makes of it is not to be found in Polemo nor Hypsicrates, no, nor
even in Antigonus. It is his own invention. Again, in his <hi
rend='ital'>Republic</hi> he permits marriage with mothers and
daughters and sons. He says the same in his work <hi rend='ital'>On
Things for their own Sake not Desirable</hi>, right at the outset.
In the third book of his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Justice</hi>,
at about line 1000, he permits eating of the corpses of the dead.
And in the second book of his <hi rend='ital'>On the Means of
Livelihood</hi>, where he professes to be considering <hi
rend='ital'>a priori</hi> how the wise man is to get his living,
occur the words : 

<milestone unit="section" n="189"/>

"And yet what reason is there that he should
provide a living ? For if it be to support life, life itself is
after all a thing indifferent. If it be for pleasure, pleasure too
is a thing indifferent. While if it be for virtue, virtue in itself
is sufficient
<pb n='299'/> 
to constitute happiness. The
modes of getting a livelihood are also ludicrous, as <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> maintenance by a king ; for he will have to be
humoured : or by friends ; for friendship will then be purchasable
for money : or living by wisdom ; for so wisdom will become
mercenary." These are the objections urged against him.

<p>Having now completed our

favours the connexion with Phoenicia, so that the boy Pythagoras was
instructed there by Chaldaeans before, on his return to Samos, he
enjoyed the instruction of Pherecydes of Syros and of Hermodainas of
Samos.</note> son of the gem-engraver Mnesarchus, and according to
Hermippus, a Samian, or, according to Aristoxenus, a Tyrrhenian from
one of those islands which the Athenians held after clearing them of
their Tyrrhenian inhabitants. Some indeed say that he was descended
through Euthyphro, Hippasus and Marmacus from Cleonymus, who was
exiled from Phlius, and that, as Marmacus lived in Samos, so
Pythagoras was called a Samian. 

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>

From Samos he went, it is said, to
Lesbos with an introduction to Pherecydes from his uncle Zo&iuml;lus. He
had three silver flagons made and took them as presents to each of
the priests of Egypt. He had brothers, of whom Eunomus was the elder
and Tyrrhenus the second ; he also had a slave, Zamolxis, who is
worshipped, so says Herodotus,<note n='b'>iv. 93 <hi
rend='ital'>sq.</hi></note> by the Getans,
<pb n='323'/> 
as
Cronos. He was a pupil, as already stated, of Pherecydes of Syros,
after whose death he went to Samos to be the pupil of Hermodamas,
Creophylus's descendant, a man already advanced in years. While
still young, so eager was he for knowledge, he left his own country
and had himself initiated into all the mysteries and rites not only
of Greece but also of foreign countries. 

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>

Now he was in Egypt when
Polycrates sent him a letter of introduction to Amasis ; he learnt
the Egyptian language, so we learn from Antiphon in his book <hi
rend='ital'>On Men of Outstanding Merit</hi>, and he also
journeyed among the Chaldaeans and Magi. Then while in Crete he went
down into the cave of Ida with Epimenides ; he also entered the
Egyptian sanctuaries,<note n='a'>Compare Clement Alex. <hi

was told their secret lore concerning the gods. After that he
returned to Samos to find his country under the tyranny of
Polycrates ; so he sailed away to Croton in Italy, and there he laid
down a constitution for the Italian Greeks, and he and his followers
were held in great estimation ; for, being nearly three hundred in
number, so well did they govern the state that its constitution was
in effect a true aristocracy (government by the best).
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
<p>This
is what Heraclides of Pontus tells us he used to say about himself :
that he had once been Aethalides and was accounted to be Hermes'
son, and Hermes told him he might choose any gift he liked except
immortality ; so he asked to retain through life and through death a
memory of his experiences. Hence in life he could recall everything,
and when he died he still kept the
<pb n='325'/> 
same
memories. Afterwards in course of time his soul entered into
Euphorbus and he was wounded by Menelaus. Now Euphorbus used to say
that he had once been Aethalides and obtained this gift from Hermes,
and then he told of the wanderings of his soul, how it migrated
hither and thither, into how many plants and animals it had come,
and all that it underwent in Hades, and all that the other souls
there have to endure. 

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>

When Euphorbus died, his soul passed into
Hermotimus, and he also, wishing to authenticate the story, went up
to the temple of Apollo at Branchidae, where he identified the
shield which Menelaus, on his voyage home from Troy, had dedicated
to Apollo, so he said : the shield being now so rotten through and
through that the ivory facing only was left. When Hermotimus died,
he became Pyrrhus, a fisherman of Delos, and again he remembered
everything, how he was first Aethalides, then Euphorbus, then
Hermotimus, and then Pyrrhus. But when Pyrrhus died, he became
Pythagoras, and still remembered all the facts mentioned.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
<p>There are some who insist, absurdly enough, that Pythagoras left
no writings whatever. At all events Heraclitus, the physicist,<note
n='a'>Fr. 129 D., 17 B.</note> almost shouts in our ear,
"Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practised inquiry beyond all other
men, and in this selection of his writings made himself a wisdom of
his own, showing much learning but poor workmanship." The occasion
of this remark was the opening words of Pythagoras's treatise <hi
rend='ital'>On Nature</hi>, namely, "Nay, I swear by the air I
breathe, I swear by the water I drink, I will never suffer censure
on account of this
<pb n='327'/> 
work." Pythagoras in fact
wrote three books. <hi rend='ital'>On Education, On
Statesmanship</hi>, and <hi rend='ital'>On Nature.</hi> 

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>

But the book
which passes as the work of Pythagoras is by Lysis of Tarentum, a
Pythagorean, who fled to Thebes and taught Epaminondas.<note
n='a'>&sect;&sect; 6-7 <foreign lang='greek'>e)/nioi me\n kaqhgh same/no u.</foreign>
Hesychius in Suidas (<hi rend='ital'>s.v.</hi>), an authority older
than Schol. Plat. 600 B, proves that this passage is a coherent
whole. The fragment of Heraclitus (B 129 Diels, 17 Byw.) is
certainly genuine. There may be, in <foreign lang='greek'> i(stori/
hn,</foreign> an allusion to the study of mensuration in Egypt. The
pretended explanation, "he spoke thus because . . ." introduces an
extract from a work which, like all those attributed to Pythagoras,
must have been a late forgery.</note> Heraclides, the son of
Serapion, in his <hi rend='ital'>Epitome of Sotion</hi>, says that
he also wrote a poem <hi rend='ital'>On the Universe</hi>, and
secondly the <hi rend='ital'>Sacred Poem</hi> which begins :
</p>

<p>Young men, come reverence in quietude
</p> 
<p>All these my words
;
</p> 
<p>thirdly <hi rend='ital'>On the Soul</hi>, fourthly <hi
rend='ital'>Of Piety</hi>, fifthly <hi rend='ital'>Helothales the
Father of Epicharmus of Cos</hi>, sixthly <hi

says that the poem <hi rend='ital'>On the Mysteries</hi> was written
by Hippasus to defame Pythagoras, and that many others written by
Aston of Croton were ascribed to Pythagoras. 

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>

Aristoxenus says that
Pythagoras got most of his moral doctrines from the Delphic
priestess Themistoclea. According to Ion of Chios in his <hi
rend='ital'>Triagmi</hi> he ascribed some poems of his own making to
Orpheus.<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>F.H.G.</hi> Fr. 12, ii. p. 49.

attribute to him the <hi rend='ital'>Scopiads</hi> which begins thus
:
</p> 
<p><hi rend='center'>Be not shameless, before any

</p> 
<p>Sosicrates in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions of
Philosophers</hi> says that, when Leon the tyrant of Phlius asked
him who he was, he said, "A philosopher,"<note n='c'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> i. 12, whence it would seem that Sosicrates
used Heraclides of Pontus as his authority for this anecdote.</note>
and that he compared life to the Great Games, where some went
to
<pb n='329'/> 
compete for the prize and others went with
wares to sell, but the best as spectators ; for similarly, in life,
some grow up with servile natures, greedy for fame and gain, but the
philosopher seeks for truth. Thus much for this part of the
subject.

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
<p>The contents in general of the aforesaid three
treatises of Pythagoras are as follows. He forbids us to pray for
ourselves, because we do not know what will help us. Drinking he
calls, in a word, a snare, and he discountenances all excess, saying
that no one should go beyond due proportion either in drinking or in
eating. Of sexual indulgence, too, he says, "Keep to the winter for
sexual pleasures, in summer abstain ; they are less harmful in
autumn and spring, but they are always harmful and not conducive to
health." Asked once when a man should consort with a woman, he
replied, "When you want to lose what strength you have."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>
<p>He
divides man's life into four quarters thus : "Twenty years a boy,
twenty years a youth, twenty years a young man, twenty years an old
man ; and these four periods correspond to the four seasons, the boy
to spring, the youth to summer, the young man to autumn, and the old
man to winter," meaning by youth one not yet grown up and by a young
man a man of mature age. According to Timaeus, he was the first to
say, "Friends have all things in common" and "Friendship is
equality" ; indeed, his disciples did put all their possessions into
one common stock. For five whole years they had to keep silence,
merely listening to his discourses without seeing him, <note
n='a'>Because he lectured at night ;<hi
rend='ital'>cf.</hi>&sect; 15<foreign lang='greek'> nukter inh\ a)kro/as1
is.</foreign></note> until they passed an examination, and
thenceforward they were admitted to his house and allowed to see
him. They would never
<pb n='331'/> 
use coffins of cypress,
because the sceptre of Zeus was made from it, so we are informed by
Hermippus in his second book <hi rend='ital'>On Pythagoras.</hi>
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>
<p>Indeed, his bearing is said to have been most dignified, and his
disciples held the opinion about him that he was Apollo come down
from the far north. There is a story that once, when he was
disrobed, his thigh was seen to be of gold ; and when he crossed the
river Nessus, quite a number of people said they heard it welcome
him. According to Timaeus in the tenth book of his <hi
rend='ital'>History</hi>, he remarked that the consorts of men bore
divine names, being called first Virgins, then Brides, and then
Mothers.<note n='a'>The allusion is to the Nymphs and the heavenly
pair, mother and daughter (Demeter and Persephone).</note> He it was
who brought geometry to perfection, while it was Moeris who first
discovered the beginnings of the elements of geometry : Anticlides
in his second book <hi rend='ital'>On Alexander</hi><note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Scriptorum Alex. ill. fr.</hi> p. 147.</note> affirms
this, 

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>

and further that Pythagoras spent most of his time upon the
arithmetical aspect of geometry ; he also discovered the musical
intervals on the monochord. Nor did he neglect even medicine. We are
told by Apollodorus the calculator that he offered a sacrifice of
oxen on finding that in a right-angled triangle the square on the
hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right
angle. And there is an epigram running as follows<note n='c'><hi
rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 119.</note> :
</p> 
<p>What time
Pythagoras that famed figure found,
</p> 
<p>For which the noble
offering he brought.
</p> 
<p>He is also said to have been the first
to diet athletes on meat, trying first with Eurymenes<note n='d'>The
story of Eurymenes was known to Porphyry, <hi rend='ital'>Vit.
Pyth.</hi> 18. We can still see how these quotations made by D. L.
himself from Favorinus disturb the context.</note>-- so we learn
from Favorinus in the third book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Memorabilia</hi>--whereas in former times they had

<pb n='333'/> 
trained on dried figs, on butter,<note n='a'>Or
rather "soft cheese";<hi rend='ital'>cf. supra</hi>,i. &sect; 7,
note.</note> and even on wheatmeal, as we are told by the same
Favorinus in the eighth book of his <hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous
History.</hi> 

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>

Some say it was a certain trainer named Pythagoras who
instituted this diet,<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>
Iamblichus, <hi rend='ital'>Vit. Pyth.</hi> 25, and Porphyry, <hi
rend='ital'>De abstinentia</hi>, i. 26.</note> and not our
Pythagoras, who forbade even the killing, let alone the eating, of
animals which share with us the privilege of having a soul. This was
the excuse put forward ; but his real reason for forbidding animal
diet was to practise people and accustom them to simplicity of life,
so that they could live on things easily procurable, spreading their
tables with uncooked foods and drinking pure water only, for this
was the way to a healthy body and a keen mind. Of course the only
altar at which he worshipped was that of Apollo the Giver of Life,
behind the Altar of Horns at Delos, for thereon were placed flour
and meal and cakes, without the use of fire, and there was no animal
victim, as we are told by Aristotle in his <hi
rend='ital'>Constitution of Delos.</hi>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>
<p>He was the first,
they say, to declare that the soul, bound now in this creature, now
in that, thus goes on a round ordained of necessity. He too,
according to Aristoxenus the musician, was the first to introduce
weights and measures into Greece. It was he who first declared that
the Evening and Morning Stars are the same, as Parmenides maintains.<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. inf.</hi> ix. 23.</note> So
greatly was he admired that his disciples used to be called
"prophets to declare the voice of God," besides which he himself
says in a written work that "after two hundred and seven years in
Hades he has returned to the land of the living." Thus it was that
they remained his staunch adherents,
<pb n='335'/> 
and men
came to hear his words from afar, among them Lucanians, Peucetians,
Messapians and Romans.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>
<p>Down to the time of Philolaus it was
not possible to acquire knowledge of any Pythagorean doctrine, and
Philolaus alone brought out those three celebrated books which Plato
sent a hundred minas to purchase. Not less than six hundred persons
went to his evening lectures ; and those who were privileged to see
him wrote to their friends congratulating themselves on a great
piece of good fortune. Moreover, the Metapontines named his house
the Temple of Demeter and his porch the Museum, so we learn from
Favorinus in his <hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History.</hi><note
n='a'>See, however, Porphyry, <hi rend='ital'>Vit. Pyth.</hi> 4, who
cites as his authority Timaeus the Sicilian historian (<hi
rend='ital'>F.H.G.</hi> i. p. 211, Fr. 78), who was not improbably
the source used by Favorinus.</note> And the rest of the
Pythagoreans used to say that not all his doctrines were for all men
to hear, our authority for this being Aristoxenus in the tenth book
of his <hi rend='ital'>Rules of Pedagogy</hi>, 

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>

where we are also
told that one of the school, Xenophilus by name, asked by some one
how he could best educate his son, replied, "By making him the
citizen of a well-governed state." Throughout Italy Pythagoras made
many into good men and true, men too of note like the lawgivers
Zaleucus and Charondas ; for he had a great gift for friendship, and
especially, when he found his own watchwords adopted by anyone, he
would immediately take to that man and make a friend of him.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>
<p>The following were his watchwords or precepts : don't stir the
fire with a knife, don't step over the beam of a balance, don't sit
down on your bushel,<note n='b'>The <foreign lang='greek'>
xoi=nic</foreign> was about a <hi rend='ital'>quart</hi>, in dry
measure.</note> don't eat your heart, don't help a man off with a
load but help him on, always roll your bed-clothes up, don't put
God's image on the circle of a ring, don't leave the pan's imprint
on the ashes, don't wipe up
<pb n='337'/> 
a mess with a
torch, don't commit a nuisance towards the sun, don't walk the
highway, don't shake hands too eagerly, don't have swallows under
your own roof, don't keep birds with hooked claws, don't make water
on nor stand upon your nail-and hair-trimmings, turn the sharp blade
away, when you go abroad don't turn round at the frontier.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
<p>This is what they meant. Don't stir the fire with a knife : don't
stir the passions or the swelling pride of the great. Don't step
over the beam of a balance : don't overstep the bounds of equity and
justice. Don't sit down on your bushel : have the same care of
to-day and the future, a bushel being the day's ration. By not
eating your heart he meant not wasting your life in troubles and
pains. By saying do not turn round when you go abroad, he meant to
advise those who are departing this life not to set their hearts'
desire on living nor to be too much attracted by the pleasures of
this life. The explanations of the rest are similar and would take
too long to set out.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="19"/>
<p>Above all, he forbade as food red mullet
and blacktail, and he enjoined abstinence from the hearts of animals
and from beans, and sometimes, according to Aristotle, even from
paunch and gurnard. Some say that he contented himself with just
some honey or a honeycomb or bread, never touching wine in the
daytime, and with greens boiled or raw for dainties, and fish but
rarely. His robe was white and spotless, his quilts of white wool,
for linen had not yet reached those parts. He was never known to
over-eat, to behave loosely, or to be drunk. 

<milestone unit="section" n="20"/>

He would avoid laughter
and all pandering to tastes such as in-
<pb n='339'/> 
sulting
jests and vulgar tales. He would punish neither slave nor free man
in anger. Admonition he used to call "setting right." He used to
practise divination by sounds or voices and by auguries, never by
burnt-offerings, beyond frankincense. The offerings he made were
always inanimate ; though some say that he would offer cocks,
sucking goats and porkers, as they are called, but lambs never. However, Aristoxenus has it that he consented to the eating of all
other animals, and only abstained from ploughing oxen and rams.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="21"/>
<p>The same authority, as we have seen, asserts that Pythagoras took
his doctrines from the Delphic priestess Themistoclea. Hieronymus,
however, says that, when he had descended into Hades, he saw the
soul of Hesiod bound fast to a brazen pillar and gibbering, and the
soul of Homer hung on a tree with serpents writhing about it, this
being their punishment for what they had said about the gods ; he
also saw under torture those who would not remain faithful to their
wives. This, says our authority, is why he was honoured by the
people of Croton. Aristippus of Cyrene affirms in his work <hi
rend='ital'>On the Physicists</hi> that he was named Pythagoras
because he uttered the truth as infallibly as did the Pythian
oracle.<note n='a'>The word <foreign lang='greek'> *puqago/

<p>He is said to have advised his
disciples as follows : Always to say on entering their own doors
:
</p> 
<p>Where did I trespass? What did I achieve?
</p> 
<p>And
unfulfilled what duties did I leave?
</p> 
<p>Not to let victims be
brought for sacrifice to the gods, and to worship only at the altar
unstained with blood. Not to call the gods to witness, man's duty
being rather to strive to make his own word carry
<pb n='341'/>

conviction. To honour their elders, on the principle that
precedence in time gives a greater title to respect ; for as in the
world sunrise comes before sunset, so in human life the beginning
before the end, and in all organic life birth precedes death.

<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>

And he
further bade them to honour gods before demi-gods, heroes before
men, and first among men their parents ; and so to behave one to
another as not to make friends into enemies, but to turn enemies
into friends. To deem nothing their own. To support the law, to wage
war on lawlessness. Never to kill or injure trees that are not wild,
nor even any animal that does not injure man. That it is seemly and
advisable neither to give way to unbridled laughter nor to wear
sullen looks. To avoid excess of flesh, on a journey to let exertion
and slackening alternate, to train the memory, in wrath to restrain
hand and tongue, to respect all divination, 

<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>

to sing to the lyre and
by hymns to show due gratitude to gods and to good men. To abstain
from beans because they are flatulent and partake most of the breath
of life ; and besides, it is better for the stomach if they are not
taken, and this again will make our dreams in sleep smooth and
untroubled.
</p> 
<p>Alexander in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions of
Philosophers</hi> says that he found in the Pythagorean memoirs the
following tenets as well.<note n='a'>For the doctrines of

Introd. pp. xxvi, xxvii) This indefatigable pedant is known to have

have possessed this work by Alexander, but he probably had access to
a public library containing it. In any case he deserves praise for
the selection. Between Alexander Polyhistor in the first century
b.c. and the threshold of the third century a.d. there had been an
enormous increase in neoPythagorean literature, mostly dealing
with mystical properties of numbers and with ethics based upon
theology. All this D. L. ignores, going back to a Hellenistic
document long forgotten.</note>

cold, winter; if dry, spring; if moist, late autumn. If all are in
equilibrium, we have the best periods of the year, of which the
freshness of spring constitutes the healthy season, and the decay of
late autumn the unhealthy. So too, in the day, freshness belongs to
the morning, and decay to the evening, which is therefore more
unhealthy. The air about the earth is stagnant and unwholesome, and
all within it is mortal; but the uppermost air is ever-moved and
pure and healthy, and all within it is immortal and consequently
divine.

The sun, the moon, and the other stars are gods; for, in
them, there is a preponderance of heat, and heat is the cause of
life. The moon is illumined by the sun. Gods and men are akin,
inasmuch as man partakes of heat ; therefore God takes thought for
man. Fate is the cause of things being thus ordered both as a whole
and separately. The sun's ray penetrates through the
</p> <pb
n='345'/> 
<p>aether, whether cold or dense--the air they call cold
aether, and the sea and moisture dense aether --and this ray
descends even to the depths and for this reason quickens all things.

<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>
All things live which partake of heat--this is why plants are living
things --but all have not soul, which is a detached part of aether,
partly the hot and partly the cold, for it partakes of cold aether
too. Soul is distinct from life; it is immortal, since that from
which it is detached is immortal. Living creatures are reproduced
from one another by germination; there is no such thing as
spontaneous generation from earth. The germ is a clot of brain
containing hot vapour within it; and this, when brought to the womb,
throws out, from the brain, ichor, fluid and blood, whence are
formed flesh, sinews, bones, hairs, and the whole of the body, while
soul and sense come from the vapour within.

First congealing in
about forty days, it receives form and, according to the ratios of
"harmony," in seven, nine, or at the most ten, months, the mature
child is brought forth. It has in it all the relations constituting
life, and these, forming a continuous series, keep it together
according to the ratios of harmony, each appearing at regulated
intervals. Sense generally, and sight in particular, is a certain
unusually hot vapour. This is why it is said to see through air and
water, because the hot aether is resisted by the cold; for, if the
vapour in the eyes had been cold, it would have been dissipated on
meeting the air, its like. As it is, in certain [lines] he calls the
eyes the portals of
<pb n='347'/> 
the sun. His conclusion is
the same with regard to hearing and the other senses.

<p>The
soul of man, he says, is divided into three parts, intelligence,
reason, and passion. Intelligence and passion are possessed by other
animals as well, but reason by man alone. The seat of the soul
extends from the heart to the brain; the part of it which is in the
heart is passion, while the parts located in the brain are reason
and intelligence. The senses are distillations from these. Reason is
immortal, all else mortal. The soul draws nourishment from the
blood; the faculties<note n='a'>The word <foreign lang='greek'>
lo/gous</foreign> is translated above by "ratios," <hi
rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> proportionalities. With <foreign lang='greek'>

soul are winds, for they as well as the soul are invisible, just as
the aether is invisible. 

<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>

The veins, arteries, and sinews are the
bonds of the soul. But when it is strong and settled down into
itself, reasonings and deeds become its bonds. When cast out upon
the earth, it wanders in the air like the body. Hermes is the
steward of souls, and for that reason is called Hermes the Escorter,
Hermes the Keeper of the Gate, and Hermes of the Underworld, since
it is he who brings in the souls from their bodies both by land and
sea ; and the pure are taken into the uppermost region, but the
impure are not permitted to approach the pure or each other, but are
bound by the Furies in bonds unbreakable.

signs of future disease and health, and not to men alone, but to

<pb n='349'/> 
sheep also and cattle as well; and it is to them
that purifications and lustrations, all divination, omens and the
like, have reference. The most momentous thing in human life is the
art of winning the soul to good or to evil. Blest are the men who
acquire a good soul; [if it be bad] they can never be at rest, nor
ever keep the same course two days together.

<p>Right has the
force of an oath, and that is why Zeus is called the God of Oaths.
Virtue is harmony, and so are health and all good and God himself;
this is why they say that all things are constructed according to
the laws of harmony. The love of friends is just concord and
equality. We should not pay equal worship to gods and heroes, but to
the gods always, with reverent silence, in white robes, and after
purification, to the heroes only from midday onwards. Purification
is by cleansing, baptism and lustration, and by keeping clean from
all deaths and births and all pollution, and abstaining from meat
and flesh of animals that have died, mullets, gurnards, eggs and
egg-sprung animals, beans, and the other abstinences prescribed by
those who perform mystic rites in the temples. 

<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>

According to
Aristotle in his work <hi rend='ital'>On the Pythagoreans,</hi>
Pythagoras counselled abstinence from beans either because they are
like the genitals, or because they are like the gates of Hades . . .
as being alone unjointed, or because they are injurious, or because
they are like the form of the universe, or because they belong to
oligarchy, since they are used in election by lot. He bade his
disciples not to pick up fallen crumbs, either in order to accustom
them not to eat immoderately, or because connected with a person's

<p>Another of his precepts was not to
eat white cocks, as being sacred to the Month and wearing suppliant
garb--now supplication ranked with things good-- sacred to the Month
because they announce the time of day ; and again white represents
the nature of the good, black the nature of evil. Not to touch such
fish as were sacred; for it is not right that gods and men should be
allotted the same things, any more than free men and slaves. Not to

barbarians do even to this day ; and you should not divide bread
which brings them together; some give as the explanation of this
that it has reference to the judgement of the dead in Hades, others
that bread makes cowards in war, others again that it is from it

Neanthes.</note> As he sat one day among his acquaintances at the
house of Milo, it chanced that the house was set ablaze out of
jealousy by one of the people who were not accounted worthy of
admittance to his presence, though some say it was the work of the
inhabitants of Croton anxious to safeguard themselves against the
setting-up of a tyranny. Pythagoras was caught as he tried to
escape; he got as far as a certain field of beans, where he stopped,
saying he would be captured rather than cross it, and be killed
rather than prate about his doctrines; and so his pursuers cut his
throat.<note n='b'>This passage, partly in direct (<foreign lang='greek'> geno/me nos, e)/sth, ei)pw/n</foreign>) and partly in

Pyth.</hi> &sect; 61, where the story of Damon and Phintias is said to have
been transferred by Hippobotus and Neanthes to the same trusty pair,
Myllias and Timycha). The story in Iamblichus represents a band of
Pythagoreans pursued by a tyrant's myrmidons and caught in a plain
where beans were growing, all of them preferring to die where they
stood rather than trample on the beans; but this story might be
located anywhere. It has nothing inherently to do with the end of
Pythagoras. What remains, <foreign lang='greek'>to\n de\ *p. kata-

escaped from the burning house but, in despair at the extinction of

they are separated from the sentence about the fire.</note> So also
were murdered
<pb n='357'/> 
more than half of his disciples,
to the number of forty or thereabouts; but a very few escaped,
including Archippus of Tarentum and Lysis, already mentioned.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
<p>Dicaearchus, however, says that Pythagoras died a fugitive in the
temple of the Muses at Metapontum after forty days' starvation.
Heraclides, in his <hi rend='ital'>Epitome of the Lives of
Satyrus,</hi> says that, after burying Pherecydes at Delos, he
returned to Italy and, when he found Cylon of Croton giving a
luxurious banquet to all and sundry, retired to Metapontum to end
his days there by starvation, having no wish to live longer. On the
other hand, Hermippus relates that, when the men of Agrigentum and
Syracuse were at war, Pythagoras and his disciples went out and
fought in the van of the army of the Agrigentines, and, their line
being turned, he was killed by the Syracusans as he was trying to
avoid the beanfield; the rest, about thirty-five in number, were
burned at the stake in Tarentum for trying to set up a government in
opposition to those in power.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
<p>Hermippus gives another
anecdote. Pythagoras, on coming to Italy, made a subterranean
dwelling and enjoined on his mother to mark and record all that
passed, and at what hour, and to send her notes down to him until he
should ascend. She did so. Pythagoras some time afterwards came up
withered and looking like a skeleton, then went into the assembly
and declared he had been down to Hades, and even read out his
experiences to them. They were so affected that they wept and wailed
and looked upon him as divine, going so far as to send
</p> <pb
n='359'/> 
<p>their wives to him in hopes that they would learn some
of his doctrines; and so they were called Pythagorean women. Thus
far Hermippus.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>
<p>Pythagoras had a wife, Theano by name,
daughter of Brontinus of Croton, though some call her Brontinus's
wife and Pythagoras's pupil. He had a daughter Damo, according to
the letter of Lysis to Hippasus, which says of him, "I am told by
many that you discourse publicly, a thing which Pythagoras deemed
unworthy, for certain it is that, when he entrusted his daughter
Damo with the custody of his memoirs, he solemnly charged her never
to give them to anyone outside his house. And, although she could
have sold the writings for a large sum of money, she would not, but
reckoned poverty and her father's solemn injunctions more precious
than gold, for all that she was a woman."
</p>

<p>They also had a son
Telauges, who succeeded his father and, according to some, was

</p> 
<p>Telauges wrote nothing, so far as
we know, but his mother Theano wrote a few things. Further, a story
is told that being asked how many days it was before a woman becomes
pure after intercourse, she replied, "With her own husband at once,
with another man never." And she advised a woman going in to her own
husband to put off her shame with her clothes, and on leaving him to
put it on

<p>To
return to Pythagoras. According to Heraclides, the son of Serapion,
he was eighty years old when he died, and this agrees with his own
description of the life of man, though most authorities say he was
ninety. And there are jesting lines of my own upon him as
follows<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii.

<p>Woe! Woe!
Whence, Pythagoras, this deep reverence for beans? Why did he fall
in the midst of his disciples? A bean-field there was he durst not
cross; sooner than trample on it, he endured to be slain at the
cross-roads by the men of Acragas.

For the last of the

the Thracian Chalcidice, Phanton of Phlius, and Echecrates, Diocles

Eurytus of Tarentum.
</p> 
<p>There were four men of the name of
Pythagoras living about the same time and at no great distance from
one another : (1) of Croton, a man with tyrannical leanings ; (2) of
Phlius, an athlete, some say a trainer ; (3) of Zacynthus ; (4) our
subject, who discovered the secrets of philosophy [and taught them],

Some say there was also another Pythagoras, a
sculptor of Rhegium, who is thought to have been the first to aim at
rhythm and symmetry ; another a sculptor of Samos ; another a bad
orator ; another a doctor who wrote on hernia and also compiled some
things about Homer ; and yet another who, so we are told by
Dionysius, wrote a history of the Dorian race. Eratosthenes says,

the first to box scientifically, in the 48th Olympiad,<note

<p>Further, we are told that he was the first to call the heaven the

<div3 type="section" n="51">
<p>Empedocles was, according to Hippobotus,
the son of Meton and grandson of Empedocles, and was a native of
Agrigentum. This is confirmed by Timaeus in the fifteenth book of
his <hi rend='ital'>Histories</hi>, and he adds that Empedocles, the
poet's grandfather, had been a man of distinction. Hermippus also
agrees with Timaeus. So, too, Heraclides, in his treatise <hi

was of an illustrious family, his grandfather having kept
racehorses. Eratosthenes also in his <hi rend='ital'>Olympic

father of Meton was a victor in the 71st Olympiad.<note n='b'>496

The grammarian Apollodorus in his <hi

<p>Then farther on he
adds :
</p> 
<p>Those who relate that, being exiled from his home, he
went to Syracuse and fought in their ranks against the Athenians
seem, in my judgement at least, to be completely mistaken. For by
that time either he was no longer living or in extreme old age,
which is inconsistent with the story.
</p> 
<p>For Aristotle and
Heraclides both affirm that he died at the age of sixty. The victor
with the ridinghorse in the 71st Olympiad was

Exaenetus and himself left a son named Exaenetus, and that in the

and his son in wrestling, or, as Heraclides<note n='a'><hi

Empedocles feasted the sacred envoys on a sacrificial ox made of
honey and barley-meal, and that he had a brother named
Callicratides. Telauges, the son of Pythagoras, in his letter to
Philolaus calls Empedocles the son of Archinomus.

</p> 
<p>Timaeus in the ninth book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Histories</hi> says he
<pb n='371'/> 
was a pupil
of Pythagoras, adding that, having been convicted at that time of
stealing his discourses, he was, like Plato, excluded from taking
part in the discussions of the school ; and further, that Empedocles himself mentions Pythagoras in the lines<note n='a'>Fr. 129
D.</note>:
</p> 
<p>And there lived among them a man of superhuman
knowledge, who verily possessed the greatest wealth of wisdom.
</p>

<p>Others say that it is to Parmenides that he is here
referring.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
<p>Neanthes states that down to the time of Philolaus
and Empedocles all Pythagoreans were admitted to the discussions.
But when Empedocles himself made them public property by his poem,
they made a law that they should not be imparted to any poet. He
says the same thing also happened to Plato, for he too was
excommunicated. But which of the Pythagoreans it was who had
Empedocles for a pupil he did not say. For the epistle commonly
attributed to Telauges and the statement that Empedocles was the
pupil of both Hippasus and Brontinus he held to be unworthy of
credence.
</p> 
<p>Theophrastus affirms that he was an admirer of
Parmenides and imitated him in his verses, for Parmenides too had
published his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Nature</hi> in verse. 

<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>

But
Hermippus's account is that he was an admirer not so much of
Parmenides as of Xenophanes, with whom in fact he lived and whose
writing of poetry he imitated, and that his meeting with the
Pythagoreans was subsequent. Alcidamas tells us in his treatise on
<hi rend='ital'>Physics</hi> that Zeno and Empedocles were pupils of
Parmenides about the same time, that afterwards they left him, and
that, while Zeno framed his own system, Empedocles became the pupil
of Anaxagoras and Pythagoras,
<pb n='373'/> 
emulating the
latter in dignity of life and bearing, and the former in his
physical investigations.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>
<p>Aristotle in his <hi
rend='ital'>Sophist</hi> calls Empedocles the inventor of rhetoric
as Zeno of dialectic. In his treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Poets</hi>
he says that Empedocles was of Homer's school and powerful in
diction, being great in metaphors and in the use of all other
poetical devices. He also says that he wrote other poems, in
particular the invasion of Xerxes and a hymn to Apollo, which a
sister of his (or, according to Hieronymus, his daughter) afterwards
burnt. The hymn she destroyed unintentionally, but the poem on the
Persian war deliberately, because it was unfinished. 

<milestone unit="section" n="58"/>

And in general
terms he says he wrote both tragedies and political discourses. But
Heraclides, the son of Sarapion, attributes the tragedies to a
different author. Hieronymus declares that he had come across
forty-three of these plays, while Neanthes tells us that Empedocles
wrote these tragedies in his youth, and that he, Neanthes, was
acquainted with seven of them.
</p> 
<p>Satyrus in his <hi
rend='ital'>Lives</hi> says that he was also a physician and an
excellent orator : at all events Gorgias of Leontini, a man
pre-eminent in oratory and the author of a treatise on the art, had
been his pupil. Of Gorgias Apollodorus says in his <hi
rend='ital'>Chronology</hi> that he lived to be one hundred and
nine. 

<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>

Satyrus quotes this same Gorgias as saying that he himself was
present when Empedocles performed magical feats. Nay more : he
contends that Empedocles in his poems lays claim to this power and
to much besides when he says<note n='a'>Fr. 111 D.</note>:
</p> <pb
n='375'/> 
<p>And thou shalt learn all the drugs that are a defence
to ward off ills and old age, since for thee alone shall I accomplish all this. Thou shalt arrest the violence of the unwearied
winds that arise and sweep the earth, laying waste the cornfields
with their blasts ; and again, if thou so will, thou shalt call back
winds in requital. Thou shalt make after the dark rain a seasonable
drought for men, and again after the summer drought thou shalt cause
tree-nourishing streams to pour from the sky. Thou shalt bring back
from Hades a dead man's strength.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="60"/>
<p>Timaeus also in the
eighteenth <note n='a'>According to Beloch this should be the
twelfth book ; <hi rend='ital'>cf. inf.</hi> &sect; 66.</note>book of his
<hi rend='ital'>Histories</hi> remarks that Empedocles has been
admired on many grounds. For instance, when the etesian winds once
began to blow violently and to damage the crops, he ordered asses to
be flayed and bags to be made of their skin. These he stretched out
here and there on the hills and headlands to catch the wind and,
because this checked the wind, he was called the "wind-stayer."
Heraclides in his book <hi rend='ital'>On Diseases</hi><note
n='b'>v. 67.</note> says that he furnished Pausanias with the facts
about the woman in a trance. This Pausanias, according to Aristippus
and Satyrus, was his bosom-friend, to whom he dedicated his poem <hi
rend='ital'>On Nature</hi> thus<note n='c'>Fr. 1 D.</note>:
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>
<p><hi rend='center'>Give ear, Pausanias, thou son of Anchitus the

</p> 
<p>Moreover he wrote an epigram upon him<note

</p> 
<p>The physician Pausanias, rightly so
named, son of Anchitus, descendant of Asclepius, was born and bred
at Gela. Many a wight pining in fell torments did he bring back from
Persephone's inmost shrine.
</p> 
<p>At all events Heraclides
testifies that the case of
<pb n='377'/> 
the woman in a
trance was such that for thirty days he kept her body without
pulsation though she never breathed ; and for that reason Heraclides
called him not merely a physician but a diviner as well, deriving
the titles from the following lines also<note n='a'>Fr. 112
D.</note>:
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>

<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
<p>Timaeus explains that
he called Agrigentum great, inasmuch as it had 800,000
inhabitants.<note n='b'>According to the vulgate, an unknown writer
Potamilla is the authority cited by Diogenes. Diels, however (<hi

their luxury, said, "The Agrigentines live delicately as if tomorrow they would die, but they build their houses well as if they
thought they would live for ever."
</p> 
<p>It is said that Cleomenes
the rhapsode recited this very poem, the <hi

Here again a citation from Favorinus seems to disturb the
context.</note>: so Favorinus in his <hi

been a champion of freedom and averse to rule of every kind, seeing
that, as Xanthus relates
<pb n='379'/> 
in his account of him,
he declined the kingship when it was offered to him, obviously
because he preferred a frugal life.

<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>

With this Timaeus agrees, at the
same time giving the reason why Empedocles favoured democracy,
namely, that, having been invited to dine with one of the
magistrates, when the dinner had gone on some time and no wine was
put on the table, though the other guests kept quiet, he, becoming
indignant, ordered wine to be brought. Then the host confessed that
he was waiting for the servant of the senate to appear. When he came
he was made master of the revels, clearly by the arrangement of the
host, whose design of making himself tyrant was but thinly veiled,
for he ordered the guests either to drink wine or have it poured
over their heads. For the time being Empedocles was reduced to
silence ; the next day he impeached both of them, the host and the
master of the revels, and secured their condemnation and execution.
This, then, was the beginning of his political career.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>
<p>Again,
when Acron the physician asked the council for a site on which to
build a monument to his father, who had been eminent among
physicians, Empedocles came forward and forbade it in a speech where
he enlarged upon equality and in particular put the following
question : "But what inscription shall we put upon it? Shall it be
this?
</p> 
<p>Acron the eminent physician of Agrigentum, son of
Acros, is buried beneath the steep eminence of his most eminent
native city?"<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> v.

<p>Others give as the second line :

<p>Is laid in

to Simonides.
</p> <pb n='381'/> 

<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>
<p>Subsequently Empedocles broke up
the assembly of the Thousand three years after it had been set up,
which proves not only that he was wealthy but that he favoured the
popular cause. At all events Timaeus in his eleventh and twelfth
books (for he mentions him more than once) states that he seems to
have held opposite views when in public life and when writing
poetry.<note n='a'>This emphasis on the political leanings of
Empedocles, backed by the authority of Timaeus, looks strange after
the anecdote, also from Timaeus, of &sect;&sect; 64, 65, nor is it clear that the
attack on the close oligarchical corporation of the Thousand really
took place at a later date (<foreign lang='greek'> u(/stero
n</foreign>). That D. L. is working in two passages of Timaeus, in
the second of which the first is not pre-supposed, is an obvious
suggestion.</note> In some passages one may see that he is
boastful and selfish. At any rate these are his words :<note
n='b'>Fr. 112. 4 D.</note>
</p> 
<p>All hail! I go about among you an
immortal god, no more a mortal, etc.
</p> 
<p>At the time when he
visited Olympia he demanded an excessive deference, so that never
was anyone so talked about in gatherings of friends as Empedocles.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="67"/>
<p>Subsequently, however, when Agrigentum came to regret
him, the descendants of his personal enemies opposed his return home
; and this was why he went to Peloponnesus, where he died. Nor did
Timon let even him alone, but fastens upon him in these words :<note
n='c'>Fr. 42 D.</note>
</p> 
<p>Empedocles, too, mouthing tawdry
verses ; to all that had independent force, he gave a separate
existence ; and the principles he chose need others to explain
them.
</p> 
<p>As to his death different accounts are given.
</p> <pb
n='383'/> 
<p>Thus Heraclides,<note n='a'>In the list of the writings
of Heraclides of Pontus (see v. 86 <hi rend='ital'>sqq.</hi>) occurs
<foreign lang='greek'>*peri\ tw=n e)n a(/|dou,</foreign> a dialogue on a
similar subject, if not actually identical, with <foreign lang='greek'>*peri\ th=s a)/pnou.</foreign> In the latter Pausanias was
one of the characters; see next note.</note> after telling the story
of the woman in a trance, how that Empedocles became famous because
he had sent away the dead woman alive, goes on to say that he was
offering a sacrifice close to the field of Peisianax. Some of his
friends had been invited to the sacrifice, including Pausanias.

<milestone unit="section" n="68"/>

Then, after the feast, the remainder of the company dispersed and
retired to rest, some under the trees in the adjoining field, others
wherever they chose, while Empedocles himself remained on the spot
where he had reclined at table. At daybreak all got up, and he was
the only one missing. A search was made, and they questioned the
servants, who said they did not know where he was. Thereupon someone
said that in the middle of the night he heard an exceedingly loud
voice calling Empedocles. Then he got up and beheld a light in the
heavens and a glitter of lamps, but nothing else. His hearers were
amazed at what had occurred, and Pausanias came down and sent people
to search for him. But later he bade them take no further trouble,
for things beyond expectation had happened to him, and it was their
duty to sacrifice to him since he was now a god.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>
<p>Hermippus
tells us that Empedocles cured Panthea, a woman of Agrigentum, who
had been given up by the physicians, and this was why he was
offering sacrifice, and that those invited were about eighty in
number. Hippobotus, again, asserts that, when he got up, he set out
on his way to Etna ; then, when he had reached it, he plunged into
the fiery craters and disappeared, his intention being to confirm
the report that he had become a god. Afterwards the truth was known,
because
<pb n='385'/> 
one of his slippers was thrown up in
the flames ; it had been his custom to wear slippers of bronze. To
this story Pausanias is made (by Heraclides) to take exception.<note
n='a'><foreign lang='greek'> a)nte/le ge.</foreign> The imperfect
tense is convincing proof that D. L. (or his source) is drawing upon
the dialogue, and not narrating facts as a historian ; D. L. must be
giving a large extract from the dialogue <foreign lang='greek'>*peri\
th=s a)/pnou,</foreign> beginning in the second paragraph of &sect; 67. Only
D. L. has inserted, in &sect; 69, (1) a note from Hermippus and (2) a r&eacute;sum&eacute;
from Hippobotus of the very passage in the dialogue <foreign lang='greek'>*peri\ th=s a)/pnou</foreign> with which D. L. has been
dealing in &sect;&sect; 67-69.</note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
<p>Diodorus of Ephesus, when writing of
Anaximander, declares that Empedocles emulated him, displaying
theatrical arrogance and wearing stately robes. We are told that the
people of Selinus suffered from pestilence owing to the noisome
smells from the river hard by, so that the citizens themselves
perished and their women died in childbirth, that Empedocles
conceived the plan of bringing two neighbouring rivers to the place
at his own expense, and that by this admixture he sweetened the
waters. When in this way the pestilence had been stayed and the
Selinuntines were feasting on the river bank, Empedocles appeared ;
and the company rose up and worshipped and prayed to him as to a
god. It was then to confirm this belief of theirs that he leapt into
the fire. 

<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>

These stories are contradicted by Timaeus, who expressly
says that he left Sicily for Peloponnesus and never returned at all
; and this is the reason Timaeus gives for the fact that the manner
of his death is unknown. He replies to Heraclides, whom he mentions
by name, in his fourteenth book. Pisianax, he says, was a citizen of
Syracuse and possessed no land at Agrigentum. Further, if such a
story had been in circulation, Pausanias would have set up a
monument to his friend, as to a god, in the form of a statue or
shrine, for he was a wealthy man. "How came he," adds Timaeus, "to
leap into the craters, which he had
<pb n='387'/> 
never once
mentioned though they were not far off ? He must then have died in
Peloponnesus. 

<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>

It is not at all surprising that his tomb is not found
; the same is true of many other men." After urging some such
arguments Timaeus goes on to say, "But Heraclides is everywhere just
such a collector of absurdities, telling us, for instance, that a
man dropped down to earth from the moon."
</p> 
<p>Hippobotus assures
us that formerly there was in Agrigentum a statue of Empedocles with
his head covered, and afterwards another with the head uncovered
in front of the Senate House at Rome, which plainly the Romans had
removed to that site. For portrait-statues with inscriptions are
extant even now. Neanthes of Cyzicus, who tells about the
Pythagoreans, relates that, after the death of Meton, the germs of a
tyranny began to show themselves, that then it was Empedocles who
persuaded the Agrigentines to put an end to their factions and
cultivate equality in politics.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>
<p>Moreover, from his abundant
means he bestowed dowries upon many of the maidens of the city who
had no dowry. No doubt it was the same means that enabled him to don
a purple robe and over it a golden girdle, as Favorinus relates in
his <hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia,</hi> and again slippers of bronze
and a Delphic laurel-wreath. He had thick hair, and a train of boy
attendants. He himself was always grave, and kept this gravity of
demeanour unshaken. In such sort would he appear in public ; when
the citizens met him, they recognized in this demeanour the stamp,
as it were, of royalty. But afterwards, as he was going in a
carriage to Messene to attend some festival, he fell and broke his
thigh ; this
<pb n='389'/> 
brought an illness which caused
his death at the age of seventy-seven. Moreover, his tomb is in
Megara.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>
<p>As to his age, Aristotle's account is different, for
he makes him to have been sixty when he died ; while others make him
one hundred and nine. He flourished in the 84th Olympiad.<note
n='a'>444-441 b.c.</note> Demetrius of Troezen in his pamphlet <hi

:
</p> 
<p>He tied a noose that hung aloft from a tall cornel-tree and
thrust his neck into it, and his soul went down to Hades.
</p> 
<p>In
the short letter of Telauges which was mentioned above<note
n='c'>viii. 35.</note> it is stated that by reason of his age he
slipped into the sea and was drowned. Thus and thus much of his
death.
</p> 
<p>There is an epigram of my own on him in my <hi

</p> 
<p>Verily there
is a tale about the death of Empedocles, how that once he fell from

of fire and so took a draught of life, how was it that his tomb was
shown still in Megara ?

<p>Alcmaeon of Croton, another disciple of
Pythagoras, wrote chiefly on medicine, but now and again he touches
on natural philosophy, as when he says, "Most human affairs go in
pairs." He is thought to have been the first to compile a physical
treatise, so we learn from Favorinus in his <hi
rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History</hi> ; and he said that the moon
[and] generally [the heavenly bodies] are in their nature
eternal.
</p> 
<p>He was the son of Pirithous, as he himself tells us
at the beginning of his treatise<note n='c'>Fr. 1 Diels</note> :
"These are the words of Alcmaeon of Croton, son of Pirithous, which
he spake to Brotinus, Leon and Bathyllus : `Of things invisible, as
of mortal things, only the gods have certain knowledge ; but to us,
as men, only inference from evidence is possible,' and so on." He
held also that the soul is immortal and that it is continuously in
motion like the sun.

<p>According to Demetrius

wished to have a tyrant's house."</note>

<p>His doctrine is that

<div3 type="section" n="86">
<p>Eudoxus
of Cnidos, the son of Aeschines, was an astronomer, a geometer, a
physician and a legislator. He learned geometry from Archytas and
medicine from Philistion the Sicilian, as Callimachus tells us in
his <hi rend='ital'>Tables.</hi> Sotion in his <hi
rend='ital'>Successions of Philosophers</hi> says that he was also a
pupil of Plato. When he was about twenty-three years old and in
straitened circumstances, he was attracted by the reputation of the
Socratics and set sail for Athens with Theomedon the physician,
who provided for his wants. Some even say that he was Theomedon's
favourite. Having disembarked at Piraeus he went up every day to
Athens and, when he had attended the Sophists' lectures, returned
again to the port. 

<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>

After spending two months there, he went home
and, aided by the liberality of his friends, he proceeded to Egypt
with Chrysippus the physician, bearing with him letters of
introduction from Agesilaus
<pb n='403'/> 
to Nectanabis, who
recommended him to the priests. There he remained one year and four
months with his beard and eyebrows shaved, and there, some say, he
wrote his <hi rend='ital'>Octa&euml;teris.</hi> From there he went to
Cyzicus and the Propontis, giving lectures ; afterwards he came to
the court of Mausolus. Then at length he returned to Athens,
bringing with him a great number of pupils : according to some, this
was for the purpose of annoying Plato, who had originally passed him
over.<note n='a'>The suggestion of hostile relations is held to be
without foundation both by Tannery, <hi rend='ital'>Astronomie

<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>

Some say that, when
Plato gave a banquet, Eudoxus, owing to the numbers present,
introduced the fashion of arranging couches in a semicircle.
Nicomachus, the son of Aristotle, states that he declared pleasure
to be the good.<note n='b'>The reference is to the <hi
rend='ital'>Nicomachean Ethics</hi> of Aristotle (i. 12, 1101 b 27 ;
x. 2, 1172 b 9 <hi rend='ital'>sq.</hi>). That Nicomachus wrote the
treatise called after him was a common error into which Cicero also
fell (<hi rend='ital'>De fin.</hi> v. &sect; 12).</note>He was received in
his native city with great honour, proof of this being the decree
concerning him. But he also became famous throughout Greece, as
legislator for his fellow-citizens, so we learn from Hermippus in
his fourth book <hi rend='ital'>On the Seven Sages,</hi> and as the
author of astronomical and geometrical treatises and other important
works.
</p> 
<p>He had three daughters, Actis, Philtis and Delphis.

<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>
Eratosthenes in his writings addressed to Baton tells us that he
also composed Dialogues of Dogs ; others say that they were written
by Egyptians in their own language and that he translated them and
published them in Greece. Chrysippus of Cnidos, the son of Erineus,
attended his lectures on the gods, the world, and the phenomena of
the heavens,
<pb n='405'/> 
while in medicine he was the pupil
of Philistion the Sicilian.
</p> 
<p>Eudoxus also left some excellent
commentaries. He had a son Aristagoras, who had a son Chrysippus,
the pupil of A&euml;thlius. To this Chrysippus we owe a medical work on
the treatment of the eye, speculations upon nature having occupied
his mind.

<p>Three men have borne the name of Eudoxus : (1) our
present subject ; (2) a historian, of Rhodes ; (3) a Sicilian Greek,
the son of Agathocles, a comic poet, who three times won the prize
in the city Dionysia and five times at the Lenaea, so we are told by
Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Chronology.</hi> We also find
another physician of Cnidos mentioned by Eudoxus<note n='a'>The
wording suggests that this physician's name was not Eudoxus, but
rather Chrysippus. He may have been the Chrysippus of Cnidos
mentioned <hi rend='ital'>supra,</hi> vii. 186 (<hi

rend='ital'>Geography</hi> as advising people to be always
exercising their limbs by every form of gymnastics, and their
sense-organs in the same way.
</p> 
<p>The same authority,
Apollodorus, states that Eudoxus of Cnidos flourished about the
103rd Olympiad,<note n='b'>368-364 b.c.</note> and that he
discovered the properties of curves. He died in his fifty-third
year. When he was in Egypt with Chonuphis of Heliopolis, the sacred
bull Apis licked his cloak. From this the priests foretold that he
would be famous but shortlived, so we are informed by Favorinus in
his <hi rend='ital'>Memorabilia.</hi>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>
<p>There is a poem of our
own upon him, which runs thus<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> vii. 744.</note> :
</p> 
<p>It is said that at Memphis
Eudoxus learned his coming fate from the bull with beautiful horns.
No words did it utter ; for whence comes speech to a bull? Nature
did not
<pb n='407'/> 
provide the young bull Apis with a
chattering tongue. But, standing sideways by him, it licked his
robe, by which it plainly prophesied "you shall soon die."
Whereupon, soon after, this fate overtook him, when he had seen
fifty-three risings of the Pleiades.
</p> 
<p>Eudoxus used to be
called <hi rend='ital'>Endoxos</hi> (illustrious) instead of Eudoxus
by reason of his brilliant reputation.
</p> 
<p>Having now dealt with
the famous Pythagoreans, let us next discuss the so-called
"sporadic" philosophers. And first we must speak of
Heraclitus.

<div1 n="9" type="book"><head>BOOK
IX</head> 
<div2 n="1" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 1. HERACLITUS</head> 

<div3 type="section" n="1">
<p>Heraclitus,
son of Bloson or, according to some, of Heracon, was a native of
Ephesus. He flourished in the 69th Olympiad.<note n='a'>504-500
b.c.</note> He was lofty-minded beyond all other men,<note n='b'>The
biographers used by our author laid evident stress on this
characteristic of the Ephesian, for &sect;&sect; 1-3 (excepting two fragments
cited in &sect; 2) dwell on this single theme. As to the criticism of
Pythagoras <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Clem. Alex. <hi
rend='ital'>Strom.</hi> i. 129 <hi rend='ital'>s.f.,</hi> who,
dealing with chronology, says that Heraclitus was later than
Pythagoras, for Pythagoras is mentioned by him.</note> and
over-weening, as is clear from his book in which he says : "Much
learning does not teach understanding ; else would it have taught
Hesiod and Pythagoras, or, again, Xenophanes and Hecataeus."<note
n='c'>Fr. 40 D., 16 B.</note> For "this one thing is wisdom, to
understand thought, as that which guides all the world
everywhere."<note n='d'>Fr. 41 D., 19 B.</note> And he used to say
that "Homer deserved to be chased out of the lists and beaten with
rods, and Archilochus likewise."<note n='e'>Fr. 42 D., 119
B.</note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="2"/>
<p>Again he would say : "There is more need to
extinguish insolence than an outbreak of fire,"<note n='f'>Fr. 43
D., 103 B.</note> and "The people must fight for the law as for
citywalls."<note n='g'>Fr. 44 D., 100 B.</note> He attacks the
Ephesians, too, for banishing his friend Hermodorus : he says :
"The Ephesians
<pb n='411'/> 
would do well to end their
lives, every grown man of them, and leave the city to beardless
boys, for that they have driven out Hermodorus, the worthiest man
among them, saying, `We will have none who is worthiest among us ;
or if there be any such, let him go elsewhere and consort with
others.'"<note n='a'>Fr. 121 D., 114 B.</note> And when he was
requested by them to make laws, he scorned the request because the
state was already in the grip of a bad constitution. 

<milestone unit="section" n="3"/>

He would retire
to the temple of Artemis and play at knuckle-bones with the boys ;
and when the Ephesians stood round him and looked on, "Why, you
rascals," he said, "are you astonished? Is it not better to do this
than to take part in your civil life ?"
</p> 
<p>Finally, he became a
hater of his kind and wandered on the mountains, and there he
continued to live, making his diet of grass and herbs. However, when
this gave him dropsy, he made his way back to the city and put this
riddle to the physicians, whether they were competent to create a
drought after heavy rain. They could make nothing of this, whereupon
he buried himself in a cowshed, expecting that the noxious damp
humour would be drawn out of him by the warmth of the manure. But,
as even this was of no avail, he died at the age of sixty.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="4"/>
<p>There is a piece of my own about him as follows<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 127.</note> :
</p> 
<p>Often have I
wondered how it came about that Heraclitus endured to live in this
miserable fashion and then to die. For a fell disease flooded his
body with water, quenched the light in his eyes and brought on
darkness.
</p> 
<p>Hermippus, too, says that he asked the doctors
whether anyone could by emptying the intestines draw off the
moisture ; and when they said it was
<pb n='413'/>

impossible, he put himself in the sun and bade his servants
plaster him over with cow-dung. Being thus stretched and prone, he
died the next day and was buried in the market-place. Neanthes of
Cyzicus states that, being unable to tear off the dung, he remained
as he was and, being unrecognizable when so transformed, he was
devoured by dogs.
</p> <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>
<p>He was exceptional from his boyhood ; for
when a youth he used to say that he knew nothing, although when he
was grown up he claimed that he knew everything. He was nobody's
pupil, but he declared that he "inquired of himself,"<note n='a'>Fr.
101 D., 80 B.</note> and learned everything from himself. Some,
however, had said that he had been a pupil of Xenophanes, as we
learn from Sotion, who also tells us that Ariston in his book <hi
rend='ital'>On Heraclitus</hi> declares that he was cured of the
dropsy and died of another disease. And Hippobotus has the same
story.
</p> 
<p>As to the work which passes as his, it is a continuous treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Nature,</hi> but is divided into
three discourses, one on the universe, another on politics, and a
third on theology. 

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>

This book he deposited in the temple of Artemis
and, according to some, he deliberately made it the more obscure in
order that none but adepts should approach it, and lest familiarity
should breed contempt. Of our philosopher Timon<note n='b'>Fr. 43
D.</note> gives a sketch in these words<note n='c'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf. Il.</hi> i. 247, 248.</note> :
</p> 
<p>In their midst
uprose shrill, cuckoo-like, a mob-reviler, riddling Heraclitus.
</p>

<p>Theophrastus puts it down to melancholy that some parts of his
work are half-finished, while other parts make a strange medley. As
a proof of his magnanimity Antisthenes in his <hi
rend='ital'>Successions of</hi>
<pb n='415'/> 
<hi
rend='ital'>Philosophers</hi> cites the fact that he renounced his
claim to the kingship in favour of his brother. So great fame did
his book win that a sect was founded and called the Heracliteans,
after him.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
<p>Here is a general summary of his doctrines. All
things are composed of fire, and into fire they are again resolved ;
further, all things come about by destiny, and existent things are
brought into harmony by the clash of opposing currents ; again, all
things are filled with souls and divinities. He has also given an
account of all the orderly happenings in the universe, and declares
the sun to be no larger than it appears. Another of his sayings is :
"Of soul thou shalt never find boundaries, not if thou trackest it
on every path ; so deep is its cause."<note n='a'>Fr. 45 D., 71
B.</note> Self-conceit he used to call a falling sickness (epilepsy)
and eyesight a lying sense.<note n='b'>Fr. 46 D., 132 B.</note>
Sometimes, however, his utterances are clear and distinct, so that
even the dullest can easily understand and derive therefrom
elevation of soul. For brevity and weightiness his exposition is
incomparable.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>
<p>Coming now to his particular tenets, we may
state them as follows : fire is the element, all things are exchange
for fire and come into being by rarefaction and condensation<note
n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Fr. 90 D., 22 B.</note> ; but of this
he gives no clear explanation. All things come into being by
conflict of opposites, and the sum of things flows like a stream.
Further, all that is is limited and forms one world. And it is
alternately born from fire and again resolved into fire in fixed
cycles to all eternity, and this is determined by destiny. Of the
opposites that which tends to birth or creation is called war and
strife, and that which tends to destruction by fire is called
concord and peace.<note n='d'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Fr. 80 D., 62
B.</note> Change he called
<pb n='417'/> 
a pathway up and
down, and this determines the birth of the world.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="9"/>
<p>For fire by
contracting turns into moisture, and this condensing turns into
water ; water again when congealed turns into earth. This process he
calls the downward path. Then again earth is liquefied, and thus
gives rise to water, and from water the rest of the series is
derived. He reduces nearly everything to exhalation from the sea.
This process is the upward path. Exhalations arise from earth as
well as from sea ; those from sea are bright and pure, those from
earth dark. Fire is fed by the bright exhalations, the moist element
by the others. He does not make clear the nature of the surrounding
element. He says, however, that there are in it bowls with their
concavities turned towards us, in which the bright exhalations
collect and produce flames. These are the stars. 

<milestone unit="section" n="10"/>

The flame of the
sun is the brightest and the hottest ; the other stars are further
from the earth and for that reason give it less light and heat. The
moon, which is nearer to the earth, traverses a region which is not
pure. The sun, however, moves in a clear and untroubled region, and
keeps a proportionate distance from us. That is why it gives us more
heat and light. Eclipses of the sun and moon occur when the bowls
are turned upwards ; the monthly phases of the moon are due to the
bowl turning round in its place little by little. Day and night,
months, seasons and years, rains and winds and other similar
phenomena are accounted for by the various exhalations. Thus the
bright exhalation, set aflame in the hollow orb of the sun, produces
day, the opposite exhalation when it has
<pb n='419'/> 
got
the mastery causes night ; the increase of warmth due to the bright
exhalation produces summer, whereas the preponderance of moisture
due to the dark exhalation brings about winter. His explanations of
other phenomena are in harmony with this. He gives no account of the
nature of the earth, nor even of the bowls. These, then, were his
opinions.
</p> 
<p>The story told by Ariston of Socrates, and his
remarks when he came upon the book of Heraclitus, which Euripides
brought him, I have mentioned in my Life of Socrates.<note n='a'>ii.

However, Seleucus the grammarian says that a certain
Croton relates in his book called <hi rend='ital'>The Diver</hi>

one Crates, who further said it required a Delian diver not to be
drowned in it. The title given to it by some is <hi rend='ital'>The

which depends upon motion most divine ; but for the most part
judgement is suspended, so that even those who are the most

interpretation of your work. Accordingly King Darius, son of
Hystaspes, wishes to enjoy your instruction and Greek culture. Come
then with all speed to see me at my palace.

<p>He holds that there are four elements of existent
things, and worlds unlimited in number but not overlapping [in

upwards and lifts them into the surrounding air. The substance of
God is spherical, in no way resembling man. He is all eye and all

and is eternal. Xenophanes was the first to declare that everything

the Eleatic Palamedes. Aristotle says that Zeno was the inventor of
dialectic, as Empedocles was of rhetoric.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="26"/>
<p>He was a truly
noble character both as philosopher and as politician ; at all
events, his extant books are brimful of intellect. Again, he plotted
to overthrow Nearchus the tyrant (or, according to others,
Diomedon) but was arrested : so Heraclides in his epitome of
Satyrus. On that occasion he was crossexamined as to his
accomplices and about the arms
<pb n='437'/> 
which he was
conveying to Lipara ; he denounced all the tyrant's own friends,
wishing to make him destitute of supporters. Then, saying that he
had something to tell him about certain people in his private ear,
he laid hold of it with his teeth and did not let go until stabbed
to death, meeting the same fate as Aristogiton the tyrannicide.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>
<p>Demetrius in his work on <hi rend='ital'>Men of the Same
Name</hi> says that he bit off, not the ear, but the nose. According
to Antisthenes in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions of
Philosophers,</hi> after informing against the tyrant's friends, he
was asked by the tyrant whether there was anyone else in the plot ;
whereupon he replied, "Yes, you, the curse of the city!" ; and to
the bystanders he said, "I marvel at your cowardice, that, for fear
of any of those things which I am now enduring, you should be the
tyrant's slaves." And at last he bit off his tongue and spat it at
him ; and his fellow-citizens were so worked upon that they
forthwith stoned the tyrant to death.<note n='a'>The heroic death of
Zeno and his defiance of the tyrant furnished a theme for various
writers ; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Plutarch, <hi rend='ital'>Adv.

<milestone unit="section" n="28"/>
<p>Of him also I have written as
follows<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 129.</note>
:
</p> 
<p>You wished, Zeno, and noble was your wish, to slay the
tyrant and set Elea free from bondage. But you were crushed ; for,
as all know, the tyrant caught you and beat you in a mortar. But
what is this that I say? It was your body that he beat, and not
you.
</p> 
<p>In all other respects Zeno was a gallant man ; and in
particular he despised the great no less than
<pb n='439'/>

Heraclitus. For example, his native place, the Phocaean colony,
once known as Hyele and afterwards as Elea, a city of moderate
size, skilled in nothing but to rear brave men, he preferred before
all the splendour of Athens, hardly paying the Athenians a visit,
but living all his life at home.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
<p>He was the first to propound
the argument of the "Achilles," which Favorinus attributes to
Parmenides, and many other arguments. His views are as follows.
There are worlds, but there is no empty space. The substance of all
things came from hot and cold, and dry and moist, which change into
one another. The generation of man proceeds from earth, and the soul
is formed by a union of all the foregoing, so blended that no one
element predominates.
</p> 
<p>We are told that once when he was
reviled he lost his temper, and, in reply to some one who blamed him
for this, he said, "If when I am abused I pretend that I am not,
then neither shall I be aware of it if I am praised."<note n='a'>A

<div3 type="section" n="30">
<p>Leucippus was born at Elea, but some say at
Abdera and others at Miletus. He was a pupil of Zeno. His views were
these. The sum of things
<pb n='441'/> 
is unlimited, and they
all change into one another. The All includes the empty as well as
the full. The worlds are formed when atoms fall into the void and
are entangled with one another ; and from their motion as they
increase in bulk arises the substance of the stars. The sun revolves
in a larger circle round the moon. The earth rides steadily, being
whirled about the centre ; its shape is like that of a drum.
Leucippus was the first to set up atoms as first principles. Such is
a general summary of his views ; on particular points they are as
follows.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
<p>He declares the All to be unlimited, as already
stated ; but of the All part is full and part empty,<note n='a'>By
the "full" is meant matter, atoms ; by the "empty," space.</note>
and these he calls elements. Out of them arise the worlds unlimited
in number and into them they are dissolved. This is how the worlds
are formed. In a given section many atoms of all manner of shapes
are carried from the unlimited into the vast empty space. These
collect together and form a single vortex, in which they jostle
against each other and, circling round in every possible way,
separate off, by like atoms joining like. And, the atoms being so
numerous that they can no longer revolve in equilibrium, the light
ones pass into the empty space outside, as if they were being
winnowed ; the remainder keep together and, becoming entangled, go
on their circuit together, and form a primary spherical system. 

<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>

This
parts off like a shell, enclosing within it atoms of all kinds ;
and, as these are whirled round by virtue of the resistance of the
centre, the enclosing shell becomes thinner, the adjacent atoms
continually combining when they touch the vortex.
</p> <pb n='443'/>

<p>In this way the earth is formed by portions brought to the centre
coalescing. And again, even the outer shell grows larger by the
influx of atoms from outside, and, as it is carried round in the
vortex, adds to itself whatever atoms it touches. And of these some
portions are locked together and form a mass, at first damp and
miry, but, when they have dried and revolve with the universal
vortex, they afterwards take fire and form the substance of the
stars.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
<p>The orbit of the sun is the outermost, that of the
moon nearest to the earth; the orbits of the other heavenly bodies
lie between these two. All the stars are set on fire by the speed of
their motion; the burning of the sun is also helped by the stars;
the moon is only slightly kindled. The sun and the moon are eclipsed
[when ..., but the obliquity of the zodiacal circle is due<note
n='a'>So Diels; but see T. L. Heath, <hi
rend='ital'>Aristarchus</hi> p. 122, note 3, who prefers to supply
"the obliquity of the circles of the stars." <hi

Gr.</hi> p. 377).</note>] to the inclination of the earth to the
south ; the regions of the north are always shrouded in mist, and
are extremely cold and frozen. Eclipses of the sun are rare ;
eclipses of the moon constantly occur, and this because their orbits
are unequal. As the world is born, so, too, it grows, decays and
perishes, in virtue of some necessity, the nature of which he does
[not] specify.

<div2 n="7" type="chapter"><head>Chapter 7. DEMOCRITUS(? 460-357
B.C.)</head> 

<div3 type="section" n="34">
<p>Democritus was the son of Hegesistratus, though some
say of Athenocritus, and others again of Damasippus. He was a native
of Abdera or, according to some, of Miletus. He was a pupil of
certain Magians and Chaldaeans. For when King
<pb n='445'/>

Xerxes was entertained by the father of Democritus he left men in
charge, as, in fact, is stated by Herodotus<note n='a'>Diels remarks
that this is a free interpretation of Hdt. vii. 109, viii.
120.</note>; and from these men, while still a boy, he learned
theology and astronomy. Afterwards he met Leucippus and, according
to some, Anaxagoras, being forty years younger than the latter. But
Favorinus in his <hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History</hi> tells us
that Democritus, speaking of Anaxagoras, declared that his views on
the sun and the moon were not original but of great antiquity, and
that he had simply stolen them. Democritus also pulled to pieces the
views of Anaxagoras on cosmogony and on mind, 

<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>

having a spite against
him, because Anbaxagoras did not take to him. If this be so, how
could he have been his pupil, as some suggest ?
</p> 
<p>According to
Demetrius in his book on <hi rend='ital'>Men of the Same Name</hi>
and Antisthenes in his <hi rend='ital'>Successions of
Philosophers</hi>, he travelled into Egypt to learn geometry from
the priests, and he also went into Persia to visit the Chaldaeans as
well as to the Red Sea. Some say that he associated with the
Gymnosophists in India and went to Aethiopia. Also that, being the
third son, he divided the family property. Most authorities will
have it that he chose the smaller portion, which was in money,
because he had need of this to pay the cost of travel; besides, his
brothers were crafty enough to foresee that this would be his
choice. 

<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>

Demetrius estimates his share at over 100 talents, the whole
of which he spent. His industry, says the same author, was so great
that he cut off a little room in the garden round the house and shut
himself up there. One day his father brought an ox to sacrifice and
tied it there, and he was not aware of it for a considerable
time,
<pb n='447'/> 
until his father roused him to attend the
sacrifice and told him about the ox. Demetrius goes on : "It would
seem that he also went to Athens and was not anxious to be
recognized, because he despised fame, and that while he knew of
Socrates, he was not known to Socrates, his words being, `I came to
Athens and no one knew me.'"
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>
<p>"If the <hi
rend='ital'>Rivals</hi> be the work of Plato," says Thrasylus,
"Democritus will be the unnamed character, different from Oenopides
and Anaxagoras, who makes his appearance when conversation is going
on with Socrates about philosophy, and to whom Socrates says that
the philosopher is like the all-round athlete.<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Rivals</hi>, 132 a-c.</note> And truly Democritus was
versed in every department of philosophy, for he had trained himself
both in physics and in ethics, nay more, in mathematics and the
routine subjects of education, and he was quite an expert in the
arts." From him we have the saying, "Speech is the shadow of
action." Demetrius of Phalerum in his <hi rend='ital'>Defence of
Socrates</hi> affirms that he did not even visit Athens. This is to
make the larger claim, namely, that he thought that great city
beneath his notice, because he did not care to win fame from a
place, but preferred himself to make a place famous.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>
<p>His
character can also be seen from his writings. "He would seem," says
Thrasylus, "to have been an admirer of the Pythagoreans. Moreover,
he mentions Pythagoras himself, praising him in a work of his own
entitled <hi rend='ital'>Pythagoras.</hi><note n='b'> &sect; 46.</note> He
seems to have taken all his ideas from him and, if chronology did
not stand in the way, he might have been thought his pupil." Glaucus
of Rhegium certainly says that
<pb n='449'/> 
he was taught by
one of the Pythagoreans, and Glaucus was his contemporary.
Apollodorus of Cyzicus, again, will have it that he lived with
Philolaus.
</p> 
<p>He would train himself, says Antisthenes, by a
variety of means to test his sense-impressions by going at times
into solitude and frequenting tombs. 

<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>

The same authority states that,
when he returned from his travels, he was reduced to a humble mode
of life because he had exhausted his means ; and, because of his
poverty, he was supported by his brother Damasus. But his reputation
rose owing to his having foretold certain future events ; and after
that the public deemed him worthy of the honour paid to a god.<note
n='a'><foreign lang='greek'>w(s de\ proeipw/n . . . h)ciw/qh.</foreign>
This sentence in <hi rend='ital'>oratio recta</hi>, interrupting the
extract from Antisthenes, finds its counterpart in the stories
attributing to Democritus the power of forecasting the weather or
the seasons, on the strength of his scientific attainments. <hi
rend='ital'>Cf</hi>. Pliny, <hi rend='ital'>N.H.</hi> xviii. 273,
341, and Clem. Alex. <hi rend='ital'>Strom</hi>. vii. 32.</note>
There was a law, says Antisthenes, that no one who had squandered
his patrimony should be buried in his native city. Democritus,
understanding this, and fearing lest he should be at the mercy of
any envious or unscrupulous prosecutors, read aloud to the people
his treatise, the <hi rend='ital'>Great Diacosmos</hi>, the best of
all his works ; and then he was rewarded with 500 talents ; and,
more than that, with bronze statues as well ; and when he died, he
received a public funeral after a lifetime of more than a century.

<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>
Demetrius, however, says that it was not Democritus himself but his
relatives who read the <hi rend='ital'>Great Diacosmos</hi>, and
that the sum awarded was 100 talents only ; with this account
Hippobotus agrees.
</p> 
<p>Aristoxenus in his <hi
rend='ital'>Historical Notes</hi> affirms that Plato wished to burn
all the writings of Democritus that he could collect, but that
Amyclas and Clinias
<pb n='451'/> 
the Pythagoreans prevented
him, saying that there was no advantage in doing so, for already the
books were widely circulated. And there is clear evidence for this
in the fact that Plato, who mentions almost all the early
philosophers, never once alludes to Democritus, not even where it
would be necessary to controvert him, obviously because he knew that
he would have to match himself against the prince of philosophers,
for whom, to be sure, Timon<note n='a'>Fr. 46 D.</note> has this
meed of praise<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. Il.</hi> i. 263, iv.
341.</note> :
</p> 
<p>Such is the wise Democritus, the guardian of
discourse, keen-witted disputant, among the best I ever read.

<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>
<p>As regards chronology, he was, as he says himself in the <hi
rend='ital'>Lesser Diacosmos</hi>, a young man when Anaxagoras was
old, being forty years his junior. He says that the <hi
rend='ital'>Lesser Diacosmos</hi> was compiled 730 years after the
capture of Troy. According to Apollodorus in his <hi
rend='ital'>Chronology</hi> he would thus have been born in the 80th
Olympiad,<note n='c'>460-457 b.c.</note> but according to Thrasylus
in his pamphlet entitled <hi rend='ital'>Prolegomena to the Reading
of the works of Democritus</hi>, in the third year of the 77th
Olympiad,<note n='d'>470-469 b.c.</note> which makes him, adds
Thrasylus, one year older than Socrates. He would then be a
contemporary of Archelaus, the pupil of Anaxagoras, and of the
school of Oenopides ; indeed he mentions Oenopides. 

<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>

Again, he
alludes to the doctrine of the One held by Parmenides and Zeno, they
being evidently the persons most talked about in his day ; he also
mentions Protagoras of Abdera, who, it is admitted, was a
contemporary of Socrates.
</p> 
<p>Athenodorus in the eighth book of
his <hi rend='ital'>Walks</hi> relates that, when Hippocrates came
to see him, he ordered
<pb n='453'/> 
milk to be brought, and,
having inspected it, pronounced it to be the milk of a black
she-goat which had produced her first kid ; which made Hippocrates
marvel at the accuracy of his observation. Moreover, Hippocrates
being accompanied by a maidservant, on the first day Democritus
greeted her with "Good morning, maiden," but the next day with "Good
morning, woman," As a matter of fact the girl had been seduced in
the night.

<p>Of the death of Democritus the account given by
Hermippus is as follows. When he was now very old and near his end,
his sister was vexed that he seemed likely to die during the
festival of Thesmophoria and she would be prevented from paying
the fitting worship to the goddess. He bade her be of good cheer and
ordered hot loaves to be brought to him every day. By applying these
to his nostrils he contrived to outlive the festival ; and as soon
as the three festival days were passed he let his life go from him
without pain, having then, according to Hipparchus, attained his one
hundred and ninth year.
</p> 
<p>In my <hi rend='ital'>Pammetros</hi>
I have a piece on him as follows<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth.
Pal.</hi> vii. 57.</note> :
</p> 
<p>Pray who was so wise, who wrought
so vast a work as the omniscient Democritus achieved ? When Death
was near, for three days he kept him in his house and regaled him
with the steam of hot loaves.
</p> 
<p>Such was the life of our
philosopher.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>
<p>His opinions are these. The first principles of
the universe are atoms and empty space ; everything else is merely
thought to exist. The worlds are unlimited ; they come into being
and perish. Nothing can come into being from that which is not

<pb n='455'/> 
nor pass away into that which is not. Further, the
atoms are unlimited in size and number, and they are borne along in
the whole universe in a vortex, and therby generate all composite
things--fire, water, air, earth ; for even these are conglomerations
of given atoms. And it is because of their solidity that these atoms
are impassive and unalterable. The sun and the moon have been
composed of such smooth and spherical masses [<hi
rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> atoms], and so also the soul, which is
identical with reason. We see by virtue of the impact of images upon
our eyes.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>
<p>All things happen by virtue of necessity, the
vortex being the cause of the creation of all things, and this he
calls necessity. The end of action is tranquillity, which is not
identical with pleasure, as some by a false interpretation have
understood, but a state in which the soul continues calm and strong,
undisturbed by any fear or superstition or any other emotion. This
he calls well-being and many other names. The qualities of things
exist merely by convention ; in nature there is nothing but atoms
and void space. These, then, are his opinions.

<div3 type="section" n="50">
<p>Protagoras, son of Artemon or, according to
Apollodorus and Dinon in the fifth book of his <hi
rend='ital'>History of Persia</hi>, of Maeandrius, was born at
Abdera (so says Heraclides of Pontus in his treatise <hi
rend='ital'>On Laws</hi>, and also that he made laws for Thurii) or,
according to Eupolis in his <hi rend='ital'>Flatterers</hi>, at Teos
; for the latter says :
</p> 
<p><hi rend='center'>Inside we've got
Protagoras of Teos.</hi>
</p> 
<p>He and Prodicus of Ceos gave public
readings for which fees were charged, and Plato in the <hi
rend='ital'>Protagoras</hi><note n='a'>316 a.</note> calls Prodicus
deep-voiced. Protagoras studied under Democritus. The latter<note

32, and Suidas, <hi rend='ital'>s.v.</hi> <foreign lang='greek'>
*dhmo/kr itos.</foreign></note> was nicknamed "Wisdom," according to
Favorinus in his <hi rend='ital'>Miscellaneous History.</hi>
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="51"/>
<p>Protagoras was the first to maintain that there are two sides to
every question, opposed to each other, and he even argued in this
fashion, being the first to do so. Furthermore he began a work thus
: "Man is the measure of all things, of things that are that they
are, and of things that are not that they
<pb n='465'/> 
are
not." He used to say that soul was nothing apart from the senses, as
we learn from Plato in the <hi rend='ital'>Theaetetus</hi>,<note
n='a'>152 a <hi rend='ital'>sq.</hi></note> and that everything is
true. In another work he began thus : "As to the gods, I have no
means of knowing either that they exist or that they do not exist.
For many are the obstacles that impede knowledge, both the obscurity
of the question and the shortness of human life." 

<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>

For this
introduction to his book the Athenians expelled him ; and they burnt
his works in the market-place, after sending round a herald to
collect them from all who had copies in their possession.
</p> 
<p>He
was the first to exact a fee of a hundred minae and the first to
distinguish the tenses of verbs, to emphasize the importance of
seizing the right moment, to institute contests in debating, and to
teach rival pleaders the tricks of their trade. Furthermore, in
his dialectic he neglected the meaning in favour of verbal
quibbling, and he was the father of the whole tribe of eristical
disputants now so much in evidence ; insomuch that Timon<note
n='b'>Fr. 47 D.</note> too speaks of him as<note n='c'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf. Il.</hi> xv. 679.</note>

<p>Protagoras, all

</p> 
<p>Cunning, I trow, to war with words.

<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>
<p>He too first introduced the method of discussion which is called
Socratic. Again, as we learn from Plato in the <hi
rend='ital'>Euthydemus</hi>,<note n='d'>286 c.</note> he was the
first to use in discussion the argument of Antisthenes which strives
to prove that contradiction is impossible, and the first to point
out how to attack and refute any proposition laid down : so
Artemidorus the dialectician in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>In
Reply to Chrysippus.</hi> He too invented the shoulder-pad on which
porters carry their burdens, so we are told by Aristotle in his
treatise <hi rend='ital'>On Education</hi> ; for he himself had been
a porter,
<pb n='467'/> 
says Epicurus somewhere.<note
n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Sc.</hi> in an epistle, <foreign lang='greek'>*peri\ e)pithde uma/twn,</foreign> <hi
rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Athen. viii. 354 c.</note> This was how he was
taken up by Democritus, who saw how skilfully his bundles of wood
were tied. He was the first to mark off the parts of discourse into
four, namely, wish, question, answer, command<note n='b'>This
answers roughly to the optative, the indicative, and the
imperative.</note> ; 

<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>

others divide into seven parts, narration,
question, answer, command, rehearsal, wish, summoning ; these he
called the basic forms of speech. Alcidamas made discourse fourfold,
affirmation, negation, question, address.
</p> 
<p>The first of his
books he read in public was that <hi rend='ital'>On the Gods</hi>,
the introduction to which we quoted above ; he read it at Athens in
Euripides' house, or, as some say, in Megaclides' ; others again
make the place the Lyceum and the reader his disciple Archagoras,
Theodotus's son, who gave him the benefit of his voice. His accuser
was Pythodorus, son of Polyzelus, one of the four hundred ;
Aristotle, however, says it was Euathlus.

fact that the two works by which Protagoras is best known (<hi

there is a dialogue which Plato wrote upon him.

<p>Philochorus says that, when he was on a voyage to Sicily, his

According to some his death occurred, when
he was on a journey, at nearly ninety years of age, though
Apollodorus makes his age seventy, assigns forty years for his
career as a sophist, and puts his <hi rend='ital'>floruit</hi> in
the 84th Olympiad.<note n='a'>444-441 b.c.</note>
</p> 
<p>There is an

</p> 
<p>Protagoras, I hear it told of

<p>Thou died'st in eld when Athens thou didst flee ;
</p>

<p>Cecrops' town chose to banish thee ; but though
</p> 
<p>Thou
`scap'dst Athene, not so Hell below.
</p> 
<p>The story is told that
once, when he asked Euathlus his disciple for his fee, the latter
replied, "But I have not won a case yet." "Nay," said Protagoras,
"if I win this case against you I must have the fee, for winning it
; if you win, I must have it, because <hi rend='ital'>you</hi> win
it."
</p> 
<p>There was another Protagoras, an astronomer, for whom
Euphorion wrote a dirge ; and a third who was a Stoic
philosopher.

<note n='c'>We naturally feel surprise when this early philosopher
is interpolated between Protagoras and Anaxarchus, both assumed to
be pupils of Democritus. The only explanation suggested is a severe
reflection on our author's acquaintance with his subject. There was
a certain Diogenes of Smyrna, an obscure adherent of the school of
Abdera. D. L., or more probably one of his authorities, has confused
this Democritean with the earlier and better-known Diogenes of
Apollonia. It is also strange that there is no Life of Metrodorus of

knew nothing, not even the fact that he knew nothing ; while
Metrodorus was a pupil of Nessas of Chios, though some say that he
was taught by Democritus. Now Anaxarchus accompanied Alexander and
flourished in the 110th Olympiad.<note n='d'>340-337 b.c.</note> He
made an enemy of Nicocreon, tyrant of Cyprus. Once at a

magnificent ; there is only one thing lacking, that the head of some
satrap should be served up at table." This was a hit at Nicocreon,

<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>
who never forgot it, and when after the king's death Anaxarchus was
forced against his will to land in Cyprus, he seized him and,
putting him in a mortar, ordered him to be pounded to death with
iron pestles. But he, making light of the punishment, made that
well-known speech, "Pound, pound the pouch containing Anaxarchus ;
ye pound not Anaxarchus." And when Nicocreon commanded his tongue to
be cut out, they say he bit it off and spat it at him. This is what
I have written upon him<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi>

</p> 
<p>Pound, Nicocreon, as hard as you like : it
is but a pouch. Pound on ; Anaxarchus's self long since is housed

<p>For his fortitude and contentment
in life he was called the Happy Man. He had, too, the capacity of
bringing anyone to reason in the easiest possible way. At all events
he succeeded in diverting Alexander when he had begun to think
himself a god ; for, seeing blood running from a wound he had

accompanied on his travels everywhere so that he even forgathered

anything was honourable or dishonourable, just or unjust.<note

of his way for nothing, taking no precaution, but facing all risks
as they came, whether carts, precipices, dogs or what not, and,
generally, leaving nothing to the arbitrament of the senses ; but he
was kept out of harm's way by his friends who, as Antigonus of
Carystus tells us, used to follow close after him. But Aenesidemus
says that it was only his philosophy that was based upon suspension
of judgement, and that he did not lack foresight in his everyday
acts. He lived to be nearly ninety.
</p> 
<p>This is what Antigonus of
Carystus says of Pyrrho in his book upon him. At first he was a poor

He would
withdraw from the world and live in solitude, rarely showing himself
to his relatives ; this he did because he had heard an Indian
reproach Anaxarchus, telling him that he would never be able to
teach others what is good while he himself danced attendance on
kings in their courts. He would maintain the same composure at all
times, so that, even if you left him when he was in the middle of a
speech, he would finish what he had to say with no audience but
himself, although in his youth he had been hasty.<note n='a'>Here
Diels would insert in the text words which would make the meaning
"easily moved by the applause of the crowd and ambitious of
fame."</note> Often, our informant adds, he would leave his home
and, telling no one, would go roaming about with whomsoever he
chanced to meet. And once, when Anaxarchus fell into a slough, he
passed by without giving him any help, and, while others blamed him,
Anaxarchus himself praised his indifference and <hi

<p>On being discovered once talking
to himself, he answered, when asked the reason, that he was training
to be good. In debate he was looked down upon by no one, for he
could both discourse at length and also sustain a cross-examination,
so that even Nausiphanes when a young man was captivated by him : at
all events he used to say that we should follow Pyrrho in
disposition but himself in doctrine ; and he would often remark that
Epicurus, greatly admiring Pyrrho's way of life, regularly asked him
for information about Pyrrho ; and that he was so respected by his
native city that they made him high priest, and on his account they
voted that all philosophers should be exempt from taxation.
</p>

<p>Moreover, there were many who emulated his
<pb n='479'/>

abstention from affairs, so that Timon in his <hi

He
lived in fraternal piety with his sister, a midwife, so says
Eratosthenes in his essay <hi rend='ital'>On Wealth and

poultry perchance or pigs, and he would dust the things in the
house, quite indifferent as to what he did. They say he showed his
indifference by washing a porker. Once he got enraged in his
sister's cause (her name was Philista), and he told the man who
blamed him that it was not over a weak woman that one should display
indifference. When a cur rushed at him and terrified him, he
answered his critic that it was not easy entirely to strip oneself
of human weakness ; but one should strive with all one's might
against facts, by deeds if possible, and if not, in word.

<p>They say that, when septic salves and surgical and caustic
remedies were applied to a wound he had sustained, he did not so
much as frown. Timon
<pb n='481'/> 
also portrays his
disposition in the full account which he gives of him to Pytho.
Philo of Athens, a friend of his, used to say that he was most fond
of Democritus, and then of Homer, admiring him and continually
repeating the line

<p><hi rend='center'>As leaves on trees, such

</p> 
<p>He also admired Homer because he likened men
to wasps, flies, and birds, and would quote these verses as well
:
</p> 
<p>Ay, friend, die thou ; why thus thy fate deplore ?
</p>

<p>Patroclus too, thy better, is no more,<note n='b'><hi

</p> 
<p>and all the passages
which dwell on the unstable purpose, vain pursuits, and childish
folly of man.<note n='c'>Here, it would seem, the materials which
can be traced to Antigonus of Carystus come to an end. The source of
the long passage &sect;&sect; 69-108, with which must go the Sceptical
Succession, &sect;&sect; 115-116, is not obvious. It may be supposed that D. L.
with his seeming partiality for the school (<hi
rend='ital'>cf.</hi> &sect; 109) has here taken pains to collect as much new
material as possible. It is hardly likely that, without personal
bias, a biographer would draw upon "the commentary of Apollonides on
the <hi rend='ital'>Silli</hi> of Timon which he dedicated to
Tiberius Caesar," and the like. It has indeed been said that D. L.
had access to a sceptical monograph which he either had or wished to
have copied for himself. If so, it must have been by a contemporary,
or at any rate a writer not earlier than Antiochus of Laodicea (&sect; 106)
and Sextus Empiricus (&sect; 87).</note>

<p>Posidonius, too, relates of
him a story of this sort. When his fellow-passengers on board a ship
were all unnerved by a storm, he kept calm and confident, pointing
to a little pig in the ship that went on eating, and telling them
that such was the unperturbed state in which the wise man should
keep himself. Numenius alone attributes to him positive tenets. He
had pupils of repute, in particular one Eurylochus, who fell short
of his professions ; for they say that he was once so angry that he
seized the spit with the meat on it and chased his cook right into
the market-place. 

<milestone unit="section" n="69"/>

Once in Elis he was so hard pressed by his pupils'
questions that he stripped
<pb n='483'/> 
and swam across the
Alpheus. Now he was, as Timon too says, most hostile to
Sophists.
</p> 
<p>Philo, again, who had a habit of very often talking
to himself, is also referred to in the lines<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf. Od.</hi> xxi. 364.</note>:
</p> 
<p>Yea, him that is

</p> 
<p>Philo, who recks

</p> 
<p>Besides these, Pyrrho's
pupils included Hecataeus of Abdera, Timon of Phlius, author of the
<hi rend='ital'>Silli,</hi> of whom more anon, and also Nausiphanes
of Teos, said by some to have been a teacher of Epicurus. All these
were called Pyrrhoneans after the name of their master, but
Aporetics, Sceptics, Ephectics, and even Zetetics, from their
principles, if we may call them such--

<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>

Zetetics or seekers because
they were ever seeking truth, Sceptics or inquirers because they
were always looking for a solution and never finding one, Ephectics
or doubters because of the state of mind which followed their
inquiry, I mean, suspense of judgement, and finally Aporetics or
those in perplexity, for not only they but even the dogmatic
philosophers themselves in their turn were often perplexed.
Pyrrhoneans, of course, they were called from Pyrrho. Theodosius in
his <hi rend='ital'>Sceptic Chapters</hi> denies that Scepticism
should be called Pyrrhonism ; for if the movement of the mind in
either direction is unattainable by us, we shall never know for
certain what Pyrrho really intended, and without knowing that, we
cannot be called Pyrrhoneans. Besides this (he says), there is the
fact that Pyrrho was not the founder of Scepticism ; nor had he any
positive tenet ; but a Pyrrhonean is one who in manners and life
resembles Pyrrho.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>
<p>Some call Homer the founder of this school,
for to the same questions he more than anyone else is
</p> <pb
n='485'/> 
<p>always giving different answers at different times, and
is never definite or dogmatic about the answer. The maxims of the
Seven Wise Men, too, they call sceptical ; for instance, "Observe
the Golden Mean," and "A pledge is a curse at one's elbow," meaning
that whoever plights his troth steadfastly and trustfully brings a
curse on his own head. Sceptically minded, again, were Archilochus
and Euripides, for Archilochus says<note n='a'>Fr. 70 B.</note>
:
</p> 
<p>Man's soul, O Glaucus, son of Leptines,
</p> 
<p>Is but as
one short day that Zeus sends down.
</p> 
<p>And Euripides<note

<p>Furthermore, they find Xenophanes, Zeno of Elea, and
Democritus to be sceptics : Xenophanes because he says,<note

</p> 
<p>Clear truth hath no man seen nor e'er

</p> 
<p>and Zeno because he would destroy motion,
saying, "A moving body moves neither where it is nor where it is
not"; Democritus because he rejects qualities, saying, "Opinion says
hot or cold, but the reality is atoms and empty space," and again,
"Of a truth we know nothing, for truth is in a well."<note

<p>So too Empedocles<note n='a'>Fr. 2, l. 7.</note> :

</p> 
<p>And even Heraclitus
: "Let us not conjecture on deepest questions what is likely."<note
n='c'>Fr. 47 D., 48 B.</note> Then again Hippocrates showed himself
two-sided and but human. And before them all Homer<note n='d'><hi

</p> 
<p>Pliant is the

;
</p> 
<p>and
</p> 
<p>And the saying which thou sayest, back it cometh
later on thee,
</p> 
<p>where he is speaking of the equal value of
contradictory sayings.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="74"/>
<p>The Sceptics, then, were constantly
engaged<note n='e'><foreign lang='greek'> diete/l oun,</foreign>
imperfect.</note> in overthrowing the dogmas of all schools, but
enuntiated none themselves ; and though they would go so far as to
bring forward and expound the dogmas of the others, they themselves
laid down nothing definitely, not even the laying down of nothing.
So much so that they even refuted their laying down of nothing,
saying, for instance, "We determine nothing," since otherwise they
would have been betrayed into determining<note n='f'><hi
rend='ital'>Inf.</hi> &sect; 104.</note>; but we put forward, say they,
all
<pb n='489'/> 
the theories for the purpose of indicating
our unprecipitate attitude, precisely as we might have done if we
had actually assented to them. Thus by the expression "We determine
nothing" is indicated their state of even balance; which is
similarly indicated by the other expressions, "Not more (one thing
than another)," "Every saying has its corresponding opposite," and
the like. 

<milestone unit="section" n="75"/>

But "Not more (one thing than another)" can also be taken
positively, indicating that two things are alike ; for example, "The
pirate is no more wicked than the liar." But the Sceptics meant it
not positively but negatively, as when, in refuting an argument, one
says, "Neither had more existence, Scylla or the Chimaera." And
"More so" itself is sometimes comparative, as when we say that
"Honey is more sweet than grapes" ; sometimes both positive and
negative, as when we say, "Virtue profits more than it harms," for
in this phrase we indicate that virtue profits and does not harm.
<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>

But the Sceptics even refute the statement "Not more (one thing than
another)." For, as forethought is no more existent than
non-existent, so "Not more (one thing than another)" is no more
existent than not. Thus, as Timon says in the <hi
rend='ital'>Pytho</hi>, the statement means just absence of all
determination and withholding of assent. The other statement, "Every
saying, etc.,"<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> "Every saying
has its corresponding opposite" (<hi rend='ital'>supra</hi>,
&sect; 74).</note> equally compels suspension of judgement; when facts
disagree, but the contradictory statements have exactly the same
weight, ignorance of the truth is the necessary consequence. But
even this statement has its corresponding antithesis, so that after
destroying others it turns round and destroys itself, like a purge
which drives the substance
<pb n='491'/> 
out and then in its
turn is itself eliminated and destroyed.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>
<p>This the dogmatists
answer by saying that they do [not merely] not deny the statement,
but even plainly assert it. So they were merely using the words as
servants, as it was not possible not to refute one statement by
another ; just as we<note n='a'>Here (as in &sect; 104) the writer, whether
D. L or his source, seems to pose as a Sceptic himself ; <hi
rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Introd. p. xiii.</note> are accustomed to say
there is no such thing as space, and yet we have no alternative but
to speak of space for the purpose of argument, though not of
positive doctrine, and just as we say nothing comes about by
necessity and yet have to speak of necessity. This was the sort of
interpretation they used to give ; though things appear to be such
and such, they are not such in reality but only appear such. And
they would say that they sought, not thoughts, since thoughts are
evidently thought, but the things in which sensation plays a
part.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
<p>Thus the Pyrrhonean principle, as Aenesidemus says in
the introduction to his <hi rend='ital'>Pyrrhonics</hi>, is but a
report on phenomena or on any kind of judgement, a report in which
all things are brought to bear on one another, and in the comparison
are found to present much anomaly and confusion. As to the
contradictions in their doubts, they would first show the ways in
which things gain credence, and then by the same methods they would
destroy belief in them ; for they say those things gain credence
which either the senses are agreed upon or which never or at least
rarely change, as well as things which become habitual or are
determined by law and those which please or excite wonder. 

<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>

They
showed, then, on the basis of that which is contrary to what induces
belief, that the probabilities on both sides are equal.
</p> <pb
n='493'/> 
<p>Perplexities arise from the agreements<note n='a'>If,
however, with Reiske we here read <foreign lang='greek'>th=s</foreign> for <foreign lang='greek'>ta\s,</foreign>
the meaning is: "The objections urged <hi rend='ital'>against</hi>
the (supposed) consistency of our percepts or our concepts, were
arranged by them under ten modes."</note> between appearances or
judgements, and these perplexities they distinguished under ten
different modes in which the subjects in question appeared to vary.
The following are the ten modes laid down.<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Sext. Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Pyrrh. Hyp.</hi>i.
&sect;&sect; 36-163.</note>
</p> 
<p>The <hi rend='ital'>first</hi> mode relates to
the differences between living creatures in respect of those things
which give them pleasure or pain, or are useful or harmful to them.
By this it is inferred that they do not receive the same impressions
from the same things, with the result that such a conflict
necessarily leads to suspension of judgement. For some creatures
multiply without intercourse, for example, creatures that live in
fire, the Arabian phoenix and worms ; others by union, such as man
and the rest. 

<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>

Some are distinguished in one way, some in another,
and for this reason they differ in their senses also, hawks for
instance being most keen-sighted, and dogs having a most acute sense
of smell. It is natural that if the senses, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> eyes, of animals differ, so also will the
impressions produced upon them; so to the goat vine-shoots are good
to eat, to man they are bitter ; the quail thrives on hemlock, which
is fatal to man ; the pig will eat ordure, the horse will not.
</p>

<p>The <hi rend='ital'>second</hi> mode has reference to the natures
and idiosyncrasies of men; for instance, Demophon, Alexander's
butler, used to get warm in the shade and shiver in the sun. 

<milestone unit="section" n="81"/>

Andron
of Argos is reported by Aristotle<note n='c'>Fr. 103 Rose.</note> to
have travelled across the waterless deserts of Libya without
drinking. Moreover, one man fancies the profession of medicine,
another
<pb n='495'/> 
farming, and another commerce; and the
same ways of life are injurious to one man but beneficial to
another; from which it follows that judgement must be suspended.
</p>

<p>The <hi rend='ital'>third</hi> mode depends on the differences
between the sense-channels in different cases, for an apple gives
the impression of being pale yellow in colour to the sight, sweet in
taste and fragrant in smell. An object of the same shape is made to
appear different by differences in the mirrors reflecting it. Thus
it follows that what appears is no more such and such a thing than
something different.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="82"/>
<p>The <hi rend='ital'>fourth</hi> mode is
that due to differences of condition and to changes in general ; for
instance, health, illness, sleep, waking, joy, sorrow, youth, old
age, courage, fear, want, fullness, hate, love, heat, cold, to say
nothing of breathing freely and having the passages obstructed. The
impressions received thus appear to vary according to the nature of
the conditions. Nay, even the state of madmen is not contrary to
nature; for why should their state be so more than ours? Even to our
view the sun has the appearance of standing still. And Theon of
Tithorea used to go to bed and walk in his sleep, while Pericles'
slave did the same on the housetop.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="83"/>
<p>The <hi
rend='ital'>fifth</hi> mode is derived from customs, laws, belief in
myths, compacts between nations and dogmatic assumptions. This class
includes considerations with regard to things beautiful and ugly,
true and false, good and bad, with regard to the gods, and with
regard to the coming into being and the passing away of the world of
phenomena. Obviously the same thing is regarded by some as just and
by others as unjust, or as good by some and
<pb n='497'/> 
bad
by others. Persians think it not unnatural for a man to marry his
daughter; to Greeks it is unlawful. The Massagetae, acording to
Eudoxus in the first book of his <hi rend='ital'>Voyage round the
World</hi>, have their wives in common ; the Greeks have not. The
Cilicians used to delight in piracy ; not so the Greeks. 

<milestone unit="section" n="84"/>

Different
people believe in different gods ; some in providence, others not.
In burying their dead, the Egyptians embalm them; the Romans burn
them ; the Paeonians throw them into lakes. As to what is true,
then, let suspension of judgement be our practice.
</p> 
<p>The <hi
rend='ital'>sixth</hi> mode relates to mixtures and participations, by virtue of which nothing appears pure in and by itself, but
only in combination with air, light, moisture, solidity, heat, cold,
movement, exhalations and other forces. For purple shows different
tints in sunlight, moonlight, and lamplight ; and our own
complexion does not appear the same at noon and when the sun is low.
<milestone unit="section" n="85"/>
Again, a rock which in air takes two men to lift is easily moved
about in water, either because, being in reality heavy, it is lifted
by the water or because, being light, it is made heavy by the air.
Of its own inherent property we know nothing, any more than of the
constituent oils in an ointment.
</p> 
<p>The <hi
rend='ital'>seventh</hi> mode has reference to distances, positions,
places and the occupants of the places. In this mode things which
are thought to be large appear small, square things round ; flat
things appear to have projections, straight things to be bent, and
colourless coloured. So the sun, on account of its distance, appears
small, mountains when far away appear misty and smooth, but when
near at hand
<pb n='499'/> 
rugged. 

<milestone unit="section" n="86"/>

Furthermore, the sun at
its rising has a certain appearance, but has a dissimilar appearance
when in mid-heaven, and the same body one appearance in a wood and
another in open country. The image again varies according to the
position of the object, and a dove's neck according to the way it is
turned. Since, then, it is not possible to observe these things
apart from places and positions, their real nature is
unknowable.
</p> 
<p>The <hi rend='ital'>eighth</hi> mode is concerned
with quantities and qualities of things, say heat or cold, swiftness
or slowness, colourlessness or variety of colours. Thus wine taken
in moderation strengthens the body, but too much of it is weakening
; and so with food and other things.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>
<p>The <hi
rend='ital'>ninth</hi> mode has to do with perpetuity, strangeness, or rarity. Thus earthquakes are no surprise to those among
whom they constantly take place ; nor is the sun, for it is seen
every day.<note n='a'>As contrasted, <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>, with
a comet; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Sext. Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Pyrrh.
Hyp.</hi> i. 141.</note> This ninth mode is put eighth by Favorinus
and tenth by Sextus and Aenesidemus; moreover the tenth is put
eighth by Sextus and ninth by Favorinus.
</p> 
<p>The <hi
rend='ital'>tenth</hi> mode rests on inter-relation, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> between light and heavy, strong and weak,
greater and less, up and down. Thus that which is on the right is
not so by nature, but is so understood in virtue of its position
with respect to something else ; for, if that change its position,
the thing is no longer on the right. 

<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>

Similarly father and brother
are relative terms, day is relative to the sun, and all things
relative to our mind. Thus relative terms are in and by themselves
unknowable. These, then, are the ten modes of perplexity.
</p> <pb
n='501'/> 
<p>But Agrippa and his school add to them<note n='a'>Sext.
Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Pyrrh. Hyp.</hi> i. 37 <foreign lang='greek'>
o)/gdoos o( a)po\ tou= pro/s ti.</foreign> The intention of Agrippa was to
<hi rend='ital'>replace</hi> the ten modes by his five.</note> five
other modes, resulting respectively from disagreement, extension
<hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi>, relativity, hypothesis and
reciprocal inference. The mode arising from disagreement proves,
with regard to any inquiry whether in philosophy or in everyday
life, that it is full of the utmost contentiousness and confusion.
The mode which involves extension <hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi>
refuses to admit that what is sought to be proved is firmly
established, because one thing furnishes the ground for belief in
another, and so on <hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum.</hi> 

<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>

The mode
derived from relativity declares that a thing can never be
apprehended in and by itself, but only in connexion with something
else. Hence all things are unknowable. The mode resulting from
hypothesis arises when people suppose that you must take the most
elementary of things as of themselves entitled to credence, instead
of postulating them : which is useless, because some one else will
adopt the contrary hypothesis. The mode arising from reciprocal
inference is found whenever that which should be confirmatory of the
thing requiring to be proved itself has to borrow credit from the
latter, as, for example, if anyone seeking to establish the
existence of pores on the ground that emanations take place should
take this (the existence of pores) as proof that there are
emanations.<note n='b'>This is what is commonly called arguing in a
circle.</note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="90"/>
<p>They would deny all demonstration, criterion,
sign, cause, motion, the process of learning, coming into being, or
that there is anything good or bad by nature. For all demonstration,
say they, is constructed out of things either already proved or
indemonstrable. If out of things already proved, those things too
will require some demonstration,
<pb n='503'/> 
and so on <hi
rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi> ; if out of things indemonstrable,
then, whether all or some or only a single one of the steps are the
subject of doubt, the whole is indemonstrable.<note n='a'>Compare
Sext. Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Pyrrh. Hyp.</hi> ii. 185. "The dogmatists
assert that the sceptical arguments against demonstration are either
demonstrative or non-demonstrative. If the latter, they fail to
establish their point [namely, that there is no such thing as
demonstration] ; if the former, the Sceptics by assuming
demonstration confute themselves."</note> If you think, they add,
that there are some things which need no demonstration, yours must
be a rare intellect, not to see that you must first have
demonstration of the very fact that the things you refer to carry
conviction in themselves. 

<milestone unit="section" n="91"/>

Nor must we prove that the elements are
four from the fact that the elements are four. Besides, if we
discredit particular demonstrations, we cannot accept the
generalization from them. And in order that we may know that an
argument constitutes a demonstration, we require a criterion ; but
again, in order that we may know that it is a criterion we require a
demonstration ; hence both the one and the other are
incomprehensible, since each is referred to the other. How then are
we to grasp the things which are uncertain, seeing that we know no
demonstration ? For what we wish to ascertain is not whether
things appear to be such and such, but whether they are so in their
essence.
</p> 
<p>They declared the dogmatic philosophers to be fools,
observing that what is concluded <hi rend='ital'>ex hypothesi</hi>
is properly described not as inquiry but assumption, and by
reasoning of this kind one may even argue for impossibilities. As
for those who think that 

<milestone unit="section" n="92"/>

we should not judge of truth from
surrounding circumstances or legislate on the basis of what is
found in nature, these men, they used to say, made themselves the
measure of all things, and did not see that every phenomenon appears
in a certain disposition and in a certain reciprocal relation to
surrounding circumstances. Therefore we must affirm either that
all
<pb n='505'/> 
things are true or that all things are
false. For if certain things only are true [and others are false],
how are we to distinguish them ?  Not by the senses, where things in
the field of sense are in question, since all these things appear to
sense to be on an equal footing; nor by the mind, for the same
reason. Yet apart from these faculties there is no other, so far as
we can see, to help us to a judgement. Whoever therefore, they say,
would be firmly assured about anything sensible or intelligible must
first establish the received opinions about it ; for some have
refuted one doctrine, others another. But things must be judged
either by the sensible or by the intelligible, 

<milestone unit="section" n="93"/>

and both are
disputed. Therefore it is impossible to pronounce judgement on
opinions about sensibles or intelligibles ; and if the conflict in
our thoughts compels us to disbelieve every one, the standard or
measure, by which it is held that all things are exactly determined,
will be destroyed, and we must deem every statement of equal value.
Further, say they, our partner in an inquiry into a phenomenon is
either to be trusted or not. If he is, he will have nothing to reply
to the man to whom it appears to be the opposite<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> to be not a serpent, but a coil of
rope.</note> ; for just as our friend who describes what appears to
him is to be trusted, so is his opponent. If he is not to be
trusted, he will actually be disbelieved when he describes what
appears to him.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="94"/>
<p>We must not assume that what convinces us is
actually true. For the same thing does not convince every one, nor
even the same people always. Persuasiveness sometimes depends on
external circumstances, on the reputation of the speaker,
</p> <pb
n='507'/> 
<p>on his ability as a thinker or his artfulness, on the
familiarity or the pleasantness of the topic.
</p> 
<p>Again, they
would destroy the criterion by reasoning of this kind. Even the
criterion has either been critically determined or not. If it has
not, it is definitely untrustworthy, and in its purpose of
distinguishing is no more true than false. If it has, it will belong
to the class of particular judgements, so that one and the same
thing determines and is determined, and the criterion which has
determined will have to be determined by another, that other by
another, and so on <hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum.</hi> 

<milestone unit="section" n="95"/>

In addition to
this there is disagreement as to the criterion, some holding that
man is the criterion, while for some it is the senses, for others
reason, for others the apprehensive presentation. Now man disagrees
with man and with himself, as is shown by differences of laws and
customs. The senses deceive, and reason says different things.
Finally, the apprehensive presentation is judged by the mind, and
the mind itself changes in various ways. Hence the criterion is
unknowable, and consequently truth also.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="96"/>
<p>They deny, too, that
there is such a thing as a sign. If there is, they say, it must
either be sensible or intelligible. Now it is not sensible, because
what is sensible is a common attribute, whereas a sign is a
particular thing. Again, the sensible is one of the things which
exist by way of difference, while the sign belongs to the category
of relative. Nor is a sign an object of thought, for objects of
thought are of four kinds, apparent judgements on things apparent,
non-apparent judgements on things nonapparent, non-apparent on
apparent, or apparent on non-apparent ; and a sign is none of these,
so
<pb n='509'/> 
that there is no such thing as a sign. A
sign is not "apparent on apparent," for what is apparent needs no
sign ; nor is it non-apparent on non-apparent, for what is revealed
by something must needs appear ; nor is it non-apparent on apparent,
for that which is to afford the means of apprehending something
else must itself be apparent ;

<milestone unit="section" n="97"/>

nor, lastly, is it apparent on
non-apparent, because the sign, being relative, must be apprehended
along with that of which it is the sign, which is not here the case.
It follows that nothing uncertain can be apprehended ; for it is
through signs that uncertain things are said to be apprehended.<note
n='a'>This conclusion would debar us from all extension of knowledge
beyond what is apparent here and now ; whereas the dogmatists permit
us from such facts to advance to what is not immediately evident,
the realm of the unknown or as yet unascertained <foreign lang='greek'>( a)/dhlon).</foreign></note>.
</p> 
<p>Causes, too, they
destroy in this way. A cause is something relative ; for it is
relative to what can be caused, namely, the effect. But things which
are relative are merely objects of thought and have no substantial
existence. 

<milestone unit="section" n="98"/>

Therefore a cause can only be an object of thought ;
inasmuch as, if it be a cause, it must bring with it that of which
it is said to be the cause, otherwise it will not be a cause. Just
as a father, in the absence of that in relation to which he is
called father, will not be a father, so too with a cause. But that
in relation to which the cause is thought of, namely the effect, is
not present ; for there is no coming into being or passing away or
any other process : therefore there is no such thing as cause.
Furthermore, if there is a cause, either bodies are the cause of
bodies, or things incorporeal of things incorporeal ; but neither is
the case ; therefore there is no such thing as cause. Body in fact
could not be the cause of body, inasmuch as both have the same
nature. And if either is
<pb n='511'/> 
called a cause in so
far as it is a body, the other, being a body, will become a cause.

<milestone unit="section" n="99"/>
But if both be alike causes, there will be nothing to be acted upon
Nor can an incorporeal thing be the cause of an incorporeal thing,
for the same reason. And a thing incorporeal cannot be the cause of
a body, since nothing incorporeal creates anything corporeal. And,
lastly, a body cannot be the cause of anything incorporeal, because
what is produced must be of the material operated upon ; but if it
is not operated upon because it is incorporeal, it cannot be
produced by anything whatever. Therefore there is no such thing as a
cause. A corollary to this is their statement that the first
principles of the universe have no real existence ; for in that case
something must have been there to create and act.
</p> 
<p>Furthermore
there is no motion ; for that which moves moves either in the place
where it is or in a place where it is not. But it cannot move in the
place where it is, still less in any place where it is not.
Therefore there is no such thing as motion.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="100"/>
<p>They used also to
deny the possibility of learning. If anything is taught, they say,
either the existent is taught through its existence or the
non-existent through its non-existence. But the existent is not
taught through its existence, for the nature of existing things is
apparent to and recognized by all ; nor is the non-existent taught
through the nonexistent, for with the non-existent nothing is ever
done, so that it cannot be taught to anyone.
</p> 
<p>Nor, say they,
is there any coming into being. For that which is does not come into
being, since it <hi rend='ital'>is</hi> ; nor yet that which is not,
for it has no sub-
<pb n='513'/> 
stantial existence, and that
which is neither substantial nor existent cannot have had the
chance of coming into being either.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="101"/>
<p>There is nothing good or
bad by nature, for if there is anything good or bad by nature, it
must be good or bad for all persons alike, just as snow is cold to
all. But there is no good or bad which is such to all persons in
common ; therefore there is no such thing as good or bad by nature.
For either all that is thought good by anyone whatever must be
called good, or not all. Certainly all cannot be so called ; since
one and the same thing is thought good by one person and bad by
another ; for instance, Epicurus thought pleasure good and
Antisthenes thought it bad ; thus on our supposition it will follow
that the same thing is both good and bad. But if we say that not all
that anyone thinks good is good, we shall have to judge the
different opinions ; and this is impossible because of the equal
validity of opposing arguments. Therefore the good by nature is
unknowable.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="102"/>
<p>The whole of their mode of inference can be
gathered from their extant treatises. Pyrrho himself, indeed, left
no writings, but his associates Timon, Aenesidemus, Numenius and
Nausiphanes did ; and others as well.
</p> 
<p>The dogmatists answer
them by declaring that the Sceptics themselves do apprehend and
dogmatize; for when they are thought to be refuting their hardest
they do apprehend, for at the very same time they are asseverating
and dogmatizing. Thus even when they declare that they determine
nothing, and that to every argument there is an opposite argument,
they are actually determining these very points and
dogmatizing.

<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>

<note n='a'>&sect; 77.</note>The others reply, "We
</p> <pb
n='515'/> 
<p>confess to human weaknesses ; for we recognize that it
is day and that we are alive, and many other apparent facts in life
; but with regard to the things about which our opponents argue so
positively, claiming to have definitely apprehended them, we suspend
our judgement because they are not certain, and confine knowledge to
our impressions.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> all we know is
that we feel. <hi rend='ital'>Cf. supra,</hi> ii.&sect; 92.</note> For we
admit that we see, and we recognize that we think this or that, but
how we see or how we think we know not. And we say in conversation
that a certain thing appears white, but we are not positive that it
really is white. As to our `We determine nothing' and the like,<note
n='b'>&sect; 74.</note> we use the expressions in an undogmatic sense, 

<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>

for
they are not like the assertion that the world is spherical. Indeed
the latter statement is not certain, but the others are mere
admissions. Thus in saying `We determine nothing,' we are <hi
rend='ital'>not</hi> determining even that."
</p> 
<p>Again, the
dogmatic philosophers maintain that the Sceptics do away with life
itself, in that they reject all that life consists in. The others
say this is false, for they do not deny that we see ; they only say
that they do not know how we see. "We admit the apparent fact," say
they, "without admitting that it really is what it appears to be."
We also perceive that fire burns ; as to whether it is its nature to
burn, we suspend our judgement. 

<milestone unit="section" n="105"/>

We see that a man moves, and that he
perishes ; how it happens we do not know. We merely object to
accepting the unknown substance behind phenomena. When we say a
picture has projections, we are describing what is apparent ; but if
we say that it has no projections, we are then speaking, not of what
is apparent, but of something else. This is
<pb n='517'/>

what makes Timon say in his <hi rend='ital'>Python</hi> that he
has not gone outside what is customary. And again in the <hi
rend='ital'>Conceits</hi> he says<note n='a'>Fr. 69 D.</note> :
</p>

<p><hi rend='center'>But the apparent is omnipotent wherever it goes
;</hi>
</p> 
<p>and in his work <hi rend='ital'>On the Senses,</hi> "I
do not lay it down that honey is sweet, but I admit that it appears
to be so."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="106"/>

<p>Aenesidemus too in the first book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Pyrrhonean Discourses</hi> says that Pyrrho determines
nothing dogmatically, because of the possibility of contradiction,
but guides himself by apparent facts. Aenesidemus says the same in
his works <hi rend='ital'>Against Wisdom</hi> and <hi rend='ital'>On
Inquiry.</hi> Furthermore Zeuxis, the friend of Aenesidemus, in his
work <hi rend='ital'>On Two-sided Arguments,</hi> Antiochus of
Laodicea, and Apellas in his <hi rend='ital'>Agrippa</hi> all hold
to phenomena alone. Therefore the apparent is the Sceptic's
criterion, as indeed Aenesidemus says ; and so does Epicurus. Democritus, however, denied that any apparent fact could be a criterion,
indeed he denied the very existence of the apparent. 

<milestone unit="section" n="107"/>

Against this
criterion of appearances the dogmatic philosophers urge that, when
the same appearances produce in us different impressions, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> a round or square tower, the Sceptic, unless
he gives the preference to one or other, will be unable to take any
course ; if on the other hand, say they, he follows either view, he
is then no longer allowing equal value to all apparent facts. The
Sceptics reply that, when different impressions are produced, they
must both be said to appear<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the
one has as much right to be called an appearance as the
other.</note> ; for things which are apparent are so called because
they appear. The end to be realized they hold to be suspension of
judgement, which brings with it
<pb n='519'/> 
tranquillity
like its shadow : so Timon and Aenesidemus declare. 

<milestone unit="section" n="108"/>

For in matters
which are for us to decide we shall neither choose this nor shrink
from that ; and things which are not for us to decide but happen of
necessity, such as hunger, thirst and pain, we cannot escape,<note

when the dogmatists argue that he may thus live in such a frame of
mind that he would not shrink from killing and eating his own father
if ordered to do so, the Sceptic replies that he will be able so to
live as to suspend his judgement in cases where it is a question of
arriving at the truth, but not in matters of life and the taking of
precautions. Accordingly we may choose a thing or shrink from a
thing by habit and may observe rules and customs. According to some
authorities the end proposed by the Sceptics is insensibility ;
according to others, gentleness.<note n='b'><hi

to Tiberius Caesar, was the son of Timarchus and a native of Phlius.
Losing his parents when young, he became a stage-dancer, but
later
<pb n='521'/> 
took a dislike to that pursuit and went
abroad to Megara to stay with Stilpo ; then after some time he
returned home and married. After that he went to Pyrrho at Elis with
his wife, and lived there until his children were born ; the elder
of these he called Xanthus, taught him medicine, and made him his
heir. 

<milestone unit="section" n="110"/>

This son was a man of high repute, as we learn from Sotion in
his eleventh book. Timon, however, found himself without means of
support and sailed to the Hellespont and Propontis. Living now at
Chalcedon as a sophist, he increased his reputation still further
and, having made his fortune, went to Athens, where he lived until
his death, except for a short period which he spent at Thebes. He
was known to King Antigonus and to Ptolemy Philadelphus, as his
own iambics<note n='a'>Possibly the proem of the <hi
rend='ital'>Silli.</hi></note> testify.
</p> 
<p>He was, according to
Antigonus, fond of wine, and in the time that he could spare from
philosophy he used to write poems. These included epics, tragedies,
satyric dramas, thirty comedies and sixty tragedies, besides <hi
rend='ital'>silli</hi> (lampoons) and obscene poems. 

<milestone unit="section" n="111"/>

There are also
reputed works of his extending to twenty thousand verses which are
mentioned by Antigonus of Carystus, who also wrote his life. There
are three <hi rend='ital'>silli</hi> in which, from his point of
view as a Sceptic, he abuses every one and lampoons the dogmatic
philosophers, using the form of parody. In the first he speaks in
the first person throughout, the second and third are in the form of
dialogues ; for he represents himself as questioning Xenophanes of
Colophon about each philosopher in turn, while Xenophanes answers
him ; in the second he speaks of the more ancient philosophers, in
the third of the
<pb n='523'/> 
later, which is why some have
entitled it the Epilogue. 

<milestone unit="section" n="112"/>

The first deals with the same subjects,
except that the poem is a monologue. It begins as follows<note
n='a'>Fr. 1 D.</note> :
</p> 
<p><hi rend='center'>Ye sophists, ye
inquisitives, come ! follow !</hi>
</p> 
<p>He died at the age of
nearly ninety, so we learn from Antigonus and from Sotion in his
eleventh book. I have heard that he had only one eye ; indeed he
used to call himself a Cyclops. There was another Timon, the
misanthrope.<note n='b'>Diels regards the passage from <foreign lang='greek'>kai\ e)/ph,</foreign>&sect; 110, down to <foreign lang='greek'>*ti/mwn o( misa/nq rwpos,</foreign>&sect; 112, as an insertion,
disturbing the symmetry of the materials derived from Antigonus of
Carystus.</note>
</p> 
<p>Now this philosopher, according to
Antigonus, was very fond of gardens and preferred to mind his own
affairs. At all events there is a story that Hieronymus the
Peripatetic said of him, "Just as with the Scythians those who are
in flight shoot as well as those who pursue, so, among philosophers,
some catch their disciples by pursuing them, some by fleeing from
them, as for instance Timon."
</p>

<p>He was quick to perceive
anything and to turn up his nose in scorn ; he was fond of writing
and at all times good at sketching plots for poets and collaborating in dramas. He used to give the dramatists Alexander and Homer
materials for their tragedies.<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi>
he collaborated with these two tragic poets, Alexander the
Aetolian and Homer of Byzantinum, partly by furnishing them with
plots, partly by handing over scenes from unpublished plays of his
own, or other similar material.</note> When disturbed by
maidservants and dogs, he would stop writing, his earnest desire
being to maintain tranquillity. Aratus is said to have asked him
how he could obtain a trustworthy text of Homer, to which he
replied, "You can, if you get hold of the ancient copies, and not
the corrected copies of our day." He used to let his own poems lie
about, sometimes
<pb n='525'/> 
half eaten away.

Hence, when
he came to read parts of them to Zopyrus the orator, he would turn
over the pages and recite whatever came handy ; then, when he was
half through, he would discover the piece which he had been looking
for in vain, so careless was he.<note n='a'>Similar carelessness is
recorded of Lamartine.</note> Furthermore, he was so easy-going that
he would readily go without his dinner. They say that once, when he
saw Arcesilaus passing through the "knaves-market," he said, "What
business have you to come here, where we are all free men ?" He was
constantly in the habit of quoting, to those who would admit the
evidence of the senses when confirmed by the judgement of the
mind, the line--

partridge and woodcock may be meant, not any Mr. Partridge and Mr.

</p> 
<p>Jesting in this fashion was habitual
with him. When a man marvelled at everything, he said, "Why do you
not marvel that we three have but four eyes between us ?" for in
fact he himself had only one eye, as also had his disciple
Dioscurides, while the man whom he addressed was normal.

</p> 
<p>According to Menodotus he left no successor,
but his school lapsed until Ptolemy of Cyrene re-established it.

They are followed by
Posidonius the Stoic and his school, and Nicolaus and Sotion in the
twelfth book of his work entitled <hi rend='ital'>Dioclean
Refutations</hi>, consisting of twenty-four books ; also by
Dionysius of Halicarnassus. They allege that he used to go round

brothers was a pander and
<pb n='533'/> 
lived with Leontion
the courtesan ; that he put forward as his own the doctrines of
Democritus about atoms and of Aristippus about pleasure ; that he
was not a genuine Athenian citizen, a charge brought by Timocrates
and by Herodotus in a book <hi rend='ital'>On the Training of

him in his letters Apollo's titles of Healer and Lord. 

<milestone unit="section" n="5"/>

Furthermore
that he extolled Idomeneus, Herodotus, and Timocrates, who had
published his esoteric doctrines, and flattered them for that very
reason. Also that in his letters he wrote to Leontion, "O Lord
Apollo, my dear little Leontion, with what tumultuous applause we
were inspired as we read your letter." Then again to Themista, the
wife of Leonteus : "I am quite ready, if you do not come to see me,
to spin thrice on my own axis and be propelled to any place that
you, including Themista, agree upon" ; and to the beautiful
Pythocles he writes : "I will sit down and await thy divine advent,
my heart's desire." And, as Theodorus says in the fourth book of his
work, <hi rend='ital'>Against Epicurus</hi>, in another letter to
Themista he thinks he preaches to her.<note n='b'>A perplexing

<milestone unit="section" n="6"/>

It is added that he corresponded
with many courtesans, and especially with Leontion, of whom Metrodorus also was enamoured. It is observed too that in his treatise
<hi rend='ital'>On the Ethical End</hi> he writes in these
</p> <pb
n='535'/> 
<p>terms<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Athen. xii.
546 e, who cites the concluding words more fully thus : <foreign lang='greek'>kai\ ta\s dia\ morfh=s kat' o)/yin h(dei/as kinh/se

of D. L., vii. 278 f. <hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> also Cic. <hi
rend='ital'>Tusc. Disp.</hi> iii. 41. The last words have been taken
to refer especially to the pleasures afforded by music and again by
painting and the plastic arts. But perhaps Epicurus is merely citing
typical examples of intense pleasures under the heads of the four
senses : (i.) taste ; (ii.) touch ; (iii.) hearing ; (iv.) seeing.
The omission of pleasant odours is curious ; <hi
rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Plato, <hi rend='ital'>Phil.</hi> 51 e <foreign lang='greek'>qei=on ge/nos h(donw=n.</foreign></note> : "I know not how
to conceive the good, apart from the pleasures of taste, sexual
pleasures, the pleasures of sound and the pleasures of beautiful
form." And in his letter to Pythocles : "Hoist all sail, my dear
boy, and steer clear of all culture." Epictetus calls him preacher
of effeminacy and showers abuse on him.
</p> 
<p>Again there was
Timocrates, the brother of Metrodorus, who was his disciple and then
left the school. He in the book entitled <hi
rend='ital'>Merriment</hi> asserts that Epicurus vomited twice a day
from over-indulgence, and goes on to say that he himself had much
ado to escape from those notorious midnight philosophizings and
the confraternity with all its secrets ; 

<milestone unit="section" n="7"/>

further, that Epicurus's
acquaintance with philosophy was small and his acquaintance with
life even smaller ; that his bodily health was pitiful,<note
n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Aelian, Fr. 39 (<hi rend='ital'>De
Epicuro eiusque discipulis</hi>). According to him the three
brothers of Epicurus were all victims of disease. Plutarch (<hi
rend='ital'>Non posse suaviter</hi>, etc., 1097 e) mentions the
dropsy. However much his ailments were exaggerated by his enemies,
they do not seem to have hindered him from literary work.</note> so
much so that for many years he was unable to rise from his chair ;
and that he spent a whole mina daily on his table, as he himself
says in his letter to Leontion and in that to the philosophers at
Mitylene. Also that among other courtesans who consorted with him
and Metrodorus were Mammarion and Hedia and Erotion and Nikidion. He
alleges too that in his thirtyseven books <hi rend='ital'>On
Nature</hi> Epicurus uses much repetition and writes largely in
sheer opposition to others,
<pb n='537'/> 
especially to
Nausiphanes, and here are his own words : "Nay, let them go hang :
for, when labouring with an idea, he too had the sophist's off-hand
boast-fulness like many another servile soul" ; besides, he himself
in his letters says of Nausiphanes : "This so maddened him that he
abused me and called me pedagogue."

<p>But these people are stark mad. For our philosopher
has abundance of witnesses to attest his unsurpassed goodwill to all
men--his native land, which honoured him with statues in bronze ;
his friends, so many in number that they could hardly be counted by
whole cities, and indeed all who knew him, held fast as they were by
the siren-charms of his doctrine, save Metrodorus<note n='d'>This
man (not to be confounded with the more famous Metrodorus of
Lampsacus, <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi>&sect; 22) must belong to the second
century b.c., if he was a contemporary of Carneades (<hi

</p><pb

<p>went over to Carneades, being perhaps burdened by his
master's excessive goodness ; the School itself which, while nearly
all the others have died out, continues for ever without
interruption through numberless reigns of one scholarch after
another<note n='a'>So Aristocles ; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Euseb.

that this defence of Epicurus might be ascribed to D. L. himself.
If, however, we compare the list of calum-niators of Epicurus cited
in &sect;&sect; 3, 4, we see that none of them is later than the Augustan age. To
the same date belongs a passage in the article of Suidas on

his gratitude to his parents, his generosity to his
brothers, his gentleness to his servants, as evidenced by the terms
of his will and by the fact that they were members of the School,
the most eminent of them being the aforesaid Mys ; and in general,
his benevolence to all mankind. His piety towards the gods and his
affection for his country no words can describe. He carried
deference to others to such excess that he did not even enter public
life. He spent all his life in Greece, notwithstanding the
calamities which had befallen her in that age<note n='b'>In the
siege of Athens he is said to have maintained his disciples,
counting out to each his ration of beans (Plut. <hi
rend='ital'>Demetr.</hi> 34).</note> ; when he did once or twice
take a trip to Ionia, it was to visit his friends there.<note
n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. Epist.</hi> 32 (Fr. 176 Usener). This
celebrated letter to a child was written from Lampsacus on such a
journey.</note> Friends indeed came to him from all parts and lived
with him in his garden. This is stated by Apollodorus, 

<milestone unit="section" n="11"/>

who also says
that he purchased the garden for eighty minae ; and to the same
effect Diocles in the third book of his <hi rend='ital'>Epitome</hi>
speaks of them as living a very simple and frugal life ; at all
events they were content with half a pint of thin wine and were, for
the rest, thoroughgoing water-drinkers. He further says that
Epicurus did not think it right that their property should be held
in common, as required by the maxim of
<pb n='541'/>

Pythagoras about the goods of friends ; such a practice in his
opinion implied mistrust, and without confidence there is no
friendship. In his correspondence he himself mentions that he was
content with plain bread and water. And again : "Send me a little
pot of cheese, that, when I like, I may fare sumptuously." Such was
the man who laid down that pleasure was the end of life. And here is
the epigram<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Anth. Plan.</hi> iv.
43.</note> in which Athenaeus eulogizes him :
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="12"/>
<p>Ye toil, O men,
for paltry things and incessantly begin strife and war for gain ;
but nature's wealth extends to a moderate bound, whereas vain
judgements have a limitless range. This message Neocles' wise son
heard from the Muses or from the sacred tripod at Delphi.<note
n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Petronius, <hi rend='ital'>Sat.</hi>
132.</note>
</p> 
<p>And, as we go on, we shall know this better from
his doctrines and his sayings.
</p> 
<p>Among the early philosophers,
says Diocles, his favourite was Anaxagoras, although he occasionally
disagreed with him, and Archelaus the teacher of Socrates. Diocles
adds that he used to train his friends in committing his treatises
to memory.<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. infra</hi>, &sect;&sect; 36,
83.</note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="13"/>
<p>Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi>
tells us that our philosopher was a pupil of Nausiphanes and Praxiphanes<note n='d'>If this Praxiphanes was the pupil of Theophrastus,
considerations of age would make it highly improbable that he
could have taught Epicurus ; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Usener, Fr.
123.</note> ; but in his letter to Eurylochus, Epicurus himself
denies it and says that he was self-taught. Both Epicurus and
Hermarchus deny the very existence of Leucippus the philosopher,
though by some and by Apollodorus the Epicurean he is said to have
been the teacher of Democritus. Demetrius the Magnesian affirms that
Epicurus also attended the lectures of Xenocrates.
</p> <pb n='543'/>

<p>The terms he used for things were the ordinary terms, and
Aristophanes the grammarian credits him with a very characteristic
style. He was so lucid a writer that in the work <hi rend='ital'>On
Rhetoric</hi> he makes clearness the sole requisite. 

<milestone unit="section" n="14"/>

And in his
correspondence he replaces the usual greeting, "I wish you joy," by
wishes for welfare and right living, "May you do well," and "Live
well."
</p> 
<p>Ariston<note n='a'>This is no doubt the Academic
philosopher, Ariston of Alexandria, pupil of Antiochus, criticized
by Philodemus in his Rhetoric, <hi rend='ital'>V.H.</hi><hi
rend='super'>2</hi> iii. 168.</note> says in his <hi
rend='ital'>Life of Epicurus</hi> that he derived his work entitled
<hi rend='ital'>The Canon</hi> from the <hi rend='ital'>Tripod</hi>
of Nausiphanes, adding that Epicurus had been a pupil of this man as
well as of the Platonist Pamphilus<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Suidas, <hi rend='ital'>s.v.</hi>; Cic. <hi
rend='ital'>N.D.</hi> i. 72.</note> in Samos. Further, that he began
to study philosophy when he was twelve years old, and started his
own school at thirty-two.
</p> 
<p>He was born, according to
Apollodorus in his <hi rend='ital'>Chronology</hi>, in the third
year of the 109th Olympiad, in the archonship of Sosigenes,<note
n='c'>341 b.c.</note> on the seventh day of the month Gamelion,<note
n='d'>The eighth month of the Attic civil year. Thus he would be
born about February, 341 b.c. Plato died 347 b.c.</note> in the
seventh year after the death of Plato.

<milestone unit="section" n="15"/>

When he was thirty-two he
founded a school of philosophy, first in Mitylene and Lampsacus, and
then five years later removed to Athens, where he died in the second
year of the 127th Olympiad,<note n='e'>271-270 b.c.</note> in the
archonship of Pytharatus, at the age of seventy-two ; and Hermarchus
the son of Agemortus, a Mitylenaean, took over the School. Epicurus
died of renal calculus after an illness which lasted a fortnight :
so Hermarchus tells us in his letters. Hermippus relates that he
entered a bronze bath of lukewarm water and asked for unmixed
wine,
<pb n='545'/> 

<milestone unit="section" n="16"/>
which he swallowed, and then, having
bidden his friends remember his doctrines, breathed his last.
</p>

<p>Here is something of my own about him<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> vii. 106.</note> :
</p> 
<p>Farewell, my
friends ; the truths I taught hold fast :
</p> 
<p>Thus Epicurus
spake, and breathed his last.
</p> 
<p>He sat in a warm bath and neat
wine quaff'd,
</p> 
<p>And straightway found chill death in that same
draught.
</p> 
<p>Such was the life of the sage and such his end.
</p>

<p>His last will was as follows : "On this wise I give and bequeath
all my property to Amynomachus, son of Philocrates of Bate and
Timocrates, son of Demetrius of Potamus, to each severally according
to the items of the deed of gift laid up in the Metro&ouml;n, 

<milestone unit="section" n="17"/>

on condition
that they shall place the garden and all that pertains to it at the
disposal of Hermarchus, son of Agemortus, of Mitylene, and the
members of his society, and those whom Hermarchus may leave as his
successors, to live and study in.<note n='b'><hi

entrust to my School in perpetuity the task of aiding Amynomachus
and Timocrates and their heirs to preserve to the best of their
power the common life in the garden in whatever way is best, and
that these also (the heirs of the trustees) may help to maintain the
garden in the same way as those to whom our successors in the School
may bequeath it. And let Amynomachus and Timocrates permit
Hermarchus and his fellow-members to live in the house in Melite for
the lifetime of Hermarchus.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="18"/>
<p>"And from the revenues made over
by me to Amynomachus and Timocrates let them to the best of their
power in consultation with Hermarchus make separate provision (1)
for the funeral offerings to my

father, mother,
and brothers, and (2) for the customary celebration of my birthday
on the tenth day of Gamelion in each year, and for the meeting of
all my School held every month on the twentieth day to commemorate
Metrodorus and myself according to the rules now in force.<note
n='a'>That this custom lasted in the school for centuries is proved
by the testimony of Cicero (<hi rend='ital'>De fin.</hi> ii. 101)
and Pliny (<hi rend='ital'>H.N.</hi> xxxv. 5), as well as by the
epigram of Philodemus (<hi rend='ital'>Anth. Pal.</hi> xi. 44). <hi

<p>"And let Amynomachus and Timocrates take care of

</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>
<p>And when near his end he
wrote the following letter to Idomeneus :
</p> 
<p>"On this blissful
day, which is also the last of my life, I write this to you. My
continual sufferings from strangury and dysentery are so great that
nothing could augment them ; but over against them all I set
gladness of mind at the remembrance of our past conversations. But I
would have you, as becomes your life-long attitude to me and to
philosophy, watch over the children of Metrodorus."
</p> 
<p>Such were
the terms of his will.

<p>Among his disciples, of

n='a'>Metrodorus (330-277 b.c.) was the master's beloved disciple ;
but the encomium preserved by Seneca (<hi rend='ital'>Ep.</hi> 52.

ope aliena, non ituros si nemo praecesserit, sed bene secuturos : ex

Timocrates) and of Sande, a citizen of Lampsacus, who from his first
acquaintance with Epicurus never left him except once for six months
spent on a visit to his native place, from which he returned to him
again. 

<milestone unit="section" n="23"/>

His goodness was proved in all ways, as Epicurus testifies in
the introductions<note n='b'>Epicurus seems to have prefixed
dedications or other short notices to the separate books of his

the <hi rend='ital'>Timocrates.</hi> Such he was : he gave his
sister Batis to Idomeneus to wife, and himself took Leontion the
Athenian courtesan as his concubine. He showed dauntless courage in
meeting troubles and death, as Epicurus declares in the first book
of his memoir. He died, we learn, seven years before Epicurus in his
fiftythird year, and Epicurus himself in his will already cited
clearly speaks of him as departed, and enjoins upon his executors to
make provision for Metrodorus's children. The above-mentioned
Timocrates<note n='c'>This second mention of Timocrates (see &sect; 6) may
have been a marginal note, not very suitably placed, intended to
distinguish the renegade Timocrates from his namesake, one of
Epicurus' executors (&sect; 18).</note>also, the brother of Metrodorus and
a giddy fellow, was another of his pupils.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="24"/>
<p>Metrodorus wrote
the following works :

Philodemus and his pupils affirm. Next came Epicurus's successor
Hermarchus, son of Agemortus, a citizen of Mitylene, the son of a

<p>There are

wrote a work to prove that life is impossible by the rules of any

</p> 
<p>There were three other men who bore the name
of Epicurus : one the son of Leonteus and Themista ; another a
Magnesian by birth ; and a third, a drillsergeant.
</p> 
<p>Epicurus
was a most prolific author and eclipsed all before him in the number
of his writings : for they amount to about three hundred rolls, and
contain not a single citation from other authors ; it is Epicurus
himself who speaks throughout. Chrysippus tried to outdo him in
authorship according to Carneades, who therefore calls him the
literary parasite of Epicurus. "For every subject treated by
Epicurus, Chrysippus in his contentiousness must treat at equal
length ; 

<milestone unit="section" n="27"/>

hence he has frequently repeated himself and set down the
first thought that occurred to him, and in his haste has left things
unrevised, and he has so many citations that they alone fill his
books : nor is this unexampled in Zeno and Aristotle." Such, then,
in number and character are the writings of Epicurus, the best of
which are the following :

<p>The views expressed in these works I will
try to set forth by quoting three of his epistles, in which he has
given an epitome of his whole system. I

<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>

will also set down his <hi
rend='ital'>Sovran Maxims</hi> and any other utterance of his that
seems worth citing, that you may be in a position to study the
philosopher on all sides and know how to judge him.
</p> 
<p>The first
epistle is addressed to Herodotus and deals with physics ; the
second to Pythocles and deals with astronomy or meteorology ; the
third is addressed to Menoeceus and its subject is human life. We
must begin with the first after some few preliminary remarks<note
n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi>&sect;&sect; 29-34, the first of those summaries
of doctrine which take up so much of Book X.</note> upon his
division of philosophy.
</p> 
<p>It is divided into three
parts--Canonic, Physics, Ethics. 

<milestone unit="section" n="30"/>

Canonic forms the introduction to
the system and is contained in a single work entitled <hi
rend='ital'>The Canon.</hi> The physical part includes the entire
theory of Nature : it is contained in the thirty-seven books <hi
rend='ital'>Of Nature</hi> and, in a summary form, in the letters.
The ethical part deals with the facts of choice and aversion : this
may be found in the books <hi rend='ital'>On Human Life</hi>, in the
letters, and in his treatise <hi rend='ital'>Of the End.</hi> The
usual arrangement, however, is to conjoin canonic with physics, and
the former they call the science which deals with the standard and
the first principle, or the elementary part of philosophy, while
physics proper, they say, deals with becoming and perishing and with
nature ; ethics, on the other
<pb n='561'/> 
hand, deals with
things to be sought and avoided, with human life and with the
end-in-chief.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="31"/>
<p>They reject dialectic as superfluous ; holding
that in their inquiries the physicists should be content to employ
the ordinary terms for things.<note n='a'>An opinion often
emphasized : <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>&sect;&sect; 37, 73, 82, 152. <hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. iii. 931 <hi
rend='ital'>sqq.</hi></note>Now in <hi rend='ital'>The Canon</hi>
Epicurus affirms that our sensations and preconceptions and our
feelings are the standards of truth ; the Epicureans generally make
perceptions of mental presentations<note n='b'>Such mental pictures
are caused by atoms too fine to affect sense : <hi
rend='ital'>cf.</hi>&sect; 64<hi rend='ital'>infra</hi>; Lucr. ii. 740 <hi
rend='ital'>sqq.</hi>, iv. 722 <hi rend='ital'>sqq.</hi> ; Cic. <hi
rend='ital'>N.D.</hi> i. 54. On the whole subject consult Usener's
<hi rend='ital'>Epicurea</hi>, Fr. 242-265, and, more especially,
Sext. Emp. <hi rend='ital'>Adv. math.</hi> vii. 203-216.</note> to
be also standards. His own statements are also to be found in the
<hi rend='ital'>Summary</hi> addressed to Herodotus and in the <hi
rend='ital'>Sovran Maxims.</hi> Every sensation, he says, is devoid
of reason and incapable of memory ; for neither is it self-caused
nor, regarded as having an external cause, can it add anything
thereto or take anything therefrom. Nor is there anything which can
refute sensations or convict them of error : 

<milestone unit="section" n="32"/>

one sensation cannot
convict another and kindred sensation, for they are equally valid ;
nor can one sensation refute another which is not kindred but
heterogeneous, for the objects which the two senses judge are not
the same<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf. inf.</hi>&sect; 146.</note>; nor
again can reason refute them, for reason is wholly dependent on
sensation ; nor can one sense refute another, since we pay equal
heed to all. And the reality of separate perceptions guarantees<note
n='d'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the trustworthiness of the senses
(<foreign lang='greek'> ai)sqh/s ewn</foreign>) considered as
faculties of sense-perception : <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Sext. Emp.
<hi rend='ital'>Adv math.</hi> viii. 9 (Usener, Fr. 244).</note> the
truth of our senses. But seeing and hearing are just as real as
feeling pain. Hence it is from plain facts that we must start when
we draw inferences about the unknown.<note n='e'>More precisely
<foreign lang='greek'> a)/dhlon</foreign> =that which does not come
within the range of sense. Compare <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi>&sect; 38<foreign lang='greek'>to\ prosme/n on kai\ to\

obtained in &sect; 40. In &sect; 62 it is called<foreign lang='greek'>to\ prosdoc
azo/men on peri\ tou= a)ora/to u.</foreign></note> For all our notions
are derived from
<pb n='563'/> 
perceptions, either by actual
contact or by analogy, or resemblance, or composition, with some
slight aid from reasoning. And the objects presented to madmen<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Sext. Emp. <hi
rend='ital'>Adv. math.</hi> viii. 63.</note> and to people in dreams
are true, for they produce effects--<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi>
movements in the mind--which that which is unreal never does.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="33"/>
<p>By preconception they mean a sort of apprehension or a right
opinion or notion, or universal idea stored in the mind ; that is, a
recollection of an external object often presented, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> Such and such a thing is a man : for no sooner
is the word "man" uttered than we think of his shape by an act of
preconception, in which the senses take the lead.<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> in conformity with the sense-data which
precede the recognition.</note> Thus the object primarily denoted by
every term is then plain and clear. And we should never have started
an investigation, unless we had known what it was that we were in
search of. For example : The object standing yonder is a horse or a
cow. Before making this judgement, we must at some time or other
have known by preconception the shape of a horse or a cow. We should
not have given anything a name, if we had not first learnt its form
by way of preconception. It follows, then, that preconceptions are
clear. The object of a judgement is derived from something
previously clear, by reference to which we frame the proposition,
<hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> "How do we know that this is a man?"

<milestone unit="section" n="34"/>
Opinion they also call conception or assumption, and declare it to
be true and false<note n='c'>See &sect; 124, where a true <foreign lang='greek'> pro/lhyi s</foreign>is opposed to a false<foreign lang='greek'> u(po/lhyi s.</foreign> In Aristotle <foreign lang='greek'> u(po/lhyi s</foreign> is often a synonym of <foreign lang='greek'>do/ca :</foreign> <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Bonitz, <hi

subsequently confirmed or if it is not contradicted by evidence, and
false if it is not subsequently confirmed or is contradicted by
evidence. Hence the introduction of the phrase, "that which awaits"

typical example in the school of that process of testing beliefs by
observation which is here prescribed. <hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr.

<p>They affirm that there are two states of feeling, pleasure and

favourable and the other hostile to that being, and by their means
choice and avoidance are determined<note n='b'><hi

</p> 
<p>But we
must return to the letter.<note n='e'>The letter to Herodotus is the
second and most valuable instalment of Epicurean doctrine. 
The
manuscript seems to have been entrusted to a scribe to copy, just as
it was : scholia and marginal notes, even where they interrupt the
thread of the argument, have been faithfully reproduced. See &sect;&sect; 39, 40,

</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
<p>"For those who are unable to study
carefully all my physical writings or to go into the longer
treatises at all, I have myself prepared an epitome<note n='f'>This,
as the most authentic summary of Epicurean physics which we possess,
serves as a groundwork in modern histories, <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> Zeller's. The reader may also consult with
advantage Giussani, <hi rend='ital'>Studi Lucreziani</hi> (vol. i.
of his <hi rend='ital'>Lucretius</hi>); Bignone, <hi

Herodotus, to preserve in the memory enough of the principal
doctrines,<note n='g'>Only the principal doctrines are contained in
this epistle ; more, both general and particular, was given in the
<hi rend='ital'>Larger Compendium.</hi></note> to the end that on
every occasion they may be able to aid themselves on the most
important points, so far as they take up the study of Physics. Those
who have made some advance in the survey of the entire system
ought to fix in their minds under the principal headings an
<pb
n='567'/> 
elementary outline of the whole treatment of the
subject. For a comprehensive view is often required, the details but
seldom."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="36"/>
<p>"To the former, then--the main heads--we must
continually return, and must memorize them so far as to get a valid
conception of the facts, as well as the means of discovering all the
details exactly when once the general outlines are rightly
understood and remembered ; since it is the privilege of the mature
student to make a ready use of his conceptions by referring every
one of them to elementary facts and simple terms. For it is
impossible to gather up the results of continuous diligent study of
the entirety of things, unless we can embrace in short formulas and
hold in mind all that might have been accurately expressed even to
the minutest detail."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="37"/>
<p>"Hence, since such a course is of
service to all who take up natural science, I, who devote to the
subject my continuous energy and reap the calm enjoyment of a life
like this, have prepared for you just such an epitome and manual of
the doctrines as a whole."
</p> 
<p>"In the first place, Herodotus, you
must understand what it is that words denote, in order that by
reference to this we may be in a position to test opinions,
inquiries, or problems, so that our proofs may not run on untested
<hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi>, nor the terms we use be empty of
meaning. 

<milestone unit="section" n="38"/>

For the primary signification of every term employed must
be clearly seen, and ought to need no proving<note n='a'>Epicurus
explains this more fully in Fr. 258 (Usener, p. 189). For "proof"
and "proving" Bignone substitutes "declaration" and
"declare."</note>; this being necessary, if we are to have something
to which the point at issue or the problem or the opinion before us
can be referred."
</p> <pb n='569'/> 
<p>"Next, we must by all means
stick to our sensations, that is, simply to the present impressions
whether of the mind or of any criterion whatever, and similarly to
our actual feelings, in order that we may have the means of
determining that which needs confirmation and that which is
obscure."
</p> 
<p>"When this is clearly understood, it is time to
consider generally things which are obscure. To begin with, nothing
comes into being out of what is non-existent.<note n='a'>This is no
innovation of Epicurus but a tenet common to all the pre-Socratics :
the One, or Nature as a whole, assumed by the Ionians, is
unchangeable in respect of generation and destruction ; <hi
rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Aristotle, <hi rend='ital'>Met.</hi> i. 3. 984
a 31. The pluralists were naturally even more explicit : see the
wellknown fragments, Anax. 17 d, Emped. 8 d. Lucretius (i. 180 f.)
expands the doctrine.</note> For in that case anything would have
arisen out of anything, standing as it would in no need of its
proper germs.<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>&sect;&sect; 41, 54. Lucr. i.
125 f. is the best commentary.</note> 

<milestone unit="section" n="39"/>

And if that which disappears
had been destroyed and become non-existent, everything would have
perished, that into which the things were dissolved being
non-existent. Moreover, the sum total of things was always such as
it is now, and such it will ever remain. For there is nothing into
which it can change. For outside the sum of things there is nothing
which could enter into it and bring about the change."
</p>

<p>"Further [<hi rend='ital'>this he says also in the Larger Epitome
near the beginning and in his First Book "On Nature"</hi>], the
whole of being consists of bodies and space.<note n='c'>Usener's
insertion of "bodies and space" comes from &sect; 86;<hi
rend='ital'>cf.</hi>Diels,<hi rend='ital'>Dox. Gr.</hi> 581.
28.</note> For the existence of bodies is everywhere attested by
sense itself, and it is upon sensation that reason must rely when it
attempts to infer the unknown from the known. 

<milestone unit="section" n="40"/>

And if there were no
space (which we call also void and place and intangible
nature),<note n='d'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. i. 426.</note>
bodies would have nothing in which to be and
<pb n='571'/>

through which to move, as they are plainly seen to move. Beyond
bodies and space there is nothing which by mental apprehension or on
its analogy we can conceive to exist. When we speak of bodies and
space, both are regarded as wholes or separate things, not as the
properties or accidents of separate things.
</p> 
<p>"Again [<hi
rend='ital'>he repeats this in the First Book and in Books XIV. and
XV. of the work "On Nature" and in the Larger Epitome</hi>], of
bodies some are composite, others the elements of which these
composite bodies are made. 

<milestone unit="section" n="41"/>

These elements are indivisible and unchangeable, and necessarily so, if things are not all to be
destroyed and pass into non-existence, but are to be strong enough
to endure when the composite bodies are broken up, because they
possess a solid nature and are incapable of being anywhere or anyhow dissolved.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi>&sect; 54.</note> It
follows that the first beginnings must be indivisible, corporeal
entities.
</p> 
<p>"Again, the sum of things is infinite. For what is
finite has an extremity, and the extremity of anything is discerned
only by comparison with something else. (Now the sum of things is
not discerned by comparison with anything else :<note n='b'>The
missing premiss is supplied by Cicero, <hi rend='ital'>De div.</hi>
ii. 103 "at quod omne est, id non cernitur ex alio extrinsecus." <hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. i. 960.</note>) hence, since it has no
extremity, it has no limit ; and, since it has no limit, it must be
unlimited or infinite."
</p> 
<p>"Moreover, the sum of things is
unlimited both by reason of the multitude of the atoms and the
extent of the void. 

<milestone unit="section" n="42"/>

For if the void were infinite and bodies finite,
the bodies would not have stayed anywhere but would have been
dispersed in their course through the infinite void, not having any
supports or counter-
<pb n='573'/> 
checks to send them back
on their upward rebound. Again, if the void were finite, the
infinity of bodies would not have anywhere to be."
</p>

<p>"Furthermore, the atoms, which have no void in them--out of which
composite bodies arise and into which they are dissolved--vary
indefinitely in their shapes ; for so many varieties of things as we
see could never have arisen out of a recurrence of a definite number
of the same shapes. The like atoms of each shape are absolutely
infinite ; but the variety of shapes, though indefinitely large, is
not absolutely infinite."

<milestone unit="section" n="43"/>

[<hi rend='ital'>For neither does the
divisibility go on "ad infinitum," he says below</hi><note
n='a'>Properly "further within"--a proof that the Scholiast read his
Epicurus from a papyrus scroll which had to be unrolled. Hence
"further within" or "nearer the centre" expresses the same thing as
"further on" or "below" in a modern book.</note><hi rend='ital'>;
but he adds, since the qualities change, unless one is prepared to
keep enlarging their magnitudes also simply "ad
infinitum."</hi>]
</p> 
<p>"The atoms are in continual motion through
all eternity. [<hi rend='ital'>Further, he says below,</hi><note
n='a'>Properly "further within"--a proof that the Scholiast read his
Epicurus from a papyrus scroll which had to be unrolled. Hence
"further within" or "nearer the centre" expresses the same thing as
"further on" or "below" in a modern book.</note> <hi
rend='ital'>that the atoms move with equal speed, since the void
makes way for the lightest and heaviest alike.</hi>] Some of them
rebound to a considerable distance from each other, while others
merely oscillate in one place when they chance to have got entangled
or to be enclosed by a mass of other atoms shaped for
entangling."<note n='b'>Note the distinction between (1) solids,
composed of interlacing atoms (which have got entangled), and (2)
fluids, composed of atoms not interlaced, needing a sheath or
container of other atoms, if they are to remain united. To (2)
belongs Soul (&sect; 66). See Lucr. ii. 80-141 ; Cic. <hi rend='ital'>De
fin.</hi> i. 7.</note>
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="44"/>
<p>"This is because each atom is
separated from the rest by void, which is incapable of offering any
resistance to the rebound ; while it is the solidity of the atom
which makes it rebound after a collision,
<pb n='575'/>

however short the distance to which it rebounds, when it finds
itself imprisoned in a mass of entangling atoms. Of all this there
is no beginning, since both atoms and void exist from everlasting.
[<hi rend='ital'>He says below that atoms have no quality at all
except shape, size, and weight. But that colour varies with the
arrangement of the atoms he states in his "Twelve Rudiments" ;
further, that they are not of any and every size ; at any rate no
atom has ever been seen by our sense.</hi>]"
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="45"/>
<p>"The repetition
at such length of all that we are now recalling to mind furnishes an
adequate outline for our conception of the nature of things."
</p>

<p>"Moreover, there is an infinite number of worlds, some like this
world, others unlike it.<note n='a'>This remark is not misplaced.
For infinity of worlds follows from the infinity of (<hi
rend='ital'>a</hi>) atoms, (<hi rend='ital'>b</hi>) space ; see <hi
rend='ital'>inf.</hi>&sect;&sect; 73, 89 ; Lucr. ii. 1048 foll.</note> For the
atoms being infinite in number, as has just been proved, are borne
ever further in their course. For the atoms out of which a world
might arise, or by which a world might be formed, have not all been
expended on one world or a finite number of worlds, whether like or
unlike this one. Hence there will be nothing to hinder an infinity
of worlds."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="46"/>
<p>"Again, there are outlines or films, which are of
the same shape as solid bodies, but of a thinness far exceeding that
of any object that we see. For it is not impossible that there
should be found in the surrounding air combinations of this kind,
materials adapted for expressing the hollowness and thinness of
surfaces, and effluxes preserving the same relative position and
motion which they had in the solid objects from which they come. To
these films we give the name of `images' or `idols.' Further-

<pb n='577'/> 
more, so long as nothing comes in the way to offer
resistance, motion through the void accomplishes any imaginable
distance in an inconceivably short time. For resistance encountered
is the equivalent of slowness, its absence the equivalent of
speed."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="47"/>
<p>"Not that, if we consider the minute times perceptible by reason alone,<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr.
iv. 794-8 : "In one unit of time, when we can perceive it by sense
and while one single word is uttered, many latent times are
contained which reason finds to exist" Obviously such minute "times"
are immeasurably short. The unit of sensible time appears to be that
called (in &sect; 62) "the minimum continuous time." <hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Sext. Emp. x.&sect;&sect; 148-154.</note> the moving body
itself arrives at more than one place simultaneously (for this too
is inconceivable), although in time perceptible to sense it does
arrive simultaneously, however different the point of departure
from that conceived by us. For if it changed its direction, that
would be equivalent to its meeting with resistance, even if up to
that point we allow nothing to impede the rate of its flight. This
is an elementary fact which in itself is well worth bearing in mind.
In the next place the exceeding thinness of the images is
contradicted by none of the facts under our observation. Hence also
their velocities are enormous, since they always find a void passage
to fit them. Besides, their incessant effluence meets with no
resistance,<note n='b'>Or, inserting <foreign lang='greek'>to\,</foreign> not <foreign lang='greek'>tw=|,</foreign>
before <foreign lang='greek'>tw=| a)pei/rw|,</foreign> "a passage of the
proper size to secure that nothing obstructs their endless
emanation." But the meaning cannot be called certain.</note> or very
little, although many atoms, not to say an unlimited number, do at
once encounter resistance."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="48"/>
<p>"Besides this, remember that the
production of the images is as quick as thought. For particles are
continually streaming off from the surface of bodies, though no
diminution of the bodies is observed, because other particles take
their place.<note n='c'>If vision is to be not merely intermittent
but continuous, images must be perpetually streaming from the
objects seen to our eyes ; there must be a continual succession of
similar images. <hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Fr. 282 (Us.) ; Lucr. ii.
67-76, iv. 143-167.</note> And those
<pb n='579'/> 
given off
for a long time retain the position and arrangement which their
atoms had when they formed part of the solid bodies, although
occasionally they are thrown into confusion. Sometimes such
films<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> mirage and monstrous
shapes of clouds : Lucr. iv. 129-142 ; Diod. iii. 56.</note> are
formed very rapidly in the air, because they need not have any solid
content ; and there are other modes in which they may be formed. For
there is nothing in all this which is contradicted by sensation, if
we in some sort look at the clear evidence of sense, to which we
should also refer the continuity of particles in the objects
external to ourselves."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>
<p>"We must also consider that it is by
the entrance of something coming from external objects that we see
their shapes and think of them.<note n='b'>Thought, as well as

external things would not stamp on us their own nature of colour and

the entrance into our eyes or minds, to whichever their size is
suitable,

of certain films coming from the things themselves, these
films or outlines being of the same colour and shape as the external

They move with rapid motion ;<note n='d'>The
reader is left to infer that, the more rapid the motion, the more
continuous is the succession of fresh images. It is this
uninterrupted train of images which guarantees the continued
existence of the external object, just as their similarity or
identity guarantees its oneness : <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Lucr. iv.
87, 104 f., 189, 256 f., 714 f. ; Cic. <hi rend='ital'>N.D.</hi> i.

of the single continuous object, and retain the mutual
interconnexion which they had in the object, when they impinge upon
the sense, such impact being due to the oscillation of the atoms in
the interior of the solid object from which they come. And whatever
presentation we derive by direct contact, whether it be with the
mind or with
<pb n='581'/> 
the sense-organs, be it shape that
is presented or other properties, this shape as presented is the
shape of the solid thing, and it is due either to a close coherence
of the image as a whole or to a mere remnant of its parts.<note
n='a'>The film suffers from obstacles especially in its passage
through the air, and is sometimes torn into tatters. When these
reach the eye, the result is faulty perception ; <hi

</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="52"/>
<p>"And to this view we must
closely adhere, if we are not to repudiate the criteria founded on
the clear evidence of sense, nor again to throw all these things
into confusion by maintaining falsehood as if it were truth.<note
n='d'>Epicurus was a severe critic of the Sceptics ; <hi

<p>"Again, hearing takes place
when a current passes from the object, whether person or thing,
which emits voice or sound or noise, or produces the sensation of
hearing in any way whatever. This current is broken up into
homogeneous particles, which at the same time preserve a certain
mutual connexion and a distinctive unity extending to the object
which emitted them, and thus, for the most part, cause the
perception in that case or, if not, merely indicate the presence of
the external object. 

<milestone unit="section" n="53"/>

For without the transmission from the object of
a certain interconnexion of the parts no such sensation could
arise. Therefore we must not suppose that the air itself is moulded
into shape by the voice emitted or something similar<note
n='a'>Air is not, as Democritus held (Beare, <hi rend='ital'>op.
cit.</hi>p. 99), the medium, any more than for vision (&sect; 49). By
"something similar" Epicurus probably means to include sound or
noise. Lucretius treats of hearing in iv. 524-614, ii.
410-413.</note> ; for it is very far from being the case that the
air is acted upon by it in this way. The blow which is struck in us
when we utter a sound causes such a displacement of the particles as
serves to produce a current resembling breath, and this displacement
gives rise to the sensation of hearing."
</p> 
<p>"Again, we must
believe that smelling,<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. iv.
673-705, ii. 414-417. Neither taste nor touch is treated separately
in this epistle.</note> like hearing, would produce no sensation,
were there not particles conveyed from the object which are of the
proper sort for exciting the organ of smelling, some of one sort,
some of another, some exciting it confusedly and strangely, others
quietly and agreeably."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
<p>"Moreover, we must hold that the atoms
in fact possess none of the qualities belonging to things which come
under our observation, except shape, weight, and size, and the
properties necessarily con-
<pb n='585'/> 
joined with
shape.<note n='a'>For shape <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Lucr. ii.

flavour nor sound nor cold nor heat (<hi rend='ital'>ib.</hi>
856-859), in short no variable quality (<hi rend='ital'>ib.</hi>
859864) ; but the various qualities are due to the arrangement,
positions, motions, and shape of the component atoms.</note> For
every quality changes, but the atoms do not change, since, when the
composite bodies are dissolved, there must needs be a permanent
something, solid and indissoluble, left behind, which makes change
possible : not changes into or from the non-existent, but often
through differences of arrangement, and sometimes through
additions and subtractions of the atoms.<note n='b'>If something
unchanging underlies every change, the transformation of things and
of their qualities must be due to the motion of the component atoms.
With <foreign lang='greek'>e)n polloi=s</foreign> understand <foreign lang='greek'> sterem ni/ois</foreign> : the arrangement of the atoms
varies in solid objects.</note> Hence these somethings capable of
being diversely arranged must be indestructible, exempt from
change, but possessed each of its own distinctive mass <note
n='c'>In &sect; 53 <foreign lang='greek'>o)/gkos</foreign>was translated
"particle," since the context shows that a group of atoms analogous
to a visible film is meant. But here each of the permanent
somethings, <hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the atoms, has its own mass
(<foreign lang='greek'>o)/gkos</foreign>) and configuration.</note>
and configuration. This must remain."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
<p>"For in the case of
changes of configuration within our experience the figure is
supposed to be inherent when other qualities are stripped off, but
the qualities are not supposed, like the shape which is left behind,
to inhere in the subject of change, but to vanish altogether from
the body. Thus, then, what is left behind is sufficient to account
for the differences in composite bodies, since something at least
must necessarily be left remaining and be immune from
annihilation."
</p> 
<p>"Again, you should not suppose that the atoms
have any and every size, <note n='d'>The opinion of
Democritus.</note>lest you be contradicted by facts ; but
differences of size must be admitted ; for this addition renders the
facts of feeling and sensation easier of explanation. 

<milestone unit="section" n="56"/>

But to
attribute any and
<pb n='587'/> 
every magnitude to the atoms
does not help to explain the differences of quality in things ;
moreover, in that case atoms large enough to be seen ought to have
reached us, which is never observed to occur ; nor can we conceive
how its occurrence should be possible, <hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi>
that an atom should become visible.<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. iv. 110-128, i. 599-627, ii. 478-521. The
first of these passages states that the atom is "far below the ken
of our senses" and "much smaller than the things which our eyes
begin to be able to see."</note>"
</p> 
<p>"Besides, you must not
suppose that there are parts unlimited in number, be they ever so
small, in any finite body. Hence not only must we reject as impossible subdivision <hi rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi> into smaller
and smaller parts, lest we make all things too weak and, in our
conceptions of the aggregates, be driven to pulverize the things
that exist, <hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the atoms, and annihilate<note
n='b'>Admitting indivisible atoms, hard solid bodies can be
explained ; whereas, if atoms were soft and thus divisible <hi

solidity (Lucr. i. 565-576). Just before Lucretius has argued that,
if atoms did not set a limit to the division of things, production
or reproduction would be impossible, since destruction is wrought
more quickly than it is repaired, and endless future time could not
undo the waste of endless past time. Possibly, however, Epicurus is
thinking of an argument similar to that used by Lucretius in ii.
522-568--that a finite number of shapes implies and requires an
infinity of atoms of each shape.</note> them ; but in dealing with
finite things we must also reject as impossible the progression <hi
rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi> by less and less increments."
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>
<p>"For when once we have said that an infinite number of particles,
however small, are contained in anything, it is not possible to
conceive how it could any longer be limited or finite in size. For
clearly our infinite number of particles must have some size ; and
then, of whatever size they were, the aggregate they made would be
infinite. And, in the next place, since what is finite has an
extremity which is distinguishable, even if it is not by itself
observable, it is not possible to avoid thinking of another such
extremity next to this. Nor can we help thinking that in this way,
by proceeding for-
<pb n='589'/> 
ward from one to the next in
order, it is possible by such a progression to arrive in thought at
infinity.<note n='a'>Each visible body is the sum of minima, or
least perceptible points, which, because they are of finite size,
are also finite in number.</note>"
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="58"/>
<p>"We must consider the
minimum perceptible by sense as not corresponding to that which is
capable of being traversed, <hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> is
extended,<note n='b'>"That which admits the successive transitions
from part to part." As Bignone remarks, a mathematical series,
whether of integers or fractions or powers, might be so described.
But Epicurus is obviously dealing with areas and surfaces ; since
generally to us the "visible" will also be extended.</note> nor
again as utterly unlike it, but as having something in common with
the things capable of being traversed, though it is without
distinction of parts. But when from the illusion created by this
common property we think we shall distinguish something in the
minimum, one part on one side and another part on the other side, it
must be another minimum equal to the first which catches our eye. In
fact, we see these minima one after another, beginning with the
first, and not as occupying the same space ; nor do we see them
touch one another's parts with their parts, but we see that by
virtue of their own peculiar character (<hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> as
being unit indivisibles) they afford a means of measuring magnitudes
: there are more of them, if the magnitude measured is greater ;
fewer of them, if the magnitude measured is less."
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="59"/>
<p>"We must
recognize that this analogy also holds of the minimum in the atom ;
it is only in minuteness that it differs from that which is observed
by sense, but it follows the same analogy. On the analogy of things
within our experience we have declared that the atom has magnitude ;
and this, small as it is, we have merely reproduced on a larger
scale. And further, the least and simplest<note n='c'><hi
rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> "uncompounded." But v. Arnim's <foreign lang='greek'>a)merh=,</foreign> "void of parts," is more
suitable.</note> things must be regarded as extremities of lengths,
furnishing from themselves as units the means of measuring lengths,
whether greater or less, the mental vision being
<pb n='591'/>

employed, since direct observation is impossible. For the
community which exists between them and the unchangeable parts (<hi
rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the minimal parts of area or surface) is
sufficient to justify the conclusion so far as this goes. But it is
not possible that these minima of the atom should group themselves
together through the possession of motion.<note n='a'>The parts of
the atom are incapable of motion ; <hi rend='ital'>cf.</hi> Lucr. i.
628-634.</note>"
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="60"/>
<p>"Further, we must not assert `up' or `down'
of that which is unlimited, as if there were a zenith or nadir.<note
n='b'>Objection was taken by Aristotle to the atomic motion of
Democritus, on the ground that it implied a point or region
absolutely high, and an opposite point or region absolutely low,
these terms being unmeaning in infinite space (Aristotle, <hi
rend='ital'>Phys.</hi> iii. 5. 205 b 30 ; iv. 8. 215 a 8). See <hi

space overhead, however, if it be possible to draw<note n='c'>This

know that never will this space --or, for that matter, the space
below the supposed standpoint if produced to infinity--appear to us
to be at the same time `up' and `down' with reference to the same
point ; for this is inconceivable. Hence it is possible to assume
one direction of motion, which we conceive as extending upwards <hi
rend='ital'>ad infinitum</hi>, and another downwards, even if it
should happen ten thousand times that what moves from us to the
spaces above our heads reaches the feet of those above us, or that
which moves downwards from us the heads of those below us. None the
less is it true that the whole of the motion in the respective cases
is conceived as extending in opposite directions <hi
rend='ital'>ad infinitum.</hi>"</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="61"/>
<p>"When they are travelling
through the void and meet with no resistance, the atoms must move
with equal speed. Neither will heavy atoms travel more quickly than
small and light ones, so long as nothing meets them, nor will small
atoms travel more quickly than large ones, provided they always find
a passage suitable to their size, and provided also that they

<pb n='593'/> 
meet with no obstruction. Nor will their upward or
their lateral motion, which is due to collisions, nor again their
downward motion, due to weight, affect their velocity. As long as
either motion obtains, it must continue, quick as the speed of
thought, provided there is no obstruction, whether due to external
collision or to the atoms' own weight counteracting the force of
the blow."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="62"/>
<p>"Moreover, when we come to deal with composite
bodies, one of them will travel faster than another, although their
atoms have equal speed. This is because the atoms in the aggregates
are travelling in one direction<note n='a'>When the atoms in a
composite body are, during a continuous sensible time, however
short, all moving in one single direction, then the composite body
will be travelling from place to place and have a relative
velocity.</note> during the shortest continuous time, albeit they
move in different directions in times so short as to be appreciable
only by the reason, but frequently collide until the continuity of
their motion is appreciated by sense. For the assumption that beyond
the range of direct observation even the minute times conceivable by
reason will present continuity of motion is not true in the case
before us. Our canon is that direct observation by sense and direct
apprehension by the mind are alone invariably true."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="63"/>
<p>"Next,
keeping in view our perceptions and feelings (for so shall we have
the surest grounds for belief), we must recognize generally that the
soul is a corporeal thing, composed of fine particles, dispersed
all over the frame,<note n='b'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. iii.
161-176, 177-230.</note> most nearly resembling wind with an
admixture of heat,<note n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. iii.
231-257, 425-430 ; Epic. Fr. (Us.) 315, 314. These authorities
assume <hi rend='ital'>four</hi> component elements, while in this
epistle one of these (<foreign lang='greek'> a)erw=de/ s ti</foreign>)
is omitted.</note> in some respects like wind, in others like heat.
But, again, there is the third part which exceeds the other two in
the fineness of
<pb n='595'/> 
its particles and thereby keeps
in closer touch with the rest of the frame.<note n='a'>The so-called
"nameless" substance (<hi rend='ital'>nominis expers</hi> Lucr. iii.
242, <foreign lang='greek'> a)katon o/masto n</foreign> in
Epicurus).</note> And this is shown by the mental faculties and
feelings, by the ease with which the mind moves, and by thoughts,
and by all those things the loss of which causes death. Further, we
must keep in mind that soul has the greatest share in causing
sensation. 

<milestone unit="section" n="64"/>

Still, it would not have had sensation, had it not been
somehow confined within the rest of the frame. But the rest of the
frame, though it provides this indispensable condition<note
n='b'>The body, by keeping soul-atoms together without much
dispersion, allows them to vibrate with the motions that generate
sentience and sensation.</note> for the soul, itself also has a
share, derived from the soul, of the said quality ; and yet does not
possess all the qualities of soul. Hence on the departure of the
soul it loses sentience. For it had not this power in itself ; but
something else, congenital with the body, supplied it to body :
which other thing, through the potentiality actualized in it by
means of motion, at once acquired for itself a quality of sentience,
and, in virtue of the neighbourhood and interconnexion between
them, imparted it (as I said) to the body also."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="65"/>
<p>"Hence, so
long as the soul is in the body, it never loses sentience through
the removal of some other part. The containing sheath<note
n='c'>Since the participle <foreign lang='greek'> stega/z
on</foreign> is also found in the plural (<foreign lang='greek'>
stega/z onta</foreign>), it seems best to assume with Bignone that
the whole frame is regarded as the sum of parts, each of which
serves as the envelope, sheath, or container of some part of the
soul. Thus the loss of a limb is not fatal to life, because the rest
of the frame has served in its capacity of envelope to preserve a
sufficient number of soul-atoms in working order.</note> may be
dislocated in whole or in part, and portions of the soul may thereby
be lost ; yet in spite of this the soul, if it manage to survive,
will have sentience. But the rest of the frame, whether the whole of
it survives or only a part, no longer has sensation, when once those
atoms
<pb n='597'/> 
have departed, which, however few in
number, are required to constitute the nature of soul. Moreover,
when the whole frame is broken up,<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. ii. 944-962.</note> the soul is scattered
and has no longer the same powers as before, nor the same motions ;
hence it does not possess sentience either."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="66"/>
<p>"For we cannot
think of it<note n='b'>It=the soul, the logical subject, the neuter
replacing the more appropriate feminine pronoun.</note> as sentient,
except it be in this composite whole and moving with these movements
; nor can we so think of it when the sheaths which enclose and
surround it are not the same as those in which the soul is now
located and in which it performs these movements. [<hi
rend='ital'>He says elsewhere that the soul is composed of the
smoothest and roundest of atoms, far superior in both respects to

over the rest of the frame, while the rational part resides in the

when the parts of the soul which have been scattered all over the
composite organism are held fast in it or dispersed, and
afterwards collide with one another by their impacts. The semen is
derived from the whole of the body.</hi>]
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="67"/>
<p>"There is the
further point to be considered, what the incorporeal can be, if, I
mean, according to current usage the term is applied to what can be
conceived as self-existent.<note n='c'>Or, if <foreign lang='greek'>o(/ti to\ a)sw/mat on le/gome n</foreign> be read, "that
according to current usage we apply the term <hi

self-existent."</note> But it is impossible to conceive anything
that is incorporeal as self-existent except empty space. And empty
space cannot itself either act or be acted upon, but simply allows
body to move through it. Hence those who call soul in-
</p> <pb

<p>corporeal speak foolishly. For if it were so, it could
neither act nor be acted upon. But, as it is, both these properties,
you see, plainly belong to soul."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="68"/>
<p>"If, then, we bring all
these arguments concerning soul to the criterion of our feelings and
perceptions, and if we keep in mind the proposition stated at the
outset, we shall see that the subject has been adequately
comprehended in outline : which will enable us to determine the
details with accuracy and confidence."</p> 
<p>"Moreover, shapes and
colours, magnitudes and weights, and in short all those qualities
which are predicated of body, in so far as they are perpetual
properties either of all bodies or of visible bodies, are knowable
by sensation of these very properties : these, I say, must not be
supposed to exist independently by themselves<note n='a'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. i. 449 f. ; Sext. Emp. <hi
rend='ital'>Adv. math.</hi>x.&sect;&sect; 221-223.</note>(for that is

nor yet to be non-existent, nor to be some other and
incorporeal entities cleaving to body,<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. i. 478-482.</note> nor again to be parts
of body. We must consider the whole body in a general way to derive
its permanent nature from all of them, though it is not, as it were,
formed by grouping them together in the same way as when from the
particles themselves a larger aggregate is made up, whether these
particles be primary or any magnitudes whatsoever less than the
particular whole. All these qualities, I repeat, merely give the
body its own permanent nature. They all have their own characteristic modes of being perceived and distinguished, but always
along with the whole body in which they inhere and never in
separation from it ; and it is in virtue of this complete conception
of the body as a whole that it is so designated."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="70"/>
<p>"Again,
qualities often attach to bodies without
<pb n='601'/> 
being
permanent concomitants. They are not to be classed among invisible
entities nor are they incorporeal. Hence, using the term
`accidents'<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. i. 455 f.,
where slavery, poverty, riches, war and peace are the examples
chosen, as elsewhere are rest and motion.</note> in the commonest
sense, we say plainly that `accidents' have not the nature of the
whole thing to which they belong, and to which, conceiving it as a
whole, we give the name of body, nor that of the permanent
properties without which body cannot be thought of. And in virtue of
certain peculiar modes of apprehension into which the complete
body always enters, each of them can be called an accident. 

<milestone unit="section" n="71"/>

But only
as often as they are seen actually to belong to it, since such
accidents are not perpetual concomitants. There is no need to banish
from reality this clear evidence that the accident has not the
nature of that whole--by us called body--to which it belongs, nor of
the permanent properties which accompany the whole. Nor, on the
other hand, must we suppose the accident to have independent
existence (for this is just as inconceivable in the case of
accidents as in that of the permanent properties) ; but, as is manifest, they should all be regarded as accidents, not as permanent
concomitants, of bodies, nor yet as having the rank of independent
existence. Rather they are seen to be exactly as and what sensation
itself makes them individually claim to be."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="72"/>
<p>"There is another
thing which we must consider carefully. We must not investigate time
as we do the other accidents which we investigate in a subject,
namely, by referring them to the preconceptions envisaged in our
minds ; but we must take into account the plain fact itself, in
virtue of which we speak of time as long or short, linking to it in
intimate connexion this attribute of duration.<note n='b'><hi

adopt any fresh terms as preferable, but should employ the usual
expressions about it. Nor need we predicate anything else of time,
as if this something else contained the same essence as is
contained in the proper meaning of the word `time' (for this also is
done by some). We must chiefly reflect upon that to which we attach
this peculiar character of time, and by which we measure it. 

<milestone unit="section" n="73"/>

No
further proof is required : we have only to reflect that we attach
the attribute of time to days and nights and their parts, and
likewise to feelings of pleasure and pain and to neutral states, to
states of movement and states of rest, conceiving a peculiar
accident of these to be this very characteristic which we express by
the word `time.' [<hi rend='ital'>He says this both in the second

do not, however, admit of every shape. Nor are they living beings
which have been separated from the infinite.</hi>] For nobody can
prove that in one sort of world there might not be contained,
whereas in another sort of world there could not possibly be, the
seeds out of which animals and plants arise and all the rest of the
things we see. [<hi rend='ital'>And the same holds good for their
nurture in a world after they have arisen. And so too we must think
it happens upon the earth also.</hi>]

<p>"Again, we must suppose
that nature<note n='a'>That is, nature working in primitive man,
almost the same thing as instinct.</note> too has been taught and
forced to learn many various lessons by the facts themselves, that
reason subsequently develops what it has thus received and makes
fresh discoveries, among some tribes more quickly, among others more
slowly, the progress thus made being at certain times and seasons
greater, at others less."</p> 
<p>"Hence even the names of things were
not originally due to convention,<note n='b'><hi
rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. v. 1041 f. Heraclitus, Democritus, and
Aristotle derived language from convention.</note> but in the
several tribes under the impulse of special feelings and special
presentations of sense primitive man uttered special cries.<note
n='c'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. v. 1028, 1029,
1056-1058.</note> The air thus emitted was moulded by their
individual feelings or sense-presentations, and differently according to the difference of the regions which the tribes inhabited.

<milestone unit="section" n="76"/>

Subsequently whole tribes adopted their own special names, in order
that their communications might be less ambiguous to each other
and more briefly expressed. And as for things not visible, so far as
those who were conscious of them tried to introduce any such notion,
they put in circulation certain names for them, either sounds which
they
<pb n='607'/> 
were instinctively compelled to utter or
which they selected by reason on analogy according to the most
general cause there can be for expressing oneself in such a
way.<note n='a'>See Bignone, p. 107 note 3.</note>"</p> 
<p>"Nay more
: we are bound to believe that in the sky revolutions, solstices,
eclipses, risings and settings, and the like, take place without the
ministration or command, either now or in the future, of any being
who at the same time enjoys perfect bliss along with immortality.
<milestone unit="section" n="77"/>

For troubles and anxieties and feelings of anger and partiality do
not accord with bliss, but always imply weakness and fear and
dependence upon one's neighbours. Nor, again, must we hold that
things which are no more than globular masses of fire, being at the
same time endowed with bliss, assume these motions at will. Nay, in
every term we use we must hold fast to all the majesty which
attaches to such notions as bliss and immortality, lest the terms
should generate opinions inconsistent with this majesty. Otherwise
such inconsistency will of itself suffice to produce the worst
disturbance in our minds. Hence, where we find phenomena invariably recurring, the invariableness of the recurrence must be
ascribed to the original interception and conglomeration of atoms
whereby the world was formed."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="78"/>
<p>"Further, we must hold that to
arrive at accurate knowledge of the cause of things of most moment
is the business of natural science, and that happiness depends on
this (viz. on the knowledge of celestial and atmospheric phenomena),
and upon knowing what the heavenly bodies really are, and any
kindred facts contributing to exact knowledge in this respect.<note
n='b'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> to secure the end of
happiness.</note>"</p> <pb n='609'/> 
<p>"Further, we must recognize
on such points as this no plurality of causes or contingency, but
must hold that nothing suggestive of conflict or disquiet is
compatible with an immortal and blessed nature. And the mind can
grasp the absolute truth of this."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="79"/>
<p>"But when we come to
subjects for special inquiry, there is nothing in the knowledge of
risings and settings and solstices and eclipses and all kindred
subjects that contributes to our happiness ; but those who are
well-informed about such matters and yet are ignorant what the
heavenly bodies really are, and what are the most important causes
of phenomena, feel quite as much fear as those who have no such
special information--nay, perhaps even greater fear, when the
curiosity excited by this additional knowledge cannot find a
solution or understand the subordination of these phenomena to the
highest causes."</p> 
<p>"Hence, if we discover more than one cause
that may account for solstices, settings and risings, eclipses and
the like, as we did also in particular matters of detail, 

<milestone unit="section" n="80"/>

we must
not suppose that our treatment of these matters fails of accuracy,
so far as it is needful to ensure our tranquillity and happiness.
When, therefore, we investigate the causes of celestial and
atmospheric phenomena, as of all that is unknown, we must take
into account the variety of ways in which analogous occurrences
happen within our experience ; while as for those who do not
recognize the difference between what is or comes about from a
single cause and that which may be the effect of any one of several
causes, overlooking the fact that the objects are only seen at a
distance, and are moreover ignorant of the conditions that render,
or do not render, peace of mind impossible
<pb n='611'/>

--all such persons we must treat with contempt. If then we think
that an event could happen in one or other particular way out of
several, we shall be as tranquil when we recognize that it actually
comes about in more ways than one as if we knew that it happens in
this particular way."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="81"/>
<p>"There is yet one more point to seize,
namely, that the greatest anxiety of the human mind arises through
the belief that the heavenly bodies are blessed and indestructible,
and that at the same time they have volitions and actions and
causality inconsistent with this belief ; and through expecting or
apprehending some everlasting evil, either because of the myths, or
because we are in dread of the mere insensibility of death, as if it
had to do with us ; and through being reduced to this state not by
conviction but by a certain irrational perversity, so that, if men
do not set bounds to their terror, they endure as much or even more
intense anxiety than the man whose views on these matters are quite
vague. 

<milestone unit="section" n="82"/>

But mental tranquillity means being released from all these
troubles and cherishing a continual remembrance of the highest and
most important truths."</p> 
<p>"Hence we must attend to present
feelings and sense perceptions, whether those of mankind in general
or those peculiar to the individual, and also attend to all the
clear evidence available, as given by each of the standards of
truth. For by studying them we shall rightly trace to its cause and
banish the source of disturbance and dread, accounting for celestial
phenomena and for all other things which from time to time befall us
and cause the utmost alarm to the rest of mankind."</p> 
<p>"Here then,
Herodotus, you have the chief doctrines

So that, if this statement be
accurately retained and take effect, a man will, I make no doubt, be
incomparably better equipped than his fellows, even if he should
never go into all the exact details. For he will clear up for
himself many of the points which I have worked out in detail in my
complete exposition ; and the summary itself, if borne in mind, will
be of constant service to him."</p> 
<p>"It is of such a sort that
those who are already tolerably, or even perfectly, well acquainted
with the details can, by analysis of what they know into such
elementary perceptions as these, best prosecute their researches in
physical science as a whole ; while those, on the other hand, who
are not altogether entitled to rank as mature students can in silent
fashion and as quick as thought run over the doctrines most
important for their peace of mind."

<p>Such is his epistle on
Physics. Next comes the "epistle on Celestial Phenomena."</p>

<p>"Epicurus to Pythocles, greeting."
</p>

<p>"In your letter to me,
of which Cleon was the bearer, you continue to show me affection
which I have merited by my devotion to you, and you try, not without

We will then complete our writing and grant all you ask. Many others

nature and those who are attached to pursuits which go deeper than
any part of ordinary education. So you will do well to take and

my letter to Herodotus.<note n='a'>This would seem decisive of what

We do not seek to wrest by force what is impossible,
nor to understand all matters equally well, nor make our treatment
always as clear as when we discuss human life or explain the
principles of physics in general--for instance, that the whole of
being consists of bodies and intangible nature, or that the ultimate
elements of things are indivisible, or any other proposition which
admits only one explanation of the phenomena to be possible. But
this is not the case with celestial phenomena : these at any rate
admit of manifold causes for their occurrence and manifold
accounts, none of them contradictory of sensation, of their
nature."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="87"/>
<p>"For in the study of nature we must not conform to
empty assumptions and arbitrary laws, but follow the promptings of
the facts ; for our life has no need now of unreason and false
opinion ; our one need is untroubled existence. All things go on
uninterruptedly, if all be explained by the method of
</p> <pb
n='617'/> 
<p>plurality of causes in conformity with the facts, so
soon as we duly understand what may be plausibly alleged respecting
them. But when we pick and choose among them, rejecting one equally
consistent with the phenomena, we clearly fall away from the study
of nature altogether and tumble into myth. Some phenomena within our
experience afford evidence by which we may interpret what goes on
in the heavens. We see how the former really take place, but not how
the celestial phenomena take place, for their occurrence may
possibly be due to a variety of causes. 

<milestone unit="section" n="88"/>

However, we must observe
each fact as presented, and further separate from it all the facts
presented along with it, the occurrence of which from various causes
is not contradicted by facts within our experience."</p> 
<p>"A world
is a circumscribed portion of the universe, which contains stars and
earth and all other visible things, cut off from the infinite, and
terminating [<hi rend='ital'>and terminating in a boundary which may
be either thick or thin, a boundary whose dissolution will bring
about the wreck of all within it</hi>] in an exterior which may
either revolve or be at rest, and be round or triangular or of any
other shape whatever. All these alternatives are possible : they
are contradicted by none of the facts in this world, in which an
extremity can nowhere be discerned."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="89"/>
<p>"That there is an
infinite number of such worlds can be perceived, and that such a
world may arise in a world or in one of the <hi

between worlds) in a tolerably empty space and not, as some
maintain, in a vast
<pb n='619'/>

as great as it is seen to be. For so too fires of which we have

alone rotate according to some necessary impulse to rise, implanted

and this through excessive
heat, due to a certain extension of the fire which always encroaches
upon that which is near it.<note n='c'>From Lucr. v. 519 f. it is
probable that words are lost from the text which ascribed these
motions to the quest of fiery atoms by the heavenly

contrary pressure of the air or, it may be, to the fact that either

vicinity or there is a dearth of it. Or even because such a whirling
motion was from the first inherent in these stars so that they move
in a sort
<pb n='623'/> 
of spiral. For all such explanations
and the like do not conflict with any clear evidence, if only in
such details we hold fast to what is possible, and can bring each of
these explanations into accord with the facts, unmoved by the
servile artifices of the astronomers."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="94"/>
<p>"The waning of the moon
and again her waxing<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr. v.
705-750.</note> might be due to the rotation of the moon's body, and
equally well to configurations which the air assumes ; further, it
may be due to the interposition of certain bodies. In short, it may
happen in any of the ways in which the facts within our experience
suggest such an appearance to be explicable. But one must not be so
much in love with the explanation by a single way as wrongly to
reject all the others from ignorance of what can, and what cannot,
be within human knowledge, and consequent longing to discover the
indiscoverable. Further, the moon may possibly shine by her own
light, just as possibly she may derive her light from the sun ; 

<milestone unit="section" n="95"/>

for
in our own experience we see many things which shine by their own
light and many also which shine by borrowed light. And none of the
celestial phenomena stand in the way, if only we always keep in mind
the method of plural explanation and the several consistent assumptions and causes, instead of dwelling on what is inconsistent and
giving it a false importance so as always to fall back in one way or
another upon the single explanation. The appearance of the face in
the moon may equally well arise from interchange of parts, or from
interposition of something, or in any other of the ways which might
be seen to accord with the facts. 

<milestone unit="section" n="96"/>

For in all the celestial
phenomena
<pb n='625'/> 
such a line of research is not to be
abandoned ; for, if you fight against clear evidence, you never can
enjoy genuine peace of mind."</p> 
<p>"An eclipse of the sun or moon
may be due to the extinction of their light, just as within our own
experience this is observed to happen ; and again by interposition
of something else--whether it be the earth or some other invisible
body like it. And thus we must take in conjunction the explanations
which agree with one another, and remember that the concurrence of
more than one at the same time may not impossibly happen." [<hi
rend='ital'>He says the same in Book XII. of his "De Natura," and
further that the sun is eclipsed when the moon throws her shadow
over him, and the moon is eclipsed by the shadow of the earth ; or
again, eclipse may be due to the moon's withdrawal, 



and this is
cited by Diogenes the Epicurean in the first book of his
"Epilecta."</hi>]
<milestone unit="section" n="97"/>
</p> 
<p>"And further, let the regularity of their
orbits be explained in the same way as certain ordinary incidents
within our own experience ; the divine nature must not on any
account be adduced to explain this, but must be kept free from the
task and in perfect bliss. Unless this be done, the whole study of
celestial phenomena will be in vain, as indeed it has proved to be
with some who did not lay hold of a possible method, but fell into
the folly of supposing that these events happen in one single way
only and of rejecting all the others which are possible, suffering
themselves to be carried into the realm of the unintelligible, and
being unable to take a comprehensive view of the facts which must
be taken as clues to the rest."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="98"/>
<p>"The variations in the length
of nights and days
<pb n='627'/> 
may be due to the swiftness
and again to the slowness of the sun's motion in the sky, owing to
the variations in the length of spaces traversed and to his
accomplishing some distances more swiftly or more slowly, as happens
sometimes within our own experience ; and with these facts our
explanation of celestial phenomena must agree ; whereas those who
adopt only one explanation are in conflict with the facts and are
utterly mistaken as to the way in which man can attain
knowledge."</p> 
<p>"The signs in the sky which betoken the weather
may be due to mere coincidence of the seasons, as is the case with
signs from animals seen on earth, or they may be caused by changes
and alterations in the air. For neither the one explanation nor the
other is in conflict with facts, 

<milestone unit="section" n="99"/>

and it is not easy to see in which
cases the effect is due to one cause or to the other."</p> 
<p>"Clouds
may form and gather either because the air is condensed under the
pressure of winds, or because atoms which hold together and are
suitable to produce this result become mutually entangled, or
because currents collect from the earth and the waters ; and there
are several other ways in which it is not impossible for the
aggregations of such bodies into clouds to be brought about. And
that being so, rain may be produced from them sometimes by their
compression, sometimes by their transformation ; 

<milestone unit="section" n="100"/>

or again may be
caused by exhalations of moisture rising<note n='a'>Lucr. vi.
519.</note> from suitable places through the air, while a more
violent inundation is due to certain accumulations suitable for such
discharge. Thunder may be due to the rolling of wind in the hollow
parts of the clouds, as it is sometimes imprisoned in vessels
which we use ; or to the roaring of
<pb n='629'/> 
fire in
them when blown by a wind,<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Lucr.
vi. 271-284.</note> or to the rending and disruption of clouds, or
to the friction and splitting up of clouds when they have become as
firm as ice. 

<milestone unit="section" n="101"/>

As in the whole survey, so in this particular point,
the facts invite us to give a plurality of explanations. Lightnings
too happen in a variety of ways. For when the clouds rub against
each other and collide, that collocation of atoms which is the cause
of fire generates lightning ; or it may be due to the flashing forth
from the clouds, by reason of winds, of particles capable of
producing this brightness ; or else it is squeezed out of the clouds
when they have been condensed either by their own action or by that
of the winds ; or again, the light diffused from the stars may be
enclosed in the clouds, then driven about by their motion and by
that of the winds, and finally make its escape from the clouds ; or
light of the finest texture may be filtered through the clouds
(whereby the clouds may be set on fire and thunder produced), and
the motion of this light may make lightning ; or it may arise from
the combustion of wind brought about by the violence of its motion
and the intensity of its compression ; 

<milestone unit="section" n="102"/>

or, when the clouds are rent
asunder by winds, and the atoms which generate fire are expelled,
these likewise cause lightning to appear. And it may easily be seen
that its occurrence is possible in many other ways, so long as we
hold fast to facts and take a general view of what is analogous to
them. Lightning precedes thunder, when the clouds are constituted as
mentioned above and the configuration which produces lightning is
expelled at the moment when the wind falls upon the cloud, and

<pb n='631'/> 
the wind being rolled up afterwards produces the
roar of thunder ; or, if both are simultaneous, the lightning moves
with a greater velocity towards us

<milestone unit="section" n="103"/>

and the thunder lags behind,
exactly as when persons who are striking blows are observed from a
distance.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>e.g.,</hi> as Apelt remarks,
when the blows struck by a great hammer on a block of iron are
watched from a distance, and it takes some time for the sound to
reach one's ear.</note> A thunderbolt is caused when winds are
repeatedly collected, imprisoned, and violently ignited ; or when a
part is torn asunder and is more violently expelled downwards, the
rending being due to the fact that the compression of the clouds has
made the neighbouring parts more dense ; or again it may be due like
thunder merely to the expulsion of the imprisoned fire, when this
has accumulated and been more violently inflated with wind and has
torn the cloud, being unable to withdraw to the adjacent parts
because it is continually more and more closely
compressed--[generally by some high mountain where thunderbolts
mostly fall]. 

<milestone unit="section" n="104"/>

And there are several other ways in which thunderbolts
may possibly be produced. Exclusion of myth is the sole condition
necessary ; and it will be excluded, if one properly attends to the
facts and hence draws inferences to interpret what is obscure."</p>

<p>"Fiery whirlwinds are due to the descent of a cloud forced
downwards like a pillar by the wind in full force and carried by a
gale round and round, while at the same time the outside wind gives
the cloud a lateral thrust ; or it may be due to a change of the
wind which veers to all points of the compass as a current of air
from above helps to force it to move ; or it may be that a strong
eddy of winds has been
<pb n='633'/> 
started and is unable to
burst through laterally because the air around is closely condensed.

<milestone unit="section" n="105"/>
And when they descend upon land, they cause what are called
tornadoes, in accordance with the various ways in which they are
produced through the force of the wind ; and when let down upon the
sea, they cause waterspouts."</p> 
<p>"Earthquakes may be due to the
imprisonment of wind underground, and to its being interspersed with
small masses of earth and then set in continuous motion, thus
causing the earth to tremble. And the earth either takes in this
wind from without or from the falling in of foundations, when
undermined, into subterranean caverns, thus raising a wind in the
imprisoned air. Or they may be due to the propagation of movement
arising from the fall of many foundations and to its being again
checked when it encounters the more solid resistance of earth.

<milestone unit="section" n="106"/>

And
there are many other causes to which these oscillations of the
earth may be due."</p> 
<p>"Winds arise from time to time when foreign
matter continually and gradually finds its way into the air ; also
through the gathering of great store of water. The rest of the winds
arise when a few of them fall into the many hollows and they are
thus divided and multiplied."</p> 
<p>"Hail is caused by the firmer
congelation and complete transformation, and subsequent distribution
into drops, of certain particles resembling wind : also by the
slighter congelation of certain particles of moisture and the
vicinity of certain particles of wind which at one and the same time
forces them together and makes them burst, so that they become
frozen in parts and in the whole mass. 

<milestone unit="section" n="107"/>

The round
<pb n='635'/>

shape of hailstones is not impossibly due to the extremities on
all sides being melted and to the fact that, as explained, particles
either of moisture or of wind surround them evenly on all sides and
in every quarter, when they freeze."</p> 
<p>"Snow may be formed when
a fine rain issues from the clouds because the pores are symmetrical
and because of the continuous and violent pressure of the winds upon
clouds which are suitable ; and then this rain has been frozen on
its way because of some violent change to coldness in the regions
below the clouds. Or again, by congelation in clouds which have
uniform density a fall of snow might occur through the clouds which
contain moisture being densely packed in close proximity to each
other ; and these clouds produce a sort of compression and cause
hail, and this happens mostly in spring. 

<milestone unit="section" n="108"/>

And when frozen clouds rub
against each other, this accumulation of snow might be thrown off.
And there are other ways in which snow might be formed."</p> 
<p>"Dew
is formed when such particles as are capable of producing this sort
of moisture meet each other from the air : again by their rising
from moist and damp places, the sort of place where dew is chiefly
formed, and their subsequent coalescence, so as to create moisture
and fall downwards, just as in several cases something similar is
observed to take place under our eyes. 

<milestone unit="section" n="109"/>

And the formation of
hoar-frost is not different from that of dew, certain particles of
such a nature becoming in some such way congealed owing to a certain
condition of cold air."</p> <pb n='637'/> 
<p>"Ice is formed by the
expulsion from the water of the circular, and the compression of the
scalene and acute-angled atoms contained in it ; further by the
accretion of such atoms from without, which being driven together
cause the water to solidify after the expulsion of a certain number
of round atoms."</p> 
<p>"The rainbow arises when the sun shines upon
humid air ; or again by a certain peculiar blending of light with
air, which will cause either all the distinctive qualities of these
colours or else some of them belonging to a single kind, and from
the reflection of this light the air all around will be coloured as
we see it to be, as the sun shines upon its parts. 

<milestone unit="section" n="110"/>

The circular
shape which it assumes is due to the fact that the distance of every
point is perceived by our sight to be equal ; or it may be because,
the atoms in the air or in the clouds and deriving from the sun
having been thus united, the aggregate of them presents a sort of
roundness."</p> 
<p>"A halo round the moon arises because the air on
all sides extends to the moon ; or because it equably raises upwards
the currents from the moon so high as to impress a circle upon the
cloudy mass and not to separate it altogether ; or because it raises
the air which immediately surrounds the moon symmetrically from
all sides up to a circumference round her and there forms a thick
ring. 

<milestone unit="section" n="111"/>

And this happens at certain parts either because a current has
forced its way in from without or because the heat has gained
possession of certain passages in order to effect this.

<p>"Comets arise either because fire is nourished in
</p> <pb
n='639'/> 
<p>certain places at certain intervals in the heavens, if
circumstances are favourable ; or because at times the heaven has a
particular motion above us so that such stars appear ; or because
the stars themselves are set in motion under certain conditions and
come to our neighbourhood and show themselves. And their
disappearance is due to the causes which are the opposite of these.
<milestone unit="section" n="112"/>

Certain stars may revolve without setting not only for the reason
alleged by some, because this is the part of the world round which,
itself unmoved, the rest revolves, but it may also be because a
circular eddy of air surrounds this part, which prevents them from
travelling out of sight like other stars ; or because there is a
dearth of necessary fuel farther on, while there is abundance in
that part where they are seen to be. Moreover there are several
other ways in which this might be brought about, as may be seen by
anyone capable of reasoning in accordance with the facts. The
wanderings of certain stars, if such wandering is their actual
motion, and the regular movement of certain other stars, 

<milestone unit="section" n="113"/>

may be
accounted for by saying that they originally moved in a circle and
were constrained, some of them to be whirled round with the same
uniform rotation and others with a whirling motion which varied ;
but it may also be that according to the diversity of the regions
traversed in some places there are uniform tracts of air, forcing
them forward in one direction and burning uniformly, in others these
tracts present such irregularities as cause the motions observed. To
assign a single cause for these effects when the facts suggest
several causes is madness and a strange inconsistency ; yet it is
done by adherents of rash astronomy, who assign meaning-
</p> <pb
n='641'/> 
<p>less causes for the stars whenever they persist in
saddling the divinity with burdensome tasks. 

<milestone unit="section" n="114"/>

That certain stars are
seen to be left behind by others may be because they travel more
slowly, though they go the same round as the others ; or it may be
that they are drawn back by the same whirling motion and move in the
opposite direction ; or again it may be that some travel over a
larger and others over a smaller space in making the same
revolution. But to lay down as assured a single explanation of these
phenomena is worthy of those who seek to dazzle the multitude with
marvels.
</p> 
<p>"Falling stars, as they are called, may in some
cases be due to the mutual friction of the stars themselves, in
other cases to the expulsion of certain parts when that mixture of
fire and air takes place which was mentioned when we were discussing
lightning ; 

<milestone unit="section" n="115"/>

or it may be due to the meeting of atoms capable of
generating fire, which accord so well as to produce this result, and
their subsequent motion wherever the impulse which brought them
together at first leads them ; or it may be that wind collects in
certain dense mist-like masses and, since it is imprisoned, ignites
and then bursts forth upon whatever is round about it, and is
carried to that place to which its motion impels it. And there are
other ways in which this can be brought about without recourse to
myths."</p>

Such
are his views on celestial phenomena.
</p> 
<p>But as to the conduct
of life, what we ought to avoid and what to choose, he writes as
follows.<note n='a'>Between the letter to Pythocles and that to
Menoeceus come excerpts (&sect;&sect; 117-120) dealing with the wise man as
conceived by Epicurus, to which are added (&sect;&sect; 120, 121) some ethical
tenets.</note> Before quoting his words, however, let me go into the
views of Epicurus himself and his school concerning the wise
man.
</p> 
<p>There are three motives to injurious acts among
men--hatred, envy, and contempt ; and these the wise man overcomes
by reason. Moreover, he who has once become wise never more assumes
the opposite habit, not even in semblance, if he can help it. He
will be more susceptible of emotion than other men : that will be no
hindrance to his wisdom. However, not every bodily constitution nor
every nationality would permit a man to become wise.
</p> <pb n='645'/> 

<milestone unit="section" n="118"/>
<p>Even on the rack the wise man is happy. He alone will
feel gratitude towards friends, present and absent alike, and show
it by word and deed. When on the rack, however, he will give vent to
cries and groans. As regards women he will submit to the
restrictions imposed by the law, as Diogenes says in his epitome of
Epicurus' ethical doctrines. Nor will he punish his servants ;
rather he will pity them and make allowance on occasion for those
who are of good character. The Epicureans do not suffer the wise man
to fall in love ; nor will he trouble himself about funeral rites;
according to them love does not come by divine inspiration : so
Diogenes in his twelfth book. The wise man will not make fine
speeches. No one was ever the better for sexual indulgence, and it
is well if he be not the worse.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="119"/>
<p>Nor, again, will the wise man
marry and rear a family : so Epicurus says in the <hi
rend='ital'>Problems</hi> and in the <hi rend='ital'>De Natura.</hi>
Occasionally he may marry owing to special circumstances in his
life. Some too will turn aside from their purpose. Nor will he
drivel, when drunken : so Epicurus says in the <hi
rend='ital'>Symposium.</hi> Nor will he take part in politics, as is
stated in the first book <hi rend='ital'>On Life</hi> ; nor will he
make himself a tyrant ; nor will he turn Cynic (so the second book
<hi rend='ital'>On Life</hi> tells us) ; nor will he be a mendicant.
But even when he has lost his sight, he will not withdraw
himself<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> by suicide, as
recommended by the Stoics (<hi rend='ital'>supra</hi>, vii.
130).</note> from life : this is stated in the same book. The wise
man will also feel grief, according to Diogenes in the fifth book of
his <hi rend='ital'>Epilecta.</hi> And he will take a suit into
court. 

<milestone unit="section" n="120"/>

He will leave written words behind him, but will not compose
panegyric. He will have regard to his property and to the
future.
</p> <pb n='647'/> 
<p>He will be fond of the country. He will
be armed against fortune and will never give up a friend. He will
pay just so much regard to his reputation as not to be looked down
upon. He will take more delight than other men in state
festivals.<note n='a'><hi rend='ital'>Cf.</hi> Philodemus, <foreign lang='greek'>*peri\ eu)sebe i/as</foreign> (Us. p. 258).</note>
</p>

<p><note n='b'>The transposition of this paragraph is due to Bignone
(p. 214, notes 2, 4).</note>The wise man will set up votive images.
Whether he is well off or not will be matter of indifference to him.
Only the wise man will be able to converse correctly about music and
poetry, without however actually writing poems himself. One wise man
does not move more wisely than another. And he will make money, but
only by his wisdom, if he should be in poverty, and he will pay
court to a king, if need be. He will be grateful to anyone when he
is corrected. He will found a school, but not in such a manner as to
draw the crowd after him ; and will give readings in public, but
only by request. He will be a dogmatist but not a mere sceptic ; and
he will be like himself even when asleep. And he will on occasion
die for a friend.
</p> 
<p>The school holds that sins are not all
equal ; that health is in some cases a good, in others a thing
indifferent ; that courage is not a natural gift but comes from
calculation of expediency ; and that friendship is prompted by our
needs. One of the friends, however, must make the first advances
(just as we have to cast seed into the earth), but it is maintained
by a partnership in the enjoyment of life's pleasures.

<p>Two
sorts of happiness can be conceived, the one the highest possible,
such as the gods enjoy, which cannot be augmented, the other
admitting addition and subtraction of pleasures.
</p> 
<p>We must now
proceed to his letter.
</p> <pb n='649'/> 
<p>"Epicurus to Menoeceus,
greeting."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="122"/>
<p>"Let no one be slow to seek wisdom when he is young
nor weary in the search thereof when he is grown old. For no age is
too early or too late for the health of the soul. And to say that
the season for studying philosophy has not yet come, or that it is
past and gone, is like saying that the season for happiness is not
yet or that it is now no more. Therefore, both old and young ought
to seek wisdom, the former in order that, as age comes over him, he
may be young in good things because of the grace of what has been,
and the latter in order that, while he is young, he may at the same
time be old, because he has no fear of the things which are to come.
So we must exercise ourselves in the things which bring happiness,
since, if that be present, we have everything, and, if that be
absent, all our actions are directed toward attaining it."</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="123"/>
<p>"Those things which without ceasing I have declared unto thee,
those do, and exercise thyself therein, holding them to be the
elements of right life. First believe that God is a living being immortal and blessed, according to the notion of a god indicated by
the common sense of mankind ; and so believing, thou shalt not
affirm of him aught that is foreign to his immortality or that
agrees not with blessedness, but shalt believe about him whatever
may uphold both his blessedness and his immortality. For verily
there are gods, and the knowledge of them is manifest ; but they are
not such as the multitude believe, seeing that men do not
steadfastly maintain the notions they form respecting them. Not the
man who denies the gods worshipped by the multitude, but he who
affirms of the gods what the multi-
<pb n='651'/> 
tude
believes about them is truly impious. 

<milestone unit="section" n="124"/>

For the utterances of the
multitude about the gods are not true preconceptions but false
assumptions ; hence it is that the greatest evils happen to the
wicked and the greatest blessings happen to the good from the hand
of the gods, seeing that they are always favourable to their own
good qualities and take pleasure in men like unto themselves, but
reject as alien whatever is not of their kind."</p> 
<p>"Accustom
thyself to believe that death is nothing to us, for good and evil
imply sentience, and death is the privation of all sentience ;
therefore a right understanding that death is nothing to us makes
the mortality of life enjoyable, not by adding to life an
illimitable time, but by taking away the yearning after immortality.

<milestone unit="section" n="125"/>
For life has no terrors for him who has thoroughly apprehended that
there are no terrors for him in ceasing to live. Foolish, therefore,
is the man who says that he fears death, not because it will pain
when it comes, but because it pains in the prospect. Whatsoever
causes no annoyance when it is present, causes only a groundless
pain in the expectation. Death, therefore, the most awful of
evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not
come, and, when death is come, we are not. It is nothing, then,
either to the living or to the dead, for with the living it is not
and the dead exist no longer.<note n='a'>The striking resemblance to
this passage of ps.-Plat. <hi rend='ital'>Axiochus</hi>, 369 b, has
often been pointed out, most recently by E. Chevallier, <hi
rend='ital'>Etude crit. du dialogue ps.-plat. l'Axiochos</hi> (Lyon,
1914, pp. 74 <hi rend='ital'>sq.</hi>) ; he rightly maintains the
priority of the letter to Menoeceus (<hi rend='ital'>ib.</hi> p.
76).</note> But in the world, at one time men shun death as the
greatest of all evils, and at another time choose it as a respite
from the evils in life. 

<milestone unit="section" n="126"/>

The wise man does not deprecate life nor
does he fear the cessation
<pb n='653'/> 
of life. The thought
of life is no offence to him, nor is the cessation of life regarded
as an evil. And even as men choose of food not merely and simply the
larger portion, but the more pleasant, so the wise seek to enjoy the
time which is most pleasant and not merely that which is longest.
And he who admonishes the young to live well and the old to make a
good end speaks foolishly, not merely because of the desirableness
of life, but because the same exercise at once teaches to live well
and to die well. Much worse is he who says that it were good not to
be born, but when once one is born to pass with all speed through
the gates of Hades.<note n='a'>Theognis 425, 427.</note> 

<milestone unit="section" n="127"/>

For if he
truly believes this, why does he not depart from life ? It were easy
for him to do so, if once he were firmly convinced. If he speaks
only in mockery, his words are foolishness, for those who hear
believe him not."</p> 
<p>"We must remember that the future is neither
wholly ours nor wholly not ours, so that neither must we count upon
it as quite certain to come nor despair of it as quite certain not
to come."</p> 
<p>"We must also reflect that of desires some are
natural, others are groundless ; and that of the natural some are
necessary as well as natural, and some natural only. And of the
necessary desires some are necessary if we are to be happy, some if
the body is to be rid of uneasiness, some if we are even to live. 

<milestone unit="section" n="128"/>

He
who has a clear and certain understanding of these things will
direct every preference and aversion toward securing health of body
and tranquillity of mind, seeing that this is the sum and end of a
blessed life. For the end of all our actions is to be free from pain
and fear, and, when once we
<pb n='655'/> 
have attained all
this, the tempest of the soul is laid ; seeing that the living
creature has no need to go in search of something that is lacking,
nor to look for anything else by which the good of the soul and of
the body will be fulfilled. When we are pained because of the
absence of pleasure, then, and then only, do we feel the need of
pleasure. Wherefore we call pleasure the alpha and omega of a
blessed life. 

<milestone unit="section" n="129"/>

Pleasure is our first and kindred good. It is the
starting-point of every choice and of every aversion, and to it we
come back, inasmuch as we make feeling the rule by which to judge of
every good thing. And since pleasure is our first and native good,
for that reason we do not choose every pleasure whatsoever, but
ofttimes pass over many pleasures when a greater annoyance ensues
from them. And ofttimes we consider pains superior to pleasures when
submission to the pains for a long time brings us as a consequence a
greater pleasure. While therefore all pleasure because it is
naturally akin to us is good, not all pleasure is choiceworthy, just
as all pain is an evil and yet not all pain is to be shunned. 

<milestone unit="section" n="130"/>

It is,
however, by measuring one against another, and by looking at the
conveniences and inconveniences, that all these matters must be
judged. Sometimes we treat the good as an evil, and the evil, on the
contrary, as a good. Again, we regard independence of outward things
as a great good, not so as in all cases to use little, but so as to
be contented with little if we have not much, being honestly
persuaded that they have the sweetest enjoyment of luxury who stand
least in need of it, and that whatever is natural is easily procured
and only the vain and worthless hard to win. Plain fare
</p> <pb
n='657'/> 
<p>gives as much pleasure as a costly diet, when once the
pain of want has been removed, 

<milestone unit="section" n="131"/>

while bread and water confer the
highest possible pleasure when they are brought to hungry lips. To
habituate one's self, therefore, to simple and inexpensive diet
supplies all that is needful for health, and enables a man to meet
the necessary requirements of life without shrinking, and it places
us in a better condition when we approach at intervals a costly fare
and renders us fearless of fortune."</p> 
<p>"When we say, then, that
pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the
prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do
by some through ignorance, prejudice, or wilful misrepresentation.
By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble
in the soul. 

<milestone unit="section" n="132"/>

It is not an unbroken succession of drinking-bouts and
of revelry, not sexual love, not the enjoyment of the fish and other
delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life ;
it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and
avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest
tumults take possession of the soul. Of all this the beginning and
the greatest good is prudence. Wherefore prudence is a more
precious thing even than philosophy ; from it spring all the other
virtues, for it teaches that we cannot lead a life of pleasure which
is not also a life of prudence, honour, and justice ; nor lead a
life of prudence, honour, and justice, which is not also a life of
pleasure. For the virtues have grown into one with a pleasant life,
and a pleasant life is inseparable from them."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="133"/>
<p>"Who, then, is
superior in thy judgement to such a man ? He holds a holy belief
concerning the gods,
<pb n='659'/> 
and is altogether free
from the fear of death. He has diligently considered the end fixed
by nature, and understands how easily the limit of good things can
be reached and attained, and how either the duration or the
intensity of evils is but slight. Destiny, which some introduce as
sovereign over all things, he laughs to scorn, affirming rather that
some things happen of necessity, others by chance, others through
our own agency. For he sees that necessity destroys responsibility
and that chance or fortune is inconstant ; whereas our own actions
are free, and it is to them that praise and blame naturally attach.
<milestone unit="section" n="134"/>
It were better, indeed, to accept the legends of the gods than to
bow beneath that yoke of destiny which the natural philosophers have
imposed. The one holds out some faint hope that we may escape if we
honour the gods, while the necessity of the naturalists is deaf to
all entreaties. Nor does he hold chance to be a god, as the world in
general does, for in the acts of a god there is no disorder ; nor to
be a cause, though an uncertain one, for he believes that no good or
evil is dispensed by chance to men so as to make life blessed,
though it supplies the starting-point of great good and great evil.
He believes that the misfortune of the wise is better than the
prosperity of the fool.

It is better, in short, that what is well
judged in action should not owe its successful issue to the aid of
chance."</p> 
<p>"Exercise thyself in these and kindred precepts day

<p>Elsewhere he rejects the whole of divination,<note

in the short epitome, and says, "No means of predicting the future
really exists, and if it did, we must regard what happens according
to it as nothing to us."
</p> 
<p>Such are his views on life and
conduct ; and he has discoursed upon them at greater length
elsewhere."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="136"/>
<p>He differs from the Cyrenaics<note n='b'>Next come
excerpts dealing with the difference between Epicurean and Cyrenaic
ethics.</note> with regard to pleasure. They do not include under
the term the pleasure which is a state of rest, but only that which
consists in motion. Epicurus admits both ; also pleasure of mind as
well as of body, as he states in his work <hi rend='ital'>On Choice
and Avoidance</hi> and in that <hi rend='ital'>On the Ethical
End</hi>, and in the first book of his work <hi rend='ital'>On Human
Life</hi> and in the epistle to his philosopher friends in
Mytilene. So also Diogenes in the seventeenth book of his <hi
rend='ital'>Epilecta</hi>, and Metrodorus in his <hi
rend='ital'>Timocrates</hi>, whose actual words are : "Thus pleasure
being conceived both as that species which consists in motion and
that which is a state of rest." The words of Epicurus in his work
<hi rend='ital'>On Choice</hi> are : "Peace of mind and freedom from
pain are pleasures which imply a state of rest ; joy and delight are
seen to consist in motion and activity."
</p>

<milestone unit="section" n="137"/>
<p>He further disagrees
with the Cyrenaics in that they hold that pains of body are worse
than mental pains ; at all events evil-doers are made to suffer
bodily punishment ; whereas Epicurus holds the pains of the mind to
be the worse ; at any rate the flesh endures the storms of the
present alone, the mind those of the past and future as well as the
present. In this way also he holds mental pleasures to be
</p> <pb
n='663'/> 
<p>greater than those of the body. And as proof that
pleasure is the end he adduces the fact that living things, so soon
as they are born, are well content with pleasure and are at enmity
with pain, by the prompting of nature and apart from reason. Left to
our own feelings, then, we shun pain ; as when even Heracles,
devoured by the poisoned robe, cries aloud,

<milestone unit="section" n="138"/>
<p>And we
choose the virtues too on account of pleasure and not for their own
sake, as we take medicine for the sake of health. So too in the
twentieth book of his <hi rend='ital'>Epilecta</hi> says Diogenes,
who also calls education <foreign lang='greek'>(a)gwgh/)</foreign>
recreation <foreign lang='greek'>( diagwg h/)</foreign>. Epicurus
describes virtue as the <hi rend='ital'>sine qua non</hi> of
pleasure, <hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> the one thing without which
pleasure cannot be, everything else, food, for instance, being
separable, <hi rend='ital'>i.e.</hi> not indispensable to
pleasure."</p> 
<p>Come, then, let me set the seal, so to say, on my
entire work as well as on this philosopher's life by citing his
Sovran Maxims,<note n='b'>This collection of forty of the most
important articles of faith in the Epicurean creed was famous in
antiquity. It consists of extracts from the voluminous writings of
Epicurus, and may have been put together by a faithful disciple. On
the other hand, Epicurus laid great stress (&sect;&sect;35, 36) on epitomes of
his doctrine being committed to memory ; so that his passion for
personal direction and supervision of the studies of his pupils may
have induced him to furnish them with such an indispensable
catechism.</note> therewith bringing the whole work to a close and
making the end of it to coincide with the beginning of
happiness."</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="139"/>
<p>1. A blessed and eternal being has no trouble
himself and brings no trouble upon any other being ; hence he is
exempt from movements of anger and partiality, for every such
movement implies weakness [<hi rend='ital'>Elsewhere he says that
the gods are discernible by reason alone, some being numerically

</p> 
<p>2.
Death is nothing to us ; for the body, when it has been resolved
into its elements, has no feeling, and that which has no feeling is
nothing to us.
</p> 
<p>3. The magnitude of pleasure reaches its limit
in the removal of all pain. When pleasure is present, so long as it
is uninterrupted, there is no pain either of body or of mind or of
both together.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="140"/>
<p>4. Continuous pain does not last long in the
flesh ; on the contrary, pain, if extreme, is present a very short
time, and even that degree of pain which barely outweighs pleasure
in the flesh does not last for many days together. Illnesses of long
duration even permit of an excess of pleasure over pain in the
flesh.
</p> 
<p>5. It is impossible to live a pleasant life without
living wisely and well and justly, and it is impossible to live
wisely and well and justly without living pleasantly. Whenever any
one of these is lacking, when, for instance, the man is not able to
live wisely, though he lives well and justly, it is impossible for
him to live a pleasant life.

<p>6. In order to obtain security
from other men any means whatsoever of procuring this was a natural
good.<note n='a'>Usener, followed by Bignone, regards <foreign lang='greek'>a)rxh=s kai\ basile i/as</foreign> of the vulgate text as a

</p>

<p>7. Some men have sought to become famous and renowned, thinking
that thus they would make themselves secure against their
fellow-men. If, then, the life of such persons really was secure,
they attained natural good ; if, however, it was insecure, they have
not attained the end which by nature's own prompting they originally
sought.

<p>8. No pleasure is in itself evil, but
the things which produce certain pleasures entail annoyances many
times greater than the pleasures themselves.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="142"/>
<p>9. If all
pleasure had been capable of accumulation,--if this had gone on
not only by recurrence in time, but all over the frame or, at any
rate, over the principal parts of man's nature, there would never
have been any difference between one pleasure and another, as in
fact there is.
</p> 
<p>10. If the objects which are productive of
pleasures to profligate persons really freed them from fears of the
mind,--the fears, I mean, inspired by celestial and atmospheric
phenomena, the fear of death, the fear of pain ; if, further, they
taught them to limit their desires, we should never have any fault
to find with such persons, for they would then be filled with
pleasures to overflowing on all sides and would be exempt from all
pain, whether of body or mind, that is, from all evil.
</p> 
<p>11. If
we had never been molested by alarms at celestial and atmospheric
phenomena, nor by the misgiving that death somehow affects us, nor
by neglect of the proper limits of pains and desires, we should have
had no need to study natural science.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="143"/>
<p>12. It would be
impossible to banish fear on matters of the highest importance, if a
man did not know the nature of the whole universe, but lived in
dread of what the legends tell us. Hence without the study of nature
there was no enjoyment of unmixed pleasures.
</p> 
<p>13. There would
be no advantage in providing security against our fellow-men, so
long as we were alarmed by occurrences over our heads or beneath the
earth or in general by whatever happens in the boundless
universe.
</p> <pb n='669'/> 
<p>14. When tolerable security against
our fellow-men is attained, then on a basis of power sufficient to
afford support<note n='a'>Or, if <foreign lang='greek'> e)coris

prosperity arises in most genuine form the security of a quiet
private life withdrawn from the multitude.

<p>15. Nature's
wealth at once has its bounds and is easy to procure ; but the
wealth of vain fancies recedes to an infinite distance.
</p> 
<p>16.
Fortune but seldom interferes with the wise man ; his greatest and
highest interests have been, are, and will be, directed by reason
throughout the course of his life.
</p> 
<p>17. The just man enjoys
the greatest peace of mind, while the unjust is full of the utmost
disquietude.
</p> 
<p>18. Pleasure in the flesh admits no increase
when once the pain of want has been removed ; after that it only
admits of variation. The limit of pleasure in the mind, however, is
reached when we reflect on the things themselves and their congeners
which cause the mind the greatest alarms.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="145"/>
<p>19. Unlimited time
and limited time afford an equal amount of pleasure, if we measure
the limits of that pleasure by reason.
</p> 
<p>20. The flesh receives
as unlimited the limits of pleasure ; and to provide it requires
unlimited time. But the mind, grasping in thought what the end and
limit of the flesh is, and banishing the terrors of futurity,
procures a complete and perfect life, and has no longer any need of
unlimited time. Nevertheless it does not shun pleasure, and even
in the
<pb n='671'/> 
hour of death, when ushered out of
existence by circumstances, the mind does not lack enjoyment of the
best life.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="146"/>
<p>21. He who understands the limits of life knows
how easy it is to procure enough to remove the pain of want and make
the whole of life complete and perfect. Hence he has no longer any
need of things which are not to be won save by labour and
conflict.
</p> 
<p>22. We must take into account as the end all that
really exists and all clear evidence of sense to which we refer our
opinions ; for otherwise everything will be full of uncertainty and
confusion.
</p> 
<p>23. If you fight against all your sensations, you
will have no standard to which to refer, and thus no means of
judging even those judgements which you pronounce false.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="147"/>
<p>24.
If you reject absolutely any single sensation without stopping to
discriminate with respect to that which awaits confirmation between
matter of opinion and that which is already present, whether in
sensation or in feelings or in any presentative perception of the
mind, you will throw into confusion even the rest of your sensations
by your groundless belief and so you will be rejecting the standard
of truth altogether. If in your ideas based upon opinion you
hastily affirm as true all that awaits confirmation as well as that
which does not, you will not escape error, as you will be
maintaining complete ambiguity whenever it is a case of judging
between right and wrong opinion.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="148"/>
<p>25. If you do not on every
separate occasion refer each of your actions to the end prescribed
by nature, but instead of this in the act of choice or avoidance

<pb n='673'/> 
swerve aside to some other end, your acts will not
be consistent with your theories.
</p> 
<p>26. All such desires as
lead to no pain when they remain ungratified are unnecessary, and
the longing is easily got rid of, when the thing desired is
difficult to procure or when the desires seem likely to produce
harm.
</p> 
<p>27. Of all the means which are procured by wisdom to
ensure happiness throughout the whole of life, by far the most
important is the acquisition of friends.
</p> 
<p>28. The same
conviction which inspires confidence that nothing we have to fear is
eternal or even of long duration, also enables us to see that even
in our limited conditions of life nothing enhances our security so
much as friendship.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="29"/>
<p>29. Of our desires some are natural and
necessary ; others are natural, but not necessary ; others, again,
are neither natural nor necessary, but are due to illusory opinion.
[Epicurus regards as natural and necessary desires which bring
relief from pain, as <hi rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> drink when we are
thirsty ; while by natural and not necessary he means those which
merely diversify the pleasure without removing the pain, as <hi
rend='ital'>e.g.</hi> costly viands ; by the neither natural nor
necessary he means desires for crowns and the erection of statues in
one's honour.--Schol.]
</p> 
<p>30. Those natural desires which entail
no pain when not gratified, though their objects are vehemently
pursued, are also due to illusory opinion ; and when they are not
got rid of, it is not because of their own nature, but because of
the man's illusory opinion.
</p>

<p>31. Natural justice is a symbol
or expression of
<pb n='675'/> 
expediency, to prevent one man
from harming or being harmed by another.
</p> 
<p>32. Those animals
which are incapable of making covenants with one another, to the end
that they may neither inflict nor suffer harm, are without either
justice or injustice. And those tribes which either could not or
would not form mutual covenants to the same end are in like
case.
</p> 
<p>33. There never was an absolute justice, but only an
agreement made in reciprocal intercourse in whatever localities
now and again from time to time, providing against the infliction or
suffering of harm.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="151"/>
<p>34. Injustice is not in itself an evil,
but only in its consequence, viz. the terror which is excited by
apprehension that those appointed to punish such offences will
discover the injustice.
</p> 
<p>35. It is impossible for the man who
secretly violates any article of the social compact to feel
confident that he will remain undiscovered, even if he has already
escaped ten thousand times ; for right on to the end of his life he
is never sure he will not be detected.
</p> 
<p>36. Taken generally,
justice is the same for all, to wit, something found expedient in
mutual intercourse ; but in its application to particular cases of
locality or conditions of whatever kind, it varies under different
circumstances.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="152"/>
<p>37. Among the things accounted just by conventional law, whatever in the needs of mutual intercourse is
attested to be expedient, is thereby stamped as just, whether or not
it be the same for all ; and in case any law is made and does not
prove suitable to the expediencies of mutual intercourse, then this
is
<pb n='677'/> 
no longer just. And should the expediency
which is expressed by the law vary and only for a time correspond
with the prior conception, nevertheless for the time being it was
just, so long as we do not trouble ourselves about empty words, but
look simply at the facts.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="153"/>
<p>38. Where without any change in
circumstances the conventional laws, when judged by their consequences, were seen not to correspond with the notion of justice,
such laws were not really just ; but wherever the laws have ceased
to be expedient in consequence of a change in circumstances, in that
case the laws were for the time being just when they were expedient
for the mutual intercourse of the citizens, and subsequently ceased
to be just when they ceased to be expedient.
</p> 

<milestone unit="section" n="154"/>
<p>39. He who best
knew how to meet fear of external foes made into one family all the
creatures he could ; and those he could not, he at any rate did not
treat as aliens ; and where he found even this impossible, he
avoided all intercourse, and, so far as was expedient, kept them
at a distance.
</p> 
<p>40. Those who were best able to provide themselves with the means of security against their neighbours, being
thus in possession of the surest guarantee, passed the most
agreeable life in each other's society ; and their enjoyment of the
fullest intimacy was such that, if one of them died before his time,
the survivors did not lament his death as if it called for
commiseration.
