                    <p>
                        The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it happened in
the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the
palace,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        that Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men
out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who
were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        They said
to me, The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province
are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is
broken down, and the gates of it are burned with fire.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        It happened, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and
mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        and said, I beg you, Yahweh, the God of heaven, the great and
awesome God, who keeps covenant and lovingkindness with those who love
him and keep his commandments:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Let your ear now be attentive, and
your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant,
which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the children
of Israel your servants while I confess the sins of the children of
Israel, which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father's house
have sinned:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        we have dealt very corruptly against you, and have
not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which
you commanded your servant Moses.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Remember, I beg you, the word
that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, If you trespass, I will
scatter you abroad among the peoples:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        but if you return to me,
and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the
uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from there, and
will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to
dwell there.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Now these are your servants and your people, whom
you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Lord, I beg you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your
servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who delight to fear your
name; and please prosper your servant this day, and grant him mercy in
the sight of this man. Now I was cup bearer to the king.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It happened in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of
Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine,
and gave it to the king. Now I had not been [before] sad in his
presence.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        The king said to me, Why is your face sad, seeing you
are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very
sore afraid.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        I said to the king, Let the king live forever: why
should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers'
tombs, lies waste, and the gates of it are consumed with fire?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Then the king said to me, For what do you make request? So I prayed to
the God of heaven.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        I said to the king, If it please the king, and
if your servant have found favor in your sight, that you would send me
to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, that I may build it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        The king said to me (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall
your journey be? and when will you return? So it pleased the king to
send me; and I set him a time.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Moreover I said to the king, If it
please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the
River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give
me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertains to
the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall
enter into. The king granted me, according to the good hand of my God
on me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave
them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the
army and horsemen.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the
servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly,
because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        I arose
in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what
my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any
animal with me, except the animal that I rode on.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        I went out by
night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal's well, and to the
dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down,
and the gates of it were consumed with fire.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Then I went on to
the spring gate and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the
animal that was under me to pass.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Then went I up in the night by
the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the
valley gate, and so returned.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        The rulers didn't know where I
went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to
the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest who
did the work.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Then said I to them, You see the evil case that we
are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and the gates of it are burned with
fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no
more a reproach.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        I told them of the hand of my God which was
good on me, as also of the king's words that he had spoken to me. They
said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for
the good [work].
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the
servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed
us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you do?
will you rebel against the king?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Then answered I them, and said
to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his
servants will arise and build: but you have no portion, nor right, nor
memorial, in Jerusalem.

                        Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brothers the
priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up
the doors of it; even to the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, to
the tower of Hananel.

                        He spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria,

                        and they conspired all of

                        Judah said,

                        Therefore set

                        It happened from that

                        I said

                        Likewise at the same time said

                        So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of

                        I said to

                        Then said they, We will restore them, and will require

                        yet you in your manifold mercies didn't forsake
them in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud didn't depart from over

night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn't withhold

                        Yes, forty years did you sustain them in the wilderness, [and]

didn't swell.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which
you did allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of
Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of
Bashan.

                        Their children also multiplied you as the stars of the

                        So the
children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them
the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their
hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might
do with them as they would.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        They took fortified cities, and a

ate, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in your
great goodness.

                        Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled

they committed awful blasphemies.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        Therefore you delivered them
into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the
time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven;
and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved
them out of the hand of their adversaries.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        But after they had
rest, they did evil again before you; therefore left you them in the

when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many
times did you deliver them according to your mercies,

                        and
testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law.
Yet they dealt proudly, and didn't listen to your commandments, but
sinned against your ordinances, (which if a man do, he shall live in
them,) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would
not hear.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        Yet many years did you bear with them, and testified

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a

God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the
awesome God, who keep covenant and lovingkindness, don't let all the
travail seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on
our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our

                        However you are just in all that is come on us; for
you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;

                        neither have
our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law,
nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you
did testify against them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        For they have not served you in their
kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the
large and fat land which you gave before them, neither turned they from
their wicked works.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        Behold, we are servants this day, and as for
the land that you gave to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the
good of it, behold, we are servants in it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        It yields much
increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins:
also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their
pleasure, and we are in great distress.

turned the curse into a blessing.

                        It came to pass, when they had
heard the law, that they separated from
                        <placeName key="tgn,1000119">Israel</placeName>
                        all the mixed multitude.

                        Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the
chambers of the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        had
prepared for him a great chamber, where before they laid the
meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of
the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment
to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the
heave-offerings for the priests.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        But in all this [time] I was
not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king
of Babylon I went to the king: and after certain days asked I leave of
the king,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that
Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts
of the house of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        It grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth
all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Then I
commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and there brought I again
the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the
frankincense.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        I perceived that the portions of the Levites had
not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, who did the
work, were fled everyone to his field.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Then contended I with
the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? I gathered them
together, and set them in their place.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Then brought all Judah
the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest,
and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was
Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted
faithful, and their business was to distribute to their brothers.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Remember me, my God, concerning this, and don't wipe out my
good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the
observances of it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        In those days saw I in Judah some men
treading wine-presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and
lading donkeys [therewith]; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all
manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath
day: and I testified [against them] in the day in which they sold
victuals.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        There lived men of Tyre also therein, who brought in
fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the children
of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Then I contended with the nobles of
Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you do, and
profane the Sabbath day?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Didn't your fathers do thus, and did
not our God bring all this evil on us, and on this city? yet you bring
more wrath on
                        <placeName key="tgn,1000119">Israel</placeName>
                        by profaning the Sabbath.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        It came to pass
that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the Sabbath,
I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they
should not be opened until after the Sabbath: and some of my servants
set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the
Sabbath day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares
lodged outside of Jerusalem once or twice.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Then I testified
against them, and said to them, Why lodge you about the wall? if you do
so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no
more on the Sabbath.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        I commanded the Levites that they should
purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to
sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember to me, my God, this also, and spare
me according to the greatness of your lovingkindness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        In those
days also saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon,
[and] of Moab:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        and their children spoke half in the speech of
Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the
language of each people.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        I contended with them, and cursed
them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made
them swear by God, [saying], You shall not give your daughters to their
sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        Did not Solomon king of

                        sin by these things? yet among
many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God,
and God made him king over all
                        <placeName key="tgn,1000119">Israel</placeName>
                        : nevertheless even him did
foreign women cause to sin.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        Shall we then listen to you to do
all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign
women?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high
priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased
him from me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        Remember them, my God, because they have defiled
the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges
for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits.
Remember me, my God, for good.
