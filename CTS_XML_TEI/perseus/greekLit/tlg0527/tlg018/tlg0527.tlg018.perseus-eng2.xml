                        Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Yahweh
stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a
proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and [put it] also in writing,
saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the
earth has Yahweh, the God of heaven, given me; and he has charged me to
build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Whoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up
to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of Yahweh, the God
of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Whoever is left, in any place where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with
silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with animals, besides the
freewill-offering for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Then rose up the heads of fathers' [houses] of Judah and Benjamin, and
the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred to
go up to build the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        All those who were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels
of silver, with gold, with goods, and with animals, and with precious
things, besides all that was willingly offered.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Also Cyrus the
king brought forth the vessels of the house of Yahweh, which
Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the
house of his gods;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring
forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them to
Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        This is the number of them:
thirty platters of gold, one thousand platters of silver, twenty-nine
knives,

                        thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four
hundred and ten, and other vessels one thousand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        All the vessels
of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these
did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up
from Babylon to Jerusalem.

                        Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth [day] of

                        The children of the captivity, who had

                        They delivered the king's commissions to the king's satraps, and

                        Now when these things were done, the princes drew near to me,
saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not
separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, [doing] according
to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the
Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians,
and the Amorites.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        For they have taken of their daughters for
themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mixed
themselves with the peoples of the lands: yes, the hand of the princes
and rulers has been chief in this trespass.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        When I heard this
thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my
head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Then were
assembled to me everyone who trembled at the words of the God of
Israel, because of the trespass of them of the captivity; and I sat
confounded until the evening offering.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        At the evening offering I
arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn;
and I fell on my knees, and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        and I said, my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you,
my God; for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our
guiltiness is grown up to the heavens.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Since the days of our
fathers we have been exceeding guilty to this day; and for our
iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the
hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to
plunder, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Now for a
little moment grace has been shown from Yahweh our God, to leave us a
remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our
God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        For we are bondservants; yet our God has not forsaken us in our
bondage, but has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight of the
kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God,
and to repair the ruins of it, and to give us a wall in Judah and in
Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Now, our God, what shall we say after this? for we
have forsaken your commandments,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        which you have commanded by
your servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which you go to
possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples
of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one
end to another with their filthiness:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        now therefore don't give
your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your
sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever; that you may be
strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance
to your children forever.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        After all that is come on us for our
evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that you our God have
punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such a
remnant,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        shall we again break your commandments, and join in
affinity with the peoples that do these abominations? would not you be
angry with us until you had consumed us, so that there should be no
remnant, nor any to escape?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Yahweh, the God of Israel, you are
righteous; for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this
day: behold, we are before you in our guiltiness; for none can stand
before you because of this.

                    <p>
                        Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and
casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered
together to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women
and children; for the people wept very sore.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Shecaniah the son
of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered Ezra, We have trespassed
against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the
land: yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the
wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my
lord, and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let
it be done according to the law.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Arise; for the matter belongs
to you, and we are with you: be of good courage, and do it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Then
arose Ezra, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all
Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they
swore.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went
into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and [when] he came
there, he ate no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the
trespass of them of the captivity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        They made proclamation
throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity,
that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        and
that whoever didn't come within three days, according to the counsel of
the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and
himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Then all
the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem
within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth [day]
of the month: and all the people sat in the broad place before the
house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, You have
trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of
Israel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Now therefore make confession to Yahweh, the God of
your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the
peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Then all the
assembly answered with a loud voice, As you have said concerning us, so
must we do.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        But the people are many, and it is a time of much
rain, and we are not able to stand outside: neither is this a work of
one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let
all those who are in our cities who have married foreign women come at
appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges
of it, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this
matter be dispatched.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and
Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this [matter]: and
Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.

                        The children
of the captivity did so. Ezra the priest, [with] certain heads of
fathers' [houses], after their fathers' houses, and all of them by
their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the
tenth month to examine the matter.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        They made an end with all
