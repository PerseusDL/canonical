                        Blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked,
   Nor stand in the way of sinners,
   Nor sit in the seat of scoffers;

                        But his delight is in Yahweh's law;
   On his law he meditates day and night.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,

   Whose leaf also does not wither.
   Whatever he does shall prosper.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        The wicked are not so,
   But are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,
   Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,
   But the way of the wicked shall perish.

                        Why do the nations rage,
   And the peoples plot a vain thing?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        The kings of the earth take a stand,
   And the rulers take counsel together,
   Against Yahweh, and against his anointed, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        "Let's break their bonds apart,

                        He who sits in the heavens will laugh.
   The Lord will have them in derision.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Then he will speak to them in his anger,
   And terrify them in his wrath:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        "Yet I have set my king on my holy hill of Zion."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        I will tell of the decree.
Yahweh said to me, "You are my son.
   Today I have become your father.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,
   The uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        You shall break them with a rod of iron.
   You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Now therefore be wise, you kings.
   Be instructed, you judges of the earth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Serve Yahweh with fear,
   And rejoice with trembling.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way,
   For his wrath will soon be kindled.
   Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.

                        Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.
   A fire was kindled against Jacob,

                        He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.

                        He rained also flesh on them as the dust;

                        He let them fall in the midst of their camp,

                        When the anger of God went up against them,

                        For all this they still sinned,

                        But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy

                        He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;

                        He gave also their increase to the caterpillar,

                        He destroyed their vines with hail,

                        He gave over their cattle also to the hail,

                        He made a path for his anger.

                        He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid,

                        He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,

                        He also drove out the nations before them,
   Allotted them for an inheritance by line,

                        Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,

                        But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.

                        When God heard this, he was angry,

                        So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh,

                        And delivered his strength into captivity,

                        He also gave his people over to the sword,

                        Fire devoured their young men;

                        Their priests fell by the sword,

                        Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,

                        Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,

                        But chose the tribe of Judah,

                        He built his sanctuary like the heights,

                        He also chose David his servant,

                        From following the ewes that have their young,
