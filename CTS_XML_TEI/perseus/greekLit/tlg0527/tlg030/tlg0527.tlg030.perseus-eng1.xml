                    <p>
                        The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        "Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher; "Vanity of vanities,
all is vanity."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        What does man gain from all his labor in which he
labors under the sun?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        One generation goes, and another generation
comes; but the earth remains forever.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        The sun also rises, and the
sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        The wind
goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around
continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the
place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        All things
are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with
seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        That which has been is
that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall
be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Is there a
thing of which it may be said, "Behold, this is new?" It has been long
ago, in the ages which were before us.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        There is no memory of the
former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to
come, among those that shall come after.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        I
applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all
that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God has given to
the sons of men to be afflicted with.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        I have seen all the works
that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and a chasing
after wind.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        That which is crooked can't be made straight; and
that which is lacking can't be counted.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        I said to myself,
"Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were
before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of
wisdom and knowledge."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to
know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after
wind.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases
knowledge increases sorrow.

                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">

                    <p>
                        I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with mirth:
therefore enjoy pleasure;" and, behold, this also was vanity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        I
said of laughter, "It is foolishness;" and of mirth, "What does it
accomplish?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my
heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold of folly, until I
might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do
under heaven all the days of their lives.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        I made myself great
works. I built myself houses. I planted myself vineyards.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        I made
myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of
fruit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        I made myself pools of water, to water from it the forest
where trees were reared.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        I bought men-servants and maid-servants,
and had servants born in my house. I also had great possessions of
herds and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        I
also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and
of the provinces. I got myself men-singers and women-singers, and the
delights of the sons of men -- musical instruments, and that of all
sorts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        So I was great, and increased more than all who were
before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also remained with me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Whatever my eyes desired, I didn't keep from them. I didn't withhold my
heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor, and
this was my portion from all my labor.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Then I looked at all the
works that my hands had worked, and at the labor that I had labored to
do; and, behold, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was
no profit under the sun.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly: for
what can the king's successor do? Just that which has been done long
ago.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels
darkness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool
walks in darkness -- and yet I perceived that one event happens to them
all.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Then said I in my heart, "As it happens to the fool, so
will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?" Then said I
in my heart that this also is vanity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        For of the wise man, even
as of the fool, there is no memory for ever, seeing that in the days to
come all will have been long forgotten. Indeed, the wise man must die
just like the fool!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the
sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun, seeing
that I must leave it to the man who comes after me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Who knows
whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all
of my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself
wise under the sun. This also is vanity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all
the labor in which I had labored under the sun.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        For there is a
man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge, and with skillfulness;
yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not labored for
it. This also is vanity and a great evil.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        For what has a man of
all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, in which he labors
under the sun?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        For all his days are sorrows, and his travail is
grief; yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is
vanity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        There is nothing better for a man than that he should
eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I
saw, that it is from the hand of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        For who can eat, or who
can have enjoyment, more than I?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        For to the man who pleases him,
God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives
travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases
God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.

   And a time to gather stones together;
A time to embrace,
   And a time to refrain from embracing;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        A time to seek,

A time to keep,

   And a time to sew;
A time to keep silence,
   And a time to speak;

                        A time to love,
   And a time to hate;
A time for war,
   And a time for peace.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        What profit has he who works in that in which he labors?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men to
be afflicted with.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        He has made everything beautiful in its time.
He has also set eternity in their hearts, yet so that man can't find
out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice,
and to do good as long as they live.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Also that every man should
eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can
be added to it, nor anything taken from it; and God has done it, that
men should fear before him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        That which is has been long ago, and
that which is to be has been long ago: and God seeks again that which
is passed away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that
wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that
wickedness was there.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        I said in my heart, "God will judge the
righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose
and for every work."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        I said in my heart, "As for the sons of
men, God tests them, so that they may see that they themselves are like
animals.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>

                        For there is a time

                        There is no man who has power over the spirit to

                        All this have I seen, and applied my mind to every work that

another to his hurt.

                        So I saw the wicked buried. Indeed they
came also from holiness. They went and were forgotten in the city where
they did this. This also is vanity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Because sentence against an
evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of
men is fully set in them to do evil.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Though a sinner commits
crimes a hundred times, and lives long, yet surely I know that it will
be better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him.

                        But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he lengthen

                        There is a vanity which is done on the earth, that there are
righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked.
Again, there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of

                        Then I commended
mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat,

                        When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        then I saw all the work of
God, that man can't find out the work that is done under the sun,
because however much a man labors to seek it out, yet he won't find it.
Yes, moreover, though a wise man thinks he can comprehend it, yet he
won't be able to find it.

                        All things come alike to all. There is one event to the
righteous and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, to the unclean,
to him who sacrifices, and to him who doesn't sacrifice. As is the
good, so is the sinner; he who takes an oath, as he who fears an oath.

                        This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is
one event to all: yes also, the heart of the sons of men is full of
evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that
they go to the dead.

                        For

                        I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to
the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise,
nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill;
but time and chance happen to them all.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        For man also doesn't

                        I have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way, and it

                        There was a little city, and few men within
