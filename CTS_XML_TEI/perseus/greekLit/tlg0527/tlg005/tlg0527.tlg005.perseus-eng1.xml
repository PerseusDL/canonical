                        These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the
Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between
Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        It is eleven days' [journey] from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to
Kadesh-barnea.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        It happened in the fortieth year, in the eleventh
month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children
of Israel, according to all that Yahweh had given him in commandment to
them;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites, who
lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at
Edrei.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to
declare this law, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb,
saying, You have lived long enough in this mountain:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        turn you,
and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and
to all [the places] near thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country,
and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore, the land of
the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river
Euphrates.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and
possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to
Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you
myself alone:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and, behold,
you are this day as the stars of the sky for multitude.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Yahweh,
the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are,
and bless you, as he has promised you!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        How can I myself alone
bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Take
wise men of understanding and well known according to your tribes, and
I will make them heads over you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        You answered me, and said, The
thing which you have spoken is good [for us] to do.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        So I took
the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over
you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of
fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes]
between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his
brother, and the sojourner who is with him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        You shall not show
partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike;
you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's:
and the cause that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I
will hear it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        I commanded you at that time all the things which
you should do.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        We journeyed from Horeb, and went through all
that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the
hill-country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and we
came to Kadesh-barnea.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        I said to you, You are come to the
hill-country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you: go up, take
possession, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you;
don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        You came near to me
everyone of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may
search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we
must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        The thing
pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came to
the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        They took of the fruit
of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us
word again, and said, It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to
us.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        Yet you wouldn't go up, but rebelled against the commandment
of Yahweh your God:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        and you murmured in your tents, and said,
Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of
Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        Where are we going up? our brothers have made our heart to melt,
saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great
and fortified up to the sky; and moreover we have seen the sons of the
Anakim there.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        Then I said to you, Don't dread, neither be afraid
of them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        Yahweh your God who goes before you, he will fight for
you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh your
God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went,
until you came to this place.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        Yet in this thing you didn't
believe Yahweh your God,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        who went before you in the way, to seek
you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you
by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        Yahweh heard
the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the
good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        save Caleb the
son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that
he has trodden on, and to his children, because he has wholly followed
Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying,
You also shall not go in there:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        Joshua the son of Nun, who
stands before you, he shall go in there: encourage you him; for he
shall cause Israel to inherit it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="39"/>
                        Moreover your little ones,
whom you said should be a prey, and your children, who this day have no
knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I
give it, and they shall possess it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="40"/>
                        But as for you, turn you,
and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="41"/>
                        Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against Yahweh,
we will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded
us. You girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go
up into the hill-country.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="42"/>
                        Yahweh said to me, Tell them, Don't go
up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be struck before
your enemies.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="43"/>
                        So I spoke to you, and you didn't listen; but you
rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and
went up into the hill-country.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="44"/>
                        The Amorites, who lived in that
hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and
beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="45"/>
                        You returned and wept
before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn't listen to your voice, nor gave ear to
you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="46"/>
                        So you abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days
that you abode [there].
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by
the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we compassed Mount
Seir many days.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Yahweh spoke to me, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        You have
compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Command
you the people, saying, You are to pass through the border of your
brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be
afraid of you: take good heed to yourselves therefore;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        don't
contend with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so
much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given
Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        You shall purchase food of
them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them
for money, that you may drink.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        For Yahweh your God has blessed
you in all the work of your hand; he has known your walking through
this great wilderness: these forty years Yahweh your God has been with
you; you have lacked nothing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        So we passed by from our brothers
the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah
from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the
wilderness of Moab.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Yahweh said to me, Don't bother Moab, neither
contend with them in battle; for I will not give you of his land for a
possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a
possession.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        (The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and
many, and tall, as the Anakim:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        these also are accounted Rephaim,
as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        The Horites also
lived in Seir before, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they
destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place; as Israel
did to the land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.)
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered. We went over the brook
Zered.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        The days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we
were come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years; until all the
generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp,
as Yahweh swore to them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Moreover the hand of Yahweh was against

                        Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, your days approach
that you must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of
meeting, that I may give him a charge. Moses and Joshua went, and
presented themselves in the tent of meeting.

                        Yahweh appeared in

                        Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep

among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have
made with them.

                        Then my anger shall be kindled against them in

and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on
them; so that they will say in that day, Haven't these evils come on us
because our God is not among us?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        I will surely hide my face in

                        Now therefore write you this song for

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore

eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat; then will they turn to
other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        It shall happen, when many evils and troubles are come on them,
that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not

                        So Moses wrote this song the same day,

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        He gave Joshua the son of

                        Take this book of the law, and put

                        Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes,

                        For I know that after
my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the

                        Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the

                        and all Naphtali, and the land of

                        Yahweh said to him, This is the land
which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give

shall not go over there.

                        He

                        Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit
