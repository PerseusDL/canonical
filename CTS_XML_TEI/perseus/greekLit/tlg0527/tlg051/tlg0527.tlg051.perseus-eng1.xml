                    <p>
                        How does the city sit solitary, that was full of people!
She has become as a widow, who was great among the nations!
She who was a princess among the provinces is become tributary!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        She weeps sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks;
Among all her lovers she has none to comfort her:
All her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her
      enemies.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because
      of great servitude;
She dwells among the nations, she finds no rest:
All her persecutors overtook her within the straits.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn
      assembly;
All her gates are desolate, her priests do sigh:
Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Her adversaries are become the head, her enemies prosper;
For Yahweh has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions:
Her young children are gone into captivity before the adversary.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        From the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed:
Her princes are become like harts that find no pasture,
They are gone without strength before the pursuer.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her
      miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old:
When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none did help
      her,
The adversaries saw her, they did mock at her desolations.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she is become as an
      unclean thing;
All who honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness:
Yes, she sighs, and turns backward.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Her filthiness was in her skirts; she didn't remember her latter
      end;
Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she has no comforter:
See, Yahweh, my affliction; for the enemy has magnified himself.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things:
For she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary,
Concerning whom you did command that they should not enter into your
      assembly.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        All her people sigh, they seek bread;
They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul:
Look, Yahweh, and see; for I am become abject.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?
Look, and see if there be any sorrow like my sorrow, which is brought
      on me,
With which Yahweh has afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce anger.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        From on high has he sent fire into my bones, and it prevails
      against them;
He has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back:
He has made me desolate and faint all the day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand;
They are knit together, they are come up on my neck; he has made my
      strength to fail:
The Lord has delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able
      to stand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men in the midst of me;
He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men:
The Lord has trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        For these things I weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water;
Because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me:
My children are desolate, because the enemy has prevailed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Zion spreads forth her hands; there is none to comfort her;
Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob, that those who are round about
      him should be his adversaries:
Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Yahweh is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment:
Please hear all you peoples, and see my sorrow:
My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        I called for my lovers, [but] they deceived me:
My priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city,
While they sought them food to refresh their souls.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        See, Yahweh; for I am in distress; my heart is troubled;
My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled:
Abroad the sword bereaves, at home there is as death.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me;
All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have
      done it:
You will bring the day that you have proclaimed, and they shall be like
      me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Let all their wickedness come before you;
Do to them, as you have done to me for all my transgressions:
For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.

                    <p>
                        How has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in
      his anger!
He has cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel,
And hasn't remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        The Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and has
      not pitied:
He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of
      Judah;
He has brought them down to the ground; he has profaned the kingdom and
      the princes of it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        He has cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel;
He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy:
He has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire, which devours round about.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        He has bent his bow like an enemy, he has stood with his right
      hand as an adversary,
Has killed all that were pleasant to the eye:
In the tent of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his wrath like
      fire.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        The Lord is become as an enemy, he has swallowed up Israel;
He has swallowed up all her palaces, he has destroyed his strongholds;
He has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        He has violently taken away his tent, as if it were of a garden;
      he has destroyed his place of assembly:
Yahweh has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion,
Has despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        The Lord has cast off his altar, he has abhorred his sanctuary;
He has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces:
They have made a noise in the house of Yahweh, as in the day of a
      solemn assembly.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Yahweh has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion;
He has stretched out the line, he has not withdrawn his hand from
      destroying;
He has made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish together.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Her gates are sunk into the ground; he has destroyed and broken
      her bars:
Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not;
Yes, her prophets find no vision from Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground, they keep
      silence;
They have cast up dust on their heads; they have girded themselves with
      sackcloth:
The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        My eyes do fail with tears, my heart is troubled;
My liver is poured on the earth, because of the destruction of the
      daughter of my people,
Because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the
      city.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        They tell their mothers, Where is grain and wine?
When they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,
When their soul is poured out into their mothers' bosom.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        What shall I testify to you? what shall I liken to you, daughter
      of Jerusalem?
What shall I compare to you, that I may comfort you, virgin daughter of
      Zion?
For your breach is great like the sea: who can heal you?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Your prophets have seen for you false and foolish visions;
They have not uncovered your iniquity, to bring back your captivity,
But have seen for you false oracles and causes of banishment.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        All that pass by clap their hands at you;
They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, [saying],
Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of
      the whole earth?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you;
They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up;
Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have
      seen it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Yahweh has done that which he purposed; he has fulfilled his
      word that he commanded in the days of old;
He has thrown down, and has not pitied:
He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you; he has exalted the horn of
      your adversaries.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Their heart cried to the Lord:
wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and
      night;
Give yourself no respite; don't let the apple of your eye cease.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches;
Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord:
Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children, that
      faint for hunger at the head of every street.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Look, Yahweh, and see to whom you have done thus!
Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the
      hands?
Shall the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets;
My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword:
You have killed them in the day of your anger; you have slaughtered,
      [and] not pitied.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        You have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors
      on every side;
There was none that escaped or remained in the day of Yahweh's anger:
Those that I have dandled and brought up has my enemy consumed.

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Surely against me he turns his hand again and again all the day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        My flesh and my skin has he made old; he has broken my bones.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        He has built against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been
      long dead.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        He has walled me about, that I can't go forth; he has made my
      chain heavy.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        He has walled up my ways with hewn stone; he has made my paths
      crooked.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        The crown is fallen from our head:
Woe to us! for we have sinned.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        For this our heart is faint;
For these things our eyes are dim;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate:
The foxes walk on it.

                        You, Yahweh, abide forever;
Your throne is from generation to generation.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Why do you forget us forever,
[And] forsake us so long time?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Turn you us to you, Yahweh, and we shall be turned;
Renew our days as of old.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        But you have utterly rejected us;
You are very angry against us.
