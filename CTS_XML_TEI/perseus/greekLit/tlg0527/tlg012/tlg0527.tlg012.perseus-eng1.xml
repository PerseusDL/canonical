                    <p>
                        It happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned
from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in
Ziklag;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out
of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head:
and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and
did obeisance.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        David said to him, From whence come you? He said
to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        David said to
him, How went the matter? Please tell me. He answered, The people are
fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead;
and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        David said to the
young man who told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son are
dead?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        The young man who told him said, As I happened by chance on
Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and, behold, the
chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        When he looked
behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, Here am I.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        He said to me, Who are you? I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        He
said to me, Stand, I pray you, beside me, and kill me; for anguish has
taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        So I stood
beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live
after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was on his head,
and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my
lord.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and
likewise all the men who were with him:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        and they mourned, and
wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and
for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they
were fallen by the sword.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        David said to the young man who told
him, Whence are you? He answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an
Amalekite.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        David said to him, How were you not afraid to put
forth your hand to destroy Yahweh's anointed?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        David called one
of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him. He struck him, so
that he died.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for
your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain Yahweh's
anointed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
Jonathan his son
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        (and he bade them teach the children of Judah
[the song of] the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places!
How are the mighty fallen!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Don't tell it in Gath,
Don't publish it in the streets of Ashkelon;
Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        You mountains of Gilboa,
Let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings:
For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,
The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,
The bow of Jonathan didn't turn back,
The sword of Saul didn't return empty.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives,
In their death they were not divided:
They were swifter than eagles,
They were stronger than lions.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
Who clothed you in scarlet delicately,
Who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
Jonathan is slain on your high places.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan:
Very pleasant have you been to me:
Your love to me was wonderful,
Passing the love of women.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        How are the mighty fallen,
The weapons of war perished!

                    <p>
                        It happened after this, that David inquired of Yahweh,
saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? Yahweh said to
him, Go up. David said, Where shall I go up? He said, To Hebron.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        His
men who were with him did David bring up, every man with his household:
and they lived in the cities of Hebron.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        The men of Judah came,
and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told
David, saying, The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to
them, Blessed be you of Yahweh, that you have shown this kindness to
your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Now Yahweh show
lovingkindness and truth to you: and I also will requite you this
kindness, because you have done this thing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Now therefore let
your hands be strong, and be you valiant; for Saul your lord is dead,
and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Now
Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, had taken Ish-bosheth the
son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        and he made him
king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over
Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Ish-bosheth,
Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and
he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        The
time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven
years and six months.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of
Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met
them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side
of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Abner
said to Joab, Please let the young men arise and play before us. Joab
said, Let them arise.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Then they arose and went over by number:
twelve for Benjamin, and for Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of
the servants of David.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        They caught everyone his fellow by the
head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down
together: therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim, which is in
Gibeon.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        The battle was very severe that day: and Abner was
beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        The
three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and
Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Asahel pursued after
Abner; and in going he didn't turn to the right hand nor to the left
from following Abner.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is
it you, Asahel? He answered, It is I.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Abner said to him, Turn
you aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay you hold on one
of the young men, and take you his armor. But Asahel would not turn
aside from following him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you
aside from following me: why should I strike you to the ground? how
then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        However he
refused to turn aside: therefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear
struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he
fell down there, and died in the same place: and it happened, that as
many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down
when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the
way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        The children of Benjamin
gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and
stood on the top of a hill.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        Then Abner called to Joab, and said,
"Shall the sword devour forever? Don't you know that it will be
bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before you bid
the people return from following their brothers?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        Joab said, As
God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people
had gone away, nor followed everyone his brother.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        So Joab blew
the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel
no more, neither fought they any more.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        Abner and his men went
all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and
went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        Joab returned
from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together,
there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        But
the servants of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, [so
that] three hundred sixty men died.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        They took up Asahel, and
buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. Joab and
his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.

                        Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the
house of David: and David grew stronger and stronger, but the house of
Saul grew weaker and weaker.

                        To David were sons born in Hebron:
and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

                        and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,

                        and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah,
David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.

                        It happened,
while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David,
that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Now Saul had
a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and
[Ish-bosheth] said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father's
concubine?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Then was Abner very angry for the words of
Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? This
day do I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his
brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand
of David; and yet you charge me this day with a fault concerning this

                        to transfer the kingdom

                        He could not answer
Abner another word, because he feared him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Abner sent messengers
to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying [also], Make

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        He said, Well; I will make a league
with you; but one thing I require of you: that is, you shall not see my
face, except you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to
see my face.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son,
saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I pledged to be married to me
for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>

                        Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her
to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return: and he returned.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, In times
past you sought for David to be king over you:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        now then do it;
for Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David
I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and
out of the hand of all their enemies.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Abner also spoke in the
ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in
Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of
Benjamin.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with
him. David made Abner and the men who were with him a feast.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to
my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you
may reign over all that your soul desires. David sent Abner away; and
he went in peace.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Behold, the servants of David and Joab came
from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not
with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in
peace.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        When Joab and all the host who was with him had come,
they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he
has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Then Joab came to
the king, and said, What have you done? behold, Abner came to you; why
is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        You

your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        When Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and
they brought him back from the well of Sirah: but David didn't know it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        When Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the
midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and struck him there in
the body, so that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        Afterward, when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless
before Yahweh forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        let
it fall on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let
there not fail from the house of Joab one who has an issue, or who is a
leper, or who leans on a staff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks
bread.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he
had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        David
said to Joab, and to all the people who were with him, Tear your

David followed the bier.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        They buried Abner in Hebron: and the
king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the
people wept.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        The king lamented for Abner, and said,
Should Abner die as a fool dies?

                        Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters:
As a man falls before the children of iniquity, so did you fall.

   All the people wept again over him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        All the people came to
cause David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying,
God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else,
until the sun be down.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        All the people took notice of it, and it

                        So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of

                        The king said to his

eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.

                        David said,
I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shown

his father. David's servants came into the land of the children of
Ammon.

                        But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun

the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?

off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them
away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        When they told it to David, he sent to meet them; for the

                        When the children of Ammon saw

                        The children of Ammon

                        The rest

                        He said, If

                        So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the

                        When the

                        It was told David; and he

                        The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of

there.

                        When all the kings who were servants to Hadarezer saw

                        It happened, at the return of the year, at the time when

                        It happened at

                        When Uriah was come to him, David
asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash
your feet. Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed
him a mess [of food] from the king.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        But Uriah slept at the door

                        When they had told David, saying, Uriah

a journey? why did you not go down to your house?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Uriah said to

                        David said to Uriah, Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will

                        When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he

                        David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he

David's head. He brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.

                        He brought forth the people who were therein, and put them

                        It happened after this, that Absalom the son of David had a
beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David
loved her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Amnon was so vexed that he fell sick because of his
sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do
anything to her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab,
the son of Shimeah, David's brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        He said to him, Why, son of the king, are you thus lean from day
to day? Won't you tell me? Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother
Absalom's sister.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Jonadab said to him, Lay you down on your bed,
and feign yourself sick: and when your father comes to see you, tell
him, Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and
dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her
hand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the
king was come to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let her sister
Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat
from her hand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to
your brother Amnon's house, and dress him food.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        So Tamar went to
her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. She took dough, and
kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to
eat. Amnon said, Have out all men from me. They went out every man from
him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that
I may eat from your hand. Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and
brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        When she
had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to
her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        She answered him, No, my
brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel.
Don't you do this folly.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        I, where shall I carry my shame? and
as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore,
please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she,
he forced her, and lay with her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Then Amnon hated her with
exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was
greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her,
Arise, be gone.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        She said to him, Not so, because this great
wrong in putting me forth is [worse] than the other that you did to me.
But he would not listen to her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Then he called his servant who
ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt
the door after her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        She had a garment of various colors on her;
for with such robes were the king's daughters who were virgins dressed.
Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various
colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her
way, crying aloud as she went.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Absalom her brother said to her,
Has Amnon your brother been with you? but now hold your peace, my
sister: he is your brother; don't take this thing to heart. So Tamar
remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        But when king
David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Absalom
spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because
he had forced his sister Tamar.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        It happened after two full
years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside
Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Absalom came
to the king, and said, See now, your servant has sheep-shearers; let
the king, I pray you, and his servants go with your servant.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        The king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be
burdensome to you. He pressed him: however he would not go, but blessed
him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        Then said Absalom, If not, please let my brother Amnon go
with us. The king said to him, Why should he go with you?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        But
Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with
him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now, when
Amnon's heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, Smite Amnon,
then kill him; don't be afraid; haven't I commanded you? be courageous,
and be valiant.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom
had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up
on his mule, and fled.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        It happened, while they were in the way,
that the news came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king's
sons, and there is not one of them left.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        Then the king arose,
and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood
by with their clothes torn.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        Jonadab, the son of Shimeah,
David's brother, answered, Don't let my lord suppose that they have
killed all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead; for
by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day
that he forced his sister Tamar.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        Now therefore don't let my

sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        But Absalom fled. The
young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and,
behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons are come: as
your servant said, so it is.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        It happened, as soon as he had
made an end of speaking, that behold, the king's sons came, and lifted
up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept
very sore.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of
Ammihur, king of Geshur. [David] mourned for his son every day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.

                        [the soul of] king David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched there a wise

clothing, Please, and don't anoint yourself with oil, but be as a woman

                        and go in to the king,

                        When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face

                        The

                        Behold, the whole family

                        Then the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        The woman said, Why then have you devised such

                        Joab fell to the

                        So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom

                        The king said, Let him turn to his own house, but

                        When he

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        To Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose

                        Absalom

                        Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king; but he

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        Therefore he said to his servants, Behold, Joab's

Absalom's servants set the field on fire.

                        Then Joab arose, and

                        Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to

therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be iniquity in me,

                        So Joab came to the king, and told him; and

                        Absalom rose up

any man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then
Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are you? He said, Your
servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.

                        Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were

                        But a boy saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of
them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a
well in his court; and they went down there.

                        The woman took and
spread the covering over the well's mouth, and strewed bruised grain

                        Absalom's servants came to the

had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.

                        It happened, after they had departed, that they came up out of the

and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled
against you.

                        Then David arose, and all the people who were with

his father.

                        Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over

                        Absalom set

                        But the

                        The king commanded

                        The people of Israel were struck there before the

                        Absalom happened to meet the
servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went
under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the

                        A certain man saw it, and told Joab, and

                        Joab said to the

                        The man said to Joab, Though I should receive a

hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king charged you
and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man
Absalom.

                        Then said Joab, I may not wait thus with

                        They took

                        Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for
himself the pillar, which is in the king's dale; for he said, I have no

                        Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But come

                        The watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is

                        Ahimaaz called, and said to

                        But Amasa

                        Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in

                        When
David rose up in the morning, the word of Yahweh came to the prophet
Gad, David's seer, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Go and speak to David, Thus says
Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose you one of them, that I may do
it to you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him,
Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? or will you flee
three months before your foes while they pursue you? or shall there be
three days' pestilence in your land? now advise you, and consider what
answer I shall return to him who sent me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        David said to Gad, I
am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh; for his
mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        So
Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the time
appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba
seventy thousand men.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        When the angel stretched out his hand
toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahweh repented him of the evil, and
said to the angel who destroyed the people, It is enough; now stay your
hand. The angel of Yahweh was by the threshing floor of Araunah the
Jebusite.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel who
struck the people, and said, Behold, I have sinned, and I have done
perversely; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand
be against me, and against my father's house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Gad came that day
to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar to Yahweh in the
threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        David went up
according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Araunah
looked forth, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him:
and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king with his face
to the ground.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to
his servant? David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an
altar to Yahweh, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what
seems good to him: behold, the oxen for the burnt offering, and the
threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for the wood:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        all this, king, does Araunah give to the king. Araunah said to the
king, Yahweh your God accept you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        The king said to Araunah, No;
but I will most assuredly buy it of you at a price. Neither will I
offer burnt-offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing. So David
bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt
offerings and peace-offerings. So Yahweh was entreated for the land,
and the plague was stayed from Israel.
