                    <p>
                        Now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus
who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred twenty-seven provinces),
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        that in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on
the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        in the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his princes and his
servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the
provinces, being before him;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        when he shown the riches of his
glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even
one hundred eighty days.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        When these days were fulfilled, the king
made a feast to all the people who were present in Shushan the palace,
both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the
king's palace.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        [There were hangings of] white [cloth], [of]
green, and [of] blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to
silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and
silver, on a pavement of red, and white, and yellow, and black marble.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        They gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being
diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance, according to
the bounty of the king.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        The drinking was according to the law;
none could compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of
his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house
which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        On the seventh day, when the
heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha,
Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven
chamberlains who ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal,
to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was beautiful
to look on.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's
commandment by the chamberlains: therefore was the king very angry, and
his anger burned in him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Then the king said to the wise men, who
knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all who knew law
and judgment;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar,
Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of
Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the
kingdom),
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law,
because she has not done the bidding of the king Ahasuerus by the
chamberlains?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Memucan answered before the king and the princes,
Vashti the queen has not done wrong to the king only, but also to all
the princes, and to all the peoples who are in all the provinces of the
king Ahasuerus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        For this deed of the queen will come abroad to
all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes, when it
shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be
brought in before him, but she didn't come.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        This day will the
princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen
say [the like] to all the king's princes. So [will there arise] much
contempt and wrath.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        If it please the king, let there go forth a
royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the
Persians and the Medes, that it not be altered, that Vashti come no
more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to
another who is better than she.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        When the king's decree which he
shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is
great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great
and small.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        The saying pleased the king and the princes; and the
king did according to the word of Memucan:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        for he sent letters
into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the
writing of it, and to every people after their language, that every man
should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the
language of his people.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">

                    <p>
                        After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was
pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was
decreed against her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Then said the king's servants who ministered
to him, Let there be beautiful young virgins sought for the king:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom,
that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to
Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, to the custody of Hegai
the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for
purification be given them;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        and let the maiden who pleases the
king be queen instead of Vashti. The thing pleased the king; and he did
so.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace, whose name was
Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a
Benjamite,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the
captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        He brought
up Hadassah, who is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither
father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her
father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        So it happened, when the king's commandment and his decree was
heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to Shushan the
palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's
house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        The maiden
pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her
things for her purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens
who were meet to be given her out of the king's house: and he removed
her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives; for Mordecai
had charged her that she should not make it known.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Mordecai
walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how
Esther did, and what would become of her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Now when the turn of
every maiden was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after it had been
done to her as prescribed for the women twelve months (for so were the
days of their purification accomplished, [to wit], six months with oil
of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the
purifying of the women),
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        then in this wise came the maiden to
the king: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the
house of the women to the king's house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        In the evening she went,
and on the next day she returned into the second house of the women, to
the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the
concubines: she came in to the king no more, except the king delighted
in her, and she were called by name.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Now when the turn of
Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken
her for his daughter, was come to go in to the king, she required
nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women,
appointed. Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked
at her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his house
royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh
year of his reign.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        The king loved Esther above all the women,
and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the
virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen
instead of Vashti.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Then the king made a great feast to all his
princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to
the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        When the virgins were gathered together the second time, then
Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Esther had not yet made
known her relatives nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for
Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up
with him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the
king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of
those who kept the threshold, were angry, and sought to lay hands on
the king Ahasuerus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        The thing became known to Mordecai, who
shown it to Esther the queen; and Esther told the king [of it] in
Mordecai's name.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        When inquisition was made of the matter, and it
was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written
in the book of the chronicles before the king.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <milestone unit="verse" n="1"/>
                    <p>
                        After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all
the princes who were with him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        All the king's servants, who were
in the king's gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman; for the
king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn't bow down, nor
did him reverence.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Then the king's servants, who were in the
king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why disobey you the king's commandment?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn't
listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters
would stand: for he had told those who he was a Jew.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        When Haman
saw that Mordecai didn't bow down, nor did him reverence, then was
Haman full of wrath.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        But he thought scorn to lay hands on
Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai:
therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the
whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        In the
first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king
Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to
day, and from month to month, [to] the twelfth [month], which is the
month Adar.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain
people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the
provinces of your kingdom; and their laws are diverse from [those of]
every people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not
for the king's profit to allow them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        If it please the king, let
it be written that they be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand

                        Nevertheless Haman

and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that

                        The king said to Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and

tomorrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons
be hanged on the gallows.

                        The king commanded it so to be done:

                        The Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together

                        The

                        But the

                        The

                        because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the

                        but when [the matter] came before the king, he commanded

                        Therefore they called these days Purim,
