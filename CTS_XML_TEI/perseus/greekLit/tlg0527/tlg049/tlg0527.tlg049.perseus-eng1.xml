                    <p>
                        The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who
were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        to whom the word of
Yahweh came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in
the thirteenth year of his reign.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        It came also in the days of
Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh
year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying
away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Now the word of
Yahweh came to me, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Before I formed you in the belly I
knew you, and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you; I
have appointed you a prophet to the nations.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Then said I, Ah,
Lord Yahweh! behold, I don't know how to speak; for I am a child.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        But Yahweh said to me, Don't say, I am a child; for to whoever I shall
send you, you shall go, and whatever I shall command you, you shall
speak.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Don't be afraid because of them; for I am with you to
deliver you, says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Then Yahweh put forth his hand, and
touched my mouth; and Yahweh said to me, Behold, I have put my words in
your mouth:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        behold, I have this day set you over the nations and
over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to
overthrow, to build and to plant.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Moreover the word of Yahweh
came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? I said, I see a rod of an
almond tree.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Then said Yahweh to me, You have well seen: for I
watch over my word to perform it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        The word of Yahweh came to me
the second time, saying, What see you? I said, I see a boiling caldron;
and the face of it is from the north.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Then Yahweh said to me,
Out of the north evil shall break forth on all the inhabitants of the
land.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms
of the north, says Yahweh; and they shall come, and they shall set
everyone his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and
against all the walls of it round about, and against all the cities of
Judah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        I will utter my judgments against them touching all their
wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to
other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        You
therefore gird up your loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I
command you: don't be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        For, behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, and an
iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land, against the
kings of Judah, against the princes of it, against the priests of it,
and against the people of the land.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        They shall fight against
you; but they shall not prevail against you: for I am with you, says
Yahweh, to deliver you.

                    <p>
                        The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Go, and cry in
the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I remember for you the
kindness of your youth, the love of your weddings; how you went after
me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Israel [was]
holiness to Yahweh, the first fruits of his increase: all who devour
him shall be held guilty; evil shall come on them, says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Hear you the word of Yahweh, O house of Jacob, and all the families of
the house of Israel:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        thus says Yahweh, What unrighteousness have
your fathers found in me, that they have gone far from me, and have
walked after vanity, and are become vain?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Neither said they,
Where is Yahweh who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us
through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through
a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none
passed through, and where no man lived?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        I brought you into a
plentiful land, to eat the fruit of it and the goodness of it; but when
you entered, you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        The priests didn't say, Where is Yahweh? and those who handle the
law didn't know me: the rulers also transgressed against me, and the
prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not
profit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Therefore I will yet contend with you, says Yahweh, and
with your children's children will I contend.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For pass over to
the isles of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider
diligently; and see if there has been such a thing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Has a nation
changed [its] gods, which yet are no gods? but my people have changed
their glory for that which does not profit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Be astonished, you
heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be you very desolate, says
Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        For my people have committed two evils: they have
forsaken me, the spring of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns,
broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Is Israel a servant? is
he a home-born [slave]? why is he become a prey?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        The young lions
have roared on him, and yelled; and they have made his land waste: his
cities are burned up, without inhabitant.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        The children also of
Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Haven't you procured this to yourself, in that you have forsaken Yahweh
your God, when he led you by the way?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Now what have you to do in
the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? or what have you
to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Your own wickedness shall correct you, and your backsliding shall
reprove you: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a
bitter, that you have forsaken Yahweh your God, and that my fear is not
in you, says the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        For of old time I have
broken your yoke, and burst your bonds; and you said, I will not serve;
for on every high hill and under every green tree you did bow yourself,
playing the prostitute.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Yet I had planted you a noble vine,
wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate
branches of a foreign vine to me?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        For though you wash yourself
with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me,
says the Lord Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        How can you say, I am not defiled, I have
not gone after the Baals? see your way in the valley, know what you
have done: [you are] a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        a
wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind in her
desire; in her occasion who can turn her away? all those who seek her
will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but
you said, It is in vain; no, for I have loved strangers, and after them
will I go.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the
house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their
priests, and their prophets;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        who tell a stock, You are my
father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned
their back to me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble
they will say, Arise, and save us.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        But where are your gods that
you have made you? let them arise, if they can save you in the time of
your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods,
Judah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        Why will you contend with me? you all have transgressed
against me, says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        In vain have I struck your children;
they received no correction: your own sword has devoured your prophets,
like a destroying lion.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        Generation, see the word of Yahweh. Have
I been a wilderness to Israel? or a land of thick darkness? why say my
people, We are broken loose; we will come no more to you?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        Can a
virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have
forgotten me days without number.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        How trimmest you your way to
seek love! therefore even the wicked women have you taught your ways.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the
innocent poor: you did not find them breaking in; but it is because of
all these things.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        Yet you said, I am innocent; surely his anger
is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with you,
because you say, I have not sinned.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        Why go you about so much to
change your way? you shall be ashamed of Egypt also, as you were
ashamed of Assyria.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        From there also shall you go forth, with
your hands on your head: for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you
trust, and you shall not prosper with them.

                    <p>
                        They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him,
and become another man's, will he return to her again? Won't that land
be greatly polluted? But you have played the prostitute with many
lovers; yet return again to me, says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Lift up your eyes to
the bare heights, and see; where have you not been lain with? By the
ways have you sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and you
have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no
latter rain; yet you have a prostitute's forehead, you refused to be

                        Moreover Yahweh said to me in the

                        I saw, when, for this
very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put
her away and given her a bill of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her

                        It happened through the lightness of her prostitution, that the land

                        Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not returned

                        Yahweh said to me, Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous

                        Go, and proclaim these words toward the

                        It shall come to pass, when you are multiplied

                        But I said, How I will put you

                        Surely as a wife

                        They

                        For Yahweh has

                        They shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and

and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow

                        I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness,

                        Thus says Yahweh: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter
weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted
for her children, because they are no more.

                        Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I

                        Is

                        Thus says Yahweh of

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        In those days they shall say no more,

                        Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will make a new covenant

Yahweh.

                        But this is the covenant that I will make with the

their sin will I remember no more.

                        Thus says Yahweh, who gives

                        If these ordinances

                        Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was

                        For
Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy,

                        and he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Jeremiah said, The word of Yahweh came to me,

                        So Hanamel my uncle's son came to

to me, Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of

                        They have turned to me the back, and not the face: and though I

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        But they set their

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of

through [the fire] to Molech; which I didn't command them, neither did

Judah to sin.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        Now therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of

                        Then Jeremiah the prophet

                        when the king of Babylon's army was fighting against Jerusalem, and

                        All the princes and all

                        in

                        that all the princes

                        It happened that, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of

by the way of the king's garden, through the gate between the two

                        But the army of the

Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he
gave judgment on him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Then the king of Babylon killed the sons

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes,

                        The Chaldeans

                        Then Nebuzaradan the captain

                        Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon

                        The captain

                        so that Yahweh could no longer bear, because of
