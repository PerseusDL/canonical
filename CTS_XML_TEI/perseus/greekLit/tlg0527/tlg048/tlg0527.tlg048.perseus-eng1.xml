                    <p>
                        The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning
Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,
kings of Judah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Hear, heavens,
   And listen, earth; for Yahweh has spoken:
I have nourished and brought up children,
   And they have rebelled against me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        The ox knows his owner,
   And the donkey his master's crib;
   But Israel doesn't know,
   My people don't consider.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Ah sinful nation,
   A people laden with iniquity,
   A seed of evil-doers,
   Children who deal corruptly!
They have forsaken Yahweh.
   They have despised the Holy One of Israel.
   They are estranged and backward.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Why should you be beaten more,
   That you revolt more and more?
The whole head is sick,
   And the whole heart faint.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness
      in it:
   Wounds, welts, and open sores.
   They haven't been closed, neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Your country is desolate.
   Your cities are burned with fire.
   Strangers devour your land in your presence,
   And it is desolate,
   As overthrown by strangers.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,
   Like a hut in a field of melons,
   Like a besieged city.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Unless Yahweh of hosts had left to us a very small remnant,
   We would have been as Sodom;
   We would have been like Gomorrah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Hear the word of Yahweh, you rulers of Sodom!
   Listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        "What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?," says Yahweh.
   "I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams,
   And the fat of fed animals.
   I don't delight in the blood of bulls,
   Or of lambs,
   Or of male goats.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        When you come to appear before me,
   Who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Bring no more vain offerings.
   Incense is an abomination to me;
   New moons, Sabbaths, and convocations:
   I can't bear with evil assemblies.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts;
   They are a burden to me.
   I am weary of bearing them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        When you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you;
   Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear.
   Your hands are full of blood.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Wash yourselves, make yourself clean.
   Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes;
   Cease to do evil.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Learn to do well.
   Seek justice,
   Relieve the oppressed,
   Judge the fatherless,
   Plead for the widow."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        "Come now, and let us reason together," says Yahweh:
   "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
   Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        If you are willing and obedient,
   You shall eat the good of the land;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the
      sword;
   For the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        How the faithful city has become a prostitute!
   She was full of justice; righteousness lodged in her,
   But now murderers.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Your silver has become dross,
   Your wine mixed with water.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves.
   Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards.
   They don't judge the fatherless,
   Neither does the cause of the widow come to them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts,
   The Mighty One of Israel, says:
"Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries,
   And avenge myself of my enemies;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        And I will turn my hand on you,
   Thoroughly purge away your dross,
   And will take away all your tin.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        I will restore your judges as at the first,
   And your counselors as at the beginning.
Afterward you shall be called 'The city of righteousness,
   A faithful town.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        Zion shall be redeemed with justice,
   And her converts with righteousness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be
      together,
   And those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,
   And you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades,
   And as a garden that has no water.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        The strong will be like tinder,
   And his work like a spark.
They will both burn together,
   And no one will quench them."

                        This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh's
      house shall be established on the top of the mountains,
   And shall be raised above the hills;
   And all nations shall flow to it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Many peoples shall go and say,
   "Come, let's go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
   To the house of the God of Jacob;
   And he will teach us of his ways,
   And we will walk in his paths.
For out of Zion the law shall go forth,
   And the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        He will judge between the nations,
   And will decide concerning many peoples;
   And they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
   And their spears into pruning-hooks.
Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
   Neither shall they learn war any more.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        House of Jacob, come, and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,
   Because they are filled from the east,
   With those who practice divination like the Philistines,
   And they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Their land is full of silver and gold,
   Neither is there any end of their treasures.
Their land also is full of horses,
   Neither is there any end of their chariots.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Their land also is full of idols.
   They worship the work of their own hands,
   That which their own fingers have made.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Man is brought low,
   And mankind is humbled;
   Therefore don't forgive them.

                        Enter into the rock,
   And hide in the dust,
From before the terror of Yahweh,
   And from the glory of his majesty.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        The lofty looks of man will be brought low,
   The haughtiness of men will be bowed down,
   And Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        For there will be a day of Yahweh of Hosts for all that is proud
      and haughty,
   And for all that is lifted up;
   And it shall be brought low:

                        The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,
   And the haughtiness of men shall be brought low;
   And Yahweh alone shall be exalted in that day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        The idols shall utterly pass away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Men shall go into the caves of the rocks,
   And into the holes of the earth,
   From before the terror of Yahweh,
   And from the glory of his majesty,
   When he arises to shake the earth mightily.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver,
   And their idols of gold,
   Which have been made for themselves to worship,
   To the moles and to the bats;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        To go into the caverns of the rocks,
   And into the clefts of the ragged rocks,
   From before the terror of Yahweh,
   And from the glory of his majesty,
   When he arises to shake the earth mightily.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils;
   For of what account is he?

                        Justice is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off; for

                        Yes, truth is lacking; and he who departs from evil makes himself a

                        He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no

                        I will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down to
