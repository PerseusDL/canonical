                        All this, [said David], have I been made to understand in writing from
the hand of Yahweh, even all the works of this pattern.

                        David
said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it:
don't be afraid, nor be dismayed; for Yahweh God, even my God, is with
you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you, until all the work for the
service of the house of Yahweh is finished.

                        Behold, there are
the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the
house of God: and there shall be with you in all manner of work every
willing man who has skill, for any manner of service: also the captains
and all the people will be wholly at your commandment.

                        David the king said to all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom
alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great;
for the palace is not for man, but for Yahweh God.

                        Now I have
prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the
[things of] gold, and the silver for the [things of] silver, and the
brass for the [things of] brass, the iron for the [things of] iron, and
wood for the [things of] wood; onyx stones, and [stones] to be set,
stones for inlaid work, and of various colors, and all manner of
precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Moreover also,
because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I
have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of
my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and
seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the
walls of the houses;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        of gold for the [things of] gold, and of
silver for the [things of] silver, and for all manner of work [to be
made] by the hands of artificers. Who then offers willingly to
consecrate himself this day to Yahweh?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Then the princes of the
fathers' [houses], and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the
captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's
work, offered willingly;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        and they gave for the service of the
house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and
of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents,
and of iron a hundred thousand talents.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        They with whom
[precious] stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of
Yahweh, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Then the people
rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart
they offered willingly to Yahweh: and David the king also rejoiced with
great joy.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the
assembly; and David said, Blessed be you, Yahweh, the God of Israel our
father, forever and ever.

                        Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, and
the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all
that is in the heavens and in the earth [is your]; your is the kingdom,
Yahweh, and you are exalted as head above all.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Both riches and
honor come of you, and you rule over all; and in your hand is power and
might; and in your hand it is to make great, and to give strength to

                        Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your

                        But who am I, and what is my people, that we
should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things
come of you, and of your own have we given you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        For we are
strangers before you, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days
on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Yahweh
our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for
your holy name comes of your hand, and is all your own.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        I know
also, my God, that you try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness.
As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all
these things: and now have I seen with joy your people, that are
present here, offer willingly to you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Yahweh, the God of
Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the

their heart to you;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart,
to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to
do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made
provision.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        David said to all the assembly, Now bless Yahweh
your God. All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers,
and bowed down their heads, and worshiped Yahweh, and the king.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings to
Yahweh, on the next day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one
thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and
sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        and ate and drink
before Yahweh on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon the
son of David king the second time, and anointed him to Yahweh to be
prince, and Zadok to be priest.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        Then Solomon sat on the throne
of Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all
Israel obeyed him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        All the princes, and the mighty men, and all
the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the
king.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
Israel, and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any
king before him in Israel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        Now David the son of Jesse reigned
over all Israel.

                        The time that he reigned over Israel was forty
years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty-three [years]
reigned he in Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        He died in a good old age, full of
days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his place.

                        Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they
are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of
Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,

                        with
all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over
Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
