                    <p>
                        In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of
Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the
prophet, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        "Yahweh was very displeased with your fathers.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Therefore tell them: Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: 'Return to me,'
says Yahweh of Hosts, 'and I will return to you,' says Yahweh of Hosts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Don't you be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets
proclaimed, saying: Thus says Yahweh of hosts, 'Return now from your
evil ways, and from your evil doings;' but they did not hear, nor
listen to me, says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Your fathers, where are they? And the
prophets, do they live forever?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        But my words and my decrees,
which I commanded my servants the prophets, didn't they overtake your
fathers?

   "Then they repented and said, 'Just as Yahweh of Hosts determined to
do to us, according to our ways, and according to our practices, so he
has dealt with us.'"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh
month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the
word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo,
the prophet, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        "I had a vision in the night, and, behold, a
man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that
were in a ravine; and behind him there were red, brown, and white
horses.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Then I asked, 'My lord, what are these?'"

   The angel who talked with me said to me, "I will show you what these
are."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        The man who stood among the myrtle trees answered, "They are
the ones Yahweh has sent to go back and forth through the earth."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        They reported to the angel of Yahweh who stood among the
myrtle trees, and said, "We have walked back and forth through the
earth, and, behold, all the earth is at rest and in peace."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Then the angel of Yahweh replied, "O Yahweh of Hosts, how
long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah,
against which you have had indignation these seventy years?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Yahweh answered the angel who talked with me with kind and
comforting words.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        So the angel who talked with me said to me,
"Proclaim, saying, 'Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: "I am jealous for
Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        I am very angry
with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased,
but they added to the calamity."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Therefore thus says Yahweh: "I
have returned to Jerusalem with mercy. My house shall be built in it,"
says Yahweh of Hosts, "and a line shall be stretched forth over
Jerusalem."'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        "Proclaim further, saying, 'Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: "My
cities will again overflow with prosperity, and Yahweh will again
comfort Zion, and will again choose Jerusalem."'"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        I asked the angel who talked with me, "What are these?"

   He answered me, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah,
Israel, and Jerusalem."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Yahweh showed me four craftsmen.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Then I asked, "What
are these coming to do?"

   He said, "These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man
lifted up his head; but these have come to terrify them, to cast down
the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land
of Judah to scatter it."

                    <p>
                        I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, a man with a
measuring line in his hand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Then I asked, "Where are you going?"

   He said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and
what is its length."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Behold, the angel who talked with me went forth, and another
angel went out to meet him,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        and said to him, "Run, speak to this
young man, saying, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without
walls, because of the multitude of men and cattle in it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        For I,'
says Yahweh, 'will be to her a wall of fire around it, and I will be
the glory in the midst of her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Come! Come! Flee from the land of
the north,' says Yahweh; 'for I have spread you abroad as the four
winds of the sky,' says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        'Come, Zion! Escape, you who
dwell with the daughter of Babylon.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        For thus says Yahweh of
hosts: 'For honor he has sent me to the nations which plundered you;
for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        For, behold,
I will shake my hand over them, and they will be a spoil to those who
served them; and you will know that Yahweh of Hosts has sent me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for, behold, I come, and I will
dwell in the midst of you,' says Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Many nations shall join
themselves to Yahweh in that day, and shall be my people; and I will
dwell in the midst of you, and you shall know that Yahweh of Hosts has
sent me to you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Yahweh will inherit Judah as his portion in the
holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Be silent, all
flesh, before Yahweh; for he has roused himself from his holy

                        He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel
of Yahweh, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Yahweh said to Satan, "Yahweh rebuke you, Satan! Yes, Yahweh who
has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn't this a burning stick plucked out
of the fire?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing
before the angel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        He answered and spoke to those who stood before
him, saying, "Take the filthy garments off of him." To him he said,
"Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will
clothe you with rich clothing."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        I said, "Let them set a clean turban on his head."

   So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and the
angel of Yahweh was standing by.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        The angel of Yahweh protested to
Joshua, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        "Thus says Yahweh of hosts: 'If you will walk in
my ways, and if you will keep my charge, then you also shall judge my
house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of
access among these who stand by.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Hear now, Joshua the high
priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men who
are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant, the Branch.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one
stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the engraving of it,' says
Yahweh of Hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one
day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        In that day,' says Yahweh of hosts, 'you will invite every
man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.'"

                        The angel who talked with me came again, and wakened me, as a
man who is wakened out of his sleep.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        He said to me, "What do you
see?"

   I said, "I have seen, and, behold, a lampstand all of gold, with its
bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon; there are seven
pipes to each of the lamps, which are on the top of it;

                        and two

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying,
"What are these, my lord?"

                        Then the angel who talked with me answered me, "Don't you know
what these are?"

   I said, "No, my lord."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, "This is the word of
Yahweh to Zerubbabel, saying, 'Not by might, nor by power, but by my
Spirit,' says Yahweh of Hosts.

                        Who are you, great mountain?
before Zerubbabel [you are a plain; and he will bring out the capstone

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        "The
hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands
shall also finish it; and you will know that Yahweh of Hosts has sent
me to you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Indeed, who despises the day of small things? For
these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of
Zerubbabel. These are the eyes of Yahweh, which run back and forth
through the whole earth."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Then I asked him, "What are these two olive trees on the
right side of the lampstand and on the left side of it?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        I asked him the second time, "What are these two
olive-branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that pour the
golden oil out of themselves?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        He answered me, "Don't you know what these are?"

   I said, "No, my lord."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Then he said, "These are the two anointed ones who stand by

                        In that day there will be on the bells of the
horses, "HOLY TO YAHWEH;" and the pots in Yahweh's house will be like
the bowls before the altar.

                        Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in
Judah will be holy to Yahweh of Hosts; and all those who sacrifice will
come and take of them, and cook in them. In that day there will no
longer be a Canaanite in the house of Yahweh of Hosts.
