                    <p>
                        The oracle which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Yahweh, how
long will I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you "Violence!"
and will you not save?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Why do you show me iniquity, and look at
perversity? For destruction and violence are before me. There is
strife, and contention rises up.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Therefore the law is paralyzed,
and justice never goes forth; for the wicked surround the righteous;
therefore justice goes forth perverted.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        "Look among the nations, watch, and wonder marvelously; for I
am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it is
told you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and
hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess
dwelling places that are not theirs.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        They are feared and dreaded.
Their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Their
horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the
evening wolves. Their horsemen press proudly on. Yes, their horsemen
come from afar. They fly as an eagle that hurries to devour.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        All
of them come for violence. Their hordes face the desert. He gathers
prisoners like sand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Yes, he scoffs at kings, and princes are a
derision to him. He laughs at every stronghold, for he builds up an
earthen ramp, and takes it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Then he sweeps by like the wind, and
goes on. He is indeed guilty, whose strength is his god."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Aren't you from everlasting, Yahweh my God, my Holy One? We
will not die. Yahweh, you have appointed him for judgment. You, Rock,
have established him to punish.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        You who have purer eyes than to
see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why do you tolerate those
who deal treacherously, and keep silent when the wicked swallows up the
man who is more righteous than he,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        and make men like the fish of
the sea, like the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        He takes up all of them with the hook. He catches them in his net, and
gathers them in his dragnet. Therefore he rejoices and is glad.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to his dragnet,
because by them his life is luxurious, and his food is good.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Will he therefore continually empty his net, and kill the nations
without mercy?

                    <p>
                        I will stand at my watch, and set myself on the ramparts, and
will look out to see what he will say to me, and what I will answer
concerning my complaint.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Yahweh answered me, "Write the vision, and make it plain on
tablets, that he may run who reads it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        For the vision is yet for
the appointed time, and it hurries toward the end, and won't prove
false. Though it takes time, wait for it; because it will surely come.
It won't delay.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Behold, his soul is puffed up. It is not upright
in him, but the righteous will live by his faith.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Yes, moreover,
wine is treacherous. A haughty man who doesn't stay at home, who
enlarges his desire as Sheol, and he is like death, and can't be
satisfied, but gathers to himself all nations, and heaps to himself all
peoples.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Won't all these take up a parable against him, and a
taunting proverb against him, and say, 'Woe to him who increases that
which is not his, and who enriches himself by extortion! How long?'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Won't your debtors rise up suddenly, and wake up those who make
you tremble, and you will be their victim?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Because you have
plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder
you, because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to
the city and to all who dwell in it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Woe to him who gets an evil
gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be
delivered from the hand of evil!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        You have devised shame to your
house, by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against your soul.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the
woodwork will answer it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Woe to him who builds a town with
blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Behold, isn't it of
Yahweh of Hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations
weary themselves for vanity?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        For the earth will be filled with
the knowledge of the glory of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        "Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink, pouring your
inflaming wine until they are drunk, so that you may gaze at their
naked bodies!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        You are filled with shame, and not glory. You will
also drink, and be exposed! The cup of Yahweh's right hand will come
around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        For the
violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of the
animals, which made them afraid; because of men's blood, and for the
violence done to the land, to every city and to those who dwell in them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        "What value does the engraved image have, that its maker has
engraved it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who
fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Woe to him
who says to the wood, 'Awake!' or to the mute stone, 'Arise!' Shall
this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is
no breath at all in the midst of it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        But Yahweh is in his holy
temple. Let all the earth be silent before him!"

                        A prayer of Habakkuk, the prophet, set to victorious music.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Yahweh, I have heard of your fame.
   I stand in awe of your deeds, Yahweh.
Renew your work in the midst of the years.
   In the midst of the years make it known.
   In wrath, you remember mercy.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        God came from Teman,
   The Holy One from Mount Paran.
Selah.

His glory covered the heavens,
   And his praise filled the earth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        His splendor is like the sunrise.
   Rays shine from his hand, where his power is hidden.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Plague went before him,
   And pestilence followed his feet.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        He stood, and shook the earth.
   He looked, and made the nations tremble.
   The ancient mountains were crumbled.
   The age-old hills collapsed.
   His ways are eternal.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction.
   The dwellings of the land of Midian trembled.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Was Yahweh displeased with the rivers?
   Was your anger against the rivers,
   Or your wrath against the sea,
   That you rode on your horses,
   On your chariots of salvation?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        You uncovered your bow.
   You called for your sworn arrows.
Selah.
You split the earth with rivers.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        The mountains saw you, and were afraid.
   The tempest of waters passed by.
   The deep roared and lifted up its hands on high.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        The sun and moon stood still in the sky,
   At the light of your arrows as they went,
   At the shining of your glittering spear.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        You marched through the land in wrath.
   You threshed the nations in anger.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        You went forth for the salvation of your people,
   For the salvation of your anointed.
You crushed the head of the land of wickedness.
   You stripped them head to foot.
Selah.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        You pierced the heads of his warriors with their own spears.
   They came as a whirlwind to scatter me,
   Gloating as if to devour the wretched in secret.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        You trampled the sea with your horses,
   Churning mighty waters.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        I heard, and my body trembled.
   My lips quivered at the voice.
Rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble in my place,
   Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble,
   For the coming up of the people who invade us.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        For though the fig tree doesn't flourish,
   Nor fruit be in the vines;
   The labor of the olive fails,
   The fields yield no food;
   The flocks are cut off from the fold,
   And there is no herd in the stalls:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Yet I will rejoice in Yahweh.
   I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Yahweh, the Lord, is my strength.
   He makes my feet like deer's feet,
   And enables me to go in high places.
