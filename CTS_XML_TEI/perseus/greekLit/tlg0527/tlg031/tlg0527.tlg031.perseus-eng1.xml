                        The Song of songs, which is Solomon's.

Beloved

                        Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth;
   For your love is better than wine.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Your oils have a pleasing fragrance.
   Your name is oil poured forth,
   Therefore the virgins love you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Take me away with you.
   Let us hurry.
   The king has brought me into his chambers.

Friends
We will be glad and rejoice in you.
   We will praise your love more than wine!

Beloved
They are right to love you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        I am dark, but lovely,
   You daughters of Jerusalem,
   Like Kedar's tents,
   Like Solomon's curtains.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Don't stare at me because I am dark,
   Because the sun has scorched me.
My mother's sons were angry with me.
   They made me keeper of the vineyards.
   I haven't kept my own vineyard.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Tell me, you whom my soul loves,
   Where you graze your flock,
   Where you rest them at noon;
   For why should I be as one who is veiled
   Beside the flocks of your companions?

Lover
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        If you don't know, most beautiful among women,
   Follow the tracks of the sheep.
   Graze your young goats beside the shepherds' tents.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        I have compared you, my love,
   To a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings,
   Your neck with strings of jewels.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        We will make you earrings of gold,
   With studs of silver.

Beloved

                        While the king sat at his table,
   My perfume spread its fragrance.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh,
   That lies between my breasts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms
   From the vineyards of En Gedi.

Lover

                        Behold, you are beautiful, my love.
   Behold, you are beautiful.
   Your eyes are doves.

                        Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant;
   And our couch is verdant.

Lover

                        The beams of our house are cedars.
   Our rafters are firs.

Beloved

                        As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,
   So is my beloved among the sons.
I sat down under his shadow with great delight,
   His fruit was sweet to my taste.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        He brought me to the banquet hall.
   His banner over me is love.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Strengthen me with raisins,
   Refresh me with apples;
   For I am faint with love.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        His left hand is under my head.
   His right hand embraces me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,
   By the roes, or by the hinds of the field,
   That you not stir up, nor awaken love,
   Until it so desires.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        The voice of my beloved!
   Behold, he comes,
   Leaping on the mountains,
   Skipping on the hills.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        My beloved is like a roe or a young hart.
   Behold, he stands behind our wall!
He looks in at the windows.
   He glances through the lattice.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        My beloved spoke, and said to me,
   Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For, behold, the winter is past.
   The rain is over and gone.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        The flowers appear on the earth;
   The time of the singing has come,
   And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        The fig tree ripens her green figs.
   The vines are in blossom;
   They give forth their fragrance.
Arise, my love, my beautiful one,
   And come away.

Lover

                        My dove in the clefts of the rock,
   In the hiding places of the mountainside,
   Let me see your face.
   Let me hear your voice;
   For your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.

                        I had scarcely passed from them,
   When I found him whom my soul loves.
I held him, and would not let him go,
   Until I had brought him into my mother's house,
   Into the chamber of her who conceived me.

                        King Solomon made himself a carriage

                        I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride.
   I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;
   I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;
   I have drunk my wine with my milk.

Friends
Eat, friends!
   Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.

                        I was asleep, but my heart was awake.
   It is the voice of my beloved who knocks:
   Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled;
   For my head is filled with dew,
   My hair with the dampness of the night.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on?
   I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening.
   My heart pounded for him.

                        I rose up to open for my beloved.
   My hands dripped with myrrh,
   My fingers with liquid myrrh,
   On the handles of the lock.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        I opened to my beloved;
   But my beloved left; gone away.
My heart went out when he spoke.
   I looked for him, but I didn't find him.
   I called him, but he didn't answer.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        The watchmen who go about the city found me.
   They beat me.
   They bruised me.
   The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,
   If you find my beloved,
   That you tell him that I am faint with love.

                        His mouth is sweetness;

This is my beloved, and this is my friend,
   Daughters of Jerusalem.
