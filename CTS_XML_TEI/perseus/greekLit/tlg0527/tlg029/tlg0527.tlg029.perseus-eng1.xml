                        The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        To know wisdom and instruction;
   To discern the words of understanding;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        To receive instruction in wise dealing,
   In righteousness, justice, and equity;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        To give prudence to the simple,
   Knowledge and discretion to the young man:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;
   That the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        To understand a proverb, and parables,
   The words and riddles of the wise.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge;
   But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        My son, listen to your father's instruction,
   And don't forsake your mother's teaching:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        For they will be a garland to grace your head,
   And chains around your neck.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        My son, if sinners entice you, don't consent.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        If they say, "Come with us,
   Let's lay in wait for blood;
   Let's lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Let's swallow them up alive like Sheol,
   And whole, like those who go down into the pit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        We'll find all valuable wealth.
   We'll fill our houses with spoil.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        You shall cast your lot among us.
   We'll all have one purse."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        My son, don't walk in the way with them.
   Keep your foot from their path,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        For their feet run to evil.
   They hurry to shed blood.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        But these lay wait for their own blood.
   They lurk secretly for their own lives.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.
   It takes away the life of its owners.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Wisdom calls aloud in the street.
   She utters her voice in the public squares.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        She calls at the head of noisy places.
   At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        "How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?
   How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,
   And fools hate knowledge?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        Turn at my reproof.
   Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.
   I will make known my words to you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Because I have called, and you have refused;
   I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        But you have ignored all my counsel,
   And wanted none of my reproof;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        I also will laugh at your disaster.
   I will mock when calamity overtakes you;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        When calamity overtakes you like a storm,
   When your disaster comes on like a whirlwind;
   When distress and anguish come on you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        Then will they call on me, but I will not answer.
   They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        Because they hated knowledge,
   And didn't choose the fear of Yahweh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        They wanted none of my counsel.
   They despised all my reproof.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,
   And be filled with their own schemes.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.
   The careless ease of fools will destroy them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,
   And will be at ease, without fear of harm."

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Then you will understand the fear of Yahweh,

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        For Yahweh gives wisdom.
   Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.

                        Then you will understand righteousness and justice,
   Equity and every good path.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For wisdom will enter into your heart.
   Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Discretion will watch over you.

                        "Many women do noble things,
   But you excel them all."

                        Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain;
   But a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised.

                        Give her of the fruit of her hands!
   Let her works praise her in the gates!
