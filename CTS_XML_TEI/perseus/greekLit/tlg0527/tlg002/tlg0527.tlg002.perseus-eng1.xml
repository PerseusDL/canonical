                        Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into

                        (every man and his household came with Jacob):

                        All the souls who came out of
the Jacob's body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in
                        <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>
                        already.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        The children of
                        <placeName key="tgn,1000119">Israel</placeName>
                        were fruitful, and increased abundantly,
and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled
with them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn't know Joseph.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        He said to his people, "Behold, the people of the children of
                        <placeName key="tgn,1000119">Israel</placeName>
                        are more and mightier than we.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Come, let us deal wisely
with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when any war breaks
out, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us,
and escape out of the land."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Therefore they set taskmasters over
them to afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for
Pharaoh:
                        <placeName key="tgn,1099919">Pithom</placeName>
                        and Raamses.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        But the more they afflicted them,
the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. They were
grieved because of the children of
                        <placeName key="tgn,1000119">Israel</placeName>
                        .
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        The Egyptians
ruthlessly made the children of
                        <placeName key="tgn,1000119">Israel</placeName>
                        serve,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        and they made
their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in
all manner of service in the field, all their service, in which they
ruthlessly made them serve.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        The king of
                        <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>
                        spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the
name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        and he said, "When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew
women, and see them on the birth stool; if it is a son, then you shall
kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        But the
midwives feared God, and didn't do what the king of
                        <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>
                        commanded
them, but saved the baby boys alive.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        The king of
                        <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>
                        called
for the midwives, and said to them, "Why have you done this thing, and
have saved the men-children alive?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women
aren't like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous, and give birth
before the midwife comes to them."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied,
and grew very mighty.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        It happened, because the midwives feared
God, that he gave them families.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Pharaoh charged all his people,
saying, "You shall cast every son who is born into the river, and every
daughter you shall save alive."

                    <p>
                        A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as
his wife.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        The woman conceived, and bore a son. When she saw that
he was a fine child, she hid him three months.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        When she could no
longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with
tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds
by the river's bank.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        His sister stood far off, to see what would
be done to him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe at the
river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket
among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to get it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        She opened it,
and saw the child, and, behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on
him, and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Should I go and
call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the
child for you?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go."

   The maiden went and called the child's mother.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Pharaoh's
daughter said to her, "Take this child away, and nurse him for me, and
I will give you your wages."

   The woman took the child, and nursed it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        The child grew, and
she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named
him
                        <placeName key="tgn,2525806">Moses</placeName>
                        , and said, "Because I drew him out of the water."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        It happened in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he
went out to his brothers, and looked at their burdens. He saw an
Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        He looked this
way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he killed the
Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        He went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the
Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to him who did the
wrong, "Why do you strike your fellow?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        He said, "Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you
plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?"

   Moses was afraid, and said, "Surely this thing is known."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Now
when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled
from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of
                        <placeName key="tgn,2510805">Midian</placeName>
                        , and he sat
down by a well.

                        Now the priest of

                        had seven daughters. They came and
drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        The shepherds came and drove them away; but
                        <placeName key="tgn,2525806">Moses</placeName>
                        stood up and
helped them, and watered their flock.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        When they came to Reuel,
their father, he said, "How is it that you have returned so early
today?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        They said, "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        He said to his daughters, "Where is he? Why is it that you
have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        <placeName key="tgn,2525806">Moses</placeName>
                        was content to dwell with the man. He gave Moses
Zipporah, his daughter.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        She bore a son, and he named him
Gershom, for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        It happened in the course of those many days, that the king
of
                        <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>
                        died, and the children of

                        sighed because of the
bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the
bondage.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        God heard their groaning, and God remembered his
covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        God saw the
children of

                        , and God was concerned about them.

the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back of the

He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not
consumed.

                        and he burnt incense of sweet spices
on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        He put up the screen of the
door to the tent.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        He set the altar of burnt offering at the
door of the tent of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt
offering and the meal-offering, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        He
set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water
therein, with which to wash.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed
their hands and their feet there.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        When they went into the tent
of meeting, and when they came near to the altar, they washed, as
Yahweh commanded Moses.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        He raised up the court around the tent
and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses
finished the work.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of
Yahweh filled the tent.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        Moses wasn't able to enter into the
tent of meeting, because the cloud stayed on it, and Yahweh's glory
filled the tent.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        When the cloud was taken up from over the
tent, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their
journeys;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        but if the cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't
travel until the day that it was taken up.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        For the cloud of
Yahweh was on the tent by day, and there was fire in the cloud by
night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their
journeys.
