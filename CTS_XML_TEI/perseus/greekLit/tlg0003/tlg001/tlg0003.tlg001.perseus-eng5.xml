					<head>Note on the geography of Thucydides</head>
					<p>VARIOUS difficulties have been found in the geography of Thucydides: his
						accounts of places are at variance sometimes (1) with facts, sometimes (2)
						with the statements of later writers. It may be said of his descriptions
						generally, as of most early descriptions, that they are graphic rather than
						accurate. When we try to reproduce them in the mind something is wanting.
						For example, we do not gather from his narrative where the Euryelus was
						situated by which the Athenians, and also Gylippus, ascended the heights of
						Epipolae (<bibl n="Thuc. 6.97">6.97</bibl>; <bibl n="Thuc. 7.2">7.2</bibl>,
							<bibl n="Thuc. 7.43">43</bibl>), or how the Syracusan defences lay after
						the completion of the third counter-wall (<bibl n="Thuc. 7.7">7.7</bibl>),
						or, without some consideration, how the dolphins were placed for the
						protection of the Athenian ships in the great Syracusan harbour (<bibl
							n="Thuc. 7.38">7.38</bibl>). The topography of battles is often
						imperfect, and sometimes leads to a difficulty in the explanation of them.
						The narrative of the battle of Amphipolis leads to the inference (see
						Arnold's Appendix) that the city was not at the top but on the slope of the
						hill which Cleon ascended with his army, but this can only be inferred with
						some uncertainty and is not definitely expressed. Perhaps without maps and
						plans a better delineation was impossible. The narrative of the second
						sea-fight in the Crisaean gulf (ii. go f.) is incoherent: for we are not
						told what happened to that portion of the Peloponnesian fleet which was
						originally victorious. The manner of the attack which ended in the<pb
							n="xii"/> capture of the first Syracusan counter-wall (<bibl
							n="Thuc. 6.100">6.100</bibl>) is not fully described and can only be
						inferred; the 'Argive hoplites' who were killed in the Syracusan out-works
						after the capture of the stockade must have joined the attacking party from
						one of the two other divisions of the army. Once more, in the calculation of
						distances the eye or the information of the writer was frequently at fault.
						For examples see below.</p>
					<p>There has been a good deal of controversy on this subject. Even into
						geography the spirit of party may find a way. Some commentators have been
						desirous of maintaining the credit of their author, like Dr. Arnold, who was
						of opinion that 'when Geographers who are also Scholars visit the places of
						which Thucydides speaks personally, most of the difficulties in his
						descriptions will vanish.' That remark of course supposes that Thucydides,
						rightly understood, is generally or always in the right. We may imagine the
						writer of it to feel what he does not say: 'The most accurate and
						trustworthy of historians can hardly be imagined to be ignorant as a
						schoolboy of geography.' And certainly, in his account of Pylos and
						Sphacteria, Dr. Arnold is ready, in a figure, to work a miracle in order to
						save the reputation of Thucydides. Changes in the formation of the coast are
						the 'Deus ex machina' to which he has recourse.</p>
					<p>Yet it may very likely be true that Thucydides is far behind Strabo or
						Pausanias or Stephanus Byzantinus in geography, though his conception of
						history may be quite unattainable by them. Still greater would be the
						disparity of his knowledge when compared with that of a modern traveller, or
						resident in Greece, who has perhaps surveyed and explored places which the
						historian himself may not have visited. For the knowledge of geography is
						always growing with time, while history fades into the distance. The
						materials of the one are increasing, while those of the other are
						diminishing. The credibility of an author's geography is not therefore to be
						judged of<pb n="xiii"/> by the credibility of his history, because in the
						one far more than in the other he is dependent on the conditions of his
						age.</p>
					<p>In this short note it is not intended to enter into the discussion of
						particular passages, but rather to urge two general principles: (i) that
						geographical accuracy is not to be expected from a writer of the age of
						Thucydides: (2) that the number of his inaccuracies show them to be
						attributable rather to his ignorance, than to the ignorance of later
						writers, or of ourselves.</p>
					<p>To attempt to reconcile the geography of Thucydides with facts may be the
						same error in kind, though not in degree, as to try and adapt the drive of
						Telemachus between Pylos and Sparta to the present condition of the country,
						or to seek on the sea-shore of Ithaca for the cave by which Odysseus was
						deposited. As the more familiar features of a scene are likely to be
						reproduced in the creations of the poet, so the ancient historian will
						roughly guess distances. But he may often make mistakes about a region with
						which he was unacquainted, and he will not always be able to judge what
						amount of description is required in order to place before his readers a
						just conception of a place or of a battle. There were no surveys of
						countries or measurements of distances in the age of Herodotus and
						Thucydides (except along the course of great roads such as the Persian
						highways), but only the proverbially uncertain measure of a day's journey or
						of a day's sail (see Thuc. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.97">2.97</bibl>, and Arnold's
						note). There were no correct maps, but only rude delineations such as made
						Herodotus laugh (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.36">4.36</bibl>). The eye was the judge of
						the distance across a strait or across the entrance of a harbour. Daily
						experience tells us how seldom the power of judging distances is found in
						any one who has not been trained by long habit.</p>
					<p>Some of the errors or misleading expressions in Thucydides which have
						suggested the above remarks are the following:â€” <pb n="xiv"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<bibl n="Thuc. 2.86">2.86 med.</bibl> The distance of Rhium in Achaia from
						Rhium on the opposite coast is said by Thucydides to be less than a mile (7
						stadia). According to Col. Leake (Morea, <bibl n="Thuc. 2.148">2.148</bibl>)
						'the distance is little, if at all, short of a mile and a half,' and would
						have been considerably greater in ancient times if we assume, as in this
						particular instance there is reason for thinking, that the sea, owing to the
						deposits of rivers, has retreated about 250 yards on the south, and somewhat
						less on the north coast.</p>
					<p>
						<bibl n="Thuc. 4.8">4.8 med.</bibl> The southern entrance of the harbour
						formed by the bay of Navarino is more than three-quarters of a mile in
						width, and the northern is 132 yards. But according to Thucydides the
						northern entrance admitted the passage of only two ships, the southern of
						not more than eight or nine, and the Lacedaemonians had intended to block up
						both passages by ships placed lengthways<note anchored="true">[It has been
							suggested that Thucydides fell into the error by combining the accounts
							of two informants, one of whom meant by 'the harbour' the lagoon of
							Osmyn Aga, behind Pylos, and the other the bay of Navarino: and mistook
							an intended blocking of the N. entrance to the bay of Navarino at both
							ends (by which a passage from the bay into the lagoon, which may have
							existed at the time, would also have been closed to the Athenians) for a
							blocking of the N. and S. entrances. See Mr. G. B. Grundy's admirable
							monograph on Pylos and Sphacteria. If this be so, the criticism, in the
							Essay, on Thucydides as a geographer would only be confirmed. It is
							clear from <bibl n="Thuc. 4.8">4.8</bibl> (<foreign xml:lang="greek"

							Lacedaemonians to have intended to block both entrances of the bay of
							Navarino. â€” And it is after all hard to believe that as a fact they did
							not intend to keep out the Athenian ships by occupying (if not blocking)
							the S. entrance.]</note>.</p>
					<p>Thucydides also underrates considerably the length of the island, which he
						describes (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.8">4.8</bibl>) as 15 stadia (about 3000 yards),
						whereas it is really 2 3/4 miles (4800 yards). [Mr. Grundy (see note) points
						out that the distance from the place where the Athenians must have landed on
						the bay side of the island to its N. point is about 15 stadia.]<pb n="xv"/>
					</p>
					<p>
						<bibl n="Thuc. 4.57">4.57 init.</bibl> According to Thucydides, Thyrea was
						situated about 10 stadia from the sea, or about 1 1/8 of a mile. According
						to Col. Leake (Morea, <bibl n="Thuc. 2.492">2.492</bibl>) 'it is at least
						three times that distance.' Other writers suggest other sites. But there are
						no remains which agree with the distance mentioned in Thucydides (Bursian,
						Geographie von Griechenland, ii. p. 70).</p>
					<p>
						<bibl n="Thuc. 6.104">6.104 med.</bibl> Gylippus sailing from Tarentum to
						Sicily was caught by a storm in the Terinaean gulf. But the Terinaean gulf,
						called also the Sinus Hipponiates, is on the west coast of Italy (Pliny,
						iii. 72. 5, 10). <foreign xml:lang="greek">Kata\ to\n Terinai=on
							ko/lpon</foreign> cannot mean 'opposite the Terinaean gulf.'</p>
					<p>
						<bibl n="Thuc. 8.88">8.88 init.</bibl> Alcibiades is described as sailing
						straight from Samos to Phaselis and Caunus on his way to Aspendus, and as
						returning to Samos from Caunus and Phaselis (108 init.). The inverse order
						in both cases is the true one. Dr. Arnold supposes the words to mean
						'straight to Phaselis, having first touched at Caunus'; 'from Caunus, and
						before that from-Phaselis.' But this explanation is forced in itself, and is
						rendered impossible by the repetition of the wrong order in the description
						of the return voyage.</p>
					<p>
						<bibl n="Thuc. 8.101">8.101 fin.</bibl> Similarly, Larissa and Hamaxitus are
						mentioned in a wrong order (see Strabo, xiii. I. 47, 48, pp. 604, 605).</p>
					<p>
						<bibl n="Thuc. 6.72">6.72 init.</bibl> So Naxos and Catana.</p>
					<p>
						<bibl n="Thuc. 3.29">3.29 med.</bibl> So Icarus and Myconus.</p>
					<p>
						<bibl n="Thuc. 7.19">7.19 init.</bibl> Decelea is said to be distant about
						120 stadia (i. e. about fourteen miles) from Athens, and about the same or a
						little more from Boeotia. In reality it was much nearer Boeotia. It has been
						suggested that Thucydides is here thinking of the far-off corner of Boeotia
						at Oropus, from which an important road ran through Decelea (<bibl
							n="Thuc. 7.28">7.28 init.</bibl>) to Athens. Still this would only show
						how different his mode of expression is from that of a modern writer.</p>
					<p>
						<bibl n="Thuc. 8.26">8.26 med.</bibl>
						<foreign xml:lang="greek">Le/ron th\n pro\ Milh/tou nh=son.</foreign> But
							Leros<pb n="xvi"/> is forty miles from Miletus. All the MSS. except the
						Vatican read <foreign xml:lang="greek">)/Eleon,</foreign> a place which is
						otherwise unknown. <foreign xml:lang="greek">Le/ron</foreign> is probably
						correct, and is confirmed by the close connexion which we find existing
						between Leros and Miletus in the tribute lists (C. I. A. 37, 226, 251, 262,
						264). The expression is natural enough for a writer who had in his mind not
						maps of the Aegean, but the actual voyage past Leros to Miletus.<bibl
							n="Thuc. 3.4">3.4 fin.</bibl>
						<foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/rmoun e)n th|= Male/a|, pro\s bore/an th=s
							po/lews</foreign> (compare c. 6, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>periopmisa/menoi to\ pro\s no/ton</foreign>). But, according to Strabo,
						Malea was at the southern extremity of the island. It is possible however to
						take <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\s bore/an th=s po/lews</foreign> not with
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/rmoun</foreign> but with <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">a)poste/llousi pre/sbeis trih/rei,</foreign> referring
						to the Mytilenaeans, above.</p>
					<p>
						<bibl n="Thuc. 1.61">1.61 med.</bibl>
						<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)fiko/menoi e)s Be/roian ka)kei=qen
							e)pistre/yantes.</foreign> But Beroea was several days' march out of the
						road from Pydna to Potidaea; nor could the Athenians possibly have reached
						Gigonus by slow marches three days after their departure from Beroea
							(<foreign xml:lang="greek">kat) o'li/gon de\ proi+o/ntes tritai=oi
							a)fi/konto e)s Gi/gwnon</foreign>). The generally received correction
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ Stre/yan</foreign> for <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">e)istre/yantes</foreign> cannot be considered certain,
						and does not remove the difficulty about Beroea.</p>
					<p>We may also notice that where Thucydides evidently wants to express
						geographical ideas with precision, as in<bibl n="Thuc. 2.9">2.9 fin.</bibl>,
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">nh=soi o(/sai e)nto\s Peloponnh/sou kai\
							Krh/ths pro\s h(/lion a)ni/sxonta, pa=sai ai( a)/llai Kukla/des plh\n
							Mh/lou kai\ Fh/ras</foreign> or in the description of the island of
						Cythera, <bibl n="Thuc. 4.53">4.53 fin.</bibl>, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>pa=sa</foreign> (i. e. either <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(
							nh=sos</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( Lakwnikh\</foreign>)
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">ga\p a)ne/xi pro\s to\ Sikeliko\n kai\
							Krhtiko\n pe/lagos,</foreign> he has caused a great deal of trouble to
						his interpreters<note anchored="true">[In <bibl n="Thuc. 2.9">2.9</bibl> the
							variations in the text give good ground for suspecting a gloss.]</note>.
						There is a lesser degree of obscurity in the description of the country
						about Chimerium (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.46">1.46 fin.</bibl>), especially the
						words <foreign xml:lang="greek">r(ei= de\ kai\ Qu/amis potamo/s, o(ri/zwn
							th\n Qesprwti/da kai\ Kestri/nhn, w(=n e)nto\s, h( a)/kpa a)ne/xei to\
							Xeime/roin,</foreign> where <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(=n</foreign>
						refers not to <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n Qesprwti/da kai\
							Kestri/nhn,</foreign> but to<pb n="xvii"/>
						<foreign xml:lang="greek">potamw=n,</foreign> gathered from the previous
						sentence (scil. the Acheron and the Thyamis).</p>
					<p>It is worth while also to compare the description of the kingdom of the
						Odrysae in <bibl n="Thuc. 2.97">2.97</bibl>, which, though not obscure, is
						cumbrous and very unlike the manner of a modern geographer.</p>
					<p>Considering the number of these errors and vague expressions, and the
						probability that Thucydides from his imperfect means of knowledge would have
						fallen into them, is it worth while, for the sake of vindicating his credit,
						either to alter the text, or to assume changes in the face of nature unless
						there is actual proof of them in each particular case? All that we can
						reasonably expect of him is that he should be a little in advance of his
						predecessors, not that he should vie with modern accuracy, or equally with a
						modern historian be alive to the value of topography, or realize the fulness
						and minuteness of detail which are required in a describer of places or of
						military movements.</p>

						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
							<p>An enemy often has weak points which wear the appearance of strength;
								and these, when their nature is explained, encourage rather than
								frighten their opponents. As, on the other hand, where an army has a
								real advantage, the adversary who is the most ignorant is also the
								most foolhardy. </p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
							<p>The Illyrians, to those who have no experience of them, do indeed at
								first sight present a threatening aspect. The spectacle of their
								numbers is terrible, their cries are intolerable, and the
								brandishing of their spears in the air has a menacing effect. But in
								action they are not the men they look, if their opponents will only
								stand their ground; for they have no regular order, and therefore
								are not ashamed of leaving any post in which they are hard pressed;
								to fly and to advance being alike <pb n="95"/> honourable, no
								imputation can be thrown on their courage. When every man is his own
								master in battle he will readily find a decent excuse for saving
								himself. They clearly think that to frighten us at a safe distance
								is a better plan than to meet us hand to hand; else why do they
								shout instead of fighting? </p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
							<p>You may easily see that all the terrors with which you have invested
								them are in reality nothing; they do but startle the sense of sight
								and hearing. If you repel their tumultuous onset, and, when
								opportunity offers, withdraw again in good order, keeping your
								ranks, you will sooner arrive at a place of safety, and will also
								learn the lesson that mobs like these, if an adversary withstand
								their first attack, do but threaten at a distance and make a
								flourish of valour, although if he yields to them they are quick
								enough to show their courage in following at his heels when there is
								no danger.' </p>

							<p>Let me tell you what it is. If all the Sicilian Greeks, or at least

								(which receives us), we, the advanced guard of Sicily, are among
								friends, and go forth from a friendly country, and that the sea is a
								large place not easy to traverse with so great an armament as
								theirs. They would know that after a long voyage their ships will be
								unable to keep in line, and coming up slowly and few at a time will
								be at our mercy. On the other hand, if they lighten their vessels
								and meet us in a compact body with the swifter part of their fleet,
								they may have to use oars, and then we shall attack them when they
								are exhausted. </p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
							<p>Or if we prefer not to fight, we can retire again to Tarentum. Having

								they will not know what to do on these desolate coasts. If they
								remain they will find themselves blockaded; if they attempt to sail

								whether the cities of Italy and Sicily will receive them. </p>

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
							<p>In my opinion the anticipation of these difficulties will hamper them

								in dismay at the unexpected opposition, they may very likely break
								up the expedition; especially if, as I am informed, the most

							<p>They determined to sail to Himera, especially as the straits were

							<p>So they sailed through the strait and, touching by the way at Rhegium

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
							<p>They then sent to the Selinuntians and told them to come and meet

								these parts who was a powerful man and <pb n="263"/> friendly to the

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
							<p>And so, taking with him about seven hundred of his own sailors and

							<p>During the same summer, and just at the time when the Peloponnesians
								were most offended with Tissaphernes on various grounds, and above
								all on account of the restoration of Alcibiades, which finally
								proved him to be a partisan of the Athenians, he, as if he were
								wanting to clear himself of these suspicions, prepared to go to <pb

								desired Lichas to go with him. He also said<note type="margin"

								provide for them during his absence. </p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
							<p>Why he went to Aspendus, and having gone there never brought the

						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
							<p>For the Phoenician fleet of a hundred and forty-seven ships came as
								far as Aspendusâ€” there is no doubt about this; but why they never
								came further is matter of conjecture. Some think that, in going to
								Aspendus, Tissaphernes was still pursuing his policy of wearing out
								the Peloponnesians; at any rate Tamos, who was in charge, supplied
								them no better, but rather worse. Others are of opinion that he
								brought up the Phoenician fleet to Aspendus in order to make money
								by selling the crews their discharge; for he certainly had no idea
								of using them in actual service. Others think that he was influenced
								by the outcry against him which had reached Lacedaemon; and that he
								wanted to create an impression of his honesty: 'Now at any rate he
								has gone to fetch the ships, and they are really manned.' </p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
							<p>I believe beyond all question that he wanted to wear out and to
								neutralise the Hellenic forces; his object was to damage them both
								while he was losing time in going to Aspendus, and to paralyse their
								action, and not strengthen either of them by his alliance. For if he
								had chosen to finish the war, finished it might have been once for
								all, as any one may see: he would have brought up the ships, and
								would in all probability have given the victory to the
								Lacedaemonians, who lay opposite to the Athenians and were fully a
								match for them already. </p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
							<p>The excuse which he gave for not bringing them is the most conclusive
								evidence against him; he said that there was not as many collected
								as the King had commanded. But if so, the King would <pb n="401"/>
								have been all the better pleased, for his money would have been
								saved and Tissaphernes would have accomplished the same result at
								less expense. </p>
						</div>
						<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
							<p>Whatever may have been his intention, Tissaphernes came to Aspendus
