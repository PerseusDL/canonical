<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Ismene, my sister, true child of my own mother, do you know any evil out of all the evils bequeathed by Oedipus that Zeus will not fulfil for the two of us in our lifetime?  There is nothing&mdash;no pain, no ruin,<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>no shame, nor dishonor&mdash;that I have not seen in your sufferings and mine.  And now what is this new edict that they say the general has just decreed to all the city?  Do you know anything?  Have you heard?  Or does it escape you that<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>evils from our enemies are on the march against our friends?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>To me no word of our friends, Antigone, either bringing joy or bringing pain has come since we two were robbed of our two brothers who died in one day by a double blow.<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>And since the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army has fled during this night, I have learned nothing further, whether better fortune is mine, or further ruin.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>I knew it well, so I was trying to bring you outside the courtyard gates to this end, that you alone might hear.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>Hear what?  It is clear that you are brooding on some dark news.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Why not?  Has not Creon destined our brothers, the one to honored burial, the other to unburied shame?  Eteocles, they say, with due observance of right and custom, he has laid in the earth<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>for his honor among the dead below.  As for the poor corpse of Polyneices, however, they say that an edict has been published to the townsmen that no one shall bury him or mourn him, but instead leave him unwept, unentombed, for the birds a pleasing store<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>as they look to satisfy their hunger.  Such, it is said, is the edict that the good Creon has laid down for you and for me&mdash;yes, for me&mdash;and it is said that he is coming here to proclaim it for the certain knowledge of those who do not already know.  They say that he does not conduct this business lightly,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>but whoever performs any of these rites, for him the fate appointed is death by public stoning among the entire city.  This is how things stand for you, and so you will soon show your nature, whether you are noble-minded, or the corrupt daughter of a noble line.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="39">
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>Poor sister, if things have come to this, what would I<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>profit by loosening or tightening this knot?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Consider whether you will share the toil and the task.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>What are you hazarding?  What do you intend?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Will you join your hand to mine in order to lift his corpse?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>You plan to bury him&mdash;when it is forbidden to the city?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>Yes, he is my brother, and yours too, even if you wish it otherwise.  I will never be convicted of betraying him.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>Hard girl!  Even when Creon has forbidden it?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>No, he has no right to keep me from my own.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>Ah, no!  Think, sister, how our father<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>perished in hatred and infamy, when, because of the crimes that he himself detected, he smashed both his eyes with self-blinding hand;  then his mother-wife, two names in one, with a twisted noose destroyed her life;<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>lastly, our two brothers in a single day, both unhappy murderers of their own flesh and blood, worked with mutual hands their common doom.  And now we, in turn&mdash;we two who have been left all alone&mdash;consider how much more miserably we will be destroyed, if in defiance of the law<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>we transgress against an autocrat's decree or his powers.  No, we must remember, first, that ours is a woman's nature, and accordingly not suited to battles against men;  and next, that we are ruled by the more powerful, so that we must obey in these things and in things even more stinging.<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>I, therefore, will ask those below for pardon, since I am forced to this, and will obey those who have come to authority.  It is foolish to do what is fruitless.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="69">
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>I would not encourage you&mdash;no, nor, even if you were willing later,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>would I welcome you as my partner in this action.  No, be the sort that pleases you.  I will bury him&mdash;it would honor me to die while doing that.  I shall rest with him, loved one with loved one, a pious criminal.  For the time is greater<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>that I must serve the dead than the living, since in that world I will rest forever.  But if you so choose, continue to dishonor what the gods in honor have established.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>I do them no dishonor.  But to act in violation of the citizens' will&mdash;of that I am by nature incapable.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>You can make that your pretext!  Regardless, I will go now to heap a tomb over the brother I love.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>Oh no, unhappy sister!  I fear for you!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Do not tremble for me.  Straighten out your own destiny.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>Then at least disclose the deed to no one before you do it.<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>Conceal it, instead, in secrecy&mdash;and so, too, will I.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Go on!  Denounce it!  You will be far more hated for your silence, if you fail to proclaim these things to everyone.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>You have a hot heart for chilling deeds.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>I know that I please those whom I am most bound to please.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>Yes, if you will also have the power.  But you crave the impossible.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Why then, when my strength fails, I will have finished.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>An impossible hunt should not be tried in the first place.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>If you mean that, you will have my hatred, and you will be subject to punishment as the enemy of the dead.<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>But leave me and the foolish plan I have authored to suffer this terrible thing, for I will not suffer anything so terrible that my death will lack honor.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>Go, then, if you so decide.  And of this be sure:  though your path is foolish, to your loved ones your love is straight and true.<stage>Exit Antigone on the spectators' left.  Ismene exits into the palace.</stage></p></sp></div1>

<p><milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>Shaft of the sun, fairest light of all that have dawned on <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> of the seven gates, you have shone forth at last, eye of golden day, advancing over Dirce's streams!<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>You have goaded with a sharper bit the warrior of the white shield, who came from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> in full armor, driving him to headlong retreat.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="110">
<milestone unit="anapests"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker><p><milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>He set out against our land because of the strife-filled claims of Polyneices, and like a screaming eagle he flew over into our land, covered by his snow-white wing,<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>with a mass of weapons and crested helmets.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="117">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="1"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p><milestone ed="p" n="117" unit="line"/>He paused above our dwellings;  he gaped around our sevenfold portals with spears thirsting for blood;  but he left<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>before his jaws were ever glutted with our gore, or before the Fire-god's pine-fed flame had seized our crown of towers.<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>So fierce was the crash of battle swelling about his back, a match too hard to win for the rival of the dragon.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="127">
<milestone unit="anapests"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker><p><milestone ed="p" n="127" unit="line"/>For Zeus detests above all the boasts of a proud tongue.  And when he saw them advancing in a swollen flood,<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>arrogant their clanging gold, he dashed with brandished fire one who was already starting to shout victory when he had reached our ramparts.</p></sp></div1>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p><milestone ed="p" n="134" unit="line"/>Staggered, he fell to the earth with a crash,<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>torch in hand, a man possessed by the frenzy of the mad attack, who just now was raging against us with the blasts of his tempestuous hate.  But his threats did not fare as he had hoped, and to the other enemies mighty Ares dispensed each their own dooms with hard blows,<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>Ares, our mighty ally at the turning-point.</p></sp></div1>

<speaker>Chorus</speaker><p><milestone ed="p" n="141" unit="line"/>For the seven captains, stationed against an equal number at the seven gates, left behind their brazen arms in tribute to Zeus the turner of battle&mdash;all but the accursed pair who, born of one father and one<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>mother, set against each other their spears, both victorious, and who now share in a common death.</p></sp></div1>

And may Bacchus, who shakes the earth of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, rule our dancing!</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="155">
<milestone unit="anapests"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker><p><milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>But look, the king of the land is coming here, Creon, the son of Menoeceus, our new ruler in accordance with the new circumstances fated by the gods.  What policy is he setting in motion,<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>that he has proposed this special conference of elders, and summoned it by a general mandate?</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="162">

<milestone unit="episode"/>
<stage>Enter Creon, with two attendants.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Creon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="162" unit="line"/>My fellow citizens!  First, the gods, after tossing the fate of our city on wild waves, have once more righted it.  Second, I have ordered you through my messengers to come here<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>apart from all the rest, because I knew, first of all, how constant was your reverence for the power of the throne of Laius;  how, again, you were reverent, when Oedipus was guiding our city;  and lastly, how, when he was dead, you still maintained loyal thoughts towards his children.<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>Since, then, these latter have fallen in one day by a twofold doom&mdash;each striking, each struck, both with the stain of a brother's murder&mdash;I now possess all the power and the throne according to my kinship with the dead.<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>Now, it is impossible to know fully any man's character, will, or judgment, until he has been proved by the test of rule and law-giving.  For if anyone who directs the entire city does not cling to the best and wisest plans,<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>but because of some fear keeps his lips locked, then, in my judgment, he is and has long been the most cowardly traitor.  And if any man thinks a friend more important than his fatherland, that man, I say, is of no account.  Zeus, god who sees all things always, be my witness&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>I would not be silent if I saw ruin, instead of safety, marching upon the citizens.  Nor would I ever make a man who is hostile to my country a friend to myself, because I know this, that our country is the ship that bears us safe, and that only when<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>we sail her on a straight course can we make true friends.  Such are the rules by which I strengthen this city.  Akin to these is the edict which I have now published to the citizenry concerning the sons of Oedipus:  Eteocles, who fell fighting<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>in behalf of our city and who excelled all in battle, they shall entomb and heap up every sacred offering that descends to the noblest of the dead below.  But as for his brother, Polyneices, I mean, who on his return from exile wanted to burn to the ground<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>the city of his fathers and his race's gods, and wanted to feed on kindred blood and lead the remnant into slavery&mdash;it has been proclaimed to the city that no one shall give him funeral honors or lamentation,<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>but all must leave him unburied and a sight of shame, with his body there for birds and dogs to eat.  This is my will, and never will I allow the traitor to stand in honor before the just.  But whoever has good will to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>he shall be honored by me in death as in life.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="211">
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>That is your will, Creon, towards this city's enemy and its friend.  And the power is yours, I believe, to make use of every law whatsoever, both concerning the dead and all us who live.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Creon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>See, then, that you be guardians of my commands.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Lay the weight of this task on some younger man.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Creon</speaker>
<p>That is not what I meant&mdash;the guards for the corpse are already in place.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Then what is this other command that you would give?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Creon</speaker>
<p>That you not give way to the breakers of my commands.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>There is no one so foolish as to crave death.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Creon</speaker>
<p>I assure you, that is the wage for disobedience.  Yet by just the hope of it, money has many times corrupted men.</p></sp>
<stage>Enter Guard.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Guard</speaker>
<p>My king, I will not say that I arrive breathless because of speed, or from the action of a swift foot.<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>For often I brought myself to a stop because of my thoughts, and wheeled round in my path to return.  My mind was telling me many things:  &ldquo;Fool, why do you go to where your arrival will mean your punishment?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Idiot, are you dallying again?  If Creon learns it from another, must you not suffer for it?&rdquo;<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>So debating, I made my way unhurriedly, slow, and thus a short road was made long.  At last, however, the view prevailed that I should come here&mdash;to you.  Even if my report brings no good, still will I tell you,<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>since I come with a good grip on one hope, that I can suffer nothing except what is my fate.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="237">
<sp>
<speaker>Creon</speaker>
<p>And what is it that so disheartens you?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guard</speaker>
<p>I want to tell you first about myself&mdash;I did not do the deed, nor did I see the doer,<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>so it would be wrong that I should come to any harm.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Creon</speaker>
<p>Like a bowman you aim well at your target from a distance, and all around you hedge yourself off well from the deed.  It is clear that you have some unheard-of thing to tell.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guard</speaker>
<p>That I do, for terrible news imposes great hesitation.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Creon</speaker>
<p>Then tell it, will you, and so unburdened go away?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guard</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>Well, here it is.  The corpse&mdash;some one has just given it burial and disappeared after sprinkling thirsty dust on the flesh and performing the other rites that piety demands.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Creon</speaker>
<p>What are you saying?  What man dared do this?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Guard</speaker>
<p>I do not know.  For there was no scar of a pickax to be seen there,<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>no earth thrown up by a mattock.  The ground was hard and dry, unbroken, not rolled over by wheels.  The doer was someone who left no trace.  When the first day-watchman showed it to us, a discomforting amazement fell on us all.<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>The dead man was veiled from us&mdash;not shut within a tomb, but a light cover of dust was on him, as if put there by the hand of one who shunned a curse.  And no sign was visible that any beast of prey or any dog had approached or torn him.  Then evil words flew thick and loud among us,<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>guard accusing guard.  It would even have come to blows in the end, nor was there anyone there to prevent it:  every man was the culprit, and no one was plainly guilty, while all disclaimed knowledge of the act.  We were ready to take red-hot iron in our hands,<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>to walk through fire and to swear oaths by the gods that we had neither done the deed, nor shared knowledge of the planning or the doing.  At last, when our investigating got us nowhere, someone spoke up and made us all bend our faces<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>in fear towards the earth.  For we did not know how we could argue with him, nor yet prosper, if we did what he said.  His argument was that the deed must be reported to you and not hidden.  This view prevailed, and so it was that<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>the lot doomed miserable me to win this prize.  So here I stand, as unwelcome to you as I am unwilling, I well know.  For no man delights in the bearer of bad news.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="278">
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>My king, my thoughts have long been deliberating whether this deed is somehow the work of gods?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Creon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>Quiet, before your words truly fill me with rage, so that you not be found at the same time foolish as well as old.  You say what is intolerable when you claim that the gods have concern for that corpse.  Was it in high esteem for his benefactions<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>that they sought to hide him, when he had come to burn their columned shrines, their sacred treasures and their land, and scatter its laws to the winds?  Or do you see the gods honoring the wicked?  It cannot be.  No!  From the very first<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>certain men of the city were chafing at this edict and muttering against me, tossing their heads in secret, and they did not keep their necks duly under the yoke in submission to me.  By those men, I am certain, they were led astray and bribed to do this deed.<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>Nothing so evil as money ever grew to be current among men.  This destroys cities, this drives men from their homes, this trains and warps honest minds to set themselves to works of shame,<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>this teaches people to practise villainies, and to know every act of unholiness.  But all the men who did this job for hire have made sure that, sooner or later, they shall suffer the punishment.  Now, as Zeus still has my reverence, know this well&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>I tell you on my oath.  If you do not find the very hand that made this burial, and reveal him before my eyes, mere death shall not suffice for you, not before, hung up alive, you have made this outrage plain,<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>so that hereafter you may thieve with better knowledge of where your money should be received from, and learn that it is best not to be fond of money-making from any and every source.

<div1 type="card" n="407">

<p>It happened like this.  When we had come to the place with those fierce threats of yours still in our ears, we swept away all the dust that covered<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/>the corpse and bared the damp body well.  We then sat down on the brow of the hill to windward, fleeing the smell from him, lest it strike us.  Each man was wide awake and kept his neighbor alert with torrents of threats, if any one should be careless of this task.<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>So time passed, until the disk of the sun stood bright in mid-sky and the heat began to burn.  And then suddenly a whirlwind lifted from the earth a storm of dust, a trouble in the sky, and it filled the plain, marring all the foliage of its woods.<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/>Soon the wide air was choked with it.  We closed our eyes, and endured the plague from the gods.  When, after a long while, this storm had passed, the girl was seen, and she wailed aloud with the sharp cry of a grieving bird, as when inside her empty<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>nest she sees the bed stripped of its nestlings.  So she, too, when she saw the corpse bare, broke into a cry of lamentation and cursed with harsh curses those who had done it.  Immediately she took thirsty dust in her hands,<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/>and from a pitcher of beaten bronze held high she crowned the dead with thrice-poured libations.  We rushed forward when we saw it, and at once closed upon our quarry, who was not at all dismayed.  We then charged her with her past and present doings,<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/>but she made no denial of anything&mdash;at once to my joy and to my pain.  For to have escaped from trouble one's self gives the greatest joy, but it stings to lead friends to evil.  Naturally, though, all such things are<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>of less account to me than my own safety.</p></sp></div1>

<p><milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>Yes, since it was not Zeus that published me that edict, and since not of that kind are the laws which Justice who dwells with the gods below established among men.  Nor did I think that your decrees were of such force, that a mortal could override the unwritten<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>and unfailing statutes given us by the gods.  For their life is not of today or yesterday, but for all time, and no man knows when they were first put forth.  Not for fear of any man's pride was I about to owe a penalty to the gods for breaking these.<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>Die I must, that I knew well &lpar;how could I not?&rpar;.  That is true even without your edicts.  But if I am to die before my time, I count that a gain.  When anyone lives as I do, surrounded by evils, how can he not carry off gain by dying?<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line"/>So for me to meet this doom is a grief of no account.

No, whomever the city may appoint, that man must be obeyed in matters small and great and in matters just and unjust.  And I would feel confident that such a man would be a fine ruler no less than a good and willing subject,<milestone ed="p" n="670" unit="line"/>and that beneath a hail of spears he would stand his ground where posted, a loyal and brave comrade in the battle line.  But there is no evil worse than disobedience.  This destroys cities;  this overturns homes;  this breaks<milestone ed="p" n="675" unit="line"/>the ranks of allied spears into headlong rout.  But the lives of men who prosper upright, of these obedience has saved the greatest part.  Therefore we must defend those who respect order, and in no way can we let a woman defeat us.  It is better to fall from power, if it is fated, by a man's hand,<milestone ed="p" n="680" unit="line"/>than that we be called weaker than women.</p></sp></div1>

<p>Father, the gods implant reason in men, the highest of all things that we call our own.<milestone ed="p" n="685" unit="line"/>For my part, to state how you are wrong to say those things is beyond my power and my desire, although another man, too, might have a useful thought.  In any case, it is my natural duty to watch on your behalf all that men say, or do, or find to blame.<milestone ed="p" n="690" unit="line"/>For dread of your glance forbids the ordinary citizen to speak such words as would offend your ear.  But I can hear these murmurs in the dark, how the city moans for this girl, saying:  &ldquo;No woman ever merited death less&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="695" unit="line"/>none ever died so shamefully for deeds so glorious as hers, who, when her own brother had fallen in bloody battle, would not leave him unburied to be devoured by savage dogs, or by any bird.

For if any man thinks that he alone is wise&mdash;that in speech or in mind he has no peer&mdash;such a soul, when laid open, is always found empty.<milestone ed="p" n="710" unit="line"/>No, even when a man is wise, it brings him no shame to learn many things, and not to be too rigid.  You see how the trees that stand beside the torrential streams created by a winter storm yield to it and save their branches, while the stiff and rigid perish root and all?<milestone ed="p" n="715" unit="line"/>And in the same way the pilot who keeps the sheet of his sail taut and never slackens it, upsets his boat, and voyages thereafter with his decking underwater.  Father, give way and allow a change from your rage.  For if even from me, a younger man, a worthy thought may be supplied,<milestone ed="p" n="720" unit="line"/>by far the best thing, I believe, would be for men to be all-wise by nature.  Otherwise&mdash;since most often it does not turn out that way&mdash;it is good to learn in addition from those who advise you well.</p></sp></div1>

For what good would it do that should I soothe you with words in which I must later be found false?<milestone ed="p" n="1195" unit="line"/>The truth is always best.  I attended your husband as his guide to the furthest part of the plain, where unpitied the body of Polyneices, torn by dogs, still lay.  After we had prayed to the goddess of the roads<milestone ed="p" n="1200" unit="line"/>and to Pluto to restrain their anger in mercy, we washed him with pure washing, and with freshly-plucked boughs we burned what remains there were.  Lastly we heaped a high-mounded tomb of his native earth.  Afterwards we turned away to enter the maiden's stoney-bedded<milestone ed="p" n="1205" unit="line"/>bridal chamber, the caverned mansion of Hades' bride.  From a distance, one of us servants heard a voice of loud wailing near that bride's unwept bed and came to tell our master Creon.  And as the King moved closer and closer, obscure signs rising from a bitter cry surrounded him&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="1210" unit="line"/>he groaned and said in bitter lament, &ldquo;Ah, misery, am I now the prophet of evil?  Am I going on the path most lined with grief of all that I have walked before?  My son's voice greets me.  Go, my servants,<milestone ed="p" n="1215" unit="line"/>hurry closer, and when you have reached the tomb, enter the opening where the stones of the mound have been torn away, up to the cell's very mouth.

Then the ill-fated boy was enraged with himself<milestone ed="p" n="1235" unit="line"/>and straightway stretched himself over his sword and drove it, half its length, into his side.
