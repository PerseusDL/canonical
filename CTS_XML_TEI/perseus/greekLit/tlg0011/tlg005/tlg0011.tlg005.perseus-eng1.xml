<speaker>Paedagogus</speaker>
<p>Son of him who once commanded our forces at <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Troy</placeName>, son of Agamemnon!&mdash;now you may survey all that your heart has desired for so long.  There is the ancient <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> of your yearning,<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>that consecrated land from which the gad-fly drove the daughter of Inachus;  there, Orestes, is the Lycean market place, named from the wolf-slaying god;  there on the left is Hera's famous temple;  and in this place to which we have come, know that you see <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>, the rich in gold,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>and here the house of Pelops' heirs, so often stained with bloodshed.  Long ago from here, away from the murder of your father, I carried you for her whose blood is yours, your sister, and saved you and reared you up to manhood to be the avenger of your murdered father.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>Now, therefore, Orestes, and you, best of allies, Pylades, our plan of action must be quickly laid;  for look, already the sun's bright ray is stirring the birds' songs into clarity, and the kindly darkness of the stars is spent.<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>Before, then, anyone comes out from the house, we must make our plans, since we are at the point where it is no longer opportune to hesitate, but it is the moment for action.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="23">
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>True friend and follower, how well you prove your loyalty to our house!<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>Just as a thoroughbred mount, even if advanced in years, does not lose courage in danger, but pricks up his ears, so you speed us forward and follow in the first ranks.  I will tell you, then, what I have determined.<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>Listen closely to my words and correct me, if I miss the mark in any way.</p>
<p>When I went to the Pythian oracle to learn how I might avenge my father on his murderers,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>Phoebus gave me the commandment which you will now hear:  that alone, and by stealth, without the aid of arms or large numbers, I should carry off my right hand's just slaughters.  Accordingly, since I received this divine declaration, you must go into that house there<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>when opportunity gives you entrance, and learn all that is happening, so that you may report to us out of sure knowledge.  Your age and the lapse of time will prevent them from recognizing you;  they will never suspect who you are with that silvered hair.  Let your story be that you are a Phocian stranger<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>sent by Phanoteus, since he is the greatest of their allies.  Tell them, and affirm it with your oath, that Orestes has perished by a fatal chance, hurled at the Pythian games<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>from his speeding chariot.  Let that be the substance of your message.</p></sp>

<!-- Orestes is still speaking -->
<p>Meanwhile, we will first crown my father's tomb as the god ordered with libations and the luxuriant tribute of a severed lock;  then we will return here, bearing in our hands an urn of hammered bronze<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>&mdash;now hidden, as you no doubt know, in the brushwood&mdash;so that we may gladden them with the false tidings that this body of mine exists no more, but has been consumed with fire and reduced to ashes.  How does it hurt me, when by feigned death<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>I find true life and win renown?  No word is ill-omened, I trust, if it yields gain.  For often before now I have seen clever men die in false report;  then, when they return home, they are held in greater honor.<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>And so for myself I trust that as a result of this rumor I, too, shall live, shining down like a star upon my enemies.</p>
<p>But you, O my fatherland and native gods of my soil, receive me with good fortune in this journey, and you also, house of my ancestors,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>since I come by divine mandate to cleanse you as justice demands.  Do not dismiss me from this land in dishonor, but grant that I may rule over my possessions and restore my house!</p>
<p>I have said enough.  Go now, old one, and take care to watch over your task.<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>The two of us will depart;  for so opportunity bids, chief ruler of every enterprise for men.</p></sp></div1>

<p>No, no;  before all else, let us strive to obey the commands of Loxias and from them make a fair beginning by pouring libations to your father.  For such actions bring<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>victory within our grasp and give us mastery in all our doings.<stage>Exeunt Paedagogus on the spectators left, Orestes and Pylades on the  right.</stage></p></sp></div1>

My accursed bed in that house of suffering there knows well already how I observe my night-long rites&mdash;how often I bewail my miserable<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>father, whom bloody Ares did not welcome with deadly gifts in a foreign land, but my mother and her bedfellow Aegisthus split his head with murderous axe, just as woodmen chop an oak.<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>And for this crime no pitying cry bursts from any lips but mine, when you, Father, have died a death so cruel and so deserving of pity!</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="103">
<sp><p>But never will I end from cries and bitter lamentation,<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>while I look on the stars' glistening flashes or on this light of day.  No, like the nightingale, slayer of her offspring, I will wail without ceasing, and cry aloud to all here at the doors of my father.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>O House of Hades and Persephone!  O Hermes of the shades!  O potent Curse, and you fearsome daughters of the gods, the Erinyes, who take note when a life is unjustly taken, when a marriage-bed is thievishly dishonored,<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>come, help me, bring vengeance for the murder of my father and send me my brother.  I no longer have the strength to hold up alone against<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>the load of grief that crushes me.

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="121" unit="line"/>Ah, Electra, child of a most wretched mother, why are you always wasting away in this unsated mourning for Agamemnon, who long ago was godlessly<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>ensnared in your false mother's wiles and betrayed by her corrupt hand?  May the one who did that perish, if I may speak such a curse without breaking the gods' laws.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="129" unit="line"/>Ah, noble-hearted girls,<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>you have come to relieve me in my troubles.  I know and feel it: it does not escape me.  Still I cannot leave this task undone, nor abandon this mourning for my poor father.  Ah, friends whose love responds to mine in every mood,<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>allow me to rave as I am, oh, please, I beg you!</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="137">

<p><milestone ed="p" n="137" unit="line"/>But never by weeping nor by prayer will you resurrect your father from the pool of Hades which receives all men.<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>No, by grieving without end and beyond due limits you will find cureless misery and your own ruin;  in these actions there is no deliverance from evils.  Tell us, why do you pursue such suffering?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>Foolish is the child who forgets a parent's piteous death.  No, closer to my heart is the mourner who eternally wails, &ldquo;Itys, Itys,&rdquo; that bird mad with grief, the messenger of Zeus.<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>Ah, all-suffering Niobe, you I count divine, since you weep forever in your rocky tomb!</p></sp></div1>

<p><milestone ed="p" n="154" unit="line"/>Not to you alone of mortals, my daughter, has sorrow come,<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>though you face it with less restraint than those girls inside, Chrysothemis and Iphianassa, whose parents and blood you share.  They still live, as he, too, lives, sorrowing in his secluded youth,<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>yet happy in that this famous realm of the Mycenaeans shall one day receive him as a noble lord, if with the blessing of Zeus's escort he, Orestes, returns to this land.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="164" unit="line"/>Yes, I await him with unwearied longing,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>as I walk my sad path from day to day childless and unwed, bathed in tears, bearing that endless doom of evils.  But he forgets all that he has suffered and learned.<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>What message comes to me that is not proven false?  He constantly desires to be with us, but though he desires it, he does not choose to appear.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="174">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="2"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="174" unit="line"/>Courage, my daughter, courage;  Zeus in the sky<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>is still mighty, and he sees and rules all.  Leave your oversharp anger to him;  be neither excessively hostile to those you hate, nor forgetful of them, since Time is a god who brings ease.<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>Neither the son of Agamemnon, who dwells by <placeName key="tgn,7018211">Crisa</placeName>'s cattle-feeding shore nor the god who reigns beside <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName> is unmindful of you.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>But the best part of life has passed away leaving me in hopelessness, and I have no strength left.  I waste away without children and have no loving husband to champion me, but like some despised foreign slave,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>I serve in the halls of my father, wrapped in shabby garments and standing to eat scanty meals.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="193">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="3"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="193" unit="line"/>Mournful was the voice heard at his return, and mournful the voice amidst your father's reclining banquet<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>when the straight, swift blow of the bronze-jawed axe was sped against him.  Deceit was the plotter, Lust the slayer, two dread parents of a dreadful<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>phantom, whether it was god or mortal that did this deed.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="201" unit="line"/>O that hated day, hated beyond all that have come to me;  O that night, the terrible grief of that unutterable feast, the shameless death-strokes<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>my father saw from their twin hands, hands which took my life captive by treachery, which cast me to ruin!  May the great god of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName><milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>create for them sufferings in penalty, and may they never have enjoyment of their splendor since they have committed such crimes!</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="213">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="3"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="213" unit="line"/>Be advised to say no more;  do you not see by what actions<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>under the present circumstances you plunge so shamefully into self-made miseries?  You have far excelled in achieving misfortune, ever breeding wars in your hardhearted soul.  But such strife<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>should not be pushed into a conflict with the powerful.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="221" unit="line"/>I have been forced to it, forced by a terrible compulsion.  I know my own passion; it does not escape me;  but, under such terrible compulsion, I will not restrain these disastrous cries of frenzy,<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>so long as life is in me.  Who indeed, my noble friends, who that keeps what is appropriate in mind, would think any word of comfort right for my ears?  Let me be, let me be, my comforters!<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>For these ills will be reckoned with those which have no cure;  I will never know a respite from my pains, or the sum of this wailing.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="233">
<milestone unit="epode"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="233" unit="line"/>It is nevertheless with goodwill, like a true-hearted mother,<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>that I dissuade you from begetting misery upon miseries.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="236" unit="line"/>But what limit has nature begot for my affliction?  Tell me, how can it be right to neglect the dead?  Has such a seed been sown in any mortal?  May I never have such men's esteem;<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>never, when I am close to prosperity, may I dwell in ease, hindering the wings of shrill lamentation so as to deprive my begetter of his honors!</p>
<p>For if the dead is to lie a wretch, merely dust and nothingness,<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>while his slayers do not pay back to him blood for blood in penalty,<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>then shame and reverence will vanish from all humanity.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="251">

<milestone unit="episode"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="251" unit="line"/>I came, my child, mindful of your interests no less than my own.  But if what I say is wrong, let your way prevail;  for united we will follow you.</p></sp>
<sp n="Electra">
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>I am ashamed, my friends, if you judge me<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>too intolerant with my many laments;  but, since rough compulsion forces me to act this way, forgive me.  How indeed could any woman of noble nature not act, when she sees her father's sufferings as I see them day and night continually,<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>and flourishing rather than fading?  First, everything to do with the mother who bore me has become most hateful towards me;  next, in my own home I live with my father's murderers;  they rule over me and from them<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>equally I either have or do without.</p>
<p>And then think what manner of days I pass, when I see Aegisthus sitting on my father's throne;  when I look on him wearing the very robes which my father wore and<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>pouring libations at the hearth where he killed him;  and when I see the chief outrage of them all, the murderer in my father's bed at my wretched mother's side, if I must call her mother, even though she shares her bed with that man.<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>So hardened is she that she joins with this polluter, fearing no Erinys.  No, as if laughing at her deeds, having found the day on which in the past she treacherously killed my father,<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>she celebrates it with dance and song, and in monthly rites she sacrifices sheep to the gods who worked her deliverance.</p>
</sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="282">
<sp><p>But I, as I joylessly witness it, cry out, waste away in the house and bewail the unholy feast named after my father,<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>in solitary weeping.  For I cannot even grieve to the full extent which would please my heart, since this lady, who is in fact no lady, loudly reproaches me with such shameless taunts as these:  &ldquo;Wicked and hateful girl, have you alone lost your father,<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>and is no one else in the world grieving?  May your death be harsh, and may the gods below never free you from your current mourning.&rdquo;  Just so she abuses me, except when she gets word that Orestes is coming.  Then, infuriated,<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>she comes up to me and cries;&mdash;&ldquo;Have you not brought this upon me?  Is this not your doing, since you stole Orestes from my hands and secretly sent him away?  Yes&mdash;but rest assured that you will be justly punished.&rdquo;  Like this she barks, and in agreement<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>her glorious bridegroom by her side urges her on&mdash;that total impotent, that utter plague who fights his battles with the help of women.  But my heart is broken by my suffering as I constantly wait for Orestes to come and end these troubles.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>For the perpetual imminence of his actions has eradicated every hope that I could conceive.  In such a state of affairs, then, friends, there is no room for self-restraint or for reverence.  Rather, in these dire straits there is much need to pursue a dire course.

<p><milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>Tell me, is Aegisthus nearby as you speak these words to us, or has he left the house?</p></sp>

<p>He is gone, to be sure.  Do not think that I would have come to the doors, if he were nearby. He happens now to be in the country.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Might I converse with you<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/>more boldly, if this is so?</p></sp>

<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Say no more now, since I see your sister<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line"/>coming from the house, Chrysothemis, offspring of the same father and mother.  In her hands are sepulchral offerings, such as are customary for those in the world below.</p></sp>
<stage>Enter Chrysothemis, from the house.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Chrysothemis</speaker>
<p>What is this speech of yours, sister, which you have come forth yet again to speak at the public doors?<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line"/>Will you not learn with any lapse of time to end your vain indulgence in futile anger?  Yet this much I know&mdash;that I myself am saddened by our present circumstances;  indeed so much so that, could I find the strength, I would bare my feelings towards them.<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line"/>But now, in these evil times I think it best to navigate with shortened sail so that I may not seem to be on the attack, when I am unable to cause harm.  I wish that your own conduct were the same!  Nevertheless, right is on the side which you favor, not on that which I advise.  But if I am to live the life of the freeborn,<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/>those in power must be obeyed in all things.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="341">
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>It is strange, indeed, that you, the daughter of our father from whom you grew, should forget him and instead show concern for your mother!  All your admonitions to me have been taught by her;  you speak no word of your own.<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/>So now take your choice:  be imprudent, or be prudent, but forgetful of your friends.  You have just said that if could you find the strength, you would show your hatred of them;  yet, when I am doing my utmost to avenge our father,<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line"/>you do not work with me, but seek to deflect your sister from her deed.</p>
<p>Does this not add cowardice to our miseries?  Therefore instruct me, or rather learn from me what gain there might be for me if I ended my lamentation.  Am I not now alive?  Miserably so, I know, but well enough for me.<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>And I hurt them, and thereby affix an honorable tribute to the dead, in case those in that world can enjoy it and feel gratitude.  But you, who tell me of your hatred, hate in word alone, while by your behavior you unite with the murderers of our father.  I, however, would never yield to them, not even if<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/>one of them were to bring to me the gifts in which you now glory.

<p>It is said that she saw the father of you and of me restored to the sunlight and to her company once more.  Then he took the scepter&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/>once his own, but now carried by Aegisthus&mdash;and planted it at the hearth.  From it branched upward a flourishing limb, by which the whole land of the Mycenaeans was overshadowed.

<p>Dear sister, let none of these offerings in your hands touch the tomb.  For neither divine law nor piety allows you to dedicate funeral gifts or bring libations to our father from his hateful wife.<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/>No!  To the winds with them!  Or cover them in a deep, dusty hole, where not one of them will ever come near our father's resting place.  Rather let these treasures be preserved for her below when she dies.  Were she not by nature the most audacious<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>of all women, she would never at all have tried to pour these ill-willed offerings to the man she killed.  Consider whether you believe that the dead in his tomb will welcome this tribute with affection towards her, by whose hand he died dishonored and was mutilated<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>like an enemy?  She, who, as if to wash herself clean, wiped off the bloodstains on his head?  Surely you do not believe that your bringing these things will absolve her of the murder?</p>
<p>It is not possible.  No, be rid of them.  Give him instead a lock of your hair's ends, cut from your own head,<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>and from wretched me, too, give these gifts, poor as they are, though all I have.  Take this hair, not glossy with unguents, and this girdle, decked with no rich ornament.  Then fall down and pray that he himself may come in kindness to us from the world below, a helper against our enemies;<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>and that young Orestes may live to set his foot upon our enemies in superior might, so that hereafter we may crown  our father's tomb with wealthier hands than those with which we honor him now.</p>
<p>I think, yes, I think that he too had some part<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>in sending her these appalling dreams.  Still, sister, do yourself this service and help me, and him, too, that most beloved of all men, who rests in Hades' domain, our shared father.</p></sp></div1>

<stage>Enter Clytaemnestra, with attendants, from the house.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Clytaemnestra</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="516" unit="line"/>You run loose again, it seems, since Aegisthus is not here, who used always to keep you at least from coming out to the gates and shaming your family.  But now, since he is absent, you pay<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line"/>me no mind.  And yet you have said of me often and to many listeners that I am a rash and unjust tyrant, who violently abuse you and yours.  But it is not I who do violence;  I only return the insults that I so often hear from you.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line"/>Your father&mdash;this and nothing else is your constant pretext&mdash;was slain by me.  Yes, by me.  I know it well.   I make no denial.  Justice took hold of him, not I alone&mdash;Justice, whom you ought to have supported, if you had been in your right mind.<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line"/>For this father of yours whom you constantly bewail alone of all the Greeks had the heart to sacrifice your own blood, your sister, to the gods&mdash;he, who, when sowing his seed, felt none of the pains I did when I gave birth.</p>
<p>Come, tell me now, why, or to please whom,<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line"/>did he sacrifice her?  To please the Argives, you will say?  No, they had no right to kill my daughter.  Or, if indeed it was for the sake of his brother Menelaus that he killed my child, was he not to pay me the penalty for that?  Did Menelaus not have two children,<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line"/>who should in fairness have died instead of my daughter, since the father and mother from whom they were sprung had caused that voyage?  Did Hades have some greater desire to feast on my offspring than on hers?  Or had all love of the children of my womb been<milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line"/>abandoned by their accursed father, while love for the children of Menelaus filled him? Were these not the marks of a thoughtless and malicious parent?  I think so, even if I differ from your judgment.  So, too, would the dead girl speak, if she could find a voice.  For myself, then, I view the past without<milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line"/>dismay;  but if you think my attitude criminal, see that your own judgment is just before you blame your neighbor.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="552">
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>This time, at least, you cannot say that I first gave you cause for upset and thereby provoked such words from you.  But, if you will permit me,<milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line"/>I would gladly declare the truth, on behalf of my dead father and my sister alike.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Clytaemnestra</speaker>
<p>Certainly I permit you;  and if you always addressed me in such a tone, you would not be difficult to listen to.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="558">
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>Then I will speak.  You admit that you killed my father.  What statement could be more shameful still than that,<milestone ed="p" n="560" unit="line"/>whether you did it justly or not?  But I will demonstrate to you that you did not justly kill him.  No, the persuasion of that wicked man with whom you now sleep dragged you to it.</p>
<p>Ask the huntress Artemis what wrong she punished when she stayed the frequent winds at Aulis;<milestone ed="p" n="565" unit="line"/>or I will tell you, since we may not learn from her.  My father, as I have heard, was once hunting in the grove of the goddess, when his footfall flushed a dappled and antlered stag;  he shot it, and chanced to make a certain boast concerning its slaughter.<milestone ed="p" n="570" unit="line"/>Angered by this, Leto's daughter detained the Greeks so that in requital for the beast's life my father should sacrifice his own daughter.  So it was that she was sacrificed, since the fleet had no other release, neither homeward nor to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Troy</placeName>.<milestone ed="p" n="575" unit="line"/>For that reason, under fierce constraint and with much resistance, at last he sacrificed her&mdash;but it was not for the sake of Menelaus.</p>
<p>But suppose&mdash;for I will make your own plea&mdash;suppose that the motive of his deed was to benefit his brother.  Should you have killed him because of that?  Under what sort of law?<milestone ed="p" n="580" unit="line"/>See that by laying down such a law for men, you do not lay down trouble and remorse for yourself.  For, if we are to take blood for blood, you surely would be the first to die, if you were to meet with justice.</p>
<p>But consider whether this pretext is any excuse at all.<milestone ed="p" n="585" unit="line"/>For tell me, if you please, what crime it is that you requite by doing the most shameless deeds of all:  sharing your bed with that blood-guilty one, with whom you first destroyed my father and now bear his children<milestone ed="p" n="590" unit="line"/>while you have cast out the earlier born, the pious offspring of a pious marriage?  How can I commend these deeds?  Or will you claim that this, too, is recompense for your daughter?  No, it is a shameful plea, if you so plead, for there is nothing noble in marrying an enemy for a daughter's sake.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="595" unit="line"/>But no, I can hardly even admonish you, when your every cry is that I slander my mother.  I think, rather, that you are no less a mistress to me than a mother;  so lowly is the life that I live,<milestone ed="p" n="600" unit="line"/>ever beset with miseries come from you and your consort.  And your other child, the exile who scarcely escaped your hand, poor Orestes, wastes away his unhappy life.  You have often accused me of rearing him to punish your crime,<milestone ed="p" n="605" unit="line"/>and I would have done so, if I could, you may be sure.  As far as he is concerned, you can denounce me to all as disloyal, if you like, or loud-mouthed, or impudent.  For if my nature is familiar with such wrongdoings, I hardly bring disgrace upon your nature.</p></sp></div1>

<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>Now be assured that I do feel shame for it, though I seem not to you.  I know that my behavior is unsuited to my age and inappropriate.

<p><milestone ed="p" n="680" unit="line"/>I was sent for that purpose, and will tell you all.  Having gone to the shrine which is <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>'s common glory in order to compete for <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>'s prizes and having heard the herald's loud summons to the foot-race, the first contest,<milestone ed="p" n="685" unit="line"/>he entered the lists, a brilliant form, a wonder in the eyes of all there.  When he had finished the race at the point where it began, he went out with the glorious honor of victory.  To say the most with the least words, I do not know the man whose deeds and triumphs have matched his.<milestone ed="p" n="690" unit="line"/>But this one thing you must know:  in all the contests that the judges announced, he carried away the prize, and men deemed him happy as often as the herald proclaimed him an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName>, by name Orestes, son of<milestone ed="p" n="695" unit="line"/>Agamemnon, who once marshalled <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>'s famous expedition.</p>
<p>So far Orestes fared as I described.  But when a god sends harm, not even the strong man can escape.  For on another day, when with the rising sun there was held the race of the swift-footed horses,<milestone ed="p" n="700" unit="line"/>he entered it along with many charioteers.  One was an Achaean, one from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>;  two masters of yoked cars were Libyans;  Orestes, driving Thessalian mares, came fifth among them;  the sixth was from <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="705" unit="line"/>with chestnut colts;  a Magnesian was the seventh;  the eighth, with white horses, was of Aenian stock;  the ninth hailed from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, built of gods;  there was a Boeotian too, making the tenth chariot.  They took their stations where the appointed umpires<milestone ed="p" n="710" unit="line"/>placed them by lot and ranged the cars.  Then at the sound of the bronze trumpet, they started.  All shouted to their horses, and shook the reins in their hands;  the whole course was filled with the clatter of rattling chariots;  and the dust flew upward.<milestone ed="p" n="715" unit="line"/>All of them in a confused throng kept plying their goads unsparingly, so that one of them might pass the wheel-hubs and the snorting steeds of his rivals;  for both at their backs and at their rolling wheels the breath of the horses foamed and smattered.<milestone ed="p" n="720" unit="line"/>Orestes, driving close to the near edge of the turning-post, almost grazed it with his wheel each time and, giving rein to the trace-horse on the right, he checked the horse on the inner side.  To this point, all the chariots still stood upright.  But then the Aenian's<milestone ed="p" n="725" unit="line"/>hard-mouthed colts carried him out of control as they passed out of the turn from the sixth into the seventh lap and dashed their foreheads against the rig of the Barcaean.  Next, as a result of this one mishap, the cars kept smashing and colliding with each other, and the whole<milestone ed="p" n="730" unit="line"/>race-ground of <placeName key="tgn,7018211">Crisa</placeName> swelled with shipwrecked chariots.</p></sp>

But when he sees that the Athenian is alone left in, he sends a shrill cry ringing through the ears of his swift colts, and gives chase.  Bringing yoke level with yoke the two of them raced, first one man, then the other,<milestone ed="p" n="740" unit="line"/>showing his head in front of the other's chariot.  Up to now the ill-fated Orestes had driven upright safely through every circuit, upright in his upright car.  But then he slackened his left rein while the horse was turning and unwittingly struck the edge of the pillar,<milestone ed="p" n="745" unit="line"/>breaking the axle-box in two.  He spilled forward over the chariot-rail and was caught in the trim reins, and as he fell to the ground, his colts were scattered into the middle of the course.</p>
<p>But when the crowd saw that he had fallen<milestone ed="p" n="750" unit="line"/>from the chariot, a cry of pity went up for the young man who had done such deeds and was allotted such bad fortune&mdash;now dashed against the earth, now tossed with his feet to the sky until the charioteers with difficulty reigned in the gallop of his horses and<milestone ed="p" n="755" unit="line"/>freed him, so covered with blood that no friend who saw it would have known the pitiful corpse.  Immediately they burned him on a pyre, and chosen men of <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName> now bring the sad dust of that mighty form in a small urn of bronze,<milestone ed="p" n="760" unit="line"/>so that he may find due burial in his fatherland.</p>
<p>Such is my story&mdash;it is grievous even to hear, but for us witnesses who looked on, it was the greatest of sorrows that these eyes have seen.

<div1 type="card" n="892">

<speaker>Chrysothemis</speaker>
<p>Well, I will tell you all that I have seen.  When I came to Father's ancestral tomb, I saw that streams of milk had recently flowed from the top of the mound<milestone ed="p" n="895" unit="line"/>and that his sepulchre was encircled with garlands of all flowers that grow.  I was astonished at the sight, and peered about lest somehow someone should approach close to me.  But when I perceived that all the place was in stillness,<milestone ed="p" n="900" unit="line"/>I crept nearer to the tomb, and on the mound's edge I saw a lock of hair, freshly severed.</p>
<p>And the very moment I see it&mdash;ah me!&mdash;a familiar image rushes into my mind, and I feel that I am looking at a token of him whom I most love, Orestes.<milestone ed="p" n="905" unit="line"/>Then I lift it in my hands and make no sound of bad omen, but the tears of joy straightaway fill my eyes.  Even now I know well, just as I knew then, that this fair tribute has come from no one but him.  Whom else does that tomb concern, save me and you?<milestone ed="p" n="910" unit="line"/>And I did not make those offerings, I know, nor did you.  How could you, when you cannot  leave this house even to worship the gods without later regretting it?  Nor, again, does our mother's heart incline to do such deeds, nor could she have done so without our knowledge.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="915" unit="line"/>No, these offerings are from Orestes!  Come, dear sister, have courage!  Not always does the same fortune, it is true, attend the same individuals.  Ours was once to be despised, but today, perhaps, will seal the promise of much good.</p></sp></div1>

<p>Hear, then, in what way I have decided to take action.  As for the support of friends, you yourself doubtless know that we have none.  Hades has taken our friends away,<milestone ed="p" n="950" unit="line"/>and we two are left alone.  I, so long as I heard that my brother still lived and prospered, had hopes that he would yet come to avenge the murder of our father.

There&mdash;I can have no secrets from you anymore.</p>
<p>How long will you wait in indifference?  What hope is left standing, to which your eyes can turn?  Now you are right to complain<milestone ed="p" n="960" unit="line"/>that you are robbed of possession of your father's estate;  now you may mourn that  you have advanced this far in years without wedded love or bridal song.  And do not cling to hopes that you will ever meet with such joys.  The man, Aegisthus, is not so unthinking<milestone ed="p" n="965" unit="line"/>as ever to permit that offspring should shoot up from you or from me either to be a certain bane for himself.  But if you will follow my plans, first you will win praise for piety from our dead father below, and from our brother, too;<milestone ed="p" n="970" unit="line"/>next, you shall be called hereafter free, just as you were born, and shall find a worthy marriage.  For noble natures draw the gaze of all.</p>
<p>Then do you not see what fair fame you will procure for yourself and for me, by obeying me?<milestone ed="p" n="975" unit="line"/>What citizen or stranger when he sees us will not greet us with praises such as these:  &ldquo;Behold these two sisters, my friends!

Now I raise your nothingness in my hands;<milestone ed="p" n="1130" unit="line"/>but then, my child, you were radiant, when I sent you away from home!  Would that I had first abandoned life, before, stealing you away with these hands, I sent you to a strange land and rescued you from death, in order that you might have lain dead on that same day<milestone ed="p" n="1135" unit="line"/>and had your share in the tomb of our father!</p>
<p>But now, an exile from home and fatherland, you have perished miserably, far from your sister.  Ah, me, these loving hands have not washed or decked your corpse, nor taken up<milestone ed="p" n="1140" unit="line"/>their sad burden from the all-consuming pyre, as was proper.  No!  At the hands of strangers, poor Orestes, you have been tended, and so have come to us, a small bulk in a small urn.</p>
<p>Ah, I grieve at the uselessness of my nursing long ago, the service that I often bestowed<milestone ed="p" n="1145" unit="line"/>on you in sweet labor!  For you were never your mother's darling so much as mine, nor was any in the house your nurse but I, and by you I was ever called &ldquo;sister.&rdquo;  But now all this has vanished in a day<milestone ed="p" n="1150" unit="line"/>with your death.  Like a whirlwind you have swept everything away with you.  Our father is gone;  I am dead because of you;  you yourself are dead and gone;  our enemies laugh at us;  and our mother, who is no mother, raves with joy. Unknown to her, you often<milestone ed="p" n="1155" unit="line"/>sent me messages about her, saying that you yourself would appear for vengeance.  But our evil fortune, yours and mine, has torn all that away, and has sent you back to me in this state, ash and a useless shade in place of your beloved form.</p></sp>

Instead tell me that which will suit our present circumstances:  where, either openly or in ambush,<milestone ed="p" n="1295" unit="line"/>we may put an end to our enemies' laughter by means of my coming.  Make sure that our mother does not discover you by your radiant face, when we two have gone into the house.  Rather, make lament, as if for the feigned disaster.  For when we succeed, then<milestone ed="p" n="1300" unit="line"/>there will be opportunity to rejoice and exult in freedom.</p></sp>

For in doing so I would not honorably support the divine power that attends us now.</p>

And never fear that she<milestone ed="p" n="1310" unit="line"/>will ever see my face lit up with smiles.  My old hatred of her has been welded to my heart, and since I have seen you, for very joy I will never cease to weep.  How indeed could I stop when I have seen you come home on this one day  first as dead,<milestone ed="p" n="1315" unit="line"/>and then in life?  What you have done to me is inconceivable&mdash;so much so that, if my father were to return to me alive, I would no longer think it a portent, but would believe that I truly saw him.  Therefore now that you have come to me by such a path, command me as your spirit bids you.
