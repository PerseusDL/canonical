<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Child of a blind old man, Antigone, to what region have we come, or to what city of men? Who will entertain the wandering Oedipus today with scanty gifts?<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>Little do I crave, and obtain still less than that little, and with that I am content. For patience is the lesson of suffering, and of the long years upon me, and lastly of a noble mind. My child, if you see any resting-place,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>either on profane ground or by groves of the gods, stop me and set me down, so that we may inquire where we are. We have come to learn as foreigners from the townsmen, and to bring to completion whatever we hear.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Father, toil-worn Oedipus, the towers that<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>ring the city, to judge by sight, are far off; and this place is sacred, to judge from its appearance: laurel, olive, and vine grow thick-set; and a feathered crowd of nightingales makes music within. So sit here on this unshaped stone;<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>you have travelled a long way for an old man.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Seat me, then, and watch over the blind.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>If time can teach, I need not learn that.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Can you tell me, now, where we have arrived?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p><placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> I know, but not this place.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>Yes, so much every traveller told us.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Well, shall I go and learn what the spot is called?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Yes, child, if indeed it is inhabited.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>It surely is inhabited. But I think there is no need&mdash;I see a man nearby.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>Setting off and coming toward us?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>He is at our side already. Speak whatever seems timely to you, for the man is here.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="33">
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Stranger, hearing from this maiden, who has sight both for herself and for me,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>that you have arrived as a scout of good fortune for the solving of our doubts&mdash;</p></sp>
<stage>Enter a stranger, a man of <placeName key="perseus,Colonus">Colonus</placeName>.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Stranger</speaker>
<p>Now, before you question me at length, leave this seat. You occupy ground which is unholy to tread upon.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>And what is this ground? To which of the gods is it sacred?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stranger</speaker>
<p>Ground inviolable, on which no one may dwell. The dread<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>goddesses hold it, the daughters of Earth and Darkness.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Who are they? Whose awful name might I hear and invoke in prayer?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stranger</speaker>
<p>The all-seeing Eumenides the people here would call them: but other names please elsewhere.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Then graciously may they receive their suppliant!<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>Nevermore will I depart from my seat in this land.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stranger</speaker>
<p>What does this mean?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>The watchword of my fate.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stranger</speaker>
<p>I dare not remove you without warrant from the city, until I report what I am doing.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Now by the gods, stranger, do not deny me, hapless wanderer as you see,<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>the honor of the knowledge for which I beg you.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stranger</speaker>
<p>Tell me, and you will not be without honor from me.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>What, then, is the place that we have entered?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stranger</speaker>
<p>All that I myself know, you will hear and learn. This whole place is sacred;<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>august Poseidon holds it, and in it lives the fire-bearing god, the Titan Prometheus. But as for the spot on which you tread, it is called the bronze threshold of this land, the support of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. And the neighboring fields claim <placeName key="perseus,Colonus">Colonus</placeName>, the horse-rider, for their ancient ruler;<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>and all the people bear his name in common as their own. Such, you see, stranger, are these haunts. They receive their honor not through story, but rather through our living with them.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Are there indeed dwellers in this region?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stranger</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>Yes indeed, the namesakes of that god there &lsqb;<placeName key="perseus,Colonus">Colonus</placeName>&rsqb;.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Have they a king? Or does speaking &lsqb;in assembly&rsqb; rest with the masses?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stranger</speaker>
<p>These parts are ruled by the king in the city.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>And who is he that is sovereign in counsel and in might?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stranger</speaker>
<p>Theseus he is called, son of Aegeus who was before him.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>Could a messenger go to him from among you?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stranger</speaker>
<p>With what aim? To speak, or to prepare his coming?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>So that by a small service he may find a great gain.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Stranger</speaker>
<p>And what help can come from one who cannot see?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>In all that I speak there will be vision.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="75">
<sp>
<speaker>Stranger</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>Take care now, stranger, that you come to no harm; for you are noble, if I may judge by your looks, leaving your ill-fortune aside. Stay here, where I found you, until I go and tell these things to the people of this district&mdash;not in the city.<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>They will decide for you whether you should stay or go back.<stage>Stranger exits.</stage></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>My child, has the stranger left us?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>He is gone, and so you can speak what you wish, father, fully at ease, knowing that I alone am near.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Ladies of dread aspect, since your seat is<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>the first in this land at which I have bent my knee, show yourselves not ungracious to Phoebus or to myself; who, when he proclaimed that doom of many woes, spoke to me of this rest after long years: on reaching my goal in a land where I should find a seat of the Awful Goddesses<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>and a shelter for foreigners, there I should close my weary life, with profit, through my having fixed my abode there, for those who received me, but ruin for those who sent me forth, who drove me away. And he went on to warn me that signs of these things would come,<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>in earthquake, or in thunder, or in the lightning of Zeus. Now I perceive that in this journey some trusty omen from you has surely led me home to this grove; never otherwise could I have met with you, first of all, in my wanderings&mdash;I, in my sobriety, with you who touch no wine,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>&mdash;or taken this august seat not shaped by men. Then, goddesses, according to the word of Apollo, give me at last some way to accomplish and close my course&mdash;unless, perhaps, I seem too lowly,<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>enslaved as I am evermore to woes the sorest on the earth. Hear, sweet daughters of primeval Darkness! Hear, you that are called the city of great Pallas, <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, given most honor of all cities! Pity this poor ghost of the man Oedipus!<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>For in truth it is the former living body no more.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Hush! Here come some aged men to spy out your resting-place.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>I will be mute. But hide me in the grove, apart from the road, till I learn<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>how these men will speak.  For in learning is the safeguard of our course.<stage>They exit.</stage></p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="118">

<milestone unit="choral"/>
<milestone unit="strophe" n="1"/>
<stage>The Chorus of elders of <placeName key="perseus,Colonus">Colonus</placeName> enters the orchestra.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Look! Who was he, then? Where is he staying? Where has he rushed from this place,<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>man most insatiate of all who live? Scan the ground, look well, press the search everywhere. A wanderer that old man must have been,<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>a wanderer, not a dweller in the land; otherwise he never would have advanced into this untrodden grove of the maidens with whom none may strive.<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>Their name we tremble to speak; we pass them by with eyes turned away, moving our lips, without sound or word, in still devotion. But now it is said that one has come who reveres them not at all;<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>and him I cannot yet discern, though I look round all the holy place, nor do I know where to find his lodging.</p>
<stage>Oedipus steps forward with Antigone.</stage></sp>
<sp><speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Behold the man you seek! In sound is my sight, as the saying goes.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>Oh! Oh! Fearful he is to see, and fearful to hear!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Do not regard me, I beg you, as a lawless man.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Zeus defend us! Who may this old man be?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Not so wholly of the best fate<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>that you would call him fortunate, guardians of this land! It is plain; otherwise I would not be creeping, as you see, by the eyes of others, and buoying my strength upon weakness.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="148">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="1"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Alas! Were you sightless even from birth?<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>Evil have been your days, and many, it appears. But at least if I can help it, you shall not add this curse to your lot. You go too far&mdash;too far!<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>That your rash steps may intrude on the field of this voiceless,  grassy glade, where the waters of the mixing bowl blend their stream with the flow of honied offerings, beware, unhappiest of strangers.<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>Retire! Withdraw! Let a wide space part us. Do you hear, toil-worn wanderer? If you have anything to say in converse with us,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>leave forbidden ground, and speak where it is lawful for all; but, till then, refrain.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>Daughter, to what counsel shall we incline?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>My father, we must behave just as the townspeople do, listening and giving way where it is necessary.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Then give me your hand.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>I lay it in yours.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Strangers, let me not suffer wrong<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>when I have trusted in you, and have passed from my refuge!</p></sp></div1>

<p>Never, old man, never will anyone remove you from your resting-place here against your will.</p>

<p>Further, then?</p></sp>

<p>Lead me, then, child, to a spot where I may speak and listen within piety's domain,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>and let us not wage war with necessity.</p></sp></div1>

<p>No man is visited by the punishment of fate if he requites deeds which were first done to himself.<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>Deceit on the one part matches deceits on the other, and gives pain instead of pleasure for reward.

I beg you with eyes that can still look<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>on your own, like one sprung from your own blood, that this sufferer may meet with reverent treatment.

<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Feel sure, daughter of Oedipus, that we pity you and him alike<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>for your misfortune; but dreading the punishment of the gods, we could not say anything beyond what we have now said to you.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>What help comes, then, of repute or fair fame, if it ends in idle breath;<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>seeing that <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, as men say, is god-fearing beyond all, and alone has the power to shelter the outraged stranger, and alone the power to help him? And where are these things for me, when, after making me rise up from this rocky seat, you then drive me from the land, afraid of my name alone?<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>Not, surely, afraid of my person or of my acts; since my acts, at least, have been in suffering rather than doing&mdash;if I must mention the tale of my mother and my father, because of which you fear me. That know I full well.<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>And yet how was I innately evil? I, who was merely requiting a wrong, so that, had I been acting with knowledge, even then I could not be accounted evil. But, as it was, all unknowing I went where I went&mdash;while they who wronged me knowingly sought my ruin.<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>Therefore, strangers, I beseech you by the gods: just as you made me leave my seat, so protect me, and do not, while you render honor to the gods, consider those gods to be fools. But rather consider that they look on the god-fearing man<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>and on the godless, and that never yet has an impious man found escape.

For there the men sit weaving in the house,<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/>but the wives go forth to win the daily bread.  And in your case, my daughters, those to whom these toils belonged keep the house at home like maidens, while you two, in their place, bear your poor father's woes.<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/>The one, from the time when her youth was past and she came into her strength, has always been this old man's guide in weary wanderings, often roaming, hungry and barefoot, through the wild woods, often battered by rains and scorching sun.<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line"/>And the comforts of home, poor girl, she holds in the second place, so long as her father should have her care. And you, my child, in former days came forth, bringing your father, unknown to the Cadmeans, all the oracles that had been given concerning Oedipus.<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>You became a faithful guardian on my behalf, when I was being driven from the land. Now, in turn, what new tidings have you brought your father, Ismene? On what mission have you set forth from home? For you do not come empty-handed, I know well,<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/>or without some cause of fear for me.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>The sufferings that I bore, father, in seeking where you dwelt, I will pass by; I would not renew the pain in the recital.<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/>But the evils that now beset your ill-fated sons&mdash;it is of these that I have come to tell. At first it was their decision that the throne should be left to Creon, and the city spared pollution, when they thought calmly about the ancient blight on our race,<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>and how it has clung to your unfortunate house. But now, moved by some god and by sinful heart, an evil strife has seized them&mdash;thrice-deluded!&mdash;to grasp at rule and the power of a tyrant. And the younger son has stripped the elder, Polyneices, of the throne,<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>and has driven him from his fatherland. But he, as the widespread rumor says among us, has gone to the valley of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> as an exile, and is taking to himself a new marriage connection, and warriors for his friends, intending that <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>  soon get hold of the Cadmean land,<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>or send its praises to the sky. These are not empty words, my father, but terrible deeds; and where the gods will have pity on your grief, I cannot tell.</p></sp></div1>

<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>What are they? What has been prophesied, my child?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>And how can I profit them while I rest beyond their gates?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>Your tomb contains a curse for them, if it should suffer misfortune.</p></sp>
<sp>

<speaker>Oedipus</speaker>
<p>Will they really cover me in Theban dust?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>Sacred envoys, from the Delphian hearth.</p></sp>

<p>Yes, both have heard it, and know it well.</p></sp>

<p>Then may the gods not quench their fated strife, and may it fall to me to decide this war on which they are now setting their hands, raising spear against spear!<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>For then neither would he who now holds the scepter and the throne survive, nor would the exile ever return; seeing that when I, their father, was being thrust without honor from my country, they did not stop or defend me.

Perhaps you will say that that was my own wish then, and that the city fittingly granted me that gift. Not so! For on that first day, when my heart seethed,<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/>and my sweetest wish was for death&mdash;indeed, death by stoning&mdash;no one was found to help me in that desire. But after a time, when all my anguish was now softened, and when I began to feel that my heart had been excessive in punishing those past errors,<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>then it was that the city set about to drive me by force from the land, after all that time. And my sons, when they had the strength to bring help&mdash;sons to their own father&mdash;they would not do it. For lack of one little word from them, I was left to wander, an outcast and a beggar forever.<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>Instead, it is from these, maidens as they are, insofar as nature enables them, that I obtain my daily food, and a shelter in the land, and the aid of family.

<p>Dearest son of Aegeus, to the gods alone old age and death never come, but everything else sinks into chaos from time which overpowers all.<milestone ed="p" n="610" unit="line"/>Earth's strength decays, and so too the strength of the body; trust dies; distrust is born; and the same spirit is never steadfast among friends, or between city and city.

Then one day my slumbering and buried corpse, cold in death, will drink their warm blood, if Zeus is still Zeus, and Phoebus, the son of Zeus, speaks clear.

<speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<p>Who, then, would reject the goodwill of such a one? To whom, first, the hearth of a spear-friend is always available on our side, by reciprocal right; then too he has come as a suppliant to our gods,<milestone ed="p" n="635" unit="line"/>paying no small recompense to this land and to me. In reverence for these claims, I will never spurn his favor, and I will establish a dwelling for him as a citizen in the land.

I am not one man's envoy, but have a mandate from all our people; since it belonged to me, by family, beyond all other Thebans to mourn his woes.<milestone ed="p" n="740" unit="line"/>Unhappy Oedipus, hear us, and come home! Justly are you summoned by all the Cadmeans, and most of all by me, since I&mdash;unless I am the worst of all men born&mdash;feel most sorrow for your woes, old man,<milestone ed="p" n="745" unit="line"/>when I see you, unhappy as you are, a stranger and a wanderer evermore, roaming in beggary, with one handmaid for your support. Ah, me, I had not thought that she could fall to such a depth of misery as that to which she has fallen&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="750" unit="line"/>this poor girl!&mdash;as she tends forever your dark life amid poverty; in ripe youth, but unwed: a prize for the first passerby to seize. Is it not a cruel reproach&mdash;alas!&mdash;that I have cast at you, and me, and all our race?<milestone ed="p" n="755" unit="line"/>But indeed an open shame cannot be hidden. Oedipus, in the name of your ancestral gods, listen to me! Hide it, and consent to return to the city and the house of your ancestors, after bidding a kind farewell to this city. <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> is worthy; yet your own city has the first claim on your reverence,<milestone ed="p" n="760" unit="line"/>since it was <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> that nurtured you long ago.</p></sp></div1>

Yet such is the nature of your own offers to me: noble in appearance, but in substance base. And I will declare it to these men too, to show you up as base.

That fate is not for you, but this one: the brooding of my vengeful spirit on your land forever; and for my sons, this heirloom:<milestone ed="p" n="790" unit="line"/>just so much soil in my realm in which to die. Am I not wiser than you in the fortunes of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>?

Quick, I say, away with you!</p>
<p>As for this man, if my<milestone ed="p" n="905" unit="line"/>anger went as far as he deserves, I would not let him go uninjured from my hand. But now, just such law as he himself has brought will be the rule for his correction.</p>
<p>You will never leave this land<milestone ed="p" n="910" unit="line"/>until you bring those maidens and produce them in my sight. For your action is a disgrace to me, and to your own ancestors, and to your country. You have come to a city that practices justice and sanctions nothing without law,<milestone ed="p" n="915" unit="line"/>yet you have spurned her lawful authorities and made this violent assault. You are taking captives at will and subjugating them by force, as if you believed that my city was void of men, or manned by slaves, and that I counted for nothing. Yet it was not <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> that trained you to be evil. <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> is not accustomed to rearing unjust men;&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="920" unit="line"/>nor would she praise you, if she learned that you are despoiling me, and despoiling the gods, when by force you drive off their unfortunate suppliants.  If my foot were upon your land, never would I drag off or lead away someone<milestone ed="p" n="925" unit="line"/>without permission from the ruler of the land, whoever he might be&mdash;no, even if my claim were the most just of all. I would know how a stranger ought to live among citizens. But you are disgracing a city that does not deserve it: your own,<milestone ed="p" n="930" unit="line"/>and your years, despite their fullness, bring you an old age barren of sense. Now, I have said before, and I say it once again: let the maidens be brought here speedily, unless you wish to be an unwilling immigrant to this country by force.<milestone ed="p" n="935" unit="line"/>These are the words of my lips; my mind is in accord.</p></sp>

<p>It is not because I thought this city void of men, son of Aegeus, or of counsel, as you say,<milestone ed="p" n="940" unit="line"/>that I have done this deed; but because I judged that its people could never be so zealous for my relatives as to support them against my will. And I knew that this people would not receive a parricide and a polluted man,<milestone ed="p" n="945" unit="line"/>a man whose unholy marriage&mdash;a marriage with children&mdash;had been found out. Such wisdom, I knew, was immemorial on the Areopagus, which does not allow such wanderers to dwell within this city. Trusting in that, I sought to take this prize.<milestone ed="p" n="950" unit="line"/>And I would not have done so, had he not been calling down bitter curses on me and on my race. As I was wronged in this way, I judged that I had a right to this requital. For anger knows no old age, until death comes;<milestone ed="p" n="955" unit="line"/>the dead alone feel no galling pain. In response to this, you will do what pleases you; for, though my case is just, the lack of aid makes me weak.

<p><milestone ed="p" n="960" unit="line"/>Shameless arrogance, where do you think this outrage falls&mdash;on my old age, or on your own? Bloodshed, incest, misery&mdash;all this your tongue has launched against me, and all this I have borne in my wretchedness by no choice of mine.<milestone ed="p" n="965" unit="line"/>For this was dear to the gods, who were angry, perhaps, with my race from of old. Taking me alone, you could not find a reproach for any crime, in retribution for which I was driven to commit these sins against myself and against my kin. Tell me now: if, by the voice of an oracle, some divine doom was coming on my father,<milestone ed="p" n="970" unit="line"/>that he should die by a son's hand, how could you justly reproach me with this, when I was then unborn, when no father had yet begotten me, no mother's womb conceived me? But if, having been born to misery&mdash;as I was born&mdash;I came to blows with my father and slew him, ignorant of what<milestone ed="p" n="975" unit="line"/>I was doing and to whom, how could you reasonably blame the unwitting deed? And my mother&mdash;wretch, do you feel no shame in forcing me to speak of her marriage, when she was your sister, and when it was such as I will now tell?<milestone ed="p" n="980" unit="line"/>For I will not be silent, when you have gone so far in impious speech.</p>
<p>Yes, she was my mother, yes&mdash;alas, for my miseries! I did not know it, nor did she, and to her shame she bore children to the son whom she had borne.<milestone ed="p" n="985" unit="line"/>But one thing, at least, I know: that you willingly revile her and me, but I did not willingly marry her, and I do not willingly speak now. No, I will not be called evil on account of this marriage, nor in the slaying of my father, which you charge me with again and again in bitter insult.<milestone ed="p" n="990" unit="line"/>Answer just one thing of those I ask. If, here and now, someone should come up and try to murder you&mdash;you, the just one&mdash;would you ask if the murderer was your father, or would you revenge yourself on him straightaway?<milestone ed="p" n="995" unit="line"/>I think that if your life is dear to you, you would requite the criminal, and not look around for a justification. Such then were the evils into which I came, led by the gods; and in this, I think, my father's soul, could it come back to life, would not contradict me.<milestone ed="p" n="1000" unit="line"/>But you are not just; you are one who considers it a fine thing to utter every sort of word, both those which are sanctioned and those which are forbidden&mdash;such are your taunts against me in the presence of these men. And to you it seems a fine thing to flatter the renowned Theseus, and <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, saying how well it is governed.<milestone ed="p" n="1005" unit="line"/>Yet while giving such generous praise, you forget that if any land knows how to worship the gods with honors, this land excels in that. It is from her that you had planned to steal me, a suppliant and an old man, and tried to seize me, having already carried off my daughters.<milestone ed="p" n="1010" unit="line"/>Therefore I now call on the goddesses here, I supplicate them, I beseech them with prayers, to bring me help and to fight on my behalf, that you may learn well what kind of men this city is guarded by.</p></sp></div1>

<p>In that you touch upon what is indeed worthy of wonder. How he departed from here, you yourself must know since you were here: with no one of his friends as guide, but rather with himself leading the way for us all.<milestone ed="p" n="1590" unit="line"/>When he had come to the Descending Way, which is bound by steps of bronze to earth's deep roots, he paused at one of the many branching paths near the basin in the rock, where the faithful covenant of Theseus and Peirithous has its memorial.<milestone ed="p" n="1595" unit="line"/>He stood midway between that basin and the Leaping stone, and between the hollow pear-tree and the marble tomb; then he sat down and loosened his filthy clothing. And then he called his daughters, and asked them to bring water from some flowing source, so that he might wash and make a drink-offering.<milestone ed="p" n="1600" unit="line"/>They went to the hill which was in view, the hill of Demeter who guards the tender plants, and in a short time brought what their father had commanded. Then they washed him and dressed him, as is the custom. But when all his desire was fulfilled,<milestone ed="p" n="1605" unit="line"/>and nothing that he required was still undone, then Zeus of the Underworld sent forth his thunder, and the maidens shuddered as they heard. They fell weeping at their father's knees, and did not cease from beating their breast, and from wailing loud.<milestone ed="p" n="1610" unit="line"/>When he heard their sudden bitter cry, he put his arms around them and said: &ldquo;My children, on this day your father no longer exists. Now I have perished utterly, and no longer will you bear the burden of tending me,<milestone ed="p" n="1615" unit="line"/>which was no light one, I well know, my children.

But when they came to the end of their crying, and the sound of wailing went forth no more, there was a silence; suddenly a voice called aloud to him, so that everyone<milestone ed="p" n="1625" unit="line"/>felt hair rising from the sudden terror. The god called him again and again: &ldquo;Oedipus, Oedipus, why do you delay our going? Too long you have been lingering.&rdquo; And when he perceived that he was called by the god,<milestone ed="p" n="1630" unit="line"/>he asked that lord Theseus should come to him; and when he did, he said: &ldquo;Friend, give me the sworn pledge of your right hand for my children; and you, my daughters, for him. Promise never to betray them by your own free will, but always to accomplish whatever you think for their benefit.&rdquo;<milestone ed="p" n="1635" unit="line"/>And he, as a man of noble spirit, without lamentation swore to keep that promise to the stranger. When Theseus had done this, straightway Oedipus felt for his children with blind hands, and said:<milestone ed="p" n="1640" unit="line"/>&ldquo;Children, you must bear up nobly in your hearts and depart from this place; do not consider it just to look upon what is not right, or to hear such speech as you may not hear. Go in haste; let only Theseus be entitled to remain to learn of those things which will be done.&rdquo;<milestone ed="p" n="1645" unit="line"/>So he spoke, and everyone of us listened; with streaming tears and mourning we followed the maidens away. But when we had gone off, very soon we looked back and saw that Oedipus was nowhere any more and our lord was alone,<milestone ed="p" n="1650" unit="line"/>holding his hand in front of his face to screen his eyes, as if he had seen some terrifying sight, one that no one could endure to behold. And then after a short time,<milestone ed="p" n="1655" unit="line"/>we saw him adore together the earth and <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> of the gods in the same prayer. But by what fate Oedipus perished, no man can tell, except Theseus alone. It was no fiery thunderbolt of the god that removed him,<milestone ed="p" n="1660" unit="line"/>nor any rising of whirlwind from the sea; it was either an escort from the gods, or else the dark world of the dead kindly split open to receive him.

<p>Dear, let us hasten back.</p></sp>

<p>To do what deed?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>A longing fills my soul&mdash;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ismene.</speaker>
<p>For what?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1725" unit="line"/>To see the netherworld home.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ismene.</speaker>
<p>Of whom?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Wretched me! Of our father.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ismene.</speaker>
<p>And how can this be right?<milestone ed="p" n="1730" unit="line"/>Surely you understand?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Why this rebuke?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ismene.</speaker>
<p>And surely you know this, too&mdash;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>What more would you tell me?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>That he perished without a tomb, apart from everyone.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Lead me there, and then kill me, too.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ismene</speaker>
<p>Unhappy me! Abandoned and helpless,<milestone ed="p" n="1735" unit="line"/>where am I now to live my wretched life?</p></sp></div1>

<p>Dear girls, do not be afraid.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>But where shall I flee?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>

<p>How we are to go home, I cannot tell.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Do not seek to go.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Trouble surrounds us.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>And previously it bore heavily.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1745" unit="line"/>Then it was desperate, but now even crueler.</p></sp>

<p>Cease your lament, children! Where the favor of the nether night is stored up, there is no room for sorrow; divine retribution would follow.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Son of Aegeus, we supplicate you!</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Theseus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1760" unit="line"/>Children, he told me that no one should draw near that place, or approach with prayer the sacred tomb in which he sleeps.

<p>I will do both this and whatever other favorable service I can, for you<milestone ed="p" n="1775" unit="line"/>and for the newly-departed under the earth, according to the gratitude I owe. I am bound to spare no pains.</p></sp>
<sp>

<p>Cease; raise up the lamentation no further. These things are established firm and fixed.</p></sp>
