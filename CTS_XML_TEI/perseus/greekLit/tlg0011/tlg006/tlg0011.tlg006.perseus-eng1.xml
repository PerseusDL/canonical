<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>This is the headland of sea-washed <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, land untrodden by men and desolate.  It was here, child bred of the man who was the noblest of the Greeks, Neoptolemus son of Achilles, that I exposed<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>long ago the native of Malis, Poeas' son, on the express command of the two chieftains to do so, because his foot was all running with a gnawing disease.  Neither libation nor burnt sacrifice could be attempted by us in peace, but with his wild, ill-omened cries<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>he filled the whole camp continually with shrieking, moaning.  But what need is there to speak of that?  The time is not ripe for too many words, lest he even learn that I am here, and I so waste the whole ruse whereby I think soon to take him.<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>Come, it is your task to serve as my ally in what remains, and to seek where in this region there is a cave with two mouths.  During cold weather it provides two seats facing the sun, while in summer a breeze wafts sleep through the tunnelled chamber.<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>And a little below, on the left hand, perhaps, you will see water rising from a spring, if it has not failed.  Go there silently, and signal to me whether he still  dwells in this same place, or is to be found elsewhere, so that the rest of my plan may be explained by me, heard by you,<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>and sped by the joint effort of us both.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="26">
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>King Odysseus, the completion of the task that you set me is not far off, for I believe I see a cave like that which you have described.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>Above you, or below?  I do not see it.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Here, high up&mdash;and of footfalls there is not a sound.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>See that he is not sheltered there asleep.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>I see an empty dwelling, without occupants.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>And is there no provision inside for human habitation?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>There is&mdash;a bed of leaves, as if for some one who makes his lodging here.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>And all else is bare?  There is nothing else beneath the roof?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>Just a cup of bare wood, the masterpiece of a sorry craftsman, and with it these tools for kindling.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>His is the store that you describe.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Ha!  Yes, and here besides are some rags drying in the sun, stained by some severe infection.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>The man inhabits these regions, clearly, and is somewhere not far off.  How could he go far afield when his foot is maimed by that old plague?  No, he has gone out in quest of food, or of some soothing herb that he may have noted somewhere.<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>Send your attendant, therefore, to keep watch, lest he come upon me unawares, since he would rather take me than all the Greeks together.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>The man is going, and the path will be watched.  And now, if you need anything else, say so.<stage>Exit Attendant, on the spectators' left.</stage></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>Son of Achilles, you must be loyal to the goals of your mission&mdash;and not with your body alone.  Should you hear some new plan unknown to you till now, you must serve it, since it is to serve that you are here.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="54">
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Then what are your orders?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>You must cheat the mind of Philoctetes by means of a story<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>told as you converse with him.  When he asks you who and from where you are, say that you are the son of Achilles&mdash;it is not in that detail that you will cheat him.  But tell him you are sailing homeward, and have left the fleet of the Achaean warriors, after coming to hate them with unbounded hatred.<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>Give him this reason:  when, with no other hope of taking <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, they had summoned you by their prayers to come from home, they judged you not worthy of the arms of Achilles, not worthy to receive them&mdash;even though you had come and were claiming them by right&mdash;but instead handed them over to Odysseus.  Say what you<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>will of me&mdash;even the vilest of vile insults.  You will not harm me at all by that.  But if you fail to do as I say, you will inflict pain on all the Argives, for if that man's bow is not seized, you can never sack the realm of Dardanus.<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>And learn why your intercourse with him may be free from mistrust and danger, while mine cannot.  You have sailed to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> under no oath to any man, nor under any constraint.  Neither did you have any part in the earlier expedition.  I, however, can deny none of these things.  Accordingly, if he<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>perceives me while he is still master of his bow, I am dead, and you, as my comrade, will share my doom.  No, the thing for which we must devise a ruse is just this:  how you may steal his invincible weapons.  Well I know, my son, that by nature you are not apt<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>to utter or contrive such treachery.  Yet knowing that victory is a sweet prize to gain, steel yourself to do it.  Our honesty shall be displayed another time.  Now, however, give yourself to me for one brief, shameless day, and then for the rest of time<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>may you be called the most righteous of all humankind.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="86">
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>I abhor acting on advice, son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, which causes pain in the hearing.  It is not in my nature to achieve anything by means of evil cunning, nor was it, as I hear, in my father's.<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>But I am ready to take the man by force and without treachery, since with the use of one foot only, he will not overcome so many of us in a struggle.  And yet I was sent to assist you and am reluctant to be called traitor.  Still I prefer, my king,<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>to fail when doing what is honorable than to be victorious in a dishonorable manner.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>Son of a father so noble, I, too, in my youth once had a slow tongue and an active hand.  But now that I have come forth to the test, I see that the tongue, not action, is what masters everything among men.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>What, then, are your orders&mdash;apart from my lying?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>I command you to take Philoctetes by deceit.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>And why by deceit rather than by persuasion?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>He will never listen;  and by force you cannot take him.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Has he strength so terrific to make him bold?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>Yes, shafts inevitable, escorts of death.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Then one does not dare even approach him?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>No, unless he takes the man by deceit, as I prescribe.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Then you think it brings no shame to speak what is false?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>No, not if the falsehood yields deliverance.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>And with what expression on his face will anyone dare mouth those lies?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>When what you do promises gain, it is wrong to shrink back.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>And what gain is it for me that he should come to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>His arrows alone will capture <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Then I am not to be the conqueror, as you said?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>Neither will you be without them, nor they without you.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>It would seem, then, that we must track them down, if things stand as you say.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>Know that by doing this task, you win two rewards.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>What are they?  If I knew, I would not refuse the deed.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>You will be celebrated in the same breath as clever and as noble.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>So be it!  I will do it, and cast off all shame.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>Do you remember, then, the story that I recommended?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Be sure of it, since once and for all I have consented.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="123">
<sp>
<speaker>Odysseus</speaker>
<p>You stay here, then, to wait for him.  Meanwhile I will go away, so as not to be observed here with you,<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>and I will send our lookout back to your ship.  And, if in my view you seem to linger at all beyond the due time, I will send that same man back again, after disguising him as the captain of a merchant-ship, so that secrecy may be on our side.<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>Then, son, as he tells his artful story, take whatever in his tale is from time to time helpful to you.  Now I will go to the ship, leaving matters here to you.  May escorting Hermes the Deceiver, lead us on, and divine Victory, Athena Polias, who saves me always!<stage>Exit Odysseus, on the spectators' left.</stage></p></sp></div1>

<milestone unit="strophe" n="1"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>I am a stranger in a strange land, Master.  What must I hide, what must I reveal to a man who will be swift to suspicion?  Show me the way!  His skill excels all other skill, his wisdom has no equal, whose hands govern the godlike<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>scepter given by Zeus.  To you, my son, that sovereign power has descended from the dawn of time.  Therefore tell me how I must serve you.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="144">
<milestone unit="anapests"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>For the present&mdash;since perhaps you wish to see the place<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>on the island's edge where he resides&mdash;survey it without fear.  But when the dread traveler, who has left this dwelling, returns, step forward at my signal from time to time, and try to help as the moment may require.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="150">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="1"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>Long have I been careful of this care, my prince:  that my eyes should be watchful for your good above all else.  And now tell me, in what manner of shelter does he keep his dwelling?  In what region is he now?  It is not inopportune for<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>me to learn so that he may not come upon me unawares from somewhere.  In what place does he wander, or rest?  Does he plant his steps within his shelter, or abroad?</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="159">
<milestone unit="anapests"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Well, here you see his home with its two portals,<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>his rocky cell.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>And its wretched occupant, where is he gone to?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>It seems clear to me, anyway, that he is plowing his way along somewhere near here in search of food.  For I know of a report that<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>this is his means of sustenance&mdash;a wretch wretchedly shooting prey with his feathered shafts&mdash;and that no one comes near to him to heal his misery.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="169">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="2"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>For my part, I pity him when I think how,<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>with no one to care for him, and seeing no companion's face, but suffering eternally alone, he is plagued by fierce disease and bewildered by each need as it arises.<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>How, how does he endure his bitter fate?  Ah, contrivances of the gods!  Ah, unhappy tribes of mortals, whose life-portion exceeds due measure!</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="180">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="2"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>That man&mdash;inferior in no way, probably, to any man belonging to the oldest families&mdash;lies alone without companions and stripped of all life's gifts<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>among the dappled or shaggy beasts.  He is a man to be pitied for his torments and his hunger alike, enduring anguish that has no cure.   But to his bitter cries the mountain nymph, babbling Echo, coming from afar,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>gives answer.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="191">
<milestone unit="anapests"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>No part of this is a marvel to me.  God-sent&mdash;if a man such as I may judge&mdash;are both those sufferings which attacked him from savage <placeName key="perseus,Chryse">Chryse</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>and those with which he now toils untended.  Surely he toils by the plan of some god so that he may not bend against <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> the invincible arrows divine, until the time be fulfilled at which, men say,<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>by those arrows <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> is fated to fall.</p></sp></div1>

<p>What is it?</p></sp>

<p>I heard a sudden thud, one that might naturally come from a man worn by pain.  From there it came, I think&mdash;or there.<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>It strikes, strikes hard on my ear, the sure sound of someone creeping along his way as if tortured.   I cannot miss that grievous cry of a man hard-pressed, even from afar&mdash;its tone is too clear.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="210">

<p>To what?  Tell me.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>To my latest thoughts.  For he is not far from his home, but nearby.  And not with music of the flute, like a shepherd pasturing his flocks, does he come,&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>no&mdash;but crying out a far-sounding howl as he stumbles, perhaps, from tortuous pain, or as he scans the haven unvisited by any ship.  His cries are loud, and terrible.</p></sp></div1>

But may they get what they gave me!  Can you imagine, boy, what kind of awakening I had when they had gone, and I rose from sleep that day?&mdash;what stinging tears I wept, and what miseries I bewailed when I saw that the ships with which I had sailed<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>were all gone, and that there was no man in the place, not one to help me, not one to ease the sickness that afflicted me, when looking all around me, I could find nothing at hand, save agony&mdash;but of that a ready store?</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="285">
<sp><p><milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>So time passed for me, season by season, and alone in this narrow house, I had to attend to all my wants by my own resources.  For my stomach's needs this bow provided, bringing down doves on the wing.  And whatever my string-sped arrow might strike,<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>in pain I would crawl to it myself, dragging my wretched foot behind me.  Or, again, if water had to be fetched, or, if when the frost had spread, as often happens in winter, a bit of firewood had to be broken, I would creep out in pain and<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>manage it.  Then fire would be lacking;  but by rubbing stone hard on stone I would at last reveal the hidden spark which preserves me from day to day.  Indeed, a roof over my head and a fire inside provides all that I want&mdash;except release from my disease.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>Come now, son, you must understand what sort of island this is.  No mariner approaches it by choice, since there is no anchorage or port where he can find a gainful market or a kindly host.  This is not a place to which prudent men voyage.  But suppose that some one has put in against his will, for such things may often<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>happen in the long course of a man's life.  These visitors, then, when they come, son, have compassionate words for me, and, perhaps moved by pity, they give me a little food or some clothing.<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>But there is one thing that no one will do, whenever I mention it:  take me home in safety.  No, this is already the tenth year that I am wasted by misery from hunger and suffering, by feeding this gluttonous plague.  This is what the Atreids and the forceful Odysseus have done to me, boy.<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/>May the gods on <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> someday give them agonies as strong in requital for mine!

<p>Dead&mdash;not by a mortal hand, but by a god's.<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line"/>He was brought down, as men say, by the arrow of Phoebus.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
<p>Well, noble alike are the slayer and the slain.  But I am at a loss to know, son, whether I should first inquire into the wrong done you, or mourn the dead.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Your own sorrows, I think, are enough<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/>for you, unhappy man, without mourning for those of your neighbor.</p></sp>

<p>They came for me in a ship elaborately ornamented, shining Odysseus, and he who fostered my father,<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/>and said&mdash;whether truly or falsely, I do not know&mdash;that since my father had perished, fate now forbade that anyone but I should take the towers of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.  Saying that this, my friend, was how things stood, they caused me no long delay before I set sail in haste,<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line"/>chiefly because of my yearning for the dead, that I might look upon him before burial, since I had never seen him.  Then, besides, theirs was a fine promise, if by accompanying them I might sack the towers of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</p>
<p>It was now the second day of my voyage<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>when, sped by breeze and oar, I approached bitter Sigeum.  When I landed, straightaway the entire army thronged around me with greetings, vowing that they saw their lost Achilles once more alive.  He, though, lay ready for burial, and I, unhappy,<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/>when I had wept for him, went before long to the Atreids, to friends, as it was reasonable to suppose,&mdash;and claimed my father's arms and all else that had been his.  O, their reply was bold and shameless!  &lsquo;Seed of Achilles, you may take all else<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/>that was your father's.  But of those arms another man now is lord, the son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>.&rsquo;  The tears came quick to my eyes as I sprang up in passionate anger and said in my bitterness, &lsquo;Madman!  Have you dared give my arms<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>to another man in my place, without asking me?&rsquo;  But Odysseus&mdash;for he chanced to be at hand&mdash;said, &lsquo;Yes, boy, they awarded them as was just, since it was I who saved the arms and their master by my presence at the crucial moment.&rsquo;  Then immediately, in my fury, I began to lash at him with every kind of insult<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>and left not one unsaid, if he was indeed to rob me of my arms.  At this point, stung by the abuse, though not given to anger, he answered,&mdash;&lsquo;You have not gone to where we have;  instead you have been absent from where you were needed.<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>And since your tongue is so arrogant, you will never sail back to Scyros with those arms in your possession.&rsquo; In that way rebuked, in that way insulted, I sail for home, deprived of what is my own by that worst offspring of a wicked line, Odysseus.<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/>And yet I do not blame him as much as I do those in power.  For a city hangs wholly on its leaders, and so does an army, but when men shatter law and order, it is the lessons of their teachers that corrupt them.  My tale is told in full.

<p>It seems that you have come to me, friends, well commended by a grief that matches my own.<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line"/>Your story is in harmony with mine, so that I can recognize the work of the Atreids and of Odysseus.

<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>

<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>He has his own troubles now, since Antilochus,<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>the son that was at his side, left him for Hades.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
<p>Ah, me!  These two, again, whom you have named, are men of whose death I had least wished to hear.  Gods! What are we to look for, when these men have died, but Odysseus here again lives, when<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/>in their place he should have been announced as dead?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>The man is a clever wrestler.  But even clever schemes, Philoctetes, are often blocked.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
<p>Now, by the gods, tell me&mdash;where was Patroclus when you needed him, he whom your father loved beyond all others?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/>He, too, was dead.  And in a brief maxim I would teach you this:  War takes no evil man by choice, but always the good men.</p></sp>

<sp>

<p>I, at least, son of Oetean Poeas, will be on my guard hereafter against <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName><milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>and the Atreids, and look on them only from afar.

With no great company I am homeward bound on my trader's voyage from <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> to Peparethus with its cluster-laden vines, but when I heard that the sailors<milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line"/>were all of your crew, I resolved not to continue my voyage in silence, without first giving you my news and getting the due reward.  You know nothing, I suspect, of your own affairs:  the new designs the Greeks<milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line"/>have regarding you, and not only designs, but deeds in progress and no longer postponed.</p></sp></div1>

<p>I will inform you of all that, since it seems that you have not heard.  There was a seer of noble birth,<milestone ed="p" n="605" unit="line"/>a son of Priam, called Helenus, whom that man, out on a solitary night raid&mdash;that deceitful Odysseus, whose repute is all shame and dishonor&mdash;captured.

And, as soon as he heard the seer prophecy this, <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>' son<milestone ed="p" n="615" unit="line"/>immediately promised that he would bring the man and show him to the Achaeans.  He thought it most likely that he would get him willingly, but, if unwilling, then by force, and he added that, were he to fail in this, whoever wished it might sever his head.<milestone ed="p" n="620" unit="line"/>You have heard everything, boy, and I advise speed for you, and for any man for whom you care.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
<p>Alas!  Has he, the utter plague, sworn to fetch me back to the Achaeans by persuasion?  For if that were to happen, I could be persuaded, when dead, to come back up<milestone ed="p" n="625" unit="line"/>from Hades into the light, as his father did!</p></sp>

<p><milestone ed="p" n="645" unit="line"/>Well, if you are so resolved, let us go, once you have taken from the cave whatever you need or desire most.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
<p>Yes, there are some things that I need, though the choice is not large.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>What is there that will not be available on board my ship?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
<p>I have a store of a certain herb, whereby I can always<milestone ed="p" n="650" unit="line"/>best lull this wound, until it is wholly tamed.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Fetch it, then.  Now, what else do you wish to take?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
<p>Any of these arrows that may have been forgotten, and may have slipped away from me, so that I not leave it for another to take.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Is that indeed the famous bow which you hold?</p></sp>

<p>Is there any way that I might have a closer view of it&mdash;and handle it, and salute it as divine?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
<p>To you alone, my son, this shall be granted, along with anything else in my power that is in your interest.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="660" unit="line"/>I do indeed crave to touch it, but my craving takes this form:  if it is lawful, I would be glad.  If not, think no more of it.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
<p>Your words are reverent, son, and your wish is lawful.  For you alone have given to my eyes the light of life and the hope of seeing the land of Oeta, of seeing<milestone ed="p" n="665" unit="line"/>my aged father and my friends;  and you alone, when I lay beneath the feet of my enemies, have lifted me beyond their reach.  Be bold.  The bow shall be yours to handle and to return to the hand that gave it, and you will be able to boast aloud that in reward for your goodness, you alone of mortals have touched it.<milestone ed="p" n="670" unit="line"/>Yes, it was by a good deed that I myself won it.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>I am not sorry that I found you and have gained your friendship, since whoever knows how to render benefit for a benefit received must prove a friend more valuable than any possession.  Please, do go inside.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>

<milestone unit="strophe" n="1"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>I have heard a rumor, but never seen with my eyes, how the man who once approached the bed of Zeus was bound upon a<milestone ed="p" n="680" unit="line"/>swift wheel by the almighty son of Cronus.  But of no other mortal do I know, either by hearsay or by sight, that has encountered a doom so repugnant as this of Philoctetes.  For though he had wronged no one by force or thievery,<milestone ed="p" n="685" unit="line"/>but conducted himself fairly towards the fair, he was left to perish so undeservedly.  I truly marvel how&mdash;how in the world&mdash;as he listened in solitude to the breakers rushing around him,<milestone ed="p" n="690" unit="line"/>he kept his hold upon a life so full of grief.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="691">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="1"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Here, he alone was his own neighbor, powerless to walk, with no one in the land to be his companion while he suffered&mdash;no one to whom he could cry out a lament that would be answered<milestone ed="p" n="695" unit="line"/>for the plague that gnawed his flesh and drained his blood&mdash;no one to lull with healing herbs gathered from the nourishing earth the burning blood which oozed from the ulcers of his<milestone ed="p" n="700" unit="line"/>envenomed foot, whenever the torment attacked him.  Instead he would then creep this way or that, stumbling like a child without his kind nurse, to any place from where his needs<milestone ed="p" n="705" unit="line"/>might be supplied, whenever the devouring anguish withdrew.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="707">

<p>For food he did not gather the fruit of holy Earth, nor anything else that we mortals feed on by our labor,<milestone ed="p" n="710" unit="line"/>except when on occasion he obtained food to ease his hunger by means of feathered shafts from his swift-striking bow.  Ah, joyless was his life, who for ten years never knew the delight of wine,<milestone ed="p" n="715" unit="line"/>but ever directed his path towards any stagnant pool that he could find as he gazed around him.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="718">

<p>But now, after those troubles, he will attain happiness and heartiness in the end<milestone ed="p" n="720" unit="line"/>because of his meeting with this son of a noble race, who after the fullness of many months carries him aboard our sea-crossing hull to his ancestral home,<milestone ed="p" n="725" unit="line"/>the haunt of Malian nymphs, and to the banks of the Spercheius in that very land where, above Oeta's heights, the hero of the brazen shield approached the gods, illuminated by his father's divine fire.</p></sp></div1>

<p>No, no.  But take this bow of mine&mdash;as you earlier asked of me&mdash;and keep it in your care and safe<milestone ed="p" n="765" unit="line"/>until this present bout with my disease is past.  For indeed sleep takes me as soon as this pain passes away, nor can it cease before then.   But you must allow me to sleep in peace.  And if<milestone ed="p" n="770" unit="line"/>those men come in the meantime, then by the gods I forbid you willingly or unwillingly, or by any skilled trickery, to give up this bow to them, lest you bring destruction at once on yourself and on me, who am your suppliant.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Have no fears as to my caution.  The bow shall pass<milestone ed="p" n="775" unit="line"/>into no hands but yours and mine.  Give it to me, and may good luck accompany it!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
<p>There, take it boy.  And humble yourself before the jealous gods, so that the bow may not prove baneful for you, as it did for me and for him who owned it before me.</p></sp>

<p>O my arms, what shames you suffer for lack of your cherished<milestone ed="p" n="1005" unit="line"/>bow, now that you are made that man's bound quarry!  And you, who cannot think one healthy or one noble thought, how stealthily you have once more ambushed and trapped me, taking this boy for your screen, because he was a stranger to me.  He is too good for your company, but worthy of mine,<milestone ed="p" n="1010" unit="line"/>since he had no thought but to execute his orders, and he already shows remorse for his own errors and for the wrongs done me.  But your corrupt mind, always on the lookout from some position of ambush, trained him well&mdash;unsuited and unwilling though he was&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="1015" unit="line"/>to be cunning in evil.  And now, wretch, for me you plan bonds and passage from the very shore on which you had me flung away, friendless, abandoned, citiless, a corpse in the eyes of the living.  Ah!  Hades take you!  Indeed I have often so prayed for you.<milestone ed="p" n="1020" unit="line"/>But, because the gods grant me nothing that is sweet, you remain alive and you laugh, while I live miserably among countless sufferings, mocked by you and by the sons of Atreus, the two generals whom you serve on this errand.<milestone ed="p" n="1025" unit="line"/>And yet you sailed with them only when brought under their yoke by trickery and compulsion.  But me, when, to my utter ruin, I sailed of my own accord as their mate with seven ships, me they cast out of ship and honor, as you claim, while they say that it was your doing.  And now, why would you take me?  Why have me led away?  For what purpose?<milestone ed="p" n="1030" unit="line"/>I am nothing, and, as far as you were concerned, I have long been dead.  You creature abhorred by the gods, how is it that you no longer find me crippled and foul-smelling?  How, if I sail with you, can you burn sacrifices to the gods, or make libations any more?  That was your pretext for casting me away in the first place.<milestone ed="p" n="1035" unit="line"/>A cruel death for you!&mdash;and die you shall for your unjust treatment of me, if the gods care for justice.  But I know that they do care for it, since you would never have made this voyage for one so miserable, unless some god-sent goad had driven you after me.<milestone ed="p" n="1040" unit="line"/>O, fatherland, and you watchful gods, bring your vengeance, bring your vengeance on them all after so long, if at all you pity me!  Yes, my life merits pity.  Yet if I were to see those men overthrown, I would believe that I had escaped my plague.</p></sp></div1>

<p>I will not.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
<p>Alas!  Why did you take from me the chance to kill my hated enemy with my bow?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>It would have been honorable neither for me, nor for you.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1305" unit="line"/>Well, you may be sure of one thing, at least:  the army's chiefs, the lying heralds of the Greeks, though bold with words, are cowards in the fight.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Neoptolemus</speaker>
<p>Good;  the bow is yours, and you have no cause for anger or complaint against me.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Philoctetes</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1310" unit="line"/>Agreed.  You have revealed the true stock, my son, from which you spring.  You are no child of Sisyphus, but of Achilles, whose fame was the fairest when he was among the living, as it is now with the dead.</p></sp></div1>

<p>I delight at your praise of my father,<milestone ed="p" n="1315" unit="line"/>and of myself.  But hear what I desire to gain from you.  It is true that men are compelled to bear the fortunes given by the gods;  but when they cling to self-inflicted miseries, as you do,<milestone ed="p" n="1320" unit="line"/>no one can justly excuse or pity them.  You have become savage:  you welcome no counsellor, and if someone admonishes you, even if he speaks in all good will, you detest him and consider him an enemy who wishes you ill.  All the same I will speak to you, calling Zeus who guards oaths to witness.<milestone ed="p" n="1325" unit="line"/>And you remember these words and write them in your heart:  you suffer this plague's affliction in accordance with god-sent fate, because you came near to <placeName key="perseus,Chryse">Chryse</placeName>'s guardian, the serpent who secretly watches over her home and guards her roofless sanctuary.  Know also that you will never gain relief from this grave sickness,<milestone ed="p" n="1330" unit="line"/>as long as the sun still rises in the east and sets in the west, until of your own free will you come to the plains of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,  find there the sons of Asclepius, our comrades,  be relieved of this infection,  and, with this bow's<milestone ed="p" n="1335" unit="line"/>aid and mine, be hailed as the sacker of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s towers.  How I know these things are so ordained, I will tell you.  We have a Trojan prisoner, Helenus, foremost among seers, who says plainly that all this must come to pass, and further,<milestone ed="p" n="1340" unit="line"/>that this very summer must see the complete capture of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.  Otherwise he willingly gives himself over for execution, if these prophecies of his prove false.  Therefore, now that you understand everything, give way graciously.  It is a glorious addition to your gain to be singled out<milestone ed="p" n="1345" unit="line"/>as best of the Greeks&mdash;first, for coming into healing hands, and then for taking <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> rich in tears, and so winning a matchless renown.</p></sp></div1>

<p>Hateful life, why, why do you keep me in the light of day, instead of letting me go to Hades' domain?<milestone ed="p" n="1350" unit="line"/>Ah, me, what shall I do?  How can I ignore this man's words, when he has advised me with good will?  But shall I yield, then?  How, after doing that, shall I, ill-fated, come into men's sight?  Whom will I be able to talk to?  You orbs that have watched my every suffering,<milestone ed="p" n="1355" unit="line"/>how could you endure to see me consorting with the sons of Atreus, who caused my ruin, or with the accursed son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>?  It is not my resentment for what has already been done that stings me, rather it is the many troubles which I seem to foresee I must suffer at the hands of<milestone ed="p" n="1360" unit="line"/>these men in the future.  For when the mind of men has once mothered wrongdoing, it trains those men to be wrongdoers in all else thereafter.  And in you, too, I wonder at this.  You should never yourself revisit <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and should prevent me from going there, seeing that those men have done you outrage<milestone ed="p" n="1365" unit="line"/>by stripping you of your father's arms &lsqb;when, in the suit for the weapons, they judged unhappy Ajax inferior to Odysseus&rsqb;.  After that, will you go to fight at their side, and compel me to do the same?  No, do not do it, son, but, as you swore to me, escort me home.  You yourself remain in Scyros, and leave those evil men to their evil doom.<milestone ed="p" n="1370" unit="line"/>So shall you win double thanks from me, as from your father, and you will not appear through your service to bad men to be like them in your nature.</p></sp>

<p>Your recommendation is reasonable, but nevertheless, I wish that you would put your trust in the gods and in my words,<milestone ed="p" n="1375" unit="line"/>and sail from this land with me, your friend.</p></sp>

<p>Not yet, not until you have heard my commands,<milestone ed="p" n="1410" unit="line"/>son of Poeas.  Know that your ears perceive the voice of Heracles, and that you look upon his face.  For your sake I have left my divine seat and come<milestone ed="p" n="1415" unit="line"/>to reveal to you the purposes of Zeus, and to halt the journey on which you are departing.  Hearken to my words.</p>
<p>First I would tell you of my own fortunes&mdash;how, by toiling through and enduring so many toils to the end, I have won the glory of deathlessness, as you witness.<milestone ed="p" n="1420" unit="line"/>And for you, be sure, this fate is ordained, that through these toils of yours you will make your life far-famed.  You shall go with this man to the Trojan city, where, first, you shall be healed of your cruel sickness,<milestone ed="p" n="1425" unit="line"/>and then, chosen out as foremost among the warriors in prowess, with my bow you shall sever <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName>, the author of these evils, from life.

And whatever spoils you receive from that army, from them carry to my pyre a thank-offering for my bow.  And these counsels hold for you also, son of Achilles,<milestone ed="p" n="1435" unit="line"/>for you have not the might to subdue the Trojan realm without him, nor he without you.  Rather, like twin lions with the same quarry, each of you must guard the other's life.  For the healing of your sickness, I will send Asclepius to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, since it is doomed to fall a second time<milestone ed="p" n="1440" unit="line"/>before my arrows.  But of this be mindful, when you plunder the land&mdash;that you show reverence towards the gods.
