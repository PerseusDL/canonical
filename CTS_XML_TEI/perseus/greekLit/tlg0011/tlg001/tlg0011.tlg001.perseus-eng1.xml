<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>There is a saying among men, put forth long ago, that you cannot judge a mortal's life and know whether it is good or bad until he dies.  But well I know, even before I have passed away to Hades' domain, that my life is ill-fortuned and heavy.<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>For I, while still dwelling in the house of my father Oeneus at <placeName key="perseus,Pleuron">Pleuron</placeName>, had such fear of marriage as never any woman of <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName> had.  For my suitor was a river-god, Achelous,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>who in three shapes was always asking me from my father&mdash;coming now as a bull in visible form, now as a serpent, sheeny and coiled, now ox-faced with human trunk, while from his thick-shaded beard wellheads of fountain-water sprayed.<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>In the expectation that such a suitor would get me, I was always praying in my misery that I might die, before I should ever approach that marriage-bed.</p>
<p>But at last, to my joy, the glorious son of Zeus and Alcmena came and<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>closed with him in combat and delivered me.  The manner of their fighting I cannot clearly recount.  I know it not, but if there be anyone who watched that sight without trembling, he might give an account of it.  But I, as I sat there, was struck with terror,<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>lest my beauty should win me sorrow in the end.  But Zeus, Arbiter of Contests, accomplished a good ending&mdash;if indeed it was good.  For since being joined with Heracles as his chosen bride, I nourish one fear after another in my anxiety for him.  One night brings distress,<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>and the next night, in turn, drives it out.  Children, furthermore, were born to us, whom at the time he looked at only as the farmer looks at a distant field, visiting it only once to sow seed and once to reap.  Such was the manner of his life, ever sending him<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>to and from our home in servitude to some master.</p>
<p>But now, when he has risen above those trials&mdash;now it is that my fear is keenest.  For ever since he slew the mighty Iphitus, we have been dwelling here in <placeName key="perseus,Trachis">Trachis</placeName>, refugees<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>in the home of a foreign host.  But where Heracles is, no one knows.  I only know that he is gone, and has caused me sharp pain for him.  I am almost sure that he has come to some suffering.  The interval has not been brief;  rather, he is unheard from ten months already,<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>plus another five.  Yes, there has been some terrible misfortune.  That tablet which he left with me before departing suggests it to me.  I often pray to the gods that I did not receive it to my misfortune.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="49">
<sp>
<speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Deianeira, my mistress, many are the times already that I have<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>observed you mourning the departure of Heracles with great weeping and lamentation.  But now&mdash;if it is proper to school the free-born with the doctrines of a slave, and if I am obliged to point out what you should do&mdash;how is it that you so abound in sons, yet<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>you do not send one of them to seek your husband, especially Hyllus?  It would be appropriate to send him, if he cared for his father's sake that he be deemed to fare well.  Here he is now, dashing to the house in timely stride.  So if in your eyes I speak in season,<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>you can use both my counsel and the man.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="61">
<stage>Enter Hyllus.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>My child, my son, wise words fall, it seems, from humble lips.  For this woman is a slave, but her advice is worthy of the free.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>What sort of advice, Mother?  Tell me, if I may be told.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>It brings shame, she says, that you have not sought to learn of your father and where he is, when he has been abroad for so long.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>But I know where, if one can put any trust in rumors.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>And in what region, my child, do you hear that he has settled?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Last year, they say, through all its length,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>he toiled as a slave to a Lydian woman.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>If he endured even that, then one might believe any and all rumors.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Well, he has been released from that service, as I hear.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>Where, then, is he reported to be now&mdash;alive, or dead?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>He is waging or yet planning a war,<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>they say, upon <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, the realm of Eurytus.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>Are you aware, my son, that he has left with me sure oracles concerning that land?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>What are they, mother?  I do not know the oracles you mean.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="79">
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>They read that either he shall meet the end of his life,<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>or, after taking on this contest, he shall thereafter, at least, enjoy a happy life for its duration.  And so, my child, when his fate is thus trembling in the balance, will you not go to assist him?  For we are saved,<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>if he finds safety, or we perish along with him.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>I will go, Mother.  Had I known the substance of these prophecies, I would have long been at his side.  As it was, my father's usual good fortune did not allow me to fear for him, nor to be overly anxious.<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>Now that I have the knowledge, I will spare no pains to learn the whole truth in this matter.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>Go, then, my son.  For prosperity yields advantage even for him who learns of it late.<stage>Exeunt Hyllus, on one side, and the Nurse into the house.</stage></p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="94">
<milestone unit="choral"/>
<milestone unit="strophe" n="1"/>
<stage>Enter the Chorus on the other side.</stage><sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>You, to whom Night gives birth when she is vanquished and despoiled of her starry crown,<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>and whom, as you blaze, she lays to rest, I pray you, O Sun, Sun, tell me, where is Alcmena's son, where dwells her child?  O Shining god with your bright flash,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>is he on the straits of the sea, or does he lean upon the twin continents?  Speak, you who surpass all in sight!</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="103">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="1"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker><p>For with longing heart, as I hear, Deianeira, the battle-prize, now,<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>like some mournful bird, never rests her eyes' longing that they might be without tears, but nourishing a well-remembered fear for her husband's travels she is constantly afflicted<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>by her anxious, widowed marriage-bed and in her misery anticipates misfortune.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="112">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="2"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>For just as one may see billow after billow<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>advancing and passing over the wide deep before the tireless south-wind, or the north, so the great toil of his life, stormy as the Cretan sea, now whirls back the heir of Cadmus, now exalts him.  But some god always<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>keeps him unerring from the house of Hades.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="122">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="2"/>
<stage>To Deianeira.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>With respect I reproach you for your weeping, but still I will speak in dissent.<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>You must not, I say, wear away fair hope.  Remember that the all-accomplishing king, the son of Cronus, does not appoint a painless lot for mortals.  Sorrow and joy revolve to all, as the stars of the Bear<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>move in their circling paths.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="132">
<milestone unit="epode"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Starry night does not remain constant with men, nor does tribulation, nor wealth;  in a moment it is gone from us, and to another in his turn come both<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>gladness and bereavement.  So I urge even you, our Queen, to keep these matters firmly in your outlook.  You must, for who has<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>known Zeus to be so without care for his children?</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="141">
<milestone unit="episode"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>You have heard of my trouble, I would guess, and that has brought you here.  But the anguish which consumes my heart&mdash;may you never come to know it through your own experience!&mdash;to that now you are total strangers.  Yes, a young life grows in those sheltered regions<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>of its own, and the Sun-god's heat disturbs it not, nor rain, nor any wind.  Rather it takes up a toilless existence amidst pleasure, until such time as she is called &ldquo;wife&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;maiden&rdquo;, and takes her portion of anxious thoughts in the night,<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>fearing for husband or for children.  At that point a woman could understand the burden of my misfortunes by recalling her own experience.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I have had many a trouble to weep for, but I am going to speak of one that none of the previous could equal.<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>When lord Heracles was setting out from home on his last journey, he left in the house an ancient tablet, inscribed with signs which he had never before brought himself to explain to me when going out on one of his many labors.<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>He had always departed as if to conquer, not to die.  But now, as if he were a doomed man, he told me what I should take for my marriage portion, and what share of their father's land he wished divided for his children.  And he fixed the time for the division, saying that, when he had been gone<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>from our land for a year and three months, he was fated either to die at that time, or by escaping the end of the period to live thereafter an untroubled life.  That, he explained, was the fate ordained by the gods<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>to be the end of the labors of Heracles just as, he said, the ancient oak at <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> had once told him through the mouths of the two Peleiades.  And it is in the present time that the truth of these prophecies is coming to pass, so that they must be fulfilled.<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>As a result I leap up from sweet sleep in fear, dear maidens, terrified at the possibility that I must remain widowed of the noblest man of all.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="180">
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Hush&mdash;no more ill-omened words!  I see a man approaching who is crowned with garlands as if for joyous news.</p></sp>
<stage>Enter the Messenger.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>Queen Deianeira, I shall be the first messenger to free you from fear.  Know that Alcmena's son lives and triumphs, and from battle brings the first-fruits to the gods of this land.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>What news is this, old man, that you give me?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>That your much-admired husband will soon come to your house, revealed in his victorious might.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>From what citizen or what stranger did you learn these tidings?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>In the meadow, the summer haunt of oxen, Lichas the herald is proclaiming it to many.  From him I heard it,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>and dashed away so that, in all honesty, having been the first to report this news, I might profit in some way by you and win your favor.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>And why is he not here, if he is so successful?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>He does not, my lady, enjoy ease of movement.  The entire Malian populace<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>stands about him in a circle and questions him, and he cannot move forward.  Each person is bent on learning according to his desire, and will not release the man until he has heard his pleasure.  Thus against his wishes, but in keeping with theirs, he is with them.  Yet you will soon see him face to face.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>O Zeus, ruler of the sacred uncut meadow of Oeta, at last, though after much delay, you have given us joy!  Uplift your voices, you women within the house and you beyond our gates, since now we enjoy the brightness of this message, which has risen on us beyond my hope!</p></sp></div1>

<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>Let the brides of tomorrow raise a joyous cry for the house with shouts of triumph at the hearth.  Among them let the yell of the men go up in unison for Apollo of the bright quiver, our defender!  And at the same time,<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>maidens, lift up a paean, cry aloud to his sister, Ortygian Artemis, huntress of deer, goddess with torch in each hand,<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>and to the nymphs her neighbors!</p>
<p>I am uplifted, I will not spurn the flute&mdash;O you master of my heart!  Behold, his ivy stirs me!  Euoe!<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>Quickly it wheels me round in Bacchus's race!  Oh, oh, Paean!  Look, dear lady!  All is taking shape, plain to see, before your gaze.</p></sp></div1>

<sp>
<speaker>Lichas</speaker>
<p>We are happy in our return, and happy in your greeting,<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>lady, in accordance with the deed achieved.  For when a man has fair fortune, it is his right to win good welcome.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>Most welcome man, tell me first what first I would know&mdash;shall I receive Heracles alive?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lichas</speaker>
<p>I certainly left him alive and well,<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>in vigorous health, unburdened by disease.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>Where, tell me&mdash;in his ancestral land, or on barbarian soil?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lichas</speaker>
<p>There is a headland of <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, where to Cenaean Zeus he marks out altars and fruitful ground in tribute.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>In payment of a vow, or at the command of an oracle?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lichas</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>For a vow, made when he was seeking to conquer and plunder the country of these women whom you see before you.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>And these&mdash;who are they, by the gods, and whose daughters?  They deserve pity, unless their misfortune deceives me.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Lichas</speaker>
<p>These are captives whom he<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>selected as choice spoils for himself and for the gods when he sacked the city of Eurytus.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>Was it in fact the war against that city which kept him away so long, beyond all forecast, past all count of days?</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="248">
<sp n="Lichas">
<speaker>Lichas</speaker>
<p>No.  The greater part of the time he was detained in <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName>, no free man, as he declares,<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>but sold into servitude.  No offense should be taken at my tale, lady, when the deed is found to be Zeus' work.  He passed a whole year, as he himself says, a bought slave to the barbarian Omphale.  And so stung was he by the shame of it,<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>that he bound himself by a solemn oath, swearing one day to enslave with wife and child the man who had brought that suffering upon him.  And not in vain did he speak the oath;  but, when he had been purified, he gathered a mercenary army and went against the city<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>of Eurytus.  For, Heracles asserted, that man alone of mortals had a share in causing his suffering.  For when Heracles, a guest-friend of long standing, came to his house and hearth, Eurytus roared against him with insults of ruinous intent,<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>saying that, although Heracles had inevitable shafts in his hands, he fell short of his own sons in the contest of the bow.  Next he shouted that Heracles was a freeman's slave, a broken hulk, and then at a banquet, when his guest was full of wine, he tossed him from his home.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="270">
<sp><p>Furious at this treatment,<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>when afterward Iphitus came to the hill of <placeName key="perseus,Tiryns">Tiryns</placeName> on the track of horses that had strayed, Heracles seized a moment when the man's eyes were one place and his thoughts another, and hurled him from a towering summit.  But in anger at that deed, the king,<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>the father of all, Olympian Zeus, sent him away to be sold, and did not tolerate that this once, he killed a man by guile.  Had he achieved his vengeance openly, Zeus would surely have pardoned him the righteous triumph.<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>For the gods do not love criminal behavior either.</p>
<p>So those men, who gloried in bitter speech, are themselves residents of Hades, all of them, and their city is enslaved.  And the women whom you see, fallen from happiness to misery,<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>are sent here to you.  For that was your husband's command, which I, his faithful servant, perform.  As for the man himself, know that he will come, once he has made pure sacrifice to Zeus of his fathers for the sacking of the city.  After all the good news<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>that has been told, this, indeed, is the sweetest word to hear.

<p>Now, O Queen, your joy is plainly revealed;  part is with you, and of the rest you have foreknowledge.</p></sp>

<p>Yes, how would I not rejoice with dutiful spirit, when I hear of my husband's successful venture?<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>My rejoicing is bound to keep pace with his success.  And yet a prudent mind can see room for fear, lest he who prospers should one day stumble.  For a strange pity came over me, friends, at the sight of these ill-fated exiles,<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>homeless and fatherless in a foreign land.  Though they were once the daughters perhaps of freeborn men, they now live the life of slaves.  O Zeus, god who turns the tide of battle, may I never see you stalking against a child of my line on any occasion;<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>no, if you do some such thing, let it not be while I am still alive!

<p>I heard this man declare, before many witnesses, that it was for the sake of this girl that Heracles overthrew Eurytus and the high towers of <placeName key="perseus,Oechalia">Oechalia</placeName>:  Eros,<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/>alone of the gods, enchanted him into doing those deeds of arms, not the toilsome servitude to Omphale in <placeName key="tgn,7016631">Lydia</placeName>, nor the death to which Iphitus was hurled.  But now the herald has thrust Eros aside and tells a different tale.  Well, when Heracles could not persuade him whose seed produced the child<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/>to give him the girl for his secret concubine, he devised some petty complaint as a pretext, and made war upon her fatherland, in which, as the herald said, that Eurytus ruled.  He killed the king, her father, and<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/>sacked her city.  And now, as you see, he makes his return, sending her to this house not without consideration, lady, and not as if she were to be a slave.  No, do not expect that;  it is not likely, if his heart has been kindled with desire.  On this account, my Queen, I resolved to reveal to you all<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>that I had heard from that man.  Many others were listening to it, as I was, in the public place where the Trachinians were assembled, so they can convict him.

<p>No, I implore you by Zeus whose strikes lightning down along the high glens of Oeta, do not rob me of a true report!  Your words will not fall on the ears of a cruel woman, nor has she yet to learn the fate of humanity,<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>how by our nature we are often inconstant in our pleasures.  He does not use good sense, then, who like a boxer opposes the blows of Eros.  For Eros rules the gods as he pleases, and he rules me as well&mdash;that is certain.  Why not another woman, just like me?<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>And so I am crazed indeed, if I blame my husband because that disease has seized him or because he was seized by this woman, his partner in a thing which is no shame to them, and no wrong to me.  Impossible!  If it was from him that you learned<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>to lie, it was not a noble lesson.  But if you are your own teacher in this, you will be seen as cruel when it is your wish to prove kind.  No, tell me the whole truth, since to a free-born man the name of liar attaches like an ugly stain.<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>If your hope is to escape detection, that cannot come to pass:  many are those whom you told and who will inform me.  And if you are afraid, your fear is mistaken, since it is not learning the truth that would pain me.  But to know it, what is terrible in that?  Has<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>Heracles not all by himself already mated with a multitude of other women?  And never yet has one of them come away with a harsh word or reproach from me, nor shall this girl, even if she should melt in her passion.  Indeed, I felt a profound pity when I saw her because<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line"/>her beauty has destroyed her life, and she, unfortunate one, has against her will devastated her fatherland and enslaved it.</p>
<p>Well, those things must go with the wind.  But as for you, I tell you, be dishonest to others, but always speak the truth to me.</p></sp></div1>

Since I see that you think as mortals should think and not without good judgment, I will tell you the whole truth, and not hide it.<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/>Yes, it is just as this one says.  That terrible longing for the girl long ago shot through Heracles, and for her sake the desolate <placeName key="perseus,Oechalia">Oechalia</placeName>, her father's land, was leveled by his spear.  But he&mdash;I must say what is in his favor&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>he never ordered me to conceal the fact and never denied it.  Instead I, lady, fearing to wound your heart by such news, erred&mdash;if you regard this in any way an error.</p>
<p>Since, however, you now know the whole story,<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line"/>for his sake and for yours equally bear with the woman, and be willing that the gentle words which you spoke about her have been spoken unalterably.

<speaker>Deianeira</speaker>
<p>Dear friends, while our guest is saying his farewell to the captive girls in the house, I have stolen away partly to tell you what these hands have devised,<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line"/>and partly to grieve over my sufferings in your company.</p>
<p>I have received a maiden&mdash;or, I believe, no longer a maiden, but an experienced woman&mdash;into my home, just as a mariner takes on cargo, a merchandise to wreck my peace of mind.  And now we are two, a pair waiting under<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line"/>a single bedspread for one man's embrace.  Such is the reward that Heracles has sent me&mdash;he whom I called true and loyal&mdash;for guarding his home through all that long time.  I do not know how to be angry with him, even though he is infected with this disease.<milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line"/>But, then again, to live with her, sharing the same marriage&mdash;what woman could endure it?  For I see that the flower of her youth is blossoming, while mine is fading.  The eyes of men love to pluck off the bloom of youth, but they turn their steps from the old.<milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line"/>On this account I am afraid lest Heracles, in name my husband, should be the younger woman's man.</p>
<p>But, as I said, anger brings shame to a woman of understanding.  I will tell you, my friends, the way by which I will have deliverance and relief.<milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line"/>I had a gift, an old one given to me by a monster of long ago, and kept it hidden in a bronze urn.  While yet a girl, I took this gift from the shaggy-chested Nessus&mdash;from his lifeblood, as he lay dying.  He is the one who used to carry men<milestone ed="p" n="560" unit="line"/>in his arms for hire across the deep current of the Evenus, using no oar for conveyance, nor ship's sail.  He carried me, too, on his shoulders, when at my father's sending, I first departed with Heracles as his wife.  When I was in midstream,<milestone ed="p" n="565" unit="line"/>he touched me with lewd hands.  I shrieked, and straightaway the son of Zeus turned round and with his hands shot a feathered arrow that whistled right through his chest to the lungs.  As he passed away the monster spoke these few words:  &ldquo;Child of aged Oeneus,<milestone ed="p" n="570" unit="line"/>you will have this benefit from my ferrying, if you obey me, since you were the last whom I carried.  If you gather with your hands the blood clotted round my wound, at the place where the Hydra, <placeName key="perseus,Lerna">Lerna</placeName>'s monstrous growth, imbued the arrow with black gall,<milestone ed="p" n="575" unit="line"/>you will have a charm for the heart of Heracles, so that he will never look upon any woman and love her more than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remembering this charm, my friends&mdash;for, after his death, I had kept it carefully locked up in the house&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="580" unit="line"/>I have imbued this robe with it, applying to it all that he instructed while he lived.  The work is finished.  May deeds of wicked daring always be far from my thoughts and from my knowledge, as I detest the women who attempt them!  But if in any way I may prevail against this girl by love-spells<milestone ed="p" n="585" unit="line"/>and the charms used on Heracles, the means to that end have been devised&mdash;unless I seem to be acting rashly.  If so, I will stop immediately.</p></sp></div1>

But I must tell the story at greater length, so that you may know exactly how this thing was accomplished.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="680" unit="line"/>I neglected no part of the precepts which the savage Centaur gave me when he was hurting from the bitter barb in his side;  they were in my memory, like the graven words which no hand may wash from a tablet of bronze.  Now this was his order to me, and I obeyed it:<milestone ed="p" n="685" unit="line"/>to keep this potion hidden in inmost recesses always away from fire and untouched by the sun's warm ray, until I should apply it, newly spread, where I wished.  So I had done.  And just now, when the moment for action had come, I performed the anointing secretly in the rooms of the house<milestone ed="p" n="690" unit="line"/>with a tuft of soft wool which I had plucked from a sheep of our home-flock;  then I folded up my gift, and laid it, unvisited by sunlight, within its hollow chest, as you saw.  But as I am going back into the house, I see a thing inexplicable by words and beyond the knowledge of the human mind to understand.<milestone ed="p" n="695" unit="line"/>For somehow I happened to have thrown the ball of wool, with which I had been anointing the robe, into the full blaze of the sun's rays.  As it grew warm, it ran all into confusion, and quickly crumbled to powder on the ground, like nothing in appearance so much as<milestone ed="p" n="700" unit="line"/>the morsels left by a saw's teeth when wood is cut.  It lies just so, fallen.  And from the earth, where it lay exposed, clotted foam seethes up, like the rich juice of the blue fruit from the vine of Bacchus when it is poured on the ground.</p>

<sp><p><milestone ed="p" n="705" unit="line"/>And so I am distraught, and I do not know to which side my thoughts should fall.  I only see that I have brought a terrible deed to completion.  For why or in thanks for what should the monster in his death-throes have shown good will to me, because of whom he was dying?   Impossible!  No, he was<milestone ed="p" n="710" unit="line"/>enchanting me in order to destroy the man who had shot him.  And now too late I gain the knowledge of this, when it can no longer help.  Yes, I alone&mdash;unless my outlook prove mistaken&mdash;I, miserable one, shall completely destroy him!  For I know that the arrow which made the wound harmed<milestone ed="p" n="715" unit="line"/>even the god Cheiron, and that it kills all varieties of beasts that it touches.  Since it is this same black venom in the blood that has passed out through the wound of Nessus, must it not kill Heracles also?  To my mind, at least, it must.  Nevertheless, I am resolved that, if he is to be brought down,<milestone ed="p" n="720" unit="line"/>at the same time I too will die along with him in the selfsame fall.  No woman could bear to live with a reputation for evil, if she cares above all that her nature is not evil.

<p>If you need to hear, then I must tell all.<milestone ed="p" n="750" unit="line"/>After sacking the famous city of Eurytus, he went his way with the trophies and choice spoils of victory.  There is a sea-washed headland of <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, Cape Cenaeum, where he marked out altars and a sacred grove to the Zeus of his fathers.<milestone ed="p" n="755" unit="line"/>There I first saw him, to the gratification of my desire.  He was about to make a sacrifice rich in offerings when his own herald, Lichas, came to him from home with your gift, the deadly robe, in his hands.  This he put on as you prescribed<milestone ed="p" n="760" unit="line"/>and then began his offering with twelve bulls, free from blemish, the prime of the spoil;  but altogether he brought a hundred mixed victims to the altar.  At first the miserable wretch prayed with serene soul and rejoiced in his ornate garb.<milestone ed="p" n="765" unit="line"/>But when the blood-fed flame began to blaze from the holy offerings and from the resinous pine, a sweat broke out on his skin and the tunic clung to his sides close-glued at every joint, as if by a craftsman's hand;  there came<milestone ed="p" n="770" unit="line"/>a convulsive, biting pain in his bones;  and then the venom, like that of some deadly, cruel viper, began to devour him.  At that he shouted for the ill-fated Lichas&mdash;who was in no way to blame for your crime&mdash;asking by what plots he had brought that robe.<milestone ed="p" n="775" unit="line"/>But he, unfortunate one, all-unknowing, said that he had brought your gift from you alone, just as it had been sent.  When Heracles heard it, just as a piercing spasm clutched his lungs, he caught him by the foot where the ankle bends in the socket<milestone ed="p" n="780" unit="line"/>and threw him at a surf-beaten rock in the sea, causing the white brain to ooze from his hair, when the crown of his head had been scattered and his blood with it.</p>

<p>Yes, with fierce daring.  You shall hear, and then you will bear me witness.<milestone ed="p" n="900" unit="line"/>When she came alone into the house and saw her son preparing a deep litter in the court, with which to go back and meet his father, she hid herself where none would see. Falling before the altars, she moaned that<milestone ed="p" n="905" unit="line"/>they were left desolate, and whenever she touched any household thing that she, poor lady, had habitually used in the past, her tears would flow.  If, as she roamed hither and thither through the house, she beheld the form of any well-loved servant, she wept in misery at the sight,<milestone ed="p" n="910" unit="line"/>crying aloud upon her own fate, and her childless existence thereafter.</p>
<p>But when she finished this, I saw her suddenly rush into the bedchamber of Heracles.  I hid in the shadows to keep my observation secret and was watching over her<milestone ed="p" n="915" unit="line"/>when I saw her spread coverings on the bedstead of Heracles.  When she had done this, she sprang up on them and sat in the middle of the bed.  Then she broke out in warm streams of tears<milestone ed="p" n="920" unit="line"/>and said:  &ldquo;Ah, my bridal bed and bridal chamber, farewell now and for ever, since you will never more receive me in these covers as his wife.&rdquo;  She says no more, but with a vehement hand she loosens her robe where the brooch of beaten gold<milestone ed="p" n="925" unit="line"/>lies above her breasts and bares all her left side and arm.  Then I run with all my strength, and warn her son of her intent.  But even in the space between my going and our return,<milestone ed="p" n="930" unit="line"/>we find that she has driven a two-edged sword up through her side to the heart.  At that sight, her son gave a great cry.  For he knew, poor boy, that in his anger he had driven her to that action.  He had learned too late from the servants in the house<milestone ed="p" n="935" unit="line"/>that she had acted without knowledge and at the will of the monster.  Then and there the youth in his misery left no cry of grief unmade as he lamented over her, nor as he fell to kiss her lips;  he threw himself at her side, loudly moaning<milestone ed="p" n="940" unit="line"/>that he had rashly attacked her with a false accusation and weeping that he must now live orphaned of both alike, of his father and of her.</p>
<p>Such are the fortunes of this house.  Rash, indeed, is he who reckons on tomorrow, or perchance on days beyond it.<milestone ed="p" n="945" unit="line"/>There is no tomorrow, until today is safely past.<stage>Exit the Nurse.</stage></p></sp></div1>

No, always without complaint I used to pursue my troubles.<milestone ed="p" n="1075" unit="line"/>But now in my misery I have been found a woman, instead of the man I used to be.</p>

<p>Ah, misery!  The ruinous spasm flames again; it shoots through my sides&mdash;I must wrestle once more with that cruel, devouring plague!</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1085" unit="line"/>King Hades, receive me!  Strike me, O fire of Zeus!  Hurl down your thunderbolt, ruler, dash it, Father, upon my head!  Again the pest consumes me, it has blazed up, it has leapt to fury!  O hands, my hands,<milestone ed="p" n="1090" unit="line"/>O shoulders and chest and trusty arms, you are indeed those noted arms which once subdued with your might the dweller in <placeName key="perseus,Nemea">Nemea</placeName>, the scourge of herdsmen, the lion, a creature that no man might approach or confront;  you tamed the Lernaean Hydra,<milestone ed="p" n="1095" unit="line"/>and that monstrous army of beasts with double form, hostile, going on hoofed feet, violent, lawless, of surpassing violence;  you tamed the beast in Erymanthia, and underground the three-headed whelp of Hades, a resistless terror, offspring of the fierce Echidna;  you tamed the dragon<milestone ed="p" n="1100" unit="line"/>that guarded the golden fruit in the farthest places of the earth.  These toils and thousands more have I tasted, and no man has ever erected a trophy of victory over my hands.  But now, with joints unhinged and with flesh torn to shreds, I have become the miserable spoil of an unseen destroyer,<milestone ed="p" n="1105" unit="line"/>&mdash;I, who am called the son of noblest mother, I, who am reputed the seed of Zeus, lord of the starry sky.</p>
<p>But you may be sure of one thing:  though I am nothing, though I cannot move a step, yet she who has done this deed shall feel my heavy hand even so.  Let her but come to me<milestone ed="p" n="1110" unit="line"/>so that she may learn to proclaim this message to all the world, that in my death, as in my life, I punished the guilty!

<p>Father, since your pause permits an answer,<milestone ed="p" n="1115" unit="line"/>hear me, diseased though you are;  I will ask you for no more than is my due.  Give yourself to me in a mood not as harsh as that to which your heart is now stung.  Otherwise you cannot learn in what circumstances you wrongly wish to triumph and wrongly show resentment.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1120" unit="line"/>Stop when you have said what it is you desire.  In this pain of mine I understand none of your many riddles.</p></sp>

<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>I come to tell you of my mother&mdash;her present circumstances and how she erred unknowingly.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>You corrupt thing!  Have you indeed mentioned her name again,<milestone ed="p" n="1125" unit="line"/>the name, &ldquo;Mother, Murderess of Father,&rdquo; in my hearing?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Yes, for her condition is such that my silence shames me.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>No, it does not shame you, when you consider her past crimes.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>You will not say so, at least in view of her deeds today.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>Speak&mdash;but take care that you not be found corrupt.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1130" unit="line"/>I will speak.  She is just now dead, a new murder.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>By whose hand?  Your sinister words give a prophecy of wonder!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>She did it by her own hand, and no other's.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>Ah, no!  Before she died by mine as she deserved!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Even your rage would be deflected, if you would learn the whole of it.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1135" unit="line"/>Your tale begins strangely, but tell me what you mean.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>The sum is this:  she did wrong, but with a good intent.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>Did she do a good deed, corrupt traitor, when she killed your father?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>No, her plan was to apply a love-charm for your heart, when she saw your new marriage inside the house, but she missed her aim.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1140" unit="line"/>And what Trachinian is so potent a charmer?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Nessus the Centaur persuaded her long ago to inflame your desire with such a potion.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="1143">

<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>Ah!  Ah, misery!  I am lost, ruined, ruined!  The light of day exists for me no more!<milestone ed="p" n="1145" unit="line"/>Ah, now I understand the depth of my misfortune!  Go, my son!  Your father is no more.  Summon for me all the crop of your brothers.  Summon, too, poor Alcmena, in vain the bedfellow of Zeus, so that<milestone ed="p" n="1150" unit="line"/>you may hear my final words tell what oracles I know.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>I cannot.  Your mother is not here.  It happens that she keeps her home at <placeName key="perseus,Tiryns">Tiryns</placeName> by the sea.  Some of your children she has taken to raise with her there, and others, you will find, are dwelling in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>.<milestone ed="p" n="1155" unit="line"/>But we who are with you, Father, will render at your command all service that is needed.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="1157">
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>Hear, then, your task.  You have come to where you will reveal what sort of man you are, who are called my son.</p>
<p>It was foreshown to me by my father far in the past that I would<milestone ed="p" n="1160" unit="line"/>perish by no creature that had the breath of life, but by one already dead, a dweller with Hades.  So this savage Centaur in death has killed me alive, just as the divine will had been foretold.  And I will show you how<milestone ed="p" n="1165" unit="line"/>later oracles tally with the first and testify to the old prophecy.  I wrote them down for myself from the mouth of my father's oak of many tongues in the grove of the Selli, who dwell on the hills and sleep on the ground.  The tree said that, at the time which lives and now is,<milestone ed="p" n="1170" unit="line"/>my release from the toils laid upon me would be accomplished.  And I expected prosperous days, but the meaning, it seems, was only that I would die.  For toil comes no more to the dead.  Since, then, my son, those words are clearly finding their fulfillment,<milestone ed="p" n="1175" unit="line"/>you, on your part, must fight on my behalf.  You must not delay, and so sharpen my tongue, but give your consent to work with me, like one who has discovered that best of laws, the law of obedience to your father.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="1179">
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Yes, Father&mdash;though in coming to this point in our talk<milestone ed="p" n="1180" unit="line"/>I begin to have some fear&mdash;I will obey you in all your decrees.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>First of all, put your right hand in mine.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>With what purpose in mind do you so strongly urge this pledge on me?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>Give your hand at once&mdash;do not disobey me!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Here, I hold it out to you.  Nothing will be denied you.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1185" unit="line"/>Now, swear by the head of Zeus my begetter!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>To do what deed?  May this also be revealed?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>To perform for me the task that I shall impose.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>I swear it with Zeus for witness of the oath.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>And pray that, if you break this oath, you may suffer.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1190" unit="line"/>I shall not suffer, since I will keep it.  Yet so I pray.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>Good, then do you know the summit of Oeta, Zeus's sacred mountain?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>I know it.  I have often stood on that height to sacrifice.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>Then, you must carry my body there after raising it up in your own hands, aided by as many of our friends as you require;<milestone ed="p" n="1195" unit="line"/>and when you have cut many a branch from the deep-rooted oak and chopped down many a sturdy wild-olive, you must lay my body on them and with a flaming pine-torch burn it.</p>
<p>And let no tear of mourning show itself there.<milestone ed="p" n="1200" unit="line"/>No, do this without laments or tears, if you are indeed my son. But if you fail to do this, even from the world below my curse and my wrath shall await you for ever.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="1203">
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Ah, Father, what have you said?  What you have done to me!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>I have spoken that which you must perform.  If you refuse,<milestone ed="p" n="1205" unit="line"/>then get yourself some other father, and be called my son no longer!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Ah, me!  What deeds you call on me to do, Father&mdash;that I should become your murderer, polluted with your blood!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>Not so, in truth, but healer of my sufferings, sole physician of my pain!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1210" unit="line"/>And how, by inflaming your body, shall I heal it?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>If your fear keeps you from this one task, at least perform the rest.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>The service of carrying you will not be refused.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>And the heaping of the pyre which I have ordered?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Yes, except that I will not touch fire to it with my own hands.<milestone ed="p" n="1215" unit="line"/>All else will I do, and you will have no hindrance on my part.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>Well, that much will be enough&mdash;yet add one small favor to your large benefits.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Even if it is tremendously large, it will be done.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>Do you know, then, the maiden, daughter of Eurytus?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1220" unit="line"/>You mean Iole, I would guess.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="1221">
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>You know her.  Just this is the command that I impose upon you, my son:  when I am dead, if you wish to show your piety by remembrance of your oath to your father, make this woman your wife and do not disobey your father.<milestone ed="p" n="1225" unit="line"/>Let no other but you take her who has lain close at my side.  You, my son, make that marriage-bond your own.  Obey;  for although you were obedient in great affairs, your disobedience in small ones cancels the gratitude already won.</p></sp></div1>

<p><milestone ed="p" n="1230" unit="line"/>Ah, me, it is wrong to be angry with a sick man, but who could bear to see him have thoughts like these?</p></sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Who on earth would, when she alone is to blame for my mother's death, and for your present condition besides?<milestone ed="p" n="1235" unit="line"/>Who would choose to do so, unless he were infected by avenging fiends?  It would be better, Father, that I also die, rather than live united with those whom I most detest!</p></sp>

<p>The man will render no due respect, it seems, to my dying prayer.  No, be sure that the curse of the gods<milestone ed="p" n="1240" unit="line"/>will await you for disobeying my commands.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Ah, you will soon show, it seems, how diseased you are!</p></sp>

<p>Yes, for you stir me from my slumbering plague.</p></sp>

<p>I am miserable!  I have no way out of so many dilemmas!</p></sp>

<p>It is not unholy, if you gladden my heart.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Do you, then, command me to do this as a clear duty?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>I do, and I call on the gods to bear me witness!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hyllus</speaker>
<p>Then I will do it, and not refuse,<milestone ed="p" n="1250" unit="line"/>&mdash;calling upon the gods to witness your deed.  I can never be condemned for obeying you, Father.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Heracles</speaker>
<p>Your words make a fair ending, and to them, my son, quickly add the gracious deed itself, so that you may place me on the pyre before any pain returns to tear or sting me.<milestone ed="p" n="1255" unit="line"/>Come, make haste and lift me!  This, in truth, is rest from troubles, this is the end, the last end, of Heracles!</p></sp>
