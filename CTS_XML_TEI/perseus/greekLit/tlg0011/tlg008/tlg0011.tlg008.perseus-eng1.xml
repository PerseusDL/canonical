<div type="introduction">
<p>The <title>Tracking Satyrs</title> is a substantial fragment of a satyr play by Sophocles, discovered at <placeName key="tgn,7001267">Oxyrhynchus</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> in <date value="1907">1907</date>.  We have some 400 lines of a play that was probably about 800 lines long.  The plot is the same as that of the <bibl n="HH 4"><title>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</title></bibl>:  Apollo's cows have been stolen, and the culprit turns out to be his newborn brother Hermes.</p>
<p>This translation is adapted from <bibl><title>The Ichneutae of Sophocles</title>, Richard Johnson Walker, London:  1919</bibl>.  Walker established his own text for the fragment, filling in many of the gaps.  I have occasionally adopted his supplements, but have basically translated the text of the first publication of the play, <bibl><title>Oxyrhynchus Papyri 9</title>, no. 1174, ed. Arthur S. Hunt, London:  1912.</bibl>

<stage>The scene is outdoors.  There is a cave upstage center (represented by the skene door).  Enter Apollo, right.<note anchored="yes" resp="aem">There are no stage directions in the texts of Greek plays;  translators normally add them for the convenience of the modern reader.  Apollo could appear on the roof of the skene building, like Athena in <bibl n="Soph. Aj."><title>Ajax</title></bibl>, or could enter in the usual way from the wings.</note></stage>
<sp><speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>I, Apollo, proclaim to all gods and all mortal men<note anchored="yes" resp="aem">This speech is rather fragmentary.  I have followed Walker's heavily-supplemented text.  The main ideas are clear, but the details are missing.</note>:  I shall give a golden basin to whoever can bring back my cattle from far away.  <milestone n="10" unit="line"/>It is quite unpleasant to me that they are gone, all of them:  cows, calves, heifers.  They are all gone, and I look in vain for their tracks, while they wander far from their own mangers.  I never thought that any of the gods or of men, whose lives are like a single day, would dare do such a thing.  Since I found out about this, shocked as I was, I have been seeking them, and I have proclaimed the deed <milestone n="20" unit="line"/>so that no god or mortal men could be unaware of it.  I am beside myself.  I have gone to visit the whole nation of the Locrians, those who inhabit Opus, those in Ozolis, those in Knemis by the Cephisus.  I have gone to <placeName key="tgn,7002678">Aetolia</placeName> and to Acarnanian Argos.  From there I came to the grove of Zeus at <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName>, shaded by leaves of prophecy.  I then hastened to the fruitful plains of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> <milestone n="30" unit="line"/>and the wealthy cities of <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>.  And then I came to <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, to holy <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, but I see my cows nowhere.  <milestone n="2" unit="column"/>Then I came to Dorian Argos and the nearby hill.  From there I came, in one leap, to the Stymphalian Lake and Mount Cyllene, hard to climb.  I speak to the forest:  if any shepherd or any rustic or any charcoal-burner is here, <milestone n="40" unit="line"/>or any saytr from the mountains, child of the river-nymphs, I announce these things to one and all.  Whoever can capture the one who stole the cattle of Apollo Paean, his is the reward that stands  here.
<stage>Enter Silenus, left.<note anchored="yes" resp="aem">Silenus is the father of the satyrs and serves almost as a chorus-leader.</note></stage></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
<p>As soon as I heard you shouting your proclamation, I came as fast as an old man can, because I want to help you out, Phoebus Apollo, <milestone n="50" unit="line"/>and perhaps I can hunt up your cattle.  Then a messenger will announce my golden reward.  I will tell my children to look carefully, if you really do mean to do what you've promised.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Apollo</speaker>
<p>I will indeed;  only confirm your promise.</p></sp>

<p>Oh gods, Fortune and the god who leads in the straight way, grant me success as I race out to seek out the prey, the spoil, and the booty:  the cattle stolen from Phoebus.  If there is anyone who has seen them, or heard about them, he would become my friend by telling me, and he would help me to help lord Phoebus.  But if someone does not tell what he knows, <milestone n="4" unit="column"/>his reward will be the god's disapproval.</p></sp>

<p>What should we do, my friend?  Do we have to get them out?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Semi-chorus A</speaker>
<p>Why?  Do you think they're in here?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Semi-chorus B</speaker>
<p>Definitely.  All the signs say so clearly.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Semi-chorus A</speaker>
<p>Look!  Here's the same hoof mark again.</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Semi-chorus B</speaker>
<p>I don't yet hear their voices clearly.  But these tracks and footprints are obviously those of the cattle.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Semi-chorus A</speaker>
<p>Hey!  As Zeus is my witness, the tracks turn around and go <emph>backward</emph>.  Look at them.  <milestone n="120" unit="line"/>Why is that?  Why would their line wheel around?  The front is turned to the back, and they're all tangled up together.  The cowherd must have been awfully confused.
</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="124">
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
<p>What kind of a way to hunt is that, bent over and leaning down to the ground?  Where are you going?  I don't understand.  You're lying there like a hedgehog fallen on the ground, or an ape sticking his head forward and having a temper tantrum.  What's this?

<p>What are you "ooh-ooh"-ing for?  What are you afraid of?  What do you see?  What frightful thing are you looking at?  Why are you carrying on like bacchantes?  Is there a hawk nearby?  <stage>From offstage, we hear a lyre being tuned.  Since the player is in fact Hermes, it sounds divine, but no mortal has ever heard this instrument before, and the satyrs are terrified.  They abruptly stop squealing.</stage> Do you want to know what it was?  Why are you so quiet, when you were just now babbling away?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Be quiet!</p></sp>

<p>Do what I say!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
<p>No one is helping me with this hunt.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Listen just a moment, will you?  When we went over there we were assaulted by a noise like no one ever heard before.
</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="145">
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
<p>Why are you running away, afraid of a noise?  You wretched beasts, with your filthy bodies all smeared with wax, seeing terrors in every shadow, scared of everything!   You're gutless, and careless, <milestone n="150" unit="line"/>and servile.  You're nothing but body and tongue and voice.  You trust to words and flee from actions.  Worst of animals, how did you ever come to have a father like me?  There are lots of monuments to my courage, when I was young, songs sung at every household's wedding feast.  I was never put to flight, never afraid, and I didn't quiver at noises made by animals up on the mountains.  Instead, I accomplished great things with my spear.  That brilliant spear is now besmirched by you, <milestone n="160" unit="line"/>because some new sound from the shepherds has frightened you, like the babies you are, and you've given up on the golden wealth that Phoebus said he was offering to you, to say nothing of freedom, which he also offered <milestone n="7" unit="column"/>to you and to me.  You've put all that away and gone to sleep.  Unless you get back to work tracking those cows and their cowherd, wherever they are, you'll be making noises of your own for your cowardice.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Father, walk beside me, <milestone n="170" unit="line"/>so you'll know whether I'm really a coward.  If you're here, you'll know first hand, not through rumors.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Silenus</speaker>
<p>I will approach this sound with you, and I will call out and whistle as I'd call a dog.  You, line up three by three, and I will go beside you and get you straightened out again.

<p>Why did you shout and scream?  It's pointless.  And why were you suspicious of me?  Who's holding back in our first task?</p>

You can be reassured about me from now on, and laugh at me if you get some joy or profit from it.

If there <emph>is</emph> any theft here, look for a poor man as your thief;  but this boy's house is hardly poor.  Consider his family, and fit bad deeds to bad men;  it's hardly appropriate to him.  But you are always a child, even though you're a young man and your beard grows on your face like a goat's.  Stop stretching up your smooth bald head for caresses.
