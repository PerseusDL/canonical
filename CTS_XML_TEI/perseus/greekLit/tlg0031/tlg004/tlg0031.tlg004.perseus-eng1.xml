                    <p>
                        In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        The same was in the beginning with God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made
that has been made.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        In him was life, and the life was the light
of men.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't
overcome it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        There came a man, sent from God, whose name was
John.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the
light, that all might believe through him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        He was not the light,
but was sent that he might testify about the light.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        The true
light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and
the world didn't recognize him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        He came to his own, and those
who were his own didn't receive him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        But as many as received
him, to them he gave the right to become God's children, to those who
believe in his name:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        who were born not of blood, nor of the will
of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        The Word
became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of
the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        John testified about him. He cried out, saying, "This was he of whom I
said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.'"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        For
the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came through Jesus
Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son,
who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        This is
John's testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem
to ask him, "Who are you?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        He confessed, and didn't deny, but he confessed, "I am not
the Christ."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        They asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?"

   He said, "I am not."

   "Are you the Prophet?"

   He answered, "No."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        They said therefore to him, "Who are you? Give us an answer
to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        He said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as Isaiah the prophet said."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        They asked him, "Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ,
nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        John answered them, "I baptize in water, but among you stands
one whom you don't know.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        He is the one who comes after me, who
has come to be before me, whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to untie."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John
was baptizing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, "Behold,
the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        This is he
of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for
he was before me.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        I didn't know him, but for this reason I came
baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        John
testified, saying, "I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out
of heaven, and it remained on him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        I didn't recognize him, but
he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, 'On whomever you
will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he
who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        I have seen, and have
testified that this is the Son of God."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his
disciples,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said,
"Behold, the Lamb of God!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        The two disciples heard him speak,
and they followed Jesus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        Jesus turned, and saw them following,
and said to them, "What are you looking for?"

   They said to him, "Rabbi" (which is to say, being interpreted,
Teacher), "where are you staying?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="39"/>
                        He said to them, "Come, and see."

   They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him
that day. It was about the tenth hour.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="40"/>
                        One of the two who heard
John, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="41"/>
                        He
first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him, "We have found the
Messiah!" (which is, being interpreted, Christ).
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="42"/>
                        He brought him
to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, "You are Simon the son of
Jonah. You shall be called Cephas" (which is by interpretation, Peter).
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="43"/>
                        On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee, and
he found Philip. Jesus said to him, "Follow me."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="44"/>
                        Now Philip was
from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="45"/>
                        Philip found
Nathanael, and said to him, "We have found him, of whom Moses in the
law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="46"/>
                        Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out of
Nazareth?"

   Philip said to him, "Come and see."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="47"/>
                        Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him,
"Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="48"/>
                        Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?"

   Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under
the fig tree, I saw you."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="49"/>
                        Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You
are King of Israel!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="50"/>
                        Jesus answered him, "Because I told you, 'I saw you
underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things
than these!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="51"/>
                        He said to him, "Most assuredly, I tell you,
hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending
and descending on the Son of Man."

                    <p>
                        The third day, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus'
mother was there.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to
the marriage.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother said to him,
"They have no wine."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with you
and me? My hour has not yet come."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do
it."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the
Jews' manner of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Jesus said to them, "Fill the water pots with water." They filled
them up to the brim.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        He said to them, "Now draw some out, and
take it to the ruler of the feast." So they took it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        When the
ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn't know
where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the
ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        and said to him,
"Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk
freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until
now!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee,
and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother,
his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep,
and doves, and the changers of money sitting.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        He made a whip of
cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen;
and he poured out the changers' money, and overthrew their tables.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        To those who sold the doves, he said, "Take these things out of

a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="47"/>
                        When he
heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him,
and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at
the point of death.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="48"/>
                        Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you see
signs and wonders, you will in no way believe."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="49"/>
                        The nobleman said to him, "Sir, come down before my child
dies."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="50"/>
                        Jesus said to him, "Go your way. Your son lives." The man
believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="51"/>
                        As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying
"Your child lives!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="52"/>
                        So he inquired of them the hour when he
began to get better. They said therefore to him, "Yesterday at the
seventh hour, the fever left him."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="53"/>
                        So the father knew that it
was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son lives." He
believed, as did his whole house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="54"/>
                        This is again the second sign
that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.

went up to Jerusalem.

                        Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there
is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, "Bethesda," having five porches.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind,

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        for an
angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred
up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water
was made whole of whatever disease he had.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        A certain man was
there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        When Jesus saw
him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he
asked him, "Do you want to be made well?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no one to put me into
the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm coming, another
steps down before me."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Jesus said to him, "Arise, take up your mat, and walk."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and
walked.

   Now it was the Sabbath on that day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        So the Jews said to him
who was cured, "It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        He answered them, "He who made me well, the same said to me,
'Take up your mat, and walk.'"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Then they asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, 'Take

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        But he who was healed didn't know who it was, for Jesus had
withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him,
"Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens
to you."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who
had made him well.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and
sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        But Jesus answered them, "My Father is still working, so I am working,

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to
kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God
his own Father, making himself equal with God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Jesus therefore
answered them, "Most assuredly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of
himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he
does, these the Son also does likewise.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        For the Father has

He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.

                        For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son

                        that all may

                        "Most assuredly I tell you, he who hears my word, and

                        Most assuredly,

of God's voice; and those who hear will live.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        For as the Father
has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in
himself.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because
he is a son of man.

                        They said this

   But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.

                        But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to

                        They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience,

was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle.

                        Jesus, standing up, saw her and said, "Woman, where are your accusers?
Did no one condemn you?"

                        She said, "No one, Lord."

   Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin

                        Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the

                        The Pharisees therefore said to him, "You testify about

                        Jesus answered them, "Even if I testify about myself, my

                        They said therefore to him, "Where is your Father?"

   Jesus answered, "You know neither me, nor my Father. If you knew me,
you would know my Father also."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Jesus spoke these words in the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Jesus said therefore again to them,

Where I go, you can't come."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        The Jews therefore said, "Will he kill himself, that he says,

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        He said to them, "You are from beneath. I am from above. You

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        I said therefore to

                        I have many things to speak and to judge concerning

                        They didn't understand that he spoke to them about the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        Jesus therefore said to them, "When you have lifted up

                        Jesus

                        Jesus answered them, "Most assuredly I tell you, everyone who

                        A bondservant doesn't

                        They answered him, "Our father is Abraham."

   They said to him, "We were not born of sexual immorality. We have

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="42"/>
                        Therefore Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you

                        Jesus

   Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, "Lord, by this

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="40"/>
                        Jesus said to her, "Didn't I tell you that if you believed,

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="41"/>
                        So they took away the stone from the place where the dead

that you listened to me.

                        I know that you always listen to me,

                        When he had said this, he cried
with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"

                        He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with

   Jesus said to them, "Free him, and let him go."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="45"/>
                        Therefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="46"/>
                        But some of them went away to the
Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.

                        The

"What are we doing? For this man does many signs.

                        If we leave

                        But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that

                        nor do you

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="51"/>
                        Now he didn't
say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied
that Jesus would die for the nation,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="52"/>
                        and not for the nation

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="53"/>
                        So from that day forward they
took counsel that they might put him to death.

                        Jesus therefore

with his disciples.

                        Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand. Many went up from

                        Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another, as they

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="57"/>
                        Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had

                        So they made him a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was

                        Mary, therefore,
took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the

with the fragrance of the ointment.

                        Then Judas Iscariot, Simon's

                        "Why

                        Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but
because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what
was put into it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. She has kept

                        For you always have the poor with

                        A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was
there, and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see
Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.

                        But the chief

                        because on

                        On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast.

                        Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is

                        His disciples didn't

                        The multitude therefore that was

                        Pilate answered, "I'm not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world. If my
kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I
wouldn't be delivered to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        Pilate therefore said to him, "Are you a king then?"

   Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this reason I have
been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I
should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my

                        Pilate said to him, "What is truth?"

   When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to
them, "I find no basis for a charge against him.

                        The

                        When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him,

                        He entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, "Where
are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Pilate therefore

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Jesus answered, "You would have no power at all against me,
unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me
to you has greater sin."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews
cried out, saying, "If you release this man, you aren't Caesar's
friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Now it was the

the Jews, "Behold, your King!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        They cried out, "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!"

   The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they
took Jesus and led him away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        He went out, bearing his cross, to
the place called "The Place of a Skull," which is called in Hebrew,
"Golgotha,"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        where they crucified him, and with him two others,

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Pilate wrote a

NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Therefore many of the Jews
read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the
city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        The
chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, "Don't write, 'The

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his
garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the
coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Then they said to one another, "Let's not tear it, but cast
lots for it to decide whose it will be," that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, which says,
"They parted my garments among them.
   For my cloak they cast lots."

   Therefore the soldiers did these things.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        But there were
standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister,
Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        Therefore when
Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he
said to his mother, "Woman, behold your son!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        Then he said to
the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" From that hour, the disciple took
her to his own home.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        After this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished,
that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I am thirsty."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full
of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        When Jesus
therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished." He bowed
his head, and gave up his spirit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        Therefore the Jews, because it was the Preparation Day, so
that the bodies wouldn't remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that
Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that their legs might be
broken, and that they might be taken away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        Therefore the

was crucified with him;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        but when they came to Jesus, and saw
that he was already dead, they didn't break his legs.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        However
one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately
blood and water came out.

                        He who has seen has testified, and

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        For these things happened, that the Scripture might be

                        Again another

                        After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple
of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he
might take away Jesus' body. Pilate gave him permission. He came
therefore and took away his body.

                        Nicodemus, who at first came

                        So they took Jesus' body, and

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Jesus therefore said to
them, "Children, have you anything to eat?"

   They answered him, "No."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat,
and you will find some."

   They cast it therefore, and now they weren't able to draw it in for
the multitude of fish.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved
said to Peter, "It's the Lord!"

   So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat
around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far
from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging the net
full of fish.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire
of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Jesus said to
them, "Bring some of the fish which you have just caught."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great
fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the
net wasn't torn.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Jesus said to them, "Come and eat breakfast."

   None of the disciples dared inquire of him, "Who are you?" knowing
that it was the Lord.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the
fish likewise.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        This is now the third time that Jesus was
revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        So
when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon,
son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?"

   He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you."

   He said to him, "Feed my lambs."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        He said to him again a
second time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?"

   He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you."

   He said to him, "Tend my sheep."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        He said to him the third
time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?"

   Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, "Do you have
affection for me?" He said to him, "Lord, you know everything. You know
that I have affection for you."

   Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Most assuredly I tell
you, when you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you
wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and
another will dress you, and carry you where you don't want to go."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would
glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him, "Follow me."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Then Peter, turning around, saw a disciple following. This
was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved, the one who had also
leaned on Jesus' breast at the supper and asked, "Lord, who is going to
betray You?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, "Lord, what about
this man?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Jesus said to him, "If I desire that he stay until I come,
what is that to you? You follow me."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        This saying therefore went
out among the brothers, that this disciple wouldn't die. Yet Jesus
didn't say to him that he wouldn't die, but, "If I desire that he stay
until I come, what is that to you?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        This is the disciple who
testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his
witness is true.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        There are also many other things which Jesus
did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even the world
itself wouldn't have room for the books that would be written.
