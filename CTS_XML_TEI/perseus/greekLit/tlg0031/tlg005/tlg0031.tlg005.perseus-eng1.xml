                        The first book I wrote, Theophilus, concerned all that Jesus
began both to do and to teach,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        until the day in which he was
received up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to
the apostles whom he had chosen.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        To these he also showed himself
alive after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them over a
period of forty days, and spoke about God's Kingdom.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Being
assembled together with them, he charged them, "Don't depart from
Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from
me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        For John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized
in the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Therefore, when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord,
are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        He said to them, "It isn't for you to know times or seasons
which the Father has set within His own authority.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        But you will
receive power when the Holy Spirit has come on you. You will be
witnesses to me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the
uttermost parts of the earth."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        When he had said these things, as they were looking, he was
taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        While
they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold, two men
stood by them in white clothing,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        who also said, "You men of
Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who was
received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you
saw him going into the sky."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called
Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        When they had come in, they went up into the upper room, where they
were staying; that is Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas,
Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and
Judas the son of James.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        All these with one accord continued
steadfastly in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the
mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        In these days, Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
(and the number of names was about one hundred twenty), and said,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        "Brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be
fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David
concerning Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        For he
was numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness, and
falling headlong, his body burst open, and all his intestines gushed
out.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        It became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in
their language that field was called 'Akeldama,' that is, 'The field of
blood.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        For it is written in the book of Psalms,
'Let his habitation be made desolate,
   Let no one dwell therein,'

   and,
'Let another take his office.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time
that the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        beginning
from the baptism of John, to the day that he was received up from us,
of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        They put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was
surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        They prayed, and said, "You,
Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you
have chosen
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        to take part in this ministry and apostleship from
which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        They
drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered
with the eleven apostles.

                        Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all with one
accord in one place.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Suddenly there came from the sky a sound
like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where
they were sitting.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Tongues like fire appeared and were
distributed to them, and it sat on each one of them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        They were
all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other
languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Now
there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation
under the sky.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        When this sound was heard, the multitude came
together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in
his own language.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        They were all amazed and marveled, saying to
one another, "Behold, aren't all these who speak Galileans?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        How
do we hear, everyone in our own native language?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Parthians,
Medes, Elamites, and people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia,
Pontus, Asia,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the parts of Libya
around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Cretans and Arabians: we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty
works of God!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        They were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying
one to another, "What does this mean?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Others, mocking, said,
"They are filled with new wine."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice,
and spoke out to them, "You men of Judea, and all you who dwell at
Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        For
these aren't drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only the third hour
of the day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        But this is what has been spoken through the prophet
Joel:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        'It will be in the last days, says God,
   I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.
Your sons and your daughters will prophesy.
   Your young men will see visions.
   Your old men will dream dreams.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Yes, and on my servants and on my handmaidens in those days,
   I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        I will show wonders in the the sky above,
   And signs on the earth beneath;
   Blood, and fire, and billows of smoke.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        The sun will be turned into darkness,
   And the moon into blood,
   Before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        It will be, that whoever will call on the name of the Lord
      will be saved.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        "You men of Israel, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a
man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which
God did by him in the midst of you, even as you yourselves know,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        him, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of
God, you have taken by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        whom God raised up, having freed him from the agony of death,
because it was not possible that he should be held by it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        For
David says concerning him,
'I saw the Lord always before my face,
   For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced.
   Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        Because you will not leave my soul in Hades,
   Neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        You made known to me the ways of life.
   You will make me full of gladness with your presence.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        "Brothers, I may tell you freely of the patriarch David, that
he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with
an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh,
he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        he foreseeing
this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was his
soul left in Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        This Jesus God
raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        Being therefore exalted
by the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the
promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see
and hear.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        For David didn't ascend into the heavens, but he says
himself,
'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit by my right hand,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet."'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        "Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that
God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and
said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what shall we
do?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized, everyone of
you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you
will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="39"/>

                        They agreed with him. Summoning the apostles, they beat them

                        They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word

                        Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture,

                        As they went on the way, they came to

                        So the assemblies

                        It happened, as Peter went throughout all those parts, he

                        There he found

                        Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha,
which when translated, means Dorcas. This woman was full of good works

                        It happened in those days that

                        As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing
that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him not to delay
in coming to them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="39"/>
                        Peter got up and went with them. When he had

him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while
she was with them.

                        Peter put them all out, and kneeled down and

eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.

                        He gave her his hand,

                        When the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius
called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who

                        Having explained everything to them,

                        Now on the next day as they were on their

                        He became hungry and desired to eat, but

                        He saw heaven

                        But Peter said, "Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten
anything that is common or unclean."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        A voice came to him again the second time, "What God has

                        and

                        While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to

                        Peter went down to the men, and said, "Behold, I am he whom

                        They said, "Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one

                        On the next day they entered into

                        When it happened that Peter

                        But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up! I myself am also a

                        As he talked with him, he went in and found many gathered

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        He said to them, "You yourselves know how it is an

                        Cornelius said, "Four days ago, I was fasting until this

                        and said, 'Cornelius, your

                        Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is

                        He charged us to preach to the

                        While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit

                        He killed James, the brother of

                        When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he
proceeded to seize Peter also. This was during the days of unleavened

                        When he had captured him, he put him in prison, and
delivered him to four squads of four soldiers each to guard him,
intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.

                        Peter therefore was kept in the prison, but constant prayer was made by

                        The same night when Herod was about
to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with
two chains. Guards in front of the door kept the prison.

                        Behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone

"Stand up quickly!" His chains fell off from his hands.

                        The

                        He

                        When they were

passed on through one street, and immediately the angel departed from
him.

                        When Peter had come to himself, he said, "Now I truly know

of Herod, and from everything the Jewish people were expecting."

                        Thinking about that, he came to the house of Mary, the mother

                        When she recognized Peter's

Peter stood before the gate.

                        They said to her, "You are crazy!" But she insisted that it

                        But he, beckoning to them with his hand to be silent, declared to them
how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, "Tell these

                        When Herod had sought
for him, and didn't find him, he examined the guards, and commanded
that they should be put to death. He went down from Judea to Caesarea,
and stayed there.

                        Now Herod was highly displeased with those of
Tyre and Sidon. They came with one accord to him, and, having made
Blastus, the king's chamberlain, their friend, they asked for peace,
because their country depended on the king's country for food.

                        On an appointed day, Herod dressed himself in royal clothing, sat on

                        The people shouted, "The

                        Immediately an angel of the

                        But the disobedient Jews stirred up and

                        Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord,
who testified to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to
be done by their hands.

                        But the multitude of the city was
divided. Part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles.

                        When some of both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, made a

                        they became
aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        There they preached the gospel.

                        At Lystra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple
from his mother's womb, who never had walked.

                        He was listening

                        said with a loud voice, "Stand upright

                        When the multitude saw
what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language
of Lycaonia, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        They called Barnabas "Jupiter," and Paul "Mercury," because he
was the chief speaker.

                        The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was
in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and
would have made a sacrifice with the multitudes.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        But when the
apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and
sprang into the multitude, crying out,

                        "Men, why are you doing
these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you

                        who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to

fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Even saying these things, they hardly stopped the multitudes
from making a sacrifice to them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        But some Jews from Antioch and
Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned
Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        But as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and
entered into the city. On the next day he went out with Barnabas to
Derbe.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        When they had preached the gospel to that city, and had
made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,

                        When they had appointed elders for
them in every assembly, and had prayed with fasting, they commended
them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        They passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.

                        When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.

                        From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been
committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        When they had arrived, and had gathered the assembly together,
they reported all the things that God had done with them, and that he
had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        They stayed there
with the disciples for a long time.

                        Some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers,
"Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you can't be
saved."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small discord

this question.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        They, being sent on their way by the assembly,
passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of
the Gentiles. They caused great joy to all the brothers.

                        When

with them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up,
saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep
the law of Moses."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see

                        When there had been much discussion, Peter
rose up and said to them, "Brothers, you know that a good while ago God

                        God, who knows the heart,

                        Now therefore why do you tempt God, that you

                        All the multitude kept silence, and they listened to
Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs and wonders God had done among
the Gentiles through them.

                        They wrote these things by their

                        it seemed good

                        For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit,

                        After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let's return now and

                        Paul wanted to have him go out

                        A vision appeared to Paul in the night.

                        On the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a

                        A certain

                        This she did for many days.

   But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit,

                        When they had brought them

                        and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        The multitude rose up together against them, and the

beaten with rods.

                        When they had laid many stripes on them, they
threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely,

                        who, having received such a charge, threw them into the inner

                        But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing
hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the
prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and
everyone's bonds were loosened.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        The jailer, being roused out of
sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to
kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.

                        But
Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, "Don't harm yourself, for we are

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        He called for lights and sprang in, and, fell down trembling

                        and brought them out and said, "Sirs,

                        They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will

                        They spoke the word of the

                        He took them the same hour of the night, and washed their

                        He brought them up into his house, and set food before them,

                        But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants,
saying, "Let those men go."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly,

they now release us secretly? No, most assuredly, but let them come
themselves and bring us out!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates, and

                        and

them to depart from the city.

                        They went out of the prison, and

                        Paul, as was his custom, went in to them, and for three Sabbath

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        explaining and

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas, of

                        But the disobedient Jews gathered some wicked men from the
marketplace, and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar.
Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the
people.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        When they didn't find them, they dragged Jason and
certain brothers before the rulers of the city, crying, "These who have

                        whom Jason has
received. These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that
there is another king, Jesus!"

                        The multitude and the rulers of
the city were troubled when they heard these things.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        When they
had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea.
When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in
that they received the word with all readiness of the mind, examining
the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Many of
them therefore believed; also of the Greek women of honorable estate,
and not a few men.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        But when the Jews of Thessalonica had
knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also,
they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Then the
brothers immediately sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea, and
Silas and Timothy still stayed there.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        But those who escorted
Paul brought him as far as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and
Timothy that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was
provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        So he
reasoned in the synagogue with Jews and the devout persons, and in the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Some of the
Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also encountered him. Some said, "What
does this babbler want to say?"

   Others said, "He seems to be advocating foreign demons," because he
preached Jesus and the resurrection.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        They took hold of him, and brought him to the Areopagus,
saying, "May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by you?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        For you bring certain strange things to our ears. We want to

                        Now all the Athenians
and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else, but
either to tell or to hear some new thing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, and said, "You men

                        For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your

                        neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything,
seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to

                        The times of ignorance
therefore God overlooked. But now he commands that all men everywhere
should repent,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        because he has appointed a day in which he will
judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained;
whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him
from the dead."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
mocked; but others said, "We want to hear you yet again concerning
this."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        Thus Paul went out from among them.

                        But certain men

                        He found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by

                        He

                        But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was
compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        When they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his

                        He departed there, and went into the house of a certain man

                        Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        The Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision,

                        Now a

                        This man had

                        When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the

                        Paul said, "John indeed baptized with the baptism of
repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the one
who would come after him, that is, on Jesus."

                        When they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the

                        When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy

                        But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of
the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the

                        This

word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul,

                        But some of the
itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves to name over those who
had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "We adjure you
by Jesus whom Paul preaches."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        There were seven sons of one

                        The evil spirit answered, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know,

                        The man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on
them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they
fled out of that house naked and wounded.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        This became known to
all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all,
and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Many also of
those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds.

                        Many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books
together and burned them in the sight of all. They counted the price of
them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.

                        Now after these things had ended, Paul determined in the

                        Having sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to

                        About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.

                        For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made
silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen,

                        whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation,

                        You see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost
throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many
people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute, but
also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as
nothing, and her majesty destroyed, whom all Asia and the world
worships."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        When they heard this they were filled with anger, and cried
out, saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"

                        The whole
city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into
the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia,
Paul's companions in travel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        When Paul wanted to enter in to
the people, the disciples didn't allow him.

                        Certain also of the

                        Some therefore cried one thing, and some

why they had come together.

                        They brought Alexander out of the

                        But when
they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of
about two hours cried out, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        When the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, "You
men of Ephesus, what man is there who doesn't know that the city of the
Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great goddess Artemis, and of the
image which fell down from Zeus?

                        Seeing then that these things
can't be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.

                        If therefore Demetrius and the
craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone, the courts are

                        On the first day of the week, when the disciples were

                        A certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window,

                        Coming to

"Thus says the Holy Spirit: 'So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man

                        When we heard these things, both we and they of that place

                        Then Paul answered, "What

                        After these days we took up our baggage and went up to

                        They, when they heard it, glorified God.
They said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        Then Paul took the men, and the next day, purified himself

                        All the city was moved, and the people ran together. They

                        Immediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to

beating Paul.

                        Then the commanding officer came near, arrested

                        Some shouted one thing, and some another,

                        When he came to the stairs, it happened that he was carried

                        As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he asked the

   He said, "Do you know Greek?

                        But Paul said, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a

                        When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the

                        A great clamor arose,

                        He

                        He even tried to

                        The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these
things were so.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        When the governor had beckoned to him to speak,
Paul answered, "Because I know that you have been a judge of this

                        In the temple they didn't find

                        But this I confess to you,

                        They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation, if

                        But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way,
deferred them, saying, "When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes
down, I will decide your case."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        He ordered the centurion that
Paul should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and
not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a
Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ
Jesus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and

for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        He hoped that way that money would be given to him by Paul,
that he might release him. Therefore also he sent for him more often,
and talked with him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        But when two years were fulfilled, Felix
was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the

                        Then the high priest

                        asking a favor against him, that he would send for

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        However
Festus answered that Paul was kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he
himself was about to depart shortly.

                        "Let them therefore," said

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        When he had stayed among them more than ten days, he went
down to Caesarea, and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat, and
commanded Paul to be brought.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        When he had come, the Jews who had
come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        while he said
in his defense, "Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered
Paul and said, "Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of
these things before me?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat,
where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you
also know very well.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For if I have done wrong, and have
committed anything worthy of death, I don't refuse to die; but if none
of those things is true that these accuse me of, no one can give me up
to them. I appeal to Caesar!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council,
answered, "You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice

                        As they stayed there
many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the King, saying, "There is a

                        Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they

                        I, being perplexed how to

and there be judged concerning these matters.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        But when Paul had

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Agrippa said to Festus, "I also would like to hear the man

   "Tomorrow," he said, "you will hear him."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with
great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the
commanding officers and principal men of the city, at the command of
Festus, Paul was brought in.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Festus said, "King Agrippa, and

                        When we had sailed slowly many days, and had come

                        When much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous,

                        Because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        Paul said to the centurion

                        While the day was coming on, Paul begged them all to take

                        Then they all cheered up, and they

                        When it was day,

                        Casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time
untying the rudder ropes. Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they
made for the beach.

                        But coming to a place where two seas met,
they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained immovable, but
the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.

                        The soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that

                        But the centurion,

                        Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to
