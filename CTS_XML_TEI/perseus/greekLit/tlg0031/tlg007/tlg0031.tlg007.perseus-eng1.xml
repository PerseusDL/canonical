                    <p>
                        Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will
of God, and our brother Sosthenes,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        to the assembly of God which
is at Corinth; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be
saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every
place, both theirs and ours:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        I always thank my God concerning you, for the grace of God
which was given you in Christ Jesus;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        that in everything you were
enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        even as the
testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        so that you come behind
in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our
Lord Jesus Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        God is faithful, through whom you were called
into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Now I
beg you, brothers, through the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you
all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but
that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same
judgment.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For it has been reported to me concerning you, my
brothers, by those who are from Chloe's household, that there are
contentions among you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Now I mean this, that each one of you
says, "I follow Paul," "I follow Apollos," "I follow Cephas," and, "I
follow Christ."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you?
Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        I thank God that I
baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        so that no one
should say that I had baptized you into my own name.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        (I also
baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don't know whether
I baptized any other.)
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to
preach the gospel -- not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of
Christ wouldn't be made void.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        For the word of the cross is
foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the
power of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        For it is written,
"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
   I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer
of this world? Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom
didn't know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of
the preaching to save those who believe.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        For Jews ask for signs,
Greeks seek after wisdom,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        but we preach Christ crucified; a
stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        but to those
who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and
the wisdom of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        Because the foolishness of God is wiser than
men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        For you see
your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh,
not many mighty, and not many noble;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        but God chose the foolish
things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God
chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the
things that are strong;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        and God chose the lowly things of the
world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not,
that he might bring to nothing the things that are:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        that no
flesh should boast before God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        But of him, you are in Christ
Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and
sanctification, and redemption:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        that, according as it is
written, "He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord."
                    </p>

                    <milestone unit="verse" n="1"/>
                    <p>
                        When I came to you, brothers, I didn't come with excellence of
speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        For
I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and
him crucified.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much
trembling.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive
words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        that your faith wouldn't stand in the wisdom of men, but in the
power of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full
grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world,
who are coming to nothing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        But we speak God's wisdom in a
mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before
the worlds to our glory,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        which none of the rulers of this world
has known. For had they known it, they wouldn't have crucified the Lord
of glory.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        But as it is written,
"Things which an eye didn't see, and an ear didn't hear,
   Which didn't enter into the heart of man,
These God has prepared for those who love him."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the
Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For who
among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man,
which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God's
Spirit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the
Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were
freely given to us by God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Which things also we speak, not in
words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches,
comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Now the
natural man doesn't receive the things of God's Spirit, for they are
foolishness to him, and he can't know them, because they are
spiritually discerned.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        But he who is spiritual discerns all
things, and he himself is judged by no one.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        "For who has known
the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?" But we have
Christ's mind.

                    <p>
                        Brothers, I couldn't speak to you as to spiritual, but as to
fleshly, as to babies in Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        I fed you with milk, not with
meat; for you weren't yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy,
strife, and factions among you, aren't you fleshly, and don't you walk
in the ways of men?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        For when one says, "I follow Paul," and
another, "I follow Apollos," aren't you fleshly?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Who then is
Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and
each as the Lord gave to him?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        I planted. Apollos watered. But God
gave the increase.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        So then neither he who plants is anything, nor
he who waters, but God who gives the increase.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Now he who plants
and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward
according to his own labor.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        For we are God's fellow workers. You
are God's farming, God's building.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        According to the grace of God
which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation,
and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on
it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has
been laid, which is Jesus Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        But if anyone builds on the
foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        each man's work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it,
because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort
of work each man's work is.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        If any man's work remains which he
built on it, he will receive a reward.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        If any man's work is
burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as
through fire.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Don't you know that you are a temple of God, and that God's
Spirit lives in you?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        If anyone destroys the temple of God, God
will destroy him; for God's temple is holy, which you are.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Let

                        There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The

holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the

distraction.

                        But if any man thinks that he is behaving
inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her

sin. Let them marry.

                        So then both he who gives his own virgin in

                        yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all

                        However, that knowledge

                        For if a man sees
you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple, won't his

idols?

                        But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled

                        For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered,

                        For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head,

                        But if a woman

                        What, don't you have houses to eat and to drink in?
Or do you despise God's assembly, and put them to shame who don't have?
What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don't praise you.

bread.

                        When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "Take,

me."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        In the same way he also took the cup, after supper,

you drink, in memory of me."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        For as often as you eat this bread
and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.

                        Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord's cup in
an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the
Lord.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the

                        For he who eats and drinks in an

we wouldn't be judged.

                        But when we are judged, we are punished

                        Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp,
if they didn't give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known
what is piped or harped?

                        For if the trumpet gave an uncertain

                        So also you, unless
you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be
known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air.

                        There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of
them is without meaning.

                        If then I don't know the meaning of
the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks

                        So also you, since you are zealous
for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the
assembly.

                        Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray
that he may interpret.

                        For if I pray in another language, my
spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.

                        What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will
pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I
will sing with the understanding also.

                        Otherwise if you bless
with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say
the "Amen" at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn't know what you
say?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        For you most assuredly give thanks well, but the other

                        I thank my God, I speak with other

                        However in the assembly I would
rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct
others also, than ten thousand words in another language.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Brothers, don't be children in thoughts, yet in malice be

                        In the law it is written,
"By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak

                        Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who
believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to
the unbelieving, but to those who believe.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        If therefore the

that you are crazy?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        But if all prophesy, and someone

judged by all.

                        And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed.
So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is

                        What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one
of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another
language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each
other up.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        If any man speaks in another language, let it be two,

                        But
if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly, and
let him speak to himself, and to God.

                        Let the prophets speak,

                        But if a revelation

                        For
you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be

                        The spirits of the prophets are subject to the

                        for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.

                        let your wives keep
silent in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to
speak; but let them be in subjection, as the law also says.

                        If
they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home,
for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly.

                        What? Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to
you alone?

                        If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or

are the commandment of the Lord.

                        Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to

                        Yes, we

                        So also is the resurrection of the dead.
It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.

                        It is

                        Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast,
immovable, always abounding in the Lord's work, because you know that
your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

                    <p>
                        Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded
the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        On the first day of
the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no
collections be made when I come.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        When I arrive, I will send
whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to
Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go
with me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        But I will come to you when I have passed through
Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        But with you it
may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my
journey wherever I go.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        For I do not wish to see you now in
passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        for a great
and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for
he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Therefore let no
one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he
may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I begged him much to
come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come
now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!

                        Let all that you do be done in love.

                        Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas,
that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set
themselves to minister to the saints),
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        that you also be in
subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus;
for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        For
they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are
like that.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet
you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their
house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a
holy kiss.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        If
any man doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Come,
Lord!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
