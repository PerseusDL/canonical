                    <p>
                        Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to
those who are called, sanctified by God the Father, and kept for Jesus
Christ:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Beloved, while I was very eager to write to you about our
common salvation, I was constrained to write to you exhorting you to
contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the
saints.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        For there are certain men who crept in secretly, even
those who were long ago written about for this condemnation: ungodly
men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying our
only Master, God, and Lord, Jesus Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Now I desire to remind you, though you already know this, that
the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward
destroyed those who didn't believe.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Angels who didn't keep their
first domain, but deserted their own dwelling place, he has kept in
everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, having,
in the same way as these, given themselves over to sexual immorality
and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering
the punishment of eternal fire.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Yet in like manner these also in
their dreaming defile the flesh, despise authority, and slander
celestial beings.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        But Michael, the archangel, when contending
with the devil and arguing about the body of Moses, dared not bring
against him an abusive condemnation, but said, "May the Lord rebuke
you!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        But these speak evil of whatever things they don't know.
What they understand naturally, like the creatures without reason, in
these things are they destroyed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Woe to them! For they went in
the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and
perished in Korah's rebellion.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        These are hidden rocky reefs in
your love feasts when they feast with you, shepherds who without fear
feed themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn
leaves without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        wild
waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for
whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        About
these also Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold,
the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        to execute
judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of
ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all the hard
things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        These are
murmurers and complainers, walking after their lusts (and their mouth
speaks proud things), showing respect of persons to gain advantage.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        But you, beloved, remember the words which have been spoken
before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        They said to
you that "In the last time there will be mockers, walking after their
own ungodly lusts."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        These are they who cause divisions, and are
sensual, not having the Spirit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        But you, beloved, keep building
up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our
Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        On some have compassion,
making a distinction,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        and some save, snatching them out of the
fire with fear, hating even the clothing stained by the flesh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Now to him who is able to keep them from stumbling, and to
present you faultless before the presence of his glory in great joy,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        to God our Savior, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty,
dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen.
