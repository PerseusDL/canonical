                    <p>
                        Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God,
according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father
and Christ Jesus our Lord.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure
conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night
and day
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be
filled with joy;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that
is in you; which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother
Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift
of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        For God
didn't give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of
me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the gospel according to the
power of God,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not
according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace,
which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        but
has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who
abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the
gospel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For this, I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and
a teacher of the Gentiles.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        For this cause I suffer also these
things.

   Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am
persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him
against that day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me,
in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        That good thing
which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in
us.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me;
of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        May the Lord grant mercy to
the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not
ashamed of my chain,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        but when he was in Rome, he sought me
diligently, and found me
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        (the Lord grant to him to find the
Lord's mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus,
you know very well.

                    <p>
                        You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is
in Christ Jesus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        The things which you have heard from me among
many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to
teach others also.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        You therefore must endure hardship, as a good
soldier of Christ Jesus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        No soldier on service entangles himself
in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a
soldier.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn't crowned
unless he has competed by the rules.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        The farmers who labor must
be the first to get a share of the crops.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Consider what I say,
and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of
David, according to my gospel,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        in which I suffer hardship to the
point of chains as a criminal. But God's word isn't chained.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sake, that they also may
obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        This saying is faithful:
For if we died with him,
   We will also live with him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        If we endure,
   We will also reign with him.
If we deny him,
   He also will deny us.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        If we are faithless,
   He remains faithful. He can't deny himself.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of
the Lord, that they don't argue about words, to no profit, to the
subverting of those who hear.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman
who doesn't need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in
ungodliness,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom
is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        men who have erred concerning the
truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing
the faith of some.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        However God's firm foundation stands, having
this seal, "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let every one who
names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Now in
a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but
also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a
vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master's use,
prepared for every good work.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith,
love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they
generate strife.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        The Lord's servant must not quarrel, but be
gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        in gentleness
correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance
leading to a full knowledge of the truth,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        and they may recover
themselves out of the devil's snare, having been taken captive by him
to his will.

                    <p>
                        But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will
come.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful,
arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without

                        traitors, headstrong,
conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        holding
a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof. Turn away
from these, also.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        For of these are those who creep into houses,
and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by
various lusts,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        always learning, and never able to come to the
knowledge of the truth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,
so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate
concerning the faith.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        But they will proceed no further. For their
folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        But
you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love,
steadfastness,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        persecutions, and sufferings: those things that
happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those
persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Yes, and
all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving
and being deceived.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        But you remain in the things which you have
learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned
them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        From infancy, you have known the sacred writings which are
able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ
Jesus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Every writing inspired by God is profitable for teaching,
for reproof, for correction, and for instruction which is in
righteousness,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly

                        For
the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine,
but, having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after
their own lusts;
