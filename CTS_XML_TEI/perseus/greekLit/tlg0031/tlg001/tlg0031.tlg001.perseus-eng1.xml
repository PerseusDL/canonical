                        So all

David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the
carrying away to Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this; for after his
mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was
found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Joseph, her husband, being a
righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended
to put her away secretly.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        But when he thought about these
things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream,
saying, "Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take to yourself
Mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy
Spirit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        She shall bring forth a son. You shall call his name
Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        "Behold, the virgin shall be with child,
   And shall bring forth a son.
They shall call his name Immanuel;"
   Which is, being interpreted, "God with us."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord
commanded him, and took his wife to himself;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        and didn't know her
sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son. He named him

                    <p>
                        Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,
saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        "Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his
star in the east, and have come to worship him."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        When Herod the
king heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he
asked them where the Christ would be born.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        They said to him, "In
Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written through the prophet,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        'You Bethlehem, land of Judah,
   Are in no way least among the princes of Judah:
For out of you shall come forth a governor,
   Who shall shepherd my people, Israel.'"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them
exactly what time the star appeared.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        He sent them to Bethlehem,
and said, "Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have
found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the
star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and
stood over where the young child was.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        When they saw the star,
they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        They came into the
house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down
and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts:
gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Being warned in a dream that they
shouldn't return to Herod, they went back to their own country another
way.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise and take the young child
and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you,
for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        He arose and took the young child and his mother by night,
and departed into Egypt,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        and was there until the death of Herod;
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the
prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men,
was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children
who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two
years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned
from the wise men.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the
prophet was fulfilled, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        "A voice was heard in Ramah,
   Lamentation, weeping and great mourning,
Rachel weeping for her children;
   She wouldn't be comforted,
   Because they are no more."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        "Arise and take
the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for
those who sought the young child's life are dead."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        He arose and took the young child and his mother, and came
into the land of Israel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        But when he heard that Archelaus was
reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to
go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of
Galilee,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: "He will be
called a Nazarene."

                    <p>
                        In those days, John the Baptizer came, preaching in the
wilderness of Judea, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven
is at hand!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        For this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the
prophet, saying,
"The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
   Make ready the way of the Lord,
   Make his paths straight."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Now John himself wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a
leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea, and all the region
around the Jordan went out to him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        They were baptized by him in
the Jordan, confessing their sins.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        But when he saw many of the
Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, "You
offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Don't
think to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for our father,' for I tell you
that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        "Even now the ax lies at the root of the trees. Therefore,
every tree that doesn't bring forth good fruit is cut down, and cast
into the fire.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but
he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy
to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        His winnowing
fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing
floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will
burn up with unquenchable fire."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be
baptized by him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        But John would have hindered him, saying, "I
need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?"

                        for this is my blood of the new

                        But I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine

                        When they had sung a hymn, they went out to
the Mount of Olives.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble
because of me tonight, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd,
and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        But after I am

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        But Peter answered him, "Even if all will be made to stumble
because of you, I will never be made to stumble."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        Jesus said to him, "Most assuredly I tell you that tonight,
before the cock crows, you will deny me three times."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not
deny you." All of the disciples also said likewise.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and
said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go there and pray."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be
sorrowful and severely troubled.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        Then he said to them, "My soul
is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="39"/>
                        He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed,
saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me;
nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="40"/>
                        He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said
to Peter, "What, couldn't you watch with me for one hour?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="41"/>
                        Watch

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="42"/>
                        Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, "My
Father, if this cup can't pass away from me unless I drink it, your
desire be done."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="43"/>
                        He came again and found them sleeping, for
their eyes were heavy.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="44"/>
                        He left them again, went away, and
prayed a third time, saying the same words.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="45"/>
                        Then he came to his

the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of
sinners.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="46"/>
                        Arise, let's be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="47"/>
                        While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the

from the chief priest and elders of the people.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="48"/>
                        Now he who
betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, "Whoever I kiss, he is the one.

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="49"/>
                        Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, "Hail,

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="50"/>
                        Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they
came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="51"/>
                        Behold, one of
those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword,
and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="52"/>
                        Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place,
for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="53"/>
                        Or do
you think that I couldn't ask my Father, and he would even now send me
more than twelve legions of angels?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="54"/>
                        How then would the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="55"/>
                        In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "Have you come
out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily
in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="56"/>
                        But all this
has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled."

   Then all the disciples left him, and fled.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="57"/>
                        Those who had
taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes
and the elders were gathered together.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="58"/>
                        But Peter followed him
from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and
sat with the officers, to see the end.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="59"/>
                        Now the chief priests,
the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus,
that they might put him to death;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="60"/>
                        and they found none. Even
though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last
two false witnesses came forward,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="61"/>
                        and said, "This man said, 'I
am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.'"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="62"/>
                        The high priest stood up, and said to him, "Have you no

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="63"/>
                        But Jesus
held his peace. The high priest answered him, "I adjure you by the
living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of
God."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="64"/>
                        Jesus said to him, "You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell
you, henceforth you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand
of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="65"/>
                        Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, "He has
spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you
have heard his blasphemy.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="66"/>
                        What do you think?"

   They answered, "He is worthy of death!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="67"/>
                        Then they spit in

                        saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who hit you?"

                        Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came
to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="70"/>
                        But he denied it before them all, saying, "I don't know what
you are talking about."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="71"/>
                        When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him,
and said to those who were there, "This man also was with Jesus of
Nazareth."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="72"/>
                        Again he denied it with an oath, "I don't know the man."

                        After a little while those who stood by came and said to
Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech makes you

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="74"/>
                        Then he began to curse and to swear, "I don't know the man!"

   Immediately the cock crowed.

                        Peter remembered the word which

                        and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to

                        Then Judas, who betrayed him, when

                        saying,

                        He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and

                        The chief priests
took the pieces of silver, and said, "It's not lawful to put them into

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        They took

                        Therefore that field was called "The Field of Blood" to this

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was
fulfilled, saying,
"They took the thirty pieces of silver,

                        Now Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked

                        When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he

                        Then Pilate said to him, "Don't you hear how

                        He gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the

                        Now at the feast the governor was

                        Now

                        Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do to Jesus, who is

                        So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather
that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands

                        "He saved others, but he

Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, 'I am the Son of

                        The robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him
the same reproach.

                        Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
until the ninth hour.

                        About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a
loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" That is, "My God, my
God, why have you forsaken me?"

                        Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said,
"This man is calling Elijah."

                        Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled
it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.

                        The rest said, "Let him be. Let's see whether Elijah comes to save him."

                        Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his
spirit.

                        Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the
top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="52"/>
                        The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen
asleep were raised;

                        and coming out of the tombs after his

                        Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus,
when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared
exceedingly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God."

                        Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed
Jesus from Galilee, serving him.

                        Among them were Mary

                        When evening had come, a rich man from

                        This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body. Then Pilate
commanded the body to be given up.

                        Joseph took the body, and
wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="60"/>
                        and laid it in his own new
tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to
the door of the tomb, and departed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="61"/>
                        Mary Magdalene was there,
and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="62"/>
                        Now on the next
day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and
the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="63"/>
                        saying, "Sir,
we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: 'After
three days I will rise again.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="64"/>
                        Command therefore that the tomb
be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at
night and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He is risen from the
dead;' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="65"/>
                        Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go, make it as
secure as you can."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="66"/>
                        So they went with the guard and made the
tomb secure, sealing the stone.

                        Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day
of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord
descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the
door, and sat on it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        His appearance was like lightning, and his
clothing white as snow.

                        For fear of him, the guards shook, and
became like dead men.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        The angel answered the women, "Don't be
afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the
place where the Lord was lying.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Go quickly and tell his
disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you
into Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy,
and ran to bring his disciples word.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        As they went to tell his
disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!"

   They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid. Go tell my
brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me."

                        Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came
into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had
happened.

                        When they were assembled with the elders, and had
taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,

                        saying, "Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him
away while we slept.

                        If this comes to the governor's ears, we

                        So they took the
