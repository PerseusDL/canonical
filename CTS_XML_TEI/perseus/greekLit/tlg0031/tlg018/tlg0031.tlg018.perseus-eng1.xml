                    <p>
                        Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to
Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the
Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        that the fellowship of
your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing
which is in us in Christ Jesus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        For we have much joy and comfort
in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed
through you, brother.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you
that which is appropriate,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        yet for love's sake I rather beg,
being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus
Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of
in my chains, Onesimus,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        who once was useless to you, but now is
useful to you and to me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        I am sending him back. Therefore
receive him, that is, my own heart,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        whom I desired to keep with
me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the gospel.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your
goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        For
perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would
have him forever,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a
beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in
the flesh and in the Lord.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would
receive me.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you
anything, put that to my account.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        I, Paul, write this with my
own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me
even your own self besides).
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Yes, brother, let me have joy from
you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Having confidence
in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond
what I say.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through
your prayers I will be restored to you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
