                        Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
according to the faith of God's elect, and the knowledge of the truth
which is according to godliness,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        in hope of eternal life, which
God, who can't lie, promised before eternal times;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        but in his own
time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted
according to the commandment of God our Savior;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        to Titus, my true
child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in
order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city,
as I directed you;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        if anyone is blameless, the husband of one
wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or
unruly behavior.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        For the overseer must be blameless, as God's
steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not
violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        but given to hospitality,
as a lover of good, sober-minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that
he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those
who contradict him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For there are also many unruly men, vain
talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching
things which they ought not, for dishonest gain's sake.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        One of
them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil
beasts, and idle gluttons."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        This testimony is true. For this
cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men
who turn away from the truth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        To the pure, all things are pure;
but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both
their mind and their conscience are defiled.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        They profess that
they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable,
disobedient, and unfit for any good work.

                    <p>
                        But say the things which fit sound doctrine,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        that older
men should be temperate, sensible, sober-minded, sound in faith, in
love, and in patience:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        and that older women likewise be reverent
in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that
which is good;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        that they may train the young women to love their
husbands, to love their children,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        to be sober-minded, chaste,
workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that
God's word may not be blasphemed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Likewise, exhort the younger
men to be sober-minded;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        in all things showing yourself an example
of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness,
incorruptibility,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        and soundness of speech that can't be
condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing
to say about us.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own
masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn
the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For the grace of
God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        instructing us
to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would
live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great
God and Savior, Jesus Christ;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        who gave himself for us, that he
might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for
his own possession, zealous for good works.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Say these things and
exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.

                    <p>
                        Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities,
to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        to speak evil of
no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility
toward all men.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        For we were also once foolish, disobedient,
deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and
envy, hateful, and hating one another.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        But when the kindness of
God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        not by works
of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy,
he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the
Holy Spirit,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        which he poured out on us richly, through Jesus
Christ our Savior;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        that, being justified by his grace, we might
be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        This saying
is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm
confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to
maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about
the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Avoid a factious
man after a first and second warning;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        knowing that such a one is
perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come
to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Send
Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing
may be lacking for them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Let our people also learn to maintain
good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in
faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
