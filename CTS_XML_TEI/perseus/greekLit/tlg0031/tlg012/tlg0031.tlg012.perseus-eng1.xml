                    <p>
                        Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and
Timothy our brother,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        to the saints and faithful brothers in
Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the
Lord Jesus Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
praying always for you,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        having heard of your faith in Christ
Jesus, and of the love which you have toward all the saints,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, whereof
you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        which
has come to you; even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit
and increasing, as it does in you also, since the day you heard and
knew the grace of God in truth;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        even as you learned of Epaphras
our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our
behalf,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        For this cause, we also, since the day we heard this, don't cease
praying and making requests for you, that you may be filled with the
knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        that you may walk worthily of the Lord, to please him in all respects,
bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of
God;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        strengthened with all power, according to the might of his
glory, for all endurance and perseverance with joy;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        giving
thanks to the Father, who made us fit to be partakers of the
inheritance of the saints in light;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        who delivered us out of the
power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his
love;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the
forgiveness of our sins;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        who is the image of the invisible God,
the firstborn of all creation.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        For by him were all things
created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things
invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers;
all things have been created through him, and for him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        He is
before all things, and in him all things are held together.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        He
is the head of the body, the assembly, who is the beginning, the
firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the
preeminence.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        and through him to reconcile all things to himself, having made
peace through the blood of his cross. Through him, I say, whether
things on the earth, or things in the heavens.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        You, being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind
in your evil works,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        yet now he has reconciled in the body of his
flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and
blameless before him,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        if it is so that you continue in the
faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the
gospel which you heard, which is being proclaimed in all creation under
heaven; of which I, Paul, was made a servant.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on
my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh
for his body's sake, which is the assembly;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        of which I was made
a servant, according to the stewardship of God which was given me
toward you, to fulfill the word of God,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        the mystery which has
been hidden for ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to
his saints,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        to whom God was pleased to make known what are the
riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ
in you, the hope of glory;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        whom we proclaim, admonishing every
man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man
perfect in Christ Jesus;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        for which I also labor, striving
according to his working, which works in me mightily.

                    <p>
                        For I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you,
and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in
the flesh;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit
together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of
understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, both of the
Father and of Christ,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge hidden.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Now this I say that no one may delude you with
persuasiveness of speech.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        For though I am absent in the flesh,
yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing your order, and
the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        As therefore you
received Christ Jesus, the Lord, walk in him,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        rooted and built up
in him, and established in the faith, even as you were taught,
abounding in it in thanksgiving.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Be careful that you don't let
anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the
tradition of men, after the elements of the world, and not after
Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        For in him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        and in him you are made full, who is the head of all
principality and power;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        in whom you were also circumcised with a
circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the
sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        having been
buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him
through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of
your flesh. He made you alive together with him, having forgiven us all
our trespasses;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        having wiped out the handwriting in ordinances
that was against us, which was contrary to us: and he has taken it out
of the way, nailing it to the cross;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        having stripped the
principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly,
triumphing over them in it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Let no man therefore judge you in eating, or in drinking, or
with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and
worshipping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has not
seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        and not holding
firmly to the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit
together through the joints and ligaments, grows with God's growth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as
though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        "Don't handle, nor taste, nor touch"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        (all of which perish
with use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        Which
things indeed appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, and humility,
and severity to the body; but aren't of any value against the
indulgence of the flesh.

                        If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things
that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are
on the earth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ
in God.

                        When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be
revealed with him in glory.

                        Put to death therefore your members
which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved
passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        for
which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        You also once walked in those, when you lived in them;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        but
now you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and
shameful speaking out of your mouth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Don't lie to one another,
seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        and
have put on the new man, that is being renewed in knowledge after the
image of his Creator,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        where there can't be Greek and Jew,
circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant,
freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Put on therefore, as God's elect, holy and beloved, a heart
of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
