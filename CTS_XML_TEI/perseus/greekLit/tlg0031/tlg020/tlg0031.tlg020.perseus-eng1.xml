                        James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion: Greetings.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Count it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various temptations,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete,
lacking in nothing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask
of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach; and it will be
given to him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for
he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        For let that man not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high
position;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like
the flower in the grass, he will pass away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For the sun arises
with the scorching wind, and withers the grass, and the flower in it
falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes. So also will the rich
man fade away in his pursuits.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has
been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord
promised to those who love him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Let no man say when he is
tempted, "I am tempted by God," for God can't be tempted by evil, and
he himself tempts no one.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        But each one is tempted, when he is
drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Then the lust, when it
has conceived, bears sin; and the sin, when it is full grown, brings
forth death.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Don't be deceived, my beloved brothers.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from
the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, nor turning
shadow.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of
truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to
hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        for the anger of man
doesn't produce the righteousness of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Therefore, putting
away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with
humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own
selves.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he
is like a man beholding his natural face in a mirror;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        for he
sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man
he was.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of
freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who forgets but a doer of
the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he
doesn't bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man's religion
is worthless.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        Pure religion and undefiled before our God and
Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,
and to keep oneself unstained by the world.

                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">

                    <p>
                        My brothers, don't hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of
glory with partiality.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        For if a man with a gold ring, in fine
clothing, comes into your assembly, and a poor man in filthy clothing
also comes in;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        and you pay special attention to him who wears the
fine clothing, and say, "Sit here in a good place;" and you tell the
poor man, "Stand there," or "Sit by my footstool;"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        haven't you
shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil
thoughts?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn't God choose those
who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the
kingdom which he promised to those who love him?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        But you have
dishonored the poor man. Don't the rich oppress you, and personally
drag you before the courts?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Don't they blaspheme the honorable
name by which you are called?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        However, if you fulfill the royal
law, according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as
yourself," you do well.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        But if you show partiality, you commit
sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For whoever
shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he has become
guilty of all.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," said
also, "Do not commit murder." Now if you do not commit adultery, but
murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        So speak, and
so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        For
judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs
over judgment.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but
has no works? Can that faith save him?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        And if a brother or
sister is naked and in lack of daily food,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        and one of you tells
them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled;" and yet you didn't give them
the things the body needs, what good is it?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Even so faith, if it
has no works, is dead in itself.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Yes, a man will say, "You have
faith, and I have works." Show me your faith from your works, and I by
my works will show you my faith.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also
believe, and shudder.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        But do you want to know, vain man, that
faith apart from works is dead?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Wasn't Abraham our father
justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was
perfected;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham
believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness;" and he was
called the friend of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        You see then that by works, a man is
justified, and not only by faith.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        In like manner wasn't Rahab
the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the
messengers, and sent them out another way?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        For as the body apart
from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we
will receive heavier judgment.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        For in many things we all stumble.
If anyone doesn't stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to
bridle the whole body also.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Indeed, we put bits into the horses'
mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Behold, the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce
winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot
desires.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great
things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        And
the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the
tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of
nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        For every kind of animal,
bird, creeping thing, and thing in the sea, is tamed, and has been
tamed by mankind.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        But nobody can tame the tongue. It is a
restless evil, full of deadly poison.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        With it we bless our God
and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My
brothers, these things ought not to be so.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Does a spring send
out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Can a fig
tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields
both salt water and fresh water.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his

                        But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart,
don't boast and don't lie against the truth.

                        This wisdom is not
that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion
and every evil deed.

                        But the wisdom that is from above is first
pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits,
without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Now the fruit of
righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

                        You lust, and

Yet you don't have, because you don't ask.

                        You adulterers and adulteresses, don't you know that
friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants

                        Don't speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks
against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and
judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the
law, but a judge.

                        Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save

                        Whereas
you don't know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your
