                    <p>
                        Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment
of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        As I exhorted you to stay at Ephesus when I was going into
Macedonia, that you might charge certain men not to teach a different
doctrine,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        neither to pay attention to myths and endless
genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God's stewardship, which
is in faith --
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        but the end of the charge is love, out of a pure
heart and a good conscience and unfeigned faith;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        from which
things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand
neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        But
we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        as
knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the
lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy
and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for
manslayers,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for
slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing
contrary to the sound doctrine;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        according to the gospel of the
glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        And I
thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me
faithful, appointing me to service;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        although I was before a
blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy,
because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        The grace of our Lord
abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus
Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were
going to believe in him for eternal life.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Now to the King
eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and
glory forever and ever. Amen.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        This charge I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to
the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may wage the
good warfare;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        holding faith and a good conscience; which some
having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        of
whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they
might be taught not to blaspheme.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">
                    <milestone unit="verse" n="1"/>
                    <p>
                        I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers,
intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        for
kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead a tranquil and
quiet life in all godliness and reverence.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        For this is good and
acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        who desires all people
to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        For there is
one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in its own
times;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am
telling the truth in Christ, not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in
faith and truth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting
up holy hands without wrath and doubting.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        In the same way, that
women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and
propriety; not just with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive
clothing;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        but (which becomes women professing godliness) with
good works.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        But I don't permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority
over a man, but to be in quietness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        For Adam was first formed,
then Eve.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Adam wasn't deceived, but the woman, being deceived,
has fallen into disobedience;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        but she will be saved through her
child-bearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with
sobriety.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">

                    <p>
                        This is a faithful saying: if a man seeks the office of an
overseer, he desires a good work.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        The overseer therefore must be
without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest,
hospitable, good at teaching;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        not a drinker, not violent, not
greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        one
who rules his own house well, having children in subjection with all
reverence;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        (but if a man doesn't know how to rule his own house,
how will he take care of the assembly of God?)
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        not a new convert,
lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside,
to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Deacons, in the same way, must be reverent, not
double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Let them
also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, if they are
blameless.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Their wives in the same way must be reverent, not
slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Let deacons be
husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        For those who have served well as deacons gain to themselves a
good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        but if I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave
themselves in the house of God, which is the assembly of the living
God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Without controversy,
the mystery of godliness is great:
God was revealed in the flesh,
   Justified in the spirit,
   Seen by angels,
   Preached among the nations,
   Believed on in the world,
   And received up in glory.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="4" type="chapter">
                    <milestone unit="verse" n="1"/>
                    <p>
                        But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will
fall away from the faith, paying attention to seducing spirits and
doctrines of demons,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies,
branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        forbidding
marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be
received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected,
if it is received with thanksgiving.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        For it is sanctified through
the word of God and prayer.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        If you instruct the brothers of these
things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in the
words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        But refuse profane and old wives' fables. Exercise yourself
toward godliness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        For bodily exercise has some value, but
godliness has value for all things, having the promise of the life
which is now, and of that which is to come.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        This saying is
faithful and worthy of all acceptance.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For to this end we both
labor and suffer reproach, because we have set our trust in the living
God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Command and teach these things.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Let no man despise your youth; but be an example to those who
believe, in word, in your way of life, in love, in spirit, in faith,
and in purity.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Until I come, pay attention to reading, to
exhortation, and to teaching.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Don't neglect the gift that is in
you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the
hands of the elders.

                        Don't rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father; the
younger men as brothers;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        the elder women as mothers; the younger

                        Honor widows who are widows indeed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn
first to show piety towards their own family, and to repay their
parents, for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Now she who
is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues
in petitions and prayers night and day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        But she who gives herself
to pleasure is dead while she lives.

                        Also command these things,
that they may be without reproach.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        But if anyone doesn't provide
for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith,
and is worse than an unbeliever.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Let no one be enrolled as a
widow under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        being approved by good works, if she has brought up children, if she
has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet,
if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she has diligently followed
every good work.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        But refuse younger widows, for when they have grown wanton
against Christ, they desire to marry;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        having condemnation,
because they have rejected their first pledge.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Besides, they
also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only idle,
but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children,
rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for reviling.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        For already some have turned aside after Satan.

                        If any
man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don't
let the assembly be burdened; that it might relieve those who are
widows indeed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double
honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.

                        For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out
the grain." And, "The laborer is worthy of his wages."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Don't receive an accusation against an elder, except at the
word of two or three witnesses.

                        Those who sin, reprove in the

                        I charge you in
the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that you
observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.

                        Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other
men's sins. Keep yourself pure.

                        Be no longer a drinker of water
only, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent
infirmities.

                        Some men's sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and
some also follow later.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        In the same way also there are good
works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can't be hidden.

                        Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own
masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Those who have believing masters, let them not
despise them, because they are brothers, but rather let them serve
them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and

                        constant

                        For we

                        But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation
and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in
ruin and destruction.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For the love of money is a root of all
kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed,
and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.

                        But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after
