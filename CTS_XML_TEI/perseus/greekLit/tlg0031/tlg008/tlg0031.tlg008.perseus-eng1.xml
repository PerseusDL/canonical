                    <p>
                        Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and
Timothy our brother, to the assembly of God which is at Corinth, with
all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Grace to you and
peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Father of mercies and God of all comfort;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        who comforts us in all
our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any
affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted
by God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our
comfort also abounds through Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        But if we are afflicted, it
is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your
comfort, which works in the patient enduring of the same sufferings
which we also suffer.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Our hope for you is steadfast, knowing
that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the
comfort.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        For we don't desire to have you uninformed, brothers,
concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia, that we were
weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired
even of life.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death
within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who
raises the dead,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        who delivered us out of so great a death, and
does deliver; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still
deliver us;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        you also helping together on our behalf by your
supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many,
thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        For our
boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and
sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we
behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        For we write no other things to you, than what you read or even
acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        as also
you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you
also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        In this confidence,
I was determined to come first to you, that you might have a second
benefit;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from
Macedonia to come to you, and to be sent forward by you on my journey
to Judea.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        When I therefore was thus determined, did I show
fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the
flesh, that with me there should be the "Yes, yes" and the "No, no?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        But as God is faithful, our word toward you was not "Yes and
no."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among
you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not "Yes and no," but in
him is "Yes."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        For however many are the promises of God, in him
is the "Yes." Therefore also through him is the "Amen," to the glory of
God through us.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed
us, is God;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        who also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of
the Spirit in our hearts.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        But I call God for a witness to my
soul, that I didn't come to Corinth to spare you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Not that we
have lordship over your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your
joy. For you stand firm in faith.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">
                    <milestone unit="verse" n="1"/>
                    <p>
                        But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you
again in sorrow.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        For if I make you sorry, then who will make me
glad but he who is made sorry by me?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        And I wrote this very thing
to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn't have sorrow from them of whom
I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be
shared by all of you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        For out of much affliction and anguish of
heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made
sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for
you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to
me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the
many;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and
comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with
his excessive sorrow.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Therefore I beg you to confirm your love
toward him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the
proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Now I also
forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven
anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of
Christ,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we
are not ignorant of his schemes.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a
door was opened to me in the Lord,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        I had no relief for my
spirit, because I didn't find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of
them, I went out into Macedonia.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        But thanks be to God, who
always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet
aroma of his knowledge in every place.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        For we are a sweet aroma
of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet
aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        For
we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity,
but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.

                    <p>
                        Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as
do some, letters of commendation to you or from you?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        You are our
letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        being
revealed that you are a letter of Christ, ministered by us, written not
with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of
stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Such confidence
we have through Christ toward God;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        not that we are sufficient of
ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency
is from God;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        who also made us sufficient as servants of a new
covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills,
but the Spirit gives life.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        But if the service of death, written
engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel
could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his
face; which was passing away:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        won't service of the Spirit be with
much more glory?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        For if the service of condemnation has glory,
the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For
most assuredly that which has been made glorious has not been made
glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasses.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For if that which passes away was with glory, much more that which
remains is in glory.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of
speech,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        and not as Moses, who put a veil on his face, that the
children of Israel wouldn't look steadfastly on the end of that which
was passing away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        But their minds were hardened, for until this
very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains,
because in Christ it passes away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        But to this day, when Moses is
read, a veil lies on their heart.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        But whenever one turns to the
Lord, the veil is taken away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Now the Lord is the Spirit and
where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        But we all,
with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are
transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the
Lord, the Spirit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained
mercy, we don't faint.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        But we have renounced the hidden things of
shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God
deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves
to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Even if our gospel
is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        in whom the god of
this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of
the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        For we don't preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as
Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake;

                        seeing it
is God who said, "Light will shine out of darkness," who has shone in
our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in
the face of Jesus Christ.

                        But we have this treasure in clay vessels, that the exceeding

                        We

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus'

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>

                        But having
the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, "I

we speak;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise

                        while we don't look at the things which

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        For most assuredly in this we groan,

                        if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked.

                        For
indeed we who are in this tent do groan, being burdened; not that we
desire to be unclothed, but that we desire to be clothed, that what is
mortal may be swallowed up by life.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Now he who made us for this

                        Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that,
while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;

                        We are of good courage, I
say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at
home with the Lord.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Therefore also we make it our aim, whether at

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For we must all be

you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance, and not

                        For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God. Or if
we are of sober mind, it is for you.

                        For the love of Christ
constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore
all died.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        He died for all, that those who live should no longer
live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even
though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no
more.

                        Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
The old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new.

                        But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through

                        So we urged Titus, that as he

                        I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving

                        For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he

                        For he indeed accepted our exhortation,
but being himself very earnest, he went out to you of his own accord.

                        We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the

                        Not only so, but who
was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace,
which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our
readiness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us
concerning this abundance which is administered by us.

                        Having

also in the sight of men.

                        We have sent with them our brother,
whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much
more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for
our brothers, they are the apostles of the assemblies, the glory of
Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front
of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf.

                        It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        for I know your readiness, of which I
boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been
prepared for a year past. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may
not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be
prepared,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        so that I won't by any means, if there come with me any

be put to shame in this confident boasting.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        I thought it
necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before
to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised
before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not
of greediness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Remember this: he who sows sparingly will also

                        Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart;
not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always
having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work.

                        For this

                        seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify God

                        Yes, I beg you that

                        For though we walk in the flesh, we don't wage war

                        Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your

                        For though I should boast somewhat abundantly

                        When I was present with you and was in need, I wasn't a burden on

                        Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in
necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For
when I am weak, then am I strong.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        I have become foolish in
boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you,
for in nothing was I behind the very best apostles, though I am
nothing.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in
all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        For what
is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies,
unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this
wrong.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you,
and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but
you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the
parents for the children.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        I will most gladly spend and be spent
for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I
caught you with deception.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Did I take advantage of you by
anyone of them whom I have sent to you?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        I exhorted Titus, and I
sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn't
we walk in the same spirit? Didn't we walk in the same steps?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight
of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your
edifying.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I
might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you
as you don't desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy,
outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts,
riots;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        that again when I come my God would humble me before
you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now,
and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and
lustfulness which they committed.

                    <p>
                        This is the third time I am coming to you. "At the mouth of
two or three witnesses shall every word established."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        I have
said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the
second time, so now, being absent, I write to those who have sinned
before now, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not
spare;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        seeing that you seek a proof of Christ who speaks in me;
who toward you is not weak, but is powerful in you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        For he was
crucified through weakness, yet he lives through the power of God. For
we also are weak in him, but we will live with him through the power of
God toward you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Test your own selves, whether you are in the
faith. Test your own selves. Or don't you know as to your own selves,
that Jesus Christ is in you? -- unless indeed you are disqualified.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        But I hope that you will know that we aren't disqualified.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we may appear
approved, but that you may do that which is honorable, though we are as
reprobate.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the
truth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. And
this we also pray for, even your perfecting.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For this cause I
write these things while absent, that I may not deal sharply when
present, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building
up, and not for tearing down.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Finally, brothers, rejoice. Be perfected, be comforted, be
of the same mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be
with you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Greet one another with a holy kiss.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        All the
saints greet you.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love
of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. Amen.
