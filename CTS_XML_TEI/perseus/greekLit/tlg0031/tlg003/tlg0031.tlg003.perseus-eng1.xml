                    <p>
                        Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative
concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        even as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the
word delivered them to us,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        it seemed good to me also, having
traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to
you in order, most excellent Theophilus;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        that you might know the
certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain
priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a
wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        They
were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the
commandments and ordinances of the Lord.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        But they had no child,
because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in
years.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Now it happened, while he executed the priest's office
before God in the order of his division,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        according to the custom
of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the
Lord and burn incense.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        The whole multitude of the people were
praying outside at the hour of incense.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right
side of the altar of incense.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Zacharias was troubled when he saw
him, and fear fell upon him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        But the angel said to him, "Don't
be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your
wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his
birth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he
will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy
Spirit, even from his mother's womb.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        He will turn many of the
children of Israel to the Lord, their God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        He will go before him
in the spirit and power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers
to the children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to
make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Zacharias said to the angel, "How can I be sure of this? For
I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the
presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good
news.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until
the day that these things will happen, because you didn't believe my
words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that
he delayed in the temple.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        When he came out, he could not speak
to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He
continued making signs to them, and remained mute.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        It happened,
when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid
herself five months, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        "Thus has the Lord done to me in
the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God
to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        to a virgin pledged to be
married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The
virgin's name was Mary.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        Having come in, the angel said to her,
"Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you
among women!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying,
and considered what kind of salutation this might be.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        The angel
said to her, "Don't be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son,
and will call his name 'Jesus.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        He will be great, and will be
called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne
of his father, David,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        and he will reign over the house of Jacob
forever. There will be no end to his kingdom."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, seeing I am a
virgin?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        The angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come on you,
and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the
holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        Behold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son in her old
age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        For everything spoken by God is possible.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        Mary said, "Behold, the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me
according to your word."

   The angel departed from her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="39"/>
                        Mary arose in those days and
went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="40"/>
                        and
entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="41"/>
                        It
happened, when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, that the baby leaped in
her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="42"/>
                        She
called out with a loud voice, and said, "Blessed are you among women,
and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="43"/>
                        Why am I so favored, that
the mother of my Lord should come to me?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="44"/>
                        For behold, when the
voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb
for joy!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="45"/>
                        Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a
fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="46"/>
                        Mary said,
"My soul magnifies the Lord.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="47"/>
                        My spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="48"/>
                        For he has looked at the humble state of his handmaid.
For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="49"/>
                        For he who is mighty has done great things for me.
   Holy is his name.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="50"/>
                        His mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear
      him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="51"/>
                        He has shown strength with his arm.
   He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="52"/>
                        He has put down princes from their thrones.
   And has exalted the lowly.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="53"/>
                        He has filled the hungry with good things.
   He has sent the rich away empty.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="54"/>
                        He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember
      mercy,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="55"/>
                        As he spoke to our fathers,
   To Abraham and his seed forever."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="56"/>
                        Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to
her house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="57"/>
                        Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was
fulfilled, and she brought forth a son.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="58"/>
                        Her neighbors and her
relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and
they rejoiced with her.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="59"/>
                        It happened on the eighth day, that they
came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias,
after the name of the father.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="60"/>
                        His mother answered, "Not so; but
he will be called John."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="61"/>
                        They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who
is called by this name."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="62"/>
                        They made signs to his father, what he
would have him called.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="63"/>
                        He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, "His name is John."

   They all marveled.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="64"/>
                        His mouth was opened immediately, and his
tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="65"/>
                        Fear came on all who
lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout
all the hill country of Judea.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="66"/>
                        All who heard them laid them up
in their heart, saying, "What then will this child be?" The hand of the
Lord was with him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="67"/>
                        His father, Zacharias, was filled with the
Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="68"/>
                        "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
   For he has visited and worked redemption for his people;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="69"/>
                        And has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his
      servant David

                        "The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some

                        Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as

                        Other fell

                        Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one

ears to hear, let him hear!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Then his disciples asked him, "What does this parable mean?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        He said, "To you it is given to know the mysteries of the

see, and hearing they may not understand.'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Now the parable is
this: The seed is the word of God.

                        Those along the road are

                        Those on

these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of
temptation.

                        That which fell among the thorns, these are those
who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares,
riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.

                        That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart,

                        He said to them, "Where is your faith?" Being afraid

                        The apostles,

                        It happened, as they were parting from him, that
Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let's make

                        When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were

                        It happened on the next day, when they had come down from the

                        Behold, a man from the

                        Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries

                        I begged your disciples to cast it

                        Jesus answered, "Faithless and perverse generation, how long

                        While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and
convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and
healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.

                        They were all

   But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he
said to his disciples,

                        Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts,

                        and said to them,
"Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever

                        John answered, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in

                        Jesus said to him, "Don't forbid him, for he who is not

                        When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, "Lord,

                        Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of

seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.

                        Some of us
went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they
didn't see him."

                        He said to them, "Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe
in all that the prophets have spoken!
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        Didn't the Christ have to
suffer these things and to enter into his glory?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        Beginning
from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the
Scriptures the things concerning himself.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        They drew near to the
village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        They urged him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is almost
evening, and the day is almost over."

   He went in to stay with them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        It happened, that when he had
sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks.
Breaking it, he gave to them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="31"/>
                        Their eyes were opened, and they
recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="32"/>
                        They said
one to another, "Weren't our hearts burning within us, while he spoke
to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="33"/>
                        Rising rose up that very hour, they returned to Jerusalem, and found
the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="34"/>
                        saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="35"/>
                        They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was
recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="36"/>
                        As they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them,
and said to them, "Peace be to you."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="37"/>
                        But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed
that they had seen a spirit.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="38"/>
                        He said to them, "Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise
in your hearts?

                        See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me.
Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones, as you see
that I have."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="40"/>
                        When he had said this, he showed them his hands
and his feet.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="41"/>
                        While they still didn't believe for joy, and
wondered, he said to them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="42"/>
                        They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="43"/>
                        He took it, and ate in front of them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="44"/>
                        He said to them,
"This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things
which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms,
concerning me must be fulfilled."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="45"/>
                        Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the
Scriptures.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="46"/>
                        He said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it
was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the
third day,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="47"/>
                        and that repentance and remission of sins should be
preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="48"/>
                        You are witnesses of these things.

                        Behold, I send forth
the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem
until you are clothed with power from on high."

                        He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his
hands, and blessed them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="51"/>
                        It happened, while he blessed them,
that he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.

                        They worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,

                        and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
