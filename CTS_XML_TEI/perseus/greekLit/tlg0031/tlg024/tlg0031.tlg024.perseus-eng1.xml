                    <p>
                        The elder, to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        for the truth's sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and
from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children
walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new
commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one
another.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        This is love, that we should walk according to his
commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the
beginning, that you should walk in it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        For many deceivers have
gone out into the world, those who don't confess that Jesus Christ came
in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Watch yourselves, that we don't lose the things which we have accomplished,
but that we receive a full reward.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Whoever transgresses and
doesn't remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn't have God. He who
remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        If anyone comes to you, and doesn't bring this teaching, don't
receive him into your house, and don't welcome him,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        for he who
welcomes him participates in his evil works.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Having many things to write to you, I don't want to do so
with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to
face, that our joy may be made full.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        The children of your chosen
sister greet you. Amen.
