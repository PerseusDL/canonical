                    <p>
                        God, having in the past spoken to the fathers through the
prophets at many times and in various ways,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all
things, through whom also he made the worlds.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding
all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself made
purification for our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        having become so much better than the angels, as he has
inherited a more excellent name than they have.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        For to which of
the angels did he say at any time, 
"You are my Son,
   Today have I become your father?"

   and again, 
"I will be to him a Father,
   And he will be to me a Son?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Again, when he brings in the firstborn into the world he says,
"Let all the angels of God worship him."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Of the angels he says,
"Who makes his angels winds,
   And his servants a flame of fire."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        but of the Son he says,
"Your throne, O God, is forever and ever;
   The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;
   Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness
      above your fellows."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        And,
"You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the foundation of the earth.
   The heavens are the works of your hands.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        They will perish, but you continue.
   They all will grow old like a garment does.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        As a mantle you will roll them up,
   And they will be changed;
But you are the same.
   Your years will not fail."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        But of which of the angels has he said at any time,
"Sit at my right hand,
   Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Aren't they all ministering spirits, sent out to do service
for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">
                    <milestone unit="verse" n="1"/>
                    <p>
                        Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that
were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        For if the word spoken
through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and
disobedience received a just recompense;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        how will we escape if we
neglect so great a salvation -- which at the first having been spoken
through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        God
also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders, and by
various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to
his own will?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        For he didn't subject the world to come, whereof we
speak, to angels.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        But one has somewhere testified, saying,
"What is man, that you think of him?
   Or the son of man, that you care for him?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        You made him a little lower than the angels;
   You crowned him with glory and honor.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        You have put all things in subjection under his feet."

   For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is
not subject to him. But now we don't see all things subjected to him,
yet.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        But we see him who has been made a little lower than the
angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and
honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are
all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the author of their
salvation perfect through sufferings.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        For both he who sanctifies
and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is
not ashamed to call them brothers,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        saying,
"I will declare your name to my brothers.
   In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        Again, "I will put my trust in him." Again, "Behold, here am
I and the children whom God has given me."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        Since then the
children have shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner
partook of the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him
who had the power of death, that is, the devil,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        and might
deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
subject to bondage.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        For most assuredly, not to angels does he
give help, but he gives help to the seed of Abraham.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        Therefore
he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he
might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining
to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        For in
that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those
who are tempted.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <milestone unit="verse" n="1"/>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling,
consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also was Moses in all his
house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses,
inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is
God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for
a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house; whose house we are, if
we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the
end.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, 
"Today if you will hear his voice,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Don't harden your hearts, as in the provocation,
   Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Where your fathers tested me by proving me,
   And saw my works for forty years.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        Therefore I was displeased with that generation,
   And said, 'They always err in their heart,
   But they didn't know my ways;'
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        As I swore in my wrath,
   'They will not enter into my rest.'"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an
evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        but
exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called "today;" lest
any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        For we
have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our
confidence firm to the end:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        while it is said,
"Today if you will hear his voice,
   Don't harden your hearts, as in the rebellion."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        For who, when they heard, rebelled? No, didn't all those who
came out of
                        <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>
                        by Moses?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        With whom was he displeased forty
years? Wasn't it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the
wilderness?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        To whom did he swear that they wouldn't enter into
his rest, but to those who were disobedient?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        We see that they
were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="4" type="chapter">
                    <milestone unit="verse" n="1"/>
                    <p>
                        Let us fear therefore, lest perhaps a promise being left of
entering into his rest, anyone of you should seem to have come short of
it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they
also did, but the word they heard didn't profit them, because it wasn't
mixed with faith by those who heard.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        For we who have believed do
enter into that rest, even as he has said, "As I swore in my wrath,
they will not enter into my rest;" although the works were finished
from the foundation of the world.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        For he has said this somewhere
about the seventh day, "God rested on the seventh day from all his
works;"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        and in this place again, "They will not enter into my
rest."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter therein,
and they to whom the good news was before preached failed to enter in
because of disobedience,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        he again defines a certain day, today,
saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said),
"Today if you will hear his voice,
   Don't harden your hearts."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken
afterward of another day.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        There remains therefore a Sabbath rest
for the people of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For he who has entered into his rest has
himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Let us

after the same example of disobedience.

                        For the word of God is
living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing
even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and
is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

                        Having then a great high priest, who has passed through
the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold tightly to our
confession.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched
with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points
tempted like we are, yet without sin.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        Let us therefore draw near
with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and
may find grace for help in time of need.

                        For every high priest, being taken from among men, is
appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both
gifts and sacrifices for sins.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        The high priest can deal gently
with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is
also surrounded with weakness.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        Because of this, he must offer
sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.

                        Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like

                        So also Christ didn't glorify himself to be made a
high priest, but it was he who said to him,
"You are my Son.
   Today I have become your father."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        As he says also in another place,

                        He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and

                        though he

                        Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the

                        named by God a high priest after

                        For when by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you again need
to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the
oracles of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.

                        For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of

                        and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance;
seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        For the land which has drunk the rain that comes

                        but if it bears
thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is

                        But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and
things that accompany salvation, even though we speak like this.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of
love which you showed toward his name, in that you served the saints,
and still do serve them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        We desire that each one of you may show
the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        that
you won't be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and
patience inherited the promises.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        For when God made a promise to
Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he swore by himself,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        saying, "Most surely I will bless you, and I will surely

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the
promise.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>

                    <p>
                        For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High,
who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed
him,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being
first, by interpretation, king of righteousness, and then also king of
Salem, which is king of peace;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        without father, without mother,
without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life,
but made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        Now
consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch,
gave a tenth out of the best spoils.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        They indeed of the sons of
Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment to take tithes
of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though
these have come out of the loins of Abraham,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        but he whose
genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes of Abraham, and has
blessed him who has the promises.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        But without any dispute the
less is blessed by the better.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Here people who die receive
tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he
lives.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        So to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes,
has paid tithes,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        for he was yet in the loins of his father when
Melchizedek met him.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Now if there was perfection through the
Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law),
what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order
of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        For
the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also
in the law.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        For he of whom these things are said belongs to
another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah, about which
tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        This is yet
more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there
arises another priest,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        who has been made, not after the law of a
fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        for
it is testified,
"You are a priest forever,
   According to the order of Melchizedek."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because
of its weakness and uselessness
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        (for the law made nothing
perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which
we draw near to God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        Inasmuch as he was not made priest without
the taking of an oath
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        (for they indeed have been made priests
without an oath), but he with an oath by him that says of him,
"The Lord swore and will not change his mind,
   'You are a priest forever,
   According to the order of Melchizedek'".
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        By so much has Jesus become the collateral of a better
covenant.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are
hindered from continuing by death.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        But he, because he lives
forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        Therefore he is also
able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him,
seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        For such a high priest was fitting for us: holy, guiltless,
undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        who doesn't need, like those high priests, to daily offer up
sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the
people. For this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but
the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a Son forever
who has been perfected.

                        For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and
sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have
something to offer.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        For if he were on earth, he would not be a

to the law;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things,
even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the
tabernacle, for he said, "See, you shall make everything according to
the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        But now he
has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the
mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better
promises.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no

                        For finding fault with
them, he said,
"Behold, the days come," says the Lord,

For they didn't continue in my covenant,

                        "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of

   After those days," says the Lord;
"I will put my laws into their mind,

I will be to them a God,
   And they will be to me a people.

                        They will not teach every man his fellow citizen,
   Every man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,'
   For all will know me,

                        In that he says, "A new covenant," he has made the first old.

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        For there was a tabernacle
prepared. In the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the show
bread; which is called the Holy Place.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        After the second veil was
the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        having a
golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all
sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron's
rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        and above it
cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we
can't now speak in detail.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        Now these things having been thus
prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle,
accomplishing the services,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        but into the second the high priest
alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for
himself, and for the errors of the people.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        The Holy Spirit is
indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn't yet revealed
while the first tabernacle was still standing;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        which is a symbol
of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are
incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshipper perfect;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        being only (with meats and drinks and various washings) fleshly
ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good
things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with
hands, that is to say, not of this creation,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        nor yet through the
blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once
for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer
sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of
the flesh:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        how much more will the blood of Christ, who through
the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your
conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        For this
reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred
for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first
covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of
the eternal inheritance.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        For where a last will and testament is,
there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        For a
will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force
while he who made it lives.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        Therefore even the first covenant
has not been dedicated without blood.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        For when every commandment
had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he
took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool
and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has
commanded you."
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of
the ministry in like manner with the blood.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        According to the
law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding
of blood there is no remission.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        It was necessary therefore that
the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these;
but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="24"/>
                        For Christ hasn't entered into holy places made with hands,
which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to
appear in the presence of God for us;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        nor yet that he should
offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year
by year with blood not his own,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        or else he must have suffered
often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the
ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this,
judgment,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the
sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are
eagerly waiting for him for salvation.

                        For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the
very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by
year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Or else wouldn't they have ceased to be offered, because the
worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more
consciousness of sins?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        But in those sacrifices there is yearly
reminder of sins.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        For it is impossible that the blood of bulls
and goats should take away sins.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        Therefore when he comes into
the world, he says,
"Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire,
   But a body did you prepare for me;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you had no

                        Then I said, 'Behold, I have come (In the scroll of the book
      it is written of me)
   To do your will, God.'"
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        Previously saying, "Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt
offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn't desire, neither had
pleasure in them" (those which are offered according to the law),
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        then he has said, "Behold, I have come to do your will." He
takes away the first, that he may establish the second,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        by
which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of
Jesus Christ once for all.

                        Every priest indeed stands day by
day ministering and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never
take away sins,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for
sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        from that
time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are
being sanctified.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for

                        "This is the covenant that I will make with them:
   'After those days,' says the Lord,
'I will put my laws on their heart,

                        Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering

                        Therefore let us also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a
cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily
entangles us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before
us,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for
the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising shame, and
has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        For
consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against
himself, that you don't grow weary, fainting in your souls.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        You
have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        and you
have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with sons,
"My son, don't take lightly the chastening of the Lord,
   Nor faint when you are reproved by him;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        For whom the Lord loves, he chastens,

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        It is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as
with sons, for what son is there whom his father doesn't discipline?
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        But if you are without discipline, whereof all have been made
partakers, then are you illegitimate, and not sons.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        Furthermore,
we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them
respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of
spirits, and live?

                        For they indeed, for a few days, punished us

of his holiness.

                        All chastening seems for the present to be not
joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of
righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby.

                        Follow after peace

                        looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short
of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble

                        lest there be any

                        For you know that even when he

                        For you have not come to a mountain that might be

                        and

                        to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="25"/>
                        See that you don't refuse him who speaks. For if they didn't
escape when they refused him who warned on the Earth, how much more
will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="26"/>
                        whose voice shook the earth, then, but now he has promised,
saying, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="27"/>
                        This phrase, "Yet once more," signifies the removing
of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that
those things which are not shaken may remain.

                        Be free from the love of money, content with such things as
