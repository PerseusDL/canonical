                        Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God,
   to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus

                        Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in
Christ;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the
world, that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        having predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ
to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        to the
praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely bestowed favor on
us in the Beloved,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        in whom we have our redemption through his

                        which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and

                        making known to us the mystery of his will, according

                        to an

Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been
foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after
the counsel of his will;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        to the end that we should be to the
praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        in whom
you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your
salvation, -- in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the
Holy Spirit of promise,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        who is a pledge of our inheritance, to
the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of his glory.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord
Jesus which is among you, and the love which you have toward all the
saints,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        don't cease to give thanks for you, making mention of
you in my prayers,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in
the knowledge of him;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        having the eyes of your hearts
enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and
what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who
believe, according to that working of the strength of his might
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made
him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        far above
all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that
is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="22"/>
                        He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to
be head over all things for the assembly,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        which is his body, the

                    <p>
                        You were made alive when you were dead in transgressions and
sins,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="2"/>
                        in which you once walked according to the course of this
world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, the spirit who
now works in the sons of disobedience;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="3"/>
                        among whom we also all
once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and
of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        But God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he
loved us,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="5"/>
                        even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us
alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="6"/>
                        and
raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly
places in Christ Jesus,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="7"/>
                        that in the ages to come he might show
the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ
Jesus;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="8"/>
                        for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that
not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        not of works, that no
one would boast.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="10"/>
                        For we are his workmanship, created in Christ
Jesus for good works, which God prepared before that we would walk in
them.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="11"/>
                        Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh,
who are called "uncircumcision" by that which is called "circumcision,"
(in the flesh, made by hands);
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="12"/>
                        that you were at that time
separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and
strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without
God in the world.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="13"/>
                        But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far
off are made near in the blood of Christ.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="14"/>
                        For he is our peace,
who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="15"/>
                        having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of commandments
contained in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man of
the two, making peace;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="16"/>
                        and might reconcile them both in one body
to God through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="17"/>
                        He came and preached peace to you who were far off and to those who
were near.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="18"/>
                        For through him we both have our access in one Spirit
to the Father.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="19"/>
                        So then you are no longer strangers and
sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the
household of God,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="20"/>
                        being built on the foundation of the apostles
and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief cornerstone;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="21"/>
                        in whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy temple
in the Lord;

                        how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="4"/>
                        by which, when you read, you can

                        which in
other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now

                        that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and

                        To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to
the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="9"/>
                        and to make all

                        to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God

                        with all

                        being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of

                        There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you also were

                        one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through

                        But to each one of us was the grace given

                        Now this, "He ascended," what is it but that he
also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?

                        He who

                        until we all attain to the unity of the

the wiles of error;

                        but speaking truth in love, we may grow up

                        This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no

                        Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak truth each one with

                        <milestone unit="verse" n="23"/>
                        For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the

                        But
as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their

                        Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the

                        that he might sanctify it,

                        that

wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without
blemish.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="28"/>
                        Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as
their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="29"/>
                        For
no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even
as the Lord also does the assembly;
                        <milestone unit="verse" n="30"/>
                        because we are members of

                        "For this cause a man will

                        This mystery is great, but I speak

                        Nevertheless each of you
must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that
she respects her husband.
