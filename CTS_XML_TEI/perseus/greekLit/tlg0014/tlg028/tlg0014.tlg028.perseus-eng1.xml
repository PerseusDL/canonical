            <div n="1" type="section">
                <p>Of the many outrageous lies which Aphobus uttered in his address to you, I shall
                    try to refute first, that one at which I felt greater indignation than at
                    anything else he said. For he declared that my grandfather was a debtor to the
                    state, and that for this reason my father would not have the property let, for
                    fear of the risks he would run.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The property
                        would be let at a public hearing before the Archon, and its value could not
                        be concealed. If, therefore, the elder Demosthenes, as the heir of Gylon,
                        was indebted to the state, the property might be confiscated to satisfy the
                        debt.</note> This is the pretence he uses; but he brought forward no proof
                    that my grandfather died indebted to the state. He did introduce evidence that
                    he became a state-debtor, but he waited until the last day,<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="true">All documents, citations of statutes, etc., pertaining to
                        the case had to be submitted in written form before the suit was called.
                        They were then sealed in a box (<foreign xml:lang="grc">e)xi=nos</foreign>),
                        which might not be opened until the documents in question were wanted in the
                        trial. By waiting until the last day to file this particular bit of evidence
                        Aphobus prevented Demosthenes from filing any documents to combat it. The
                        latter was therefore “ensnared by lack of time” (<bibl n="Dem. 28.2">Dem.
                            28.2</bibl>).</note> and kept this evidence for his second speech,
                    thinking that by it he would be able to give a malicious turn to the matter. So,
                    if he reads it, give close heed. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
                <p>For you will find that the evidence adduced proves not that my grandfather is a
                    state-debtor, but that he was one. I shall undertake first to refute this charge
                    of which he thinks to make so much, and which we declare to be false. If I had
                    been able to do so, and had not been thus ensnared by lack of time, I should
                    have brought forward witnesses to prove that the money was paid in full, and
                    that everything was settled between my grandfather and the state; as it is, I
                    shall show by strong proofs that he was not indebted at the time of his death,
                    and that we incurred no risks in letting our wealth be known.</p>

            <div n="3" type="section">
                <p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In the first place Demochares, who married my
                    mother's sister, a daughter of Gylon, has not concealed his property, but acts
                    as choregus and as trierarch, and performs other public services, without any
                    fear of such consequences. In the second place, my father voluntarily revealed
                    the rest of his property, and in particular the four talents and three thousand
                    drachmae, which these men by their accusations against one another admit to have
                    been mentioned in the will, and to have been received by them. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
                <p>Furthermore, Aphobus himself in conjunction with his co-trustees revealed to the
                    state the amount of the property left me, when he appointed me leader of the
                    tax-group and that at no low rating, but at one so high as to entail a payment
                    of five hundred drachmae on each twenty-five minae.<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="true">See <bibl n="Dem. 27.7">Dem. 27.7</bibl>, with the
                        notes.</note> And yet, if there were any truth in what he says, he would not
                    have acted thus, but would have taken every precaution. But, as it is,
                    Demochares, and my father, and these men themselves have manifestly let their
                    wealth be known; they plainly feared no such risk as that of which he speaks.

            <div n="5" type="section">
                <p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Strangest of all is it that, though they allege
                    that my father would not permit them to let the property, they should never
                    produce this will from which one could have learned the truth, and that having
                    destroyed so important a piece of evidence, they should expect you to believe
                    them on their mere word. It was their duty on the contrary, as soon as my father
                    died, to call in a number of witnesses and to bid them seal the will, so that,
                    in case any dispute should arise, it would have been possible to refer to the
                    writing itself, and so learn the whole truth. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
                <p>But, as it is, they thought proper to have some other papers sealed, in which
                    many items of the property left were not inscribed—papers which were mere
                    memoranda; but the will itself, which gave them possession of the papers to
                    which they affixed their seals, and all the rest of the property, and which
                    acquitted them of all responsibility for not letting the estate, they did not
                    seal, nor yet produce. You ought presumably to believe them in anything they say
                    about this matter. </p>

                    mean. My father, they say, would not suffer them to let the estate, or to
                    disclose the value of the property. To me, do you mean, or to the state? Quite
                    the contrary: you have plainly disclosed it to the state, but have hidden it
                    absolutely from me. You have not even revealed the fund which was the basis for
                    your assessment in the payment of the property-tax. Show me this fund. What was
                    it? Where did you deliver it over to me, and in whose presence? </p>

                <p>Of the four talents and three thousand drachmae, you received the two talents and

                    my behalf to the public treasury; for at that time they were your property. But
                    the house and the fourteen slaves and the thirty minae which you gave over into
                    my hands, could not have been assessed at any such sum as that which you agreed
                    to pay to the tax-group. </p>

                <p>Nay; it is absolutely certain that the property left by my father was much more
                    than this, and that it is all in your possession. It is because you are plainly
                    proved to have made havoc of it that you have the audacity to make up such
                    falsehoods. Sometimes you refer the responsibility to one another; again you
                    mutually accuse one another of having received funds; you claim to have received

                    any agreement in regard to these matters, but merely heard Demophon read a

                        Thrasylochus, hoping that he might win a decision from the generals, before
                        whom such cases were heard, as to whether or not his claim against his
                        guardians would pass to Thrasylochus together with his visible property.
                        From the oration against Meidias we learn that Meidias and Thrasylochus came
                        jointly to Demosthenes' house, and with great violence forced themselves
                        even into the women's apartments before they were finally ejected.</note>
                    but, failing of this, and being hard pressed for time, rather than be forced to
                    give up my suit, I mortgaged my house and all my property, and paid the cost of
                    the service in question,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The service was the
                        trierarchy, and the cost entailed amounted to twenty minae.</note> being

                    you would not rightly feel indignation against this man and pity for me, seeing
                    that to the estate of more than ten talents which he inherited there has been
                    added my own of such considerable size, while I have not only been defrauded of
                    my inheritance, but am by the rascality of these men being robbed even of what
                    they have now repaid me? To what are we to turn, if you give a different
                    decision regarding them? To the goods mortgaged to our creditors? But they
                    belong to the holders of the mortgage. To what is left after the creditors are
                    paid? But that becomes the property of the defendant, if you condemn me to pay

                    prospects such as these that my father left us. Nay, my sister was to be the

                    ruthless of all men with a dowry of eighty minae, and I as my father's successor

                    our relatives, have felt no compassion. It is to you that we have fled for
                    protection. I beseech you, I implore you by your children, by your wives, by all
                    the good things you possess. So may heaven give you joy of them, do not look
                    upon me with indifference nor cause my mother, deprived of the hopes in life

                    adversely (which may heaven forfend) what, think you, will be her anguish of
                    soul when she sees me not only robbed of my patrimony, but disenfranchised as
                    well, and has no hope that my sister will find an establishment that befits her

                    shall not be worse than my father; but of this man you have had experience, and
                    you know well that, though he inherited a large estate, he has shown no
                    generosity toward you, but has been proven to be a defrauder of others. </p>

                    naturally be ready to undertake public services, being grateful to you for
                    rightfully restoring to me my estate; while this fellow, if you make him master
                    of my goods, will do nothing of the kind. Do not imagine that he will be ready
                    to undertake public services for you on behalf of property which he denies
