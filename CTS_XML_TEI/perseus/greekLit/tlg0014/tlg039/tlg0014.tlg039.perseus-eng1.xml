                <p>It was not from any love of litigation I protest by the gods, men of the jury,
                    that I brought this suit against Boeotus, nor was I unaware that it will seem
                    strange to many people that I should bring suit because somebody thought right
                    to have the same name as myself; but it was necessary to have the matter decided
                    in your court, in view of the consequences that must result if I do not get this
                    matter righted. </p>

                <p>If the defendant declared himself the son of another father and not of my own, I
                    should naturally have seemed meddlesome in caring by what name he chose to call
                    himself; but, as it is, he brought suit against my father, and having got up a

                    him—Mnesicles, whom you all probably know, and that Menecles who secured the

                        was put to death, as the scholiast on <bibl n="Dem. 19.281">Dem.

                        case seems to have been a notorious one, and reflected little credit on
                        Menecles.</note> and others of the same sort—he went into court, alleging
                    that he was my father's son by the daughter of Pamphilus, and that he was being
                    outrageously treated, and robbed of his civic rights. </p>

            <div n="3" type="section">
                <p>My father (for the whole truth shall be told you, men of the jury) feared to come
                    into court lest someone, on the ground of having elsewhere received some injury
                    from him in his public life, should confront him here; and at the same time he
                    was deceived by this man's mother. For she had sworn that if he should tender
                    her an oath in this matter, she would refuse it, and that, when this had been
                    done, all relations between them would be at an end; and she had also had money
                    deposited in the hands of a third party on her behalf<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="true">This money was evidently to be paid to her for fulfilling
                        her promise to refuse the oath.</note>;—on these conditions, then, my father
                    tendered her the oath. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
                <p>But she accepted it, and swore that not only the defendant, but his brother too,
                    her other son, was my father's child. When she had done this it was necessary to
                    enter them among the clansmen,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Admission to the
                        clan was necessary, if full family rights were to be secured.</note> and
                    there was no excuse left. My father did enter them; he adopted them as his
                    children and (to cut short the intervening matters) he enrolled the defendant at
                    the Apaturia<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The Apaturia was a family festival
                        occurring in the month Pyanepsion (October-November), and was the time when
                        children were regularly registered in the list of clan-members.</note> as
                    Boeotus on the list of the clansmen, and the other as Pamphilus. But I had
                    already been enrolled as Mantitheus. </p>

            <div n="5" type="section">
                <p>My father's death happened before the entries were made on the register of the

                        deme marked the beginning of a young man's political life. It took place
                        when he reached the age of eighteen.</note> but the defendant went and
                    enrolled himself on the register as Mantitheus, instead of Boeotus. How great a
                    wrong he did in this—to me, in the first place, but also to you—I shall show, as
                    soon as I have brought forward witnesses to prove my assertions.<quote

                <p>You have heard from the witnesses the manner in which our father enrolled us; I
                    shall now show to you that, as the defendant did not choose to abide by this
                    enrollment, it was both just and necessary for me to bring suit. For I am surely
                    not so stupid nor unreasonable a person as to have agreed to take only a third
                    of my father's estate (though the whole of it was coming to me), seeing that my
                    father had adopted these men, and to be content with that, and then to engage in
                    a quarrel with my kin<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Literally, “to strive
                        with one under the same yoke.” Such metaphors were very common in Greek

                    bring great dishonor and a reputation for cowardice, while for my opponent to
                    have the same name as myself was on many accounts impossible. </p>

                <p>To begin with (assuming that it is best to mention public matters before
                    private), in what way will the state give its command to us, if any duty is to
                    be performed? The members of the tribe will, of course<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="true">The appointment of citizens to undertake the various
                        “liturgies” (such as, e.g., the trierarchy) was made from the tax-groups

                    nominate other people. Well then; they will bring forward the name of
                    Mantitheus, son of Mantias, of Thoricus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"
                        >Thoricus was a deme of the tribe Acamantis.</note> if they are nominating
                    one for choregus<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The choregus had for his
                        duties the equipment and training of a chorus for the dramatic contests at
                        one of the great festivals. For this purpose the tribe chose one of its
                        richest members.</note> or gymnasiarch<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The
                        gymnasiarch was appointed by the tribe to maintain a team to represent it in

                    other office. By what, then, will it be made clear whether they are nominating

                    after this the Archon summons us, or any other magistrate, before whom the case
                    is called. We do not obey the summons; we do not undertake the service. Which of
                    us is liable to the penalties provided by law? And in what manner will the
                    generals enter our names, if they are listing names for a tax-company? or if
                    they are appointing a trierarch? Or, if there be a military expedition, how will
                    it be made clear which of us is on the muster-roll? </p>
            </div>
            <div n="9" type="section">
                <p>Or again, if any other magistrate, the Archon, the King-Archon, the Stewards of
                    the Games, makes an appointment for some public service, what sign will there be
                    to indicate which one of us they are appointing? Are they in heaven's name to
                    add the designation “son of Plangon,'' if they are entering your name, or add
                    the name of my mother if they are entering mine? But who ever heard of such a
                    thing? or by what law could this special designation be appended, or anything
                    else, except the name of the father and the deme? And seeing that both of these
                    are the same great confusion must result. </p>

            <div n="10" type="section">
                <p>Again, suppose Mantitheus, son of Mantias, of Thoricus should be summoned as

                    Should we go, both of us? For how is it to be clear whether he has summoned you
                    or me? Or, by Zeus, suppose the state is appointing to any office by lot, for
                    example that of Senator,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">In Athens the members
                        of the senate (<foreign xml:lang="grc">boulh/</foreign>) of five hundred—
                        fifty from each of the ten tribes—were chosen by lot.</note> that of

                    rest; how will it be clear which one of us has been appointed?—unless some mark
                    shall be attached to the tablet,<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Every
                        candidate had an identification tablet inscribed with his full name (that
                        is, his given name, the name of his father, and the name of his deme), and
                        this was placed in the urn for drawing.</note> as there might be to anything
                    else; and even then people will not know to which of us two it belongs. Well
                    then, he will say that he has been appointed, and I shall say that I have. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="11" type="section">
                <p>The only course left is for us to go into court. So the city will order a court
                    to be set up for each of the cases; and we shall be cheated of the fair and
                    equal right, that the one chosen by lot shall hold office. Then we shall berate
                    each other, and he who shall prevail by his words will hold office. And in which
                    case should we be better off—by trying to rid ourselves of our existing
                    resentments, or by arousing fresh animosities and recriminations? For these must
                    of necessity result, when we wrangle with one another about an office or
                    anything else. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="12" type="section">
                <p>But suppose again (for we must examine every phase of the matter), one or the
                    other of us persuades the other, in case he is chosen, to yield the office to
                    him, and so obtains the appointment? What is this but one man drawing lots with
                    two tablets? Shall it, then, be permitted us to do with impunity a thing for
                    which the law appoints the penalty of death? “Why, certainly, for we should not
                    do it,” you may say. I know that, at least so far as I am concerned; but it is
                    not right that some persons should even be liable to this penalty, when they
                    need not be. </p>

            <div n="13" type="section">
                <p>Very well; but in these cases it is the state that is injured: what harm does it
                    do me individually? Observe in what serious ways I am harmed, and consider if
                    there be anything in what I say. Indeed the wrong done to me is far more
                    grievous than what you have heard. You all know, for instance, that he was
                    intimate with Menecles during his lifetime, and with his crowd, and that he now
                    associates with others no better than Menecles, and that he has cherished the
                    same ambitions, and desires to be thought a clever fellow<note resp="Loeb"

            <div n="14" type="section">
                <p>Now, if, as time goes on, he undertakes to set on foot any of the same practices
                    as these men (these are indictments, presentments for contraband, informations,
                    arrests) and on the basis of one of these he is condemned to pay a fine to the
                    state (for there are many vicissitudes in mortal affairs, and you know well how
                    to keep in due bounds even the most clever people on any occasion when they
                    overreach themselves), why will his name be entered on the record any more than

                    not paid; why is there any greater likelihood that the defendant's children will

                    the father and the tribe, and all else are identical? Suppose, now, somebody

                    nothing to do with me, but, having had the writ registered, should enter the

                    recourse to the statements he is always making, that my father was induced by me
                    to treat him with despite; and he claims the right, alleging that he is older
                    than I, to bear the name of his paternal grandfather. As to this, it is better
                    for you to listen to a few statements. I remember seeing him, before he became a
                    relative of mine, casually, as one might see anyone else, and thought him
                    younger than I, and to judge by appearances, much younger; but I will not insist

                    thought it right to join the chorus in the tribe Hippothontis before you claimed
                    to be the son of my father, what name would you have set down as rightly
                    belonging to you? For if you should say, Mantitheus, you could not do so on the
                    plea that you are older than I, for since at that time you did not suppose you
                    had any connection even with my tribe, how could you claim to be related to my

                    just way of reckoning. And what is this? That these men should be considered
                    children of my father from the date when he adopted them. Well then, he entered
                    me on the register of the demesmen as Mantitheus, before he introduced this man
                    to the clansmen. Therefore not by virtue of time only, but also by virtue of
                    justice I have the right to bear this name as a mark of seniority. </p>

                    is it that you have now become a member of the tribe Acamantis, and of the deme
                    Thoricus, and a son of Mantias, and have your share in the property left by
                    him?” You could give no other answer than, “Mantias while living acknowledged
                    me, too, as his son.” If one should ask you what proof you had of this or what
                    evidence, you would say, “He introduced me to the clansmen.” But if one asked
                    under what name he enrolled you, you would say, “Boeotus,” for that is the name
                    by which you were introduced. </p>

                    you, or to declare yourself the son of some other father, would his demand not
                    be thought a reasonable one? Well then, I make this same demand of you, either
                    to add to your name that of another father, or to keep the name which Mantias
                    gave you. </p>

                    men used to say that the kinsfolk of the defendant's mother were quite as good

                    father was compelled to bring them into the clan, when I had already been
                    introduced as Mantitheus, he introduced the defendant as Boeotus, and his

                    the same name to two of his sons. If you can, I will grant that my father gave

                    counted you as no relative; but ever since he, adopted you, I too regard you as
                    a kinsman. What is the proof of this? You possess your portion of my father's
                    estate after his death; you share in the religious rites, and civic privileges.
                    No one seeks to exclude you from these. What is it that you would have? But if
                    he says that he is being outrageously treated, if he weeps and wails, and makes
                    charges against me, do not believe what he says. It is not right that you
                    should, since our argument is not now about these matters. But take this
                    attitude—that he can just as well get satisfaction under the name of Boeotus.

                <p>Why are you, then, so fond of wrangling? Desist, I beg you; do not be so ready to
                    cherish enmity against me. I am not so minded toward you. For even now—lest the
                    fact escape your notice—I am speaking rather in your interest than in my own, in
                    insisting that we should not have the same name. If there were no other reason,
                    at least anyone hearing it must ask which of us is meant if there are two
                    Mantitheuses, sons of Mantias. Then he will say, “The one whom he was compelled
                    to adopt,” if he means you. How can you desire this? Now take, please, and read
                    these two depositions, proving that my father gave me the name Mantitheus, and
                    him the name Boeotus.<quote type="Depositions">

                <p>It remains, I think, to show you, men of Athens, that not only will you be
                    fulfilling your oaths, if you give the verdict for which I ask, but also that
                    the defendant has given judgement against himself, that he should rightly bear
                    the name of Boeotus, and not Mantitheus. For when I had entered this suit
                    against Boeotus, son of Mantias, of Thoricus, at the first he accepted service
                    of the suit, and put in an oath for delay, as being Boeotus; but finally, when
                    there was no longer room for evasion, he allowed the arbitrators to give
                    judgement against him by default, and then, in Heaven's name, see what he did—

                <p>he got this judgement for non-appearance set aside, entitling himself Boeotus.
                    And yet he ought in the first place to have allowed me to get my suit finished
                    as against Boeotus, if that name did not, in fact, pertain to him at all, and
                    not subsequently be found getting the judgement for non-appearance set aside
                    under this name. When, a man has thus given judgement against himself that he is
                    properly Boeotus, what verdict can he demand that you sworn jurors shall give?
                    To prove that I am speaking the truth in this, take the decision setting aside
                    the judgement for non-appearance and this complaint.<quote type="Decision">

                    their own names, you would rightly give the verdict for which he asks. But if
                    the law, which you all know as well as I, gives parents the right not only to
                    give the name in the first place, but also to cancel it and renounce it by
                    public declaration, if they please; and if I have shown that my father, who had
                    this authority under the law, gave to the defendant the name Boeotus, and to me
                    the name Mantitheus, how can you render any other verdict than that for which I

                    concerning these matters, you would have been bound to cast your votes in my
                    favor. For who is there among you who has given the same name to two of his

                    on the basis of what you deem most just, on the basis of the laws, your oaths,
                    and the admissions this man has made, my request of you, men of Athens, is
                    reasonable, and my claims just; while my opponent asks what is not only
                    unreasonable, but contrary to established usage.</p>
