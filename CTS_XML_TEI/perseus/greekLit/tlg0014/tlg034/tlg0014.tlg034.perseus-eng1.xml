                <p>The request that I shall make of you, men of the jury, is a fair one, that you

                    appeared in any suit before you either as plaintiffs or as defendants. </p>

                <p>And you may be sure, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
                    that we should not even now have brought this action against Phormio, if we
                    believed that the money which we lent him had been lost on the ship that was
                    wrecked; we are not so shameless nor so unaccustomed to losses. But as many have
                    kept taunting us, and especially those who were in <placeName key="tgn,1115068"
                        >Bosporus</placeName> with Phormio, who knew that he had not lost the money
                    together with the ship, we thought it a dreadful thing not to seek redress after
                    being wronged as we had been by this man. </p>

            <div n="3" type="section">
                <p>With reference to the special plea my argument is a brief one. For even the
                    defendants do not absolutely deny that a contract was made on your exchange<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="true">The word rendered “exchange” or “market,” may
                        well designate merely the Peiraeus, which was in a very real sense the
                            <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)mpo/rion</foreign> of <placeName

                    there exists no longer any obligation on their part due to the contract, for
                    they have done nothing that contravenes the terms of the agreement. </p>

            <div n="4" type="section">
                <p>The laws, however, in accordance with which you sit as jurors, do not use this
                    language. They do indeed allow the production of a special plea when there has
                    been no contract at all at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> or
                    for the Athenian market; but if a man admits that a contract was made, yet
                    contends that he has done everything that the contract requires, they bid him to
                    make a defence on the merits of the case, and not to make the plaintiff a
                        defendant.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">As happened, of course, when a
                        plea in bar of action was introduced.</note> Not but that I hope to prove
                    from the facts of the case itself that this suit of mine is admissible. </p>

                    consider what is admitted by these men, and what is disputed; for in this way
                    you will best sift the question. They admit that they borrowed the money, and
                    that they had contracts made to secure the loan; but they claim that they have
                    paid the money to Lampis, the servant of Dio, in <placeName key="tgn,1115068"
                        >Bosporus</placeName>. We, on our part, shall prove, not only that Phormio
                    did not pay it, but that it was actually impossible for him to pay it. But I
                    must recount to you a few of the things that happened at the outset. </p>

                        >Pontus</placeName> and back, on the security of goods of twice that

                        of the disputed phrase.</note> and deposited a contract with Cittus the
                    banker. But, although the contract required him to put on board the ship goods
                    to the value of four thousand drachmae, he did the most outrageous thing
                    possible. For while still in the Peiraeus he, without our knowledge, secured an
                    additional loan of four thousand five hundred drachmae from Theodorus the
                    Phoenician, and one of one thousand drachmae from Lampis the shipowner. </p>

                        >Athens</placeName> a cargo worth one hundred and fifteen minae,<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="true">If the loans were all made on the same basis
                        (i.e. on the security of goods of a value twice as great as the loan) we
                        should have to read one hundred and fifty instead of one hundred and
                        fifteen, as the combined loans amounted to seventy-five minae. It is
                        possible, however, that Theodorus and Lampis, whose loans were for the
                        outward voyage only, and who sailed with Phormio, accepted a lower rate than
                        that demanded by Chrysippus and his partner, who remained in <placeName

                    all his creditors what was written in their agreements, he purchased only a
                    cargo worth five thousand five hundred drachmae, including the provisions; while
                    his debts were seventy-five minae. This was the beginning of his fraud, men of

                    absolutely crazy, as to have drawn up a complaint like this, if Lampis (whose
                    words would prove my contention false) admitted that he had received the money.

                    to export grain and the exemption from duty in the name of the state; and having

                    loans which he had secured at Athens, and that with the proceeds from the goods
                    sold in Bosporus he with difficulty satisfied his creditors who had lent money

                    who was at the time in Bosporus, as a witness. Again, Lampis himself is shown to
                    have testified to me, before he was corrupted by Phormio, that he had not

                        clearly (i.e. in the suit as instituted) it would have been his best
                        defence. He could not do so, and therefore had recourse to a special plea,
                        arguing that my suit could not be brought into court. This, however, is

                    not see what better defence he could have made. But that the action is
                    admissible the law itself solemnly declares, when it maintains that mercantile
                    actions are those for contracts made at Athens or for the Athenian market, and
