          <p> Cases in which the facts are agreed upon are settled in advance either by the law or

            But should matter for dispute occur, it is your task, gentlemen, to give a decision.
            However, I do not imagine that any dispute will in fact arise between the defendant and
            myself. My son was struck in the side by a javelin thrown by yonder lad in the

            nature in word and deed; for I myself, who, unless I am sorely mistaken, am very far
            from finding or wanting to find such a task congenial, have today been forced by sheer
            misfortune to depart from my habits and appear as defendant in a case in which I found
            it hard enough to arrive at the exact truth, but which leaves me still more perplexed
            when I consider how I should present it to you. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="2" type="section">
          <p>I am driven by pitiless necessity: and I, like my opponents, gentlemen of the jury,
            seek refuge in your sympathy. I beg of you: if my arguments appear more subtle than
            those generally presented to you, do not allow the circumstances already mentioned<note
              anchored="true" resp="ed">i.e. the fact that he was not accustomed to appearing in
              courts of law, which should make it a priori probable that he is a simple and
              straightforward man who would not resort to subtleties of argument if his case were a
              sound one.</note> so to prejudice you against my defence as to make you base your
            verdict upon apparent fact instead of upon the truth; apparent fact puts the advantage
            with the clever speaker, but truth with the man who lives in justice and righteousness.

          <p>In training my son in those pursuits from which the state derives most benefit I
            imagined that both of us would be rewarded; but the result has sadly belied my hopes.
            For the lad—not from insolence or wantonness, but while at javelin-practice in the
            gymnasium with his fellows—made a hit, it is true, but killed no one, if one considers
            his true part in the matter<note anchored="true" resp="ed">Two interpretations of the
              text as it stands in the manuscripts are possible: (1) “He threw (his spear), it is
              true, but killed no one”; (2) “He struck (someone), it is true, but did not kill him.”
              (1) gives good sense; but elsewhere in the tetralogy <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                >BA/LLEIN</foreign> means “to hit,” not “to throw.” (2) avoids this difficulty; but
              it has been urged (e.g. by Blass, who favors emendation) that the words <foreign
                xml:lang="greek">TO\N ME\N BALO/NTA KAI\ A)POKTEI/NANTA OU)/TE TRW=SAI OU)/TE
                A)POKTEI/NAI/ FHSI</foreign> in <bibl n="Antiph. 3.3.5">Antiph. 3.3.5</bibl> (cf.
              also <bibl n="Antiph. 3.3.6">Antiph. 3.3.6</bibl> sub fin.) prove that the speaker in
              the present passage had not admitted that X struck Y. The contradiction, however, is
              only apparent. The speaker here is saying in effect that the responsibility for the
              blow must rest with Y, although X dealt it; in <bibl n="Antiph. 3.3.5">Antiph.
                3.3.5-6</bibl> his opponents argue that the responsibility must rest with X, because
              X dealt it.</note>: he accidentally<note anchored="true" resp="ed">For <foreign
                xml:lang="greek">A)KOUSI/WS</foreign> cf. <bibl n="Antiph. 2.3.1">Antiph.
                2.3.1</bibl>, note 2.</note> incurred the blame for the error of another which
            affected that other's own person. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="4" type="section">
          <p>Had the boy been wounded because the javelin had traveled in his direction outside the
            area appointed for its flight, we should be left unable to show that we had not caused
            his death. But he ran into the path of the javelin and placed his person in its way.
            Hence my son was prevented from hitting the target: while the boy, who moved into the
            javelin's path, was struck, thereby causing us to be blamed for what we did not do. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="5" type="section">
          <p>It was because he ran in front of the javelin that the boy was struck. The lad is
            therefore accused without just cause, as he did not strike anyone standing clear of the
            target. At the same time, since it is plain to you that the boy was not struck while
            standing still, but was struck only after deliberately moving into the path of the
            javelin, you have still clearer proof that his death was due to an error on his own
            part. Had he stood still and not run across, he would not have been struck. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="6" type="section">
          <p/>
          <p>Both sides are agreed, as you see, that the boy's death was accidental; so by
            discovering which of the two was guilty of error, we should prove still more
            conclusively who killed him. For it is those guilty of error in carrying out an intended
            act who are responsible for accidents<note anchored="true" resp="ed">The argument is:
              (1) It is agreed that death was accidental. (2) But accidents are always due to
                <foreign xml:lang="greek">A(MARTI/A</foreign> on the part of someone. (3) Therefore
              if the person guilty of <foreign xml:lang="greek">A(MARTI/A</foreign> is discovered,
              we have eo ipso discovered the person responsible for the boy's death.</note>: just as
            it is those who voluntarily do a thing or allow it to be done to them who are
            responsible for the effects suffered. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="7" type="section">
          <p/>
          <p>Now the lad, on his side, was not guilty of error in respect of anyone: in practising
            he was not doing what he was forbidden but what he had been told to do, and he was not
            standing among those engaged in gymnastics when he threw the javelin, but in his place
            among the other throwers: nor did he hit the boy because he missed the target and sent
            his javelin instead at those standing clear. He did everything correctly, as he
            intended; and thus he was not the cause of any accident, but the victim of one, in that
            he was prevented from hitting the target. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="8" type="section">
          <p/>
          <p>The boy, on the other hand, who wished to run forward, missed the moment at which he
            could have crossed without being hit, with results which he by no means desired. He was
            accidentally guilty of an error which affected his own person, and has thus met with a
            disaster for which he had himself alone to thank. He has punished himself for his error,
            and is therefore duly requited; not that we rejoice at or approve of it—far from it: we
            feel both sympathy and sorrow.</p>
          <p>It is thus the dead boy who proves to have been guilty of error; so the act which
            caused his death is to be attributed not to us, but to him, the party guilty of error:
            just as the recoiling of its effects upon the agent not only absolves us from blame, but
            has caused the agent to be punished as he deserved directly his error was committed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div n="9" type="section">
          <p/>
          <p>Furthermore, our innocence is attested by the law upon which my accuser relies in
            charging me with the boy's death, the law which forbids the taking of life whether
            wrongfully or otherwise. For the fact that the victim himself was guilty of error clears
            the defendant here of having killed him by accident: while his accuser does not even
            suggest that he killed him deliberately. Thus he is cleared of both charges, of killing
            the boy by accident and of killing him deliberately. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="10" type="section">
          <p>Not only do the true facts of the case and the law under which he is being prosecuted
            attest my son's innocence; but our manner of life is equally far from justifying such
            harsh treatment of us. Not only will it be an outrage, if my son is to bear the blame
            for errors which he did not commit; but I myself, who am equally innocent, though
            assuredly not more so, will be visited with woes many times more bitter. Once my son is
            lost, I shall pass the rest of my days longing for death: once I am left childless, mine
            will be a life within the tomb. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="11" type="section">
          <p/>
          <p>Have pity, then, on this child, the victim of calamity, though guilty of no error: and
            have pity on me, an old man in distress, stricken thus suddenly with sorrow. Do not
            bring a miserable fate upon us by condemning us: but show that you fear God by
            acquitting us. The dead boy is not unavenged for the calamity which befell him: nor
            ought we ourselves to share the responsibility for errors due to our accusers. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="12" type="section">
          <p>So respect the righteousness which the facts before you have revealed: respect justice:
            and acquit us as godly and just men should. Do not bring upon a father and a son, two of
            the most wretched of beings, sorrows which the years of neither can well bear.</p>

        <head>Second Speech for the Prosecution</head>
        <div n="1" type="section">
          <p> That sheer necessity can force all men to belie their nature in both word and deed is
            a fact of which the defendant seems to me to be giving very real proof. Whereas in the
            past he was the last to show impudence or audacity, his very misfortune has today forced
            him to say things which I for one would never have expected of him. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="2" type="section">
          <p>I, in my great folly, imagined that he would not reply; otherwise I would not have
            deprived myself of half of my opportunities as prosecutor by making only one speech
            instead of two; and he, but for his audacity, would not have had the twofold advantage
            over me of using one speech to answer the one speech for the prosecution and making his
            accusations when they could not be answered.<note anchored="true" resp="ed">I take the
              speaker to mean: “The case seemed so simple that instead of developing any argument in
              my first speech for the prosecution, I merely stated the bare facts. The defendant,
              however, has make an elaborate reply, and will doubtless do the same again in his
              second speech; this is equivalent to his making two speeches to my one. Further, he
              will be able to use his second speech to answer my one serious speech for the
              prosecution (<foreign xml:lang="greek">E(/NA PRO\S E(/NA LO/GON
                A)POLOGHQEI/S</foreign>); while I cannot effectively answer the attack which he made
              upon me in his first speech (<foreign xml:lang="greek">A(\ KATHGO/RHSEN A)NAPOKRI/TWS
                EI)PW/N</foreign>), because, as prosecutor, I must now devote myself to attacking
              him.”</note>

          <p/>
          <p>With his great advantage over us in the matter of the speeches, and with the far
            greater one which his methods have given him in addition,<note anchored="true" resp="ed"
              >Referring apparently to the artifices employed by the defence for working upon the
              feelings of the court (cf. <bibl n="Antiph. 3.2.1">Antiph. 3.2.1</bibl> ff.).</note>
            it is outrageous that the accused should entreat you to listen kindly to his defence. I
            myself, on the other hand, far from causing any harm, have been the victim of cruel
            affliction, and am today being treated still more cruelly. It is as one who seeks more
            than a pretended refuge in your sympathy that I make my own request of you. You who take
            vengeance for unrighteous deeds and determine wherein is righteousness, do not, I beg of
            you, let worthless subtleties of speech induce you to disregard plain facts and treat
            the truth as false; </p>
        </div>
        <div n="4" type="section">
          <p>for such subtleties result in a tale more plausible than true, whereas the truth, when
            told, will be less guileful and therefore less convincing.</p>
          <p>My faith in justice, then, enables me to despise his defence. Yet my distrust of the
            pitiless will of fate makes me fear that I may not only lose the benefit of my child,
            but that I may see him convicted by you of taking his own life in addition. </p>

            who cast it, he was greeted by yonder lad's cruel weapon; though guilty of error in
            respect of no single person, he died a piteous death. The lad, on the other hand, who
            mistook the moment at which the javelins were being picked up, was not prevented from
            making a hit. To my bitter sorrow, he struck a target; and although he did not kill my

            attributed? To the spectators or the masters in charge—whom no one accuses at all? The
            circumstances of my son's death are no mystery: to me, for one, they are only too clear;
            and I maintain that the law is right when it orders the punishment of those who have
            taken life; not only is it just that he who killed without meaning to kill should suffer
            punishment which he did not mean to incur; but it would also be an injustice to the

            who was guilty of it; and if, on the other hand, a defilement from heaven has fallen

            standing still, he deserves to be treated as his own slayer. Then the lad is not free
            from blame either; he is only innocent if he was standing still and not throwing his
            javelin when the boy was killed. The boy's death was therefore due to both of them. Now
            the boy, whose error affected his own person, has punished himself even more harshly

            maintaining that his son threw the javelin or struck himself. I am maintaining that
            since he moved within range of the javelin, his death was due not to the lad, but to
            himself; for he was not killed standing in his place. As this running across was his
            undoing, it follows that if it was at his master's summons that he ran across, the

          <p>Before proceeding to any further argument, I wish to show still more clearly which of
            the two was responsible for the accident. The lad no more missed the target than any of
            those practising with him<note anchored="true" resp="ed">A highly artificial piece of
              sophistry. (1) The lad did exactly the same as the other throwers: so, as they did not
              miss the target, neither can he have done. (2) On the other hand, the boy did not do
              the same as the other spectators; and so he is not blameless, as they are.</note>: nor
            has he rendered himself guilty of any of the acts with which he is charged owing to
            error on his own part. On the other hand, the boy did not do the same as the other
            onlookers; he moved into the javelin's path. And this is clear proof that it was through
            his own error that he met with a disaster which those who stood still did not. The
            thrower would not have been guilty of an error in any respect,<note anchored="true"
              resp="ed">A curious admission that the <foreign xml:lang="greek">MEIRA/KION</foreign>
              was guilty of <foreign xml:lang="greek">A(MARTI/A</foreign> to at least some
              extent.</note> had no one moved into the path of his spear: while the boy would not

        </div>
        <div n="6" type="section">
          <p/>
          <p>Further, my son was not more concerned in the boy's death than any one of those
            throwing javelins with him, as I will show. If it was owing to the fact that my son was
            throwing a javelin that the boy was killed, then all those practising with him must
            share in the guilt of the deed, as it was not owing to their failure to throw that they
            did not strike him, but owing to the fact that he did not move into the path of the
            javelin of any one of them. Similarly the young man, who was no more guilty of error
            than they, would not have hit the boy any more than they did, had the boy stood still
            with the onlookers. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="7" type="section">
          <p/>
          <p>Again, not only was the boy guilty of the error committed; he was also to blame for the
            failure to take due precautions. My son saw no one running across, so how could he have
            taken precautions against striking anyone? The boy, on the other hand, upon seeing the
            throwers, might easily have guarded against running across, as he was quite at liberty
            to remain standing still. </p>

        <div n="8" type="section">

          <p>The law which they quote is a praiseworthy one; it is right and fair that it should
            visit those who have killed without meaning to do so with chastisement which they did
            not mean to incur. But the lad is not guilty of error; and it would therefore be unjust
            that he should suffer for him who is. It is enough that he should bear the consequences
            of his own errors. On the other hand, the boy, who perished through his own error,
            punished himself as soon as he had committed that error. And as the slayer has been
            punished, the slaying has not gone unavenged. </p>
        </div>
        <div n="9" type="section">
          <p/>
          <p>The slayer has paid the penalty; so it is not by acquitting us, but by condemning us
            that you will leave a burden upon your consciences. The boy, who is bearing the
            consequence of his own error, will leave behind him nothing that calls for atonement
            from anyone; but if my son, who is innocent, is put to death, the conscience of those
            who have condemned him will be more heavily burdened than ever.</p>
          <p>If the arguments put forward prove the dead boy his own slayer, it is not we who have
            stated them whom he has to thank, but the fact that the accident happened as it did.

        </div>
        <div n="10" type="section">
          <p>Since examination proves beyond doubt that the boy was his own slayer, the law absolves
            us from blame, and condemns him who was guilty. See, then, that we are not plunged into
            woes which we do not deserve, and that you yourselves do not defy the powers above by a
            verdict succoring my opponents in their misfortunes. Remember, as righteousness and
            justice require you to do, that the accident was caused by him who moved into the
            javelin's path. Remember, and acquit us; for we are not guilty of his death.</p>
