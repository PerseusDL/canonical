     family was of <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002681" >Attica</placeName>; and in wisdom and learning he surpassed all the men of his time.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The following fragments on the Seven Wise Men may be compared
      with the fuller accounts in Diogenes Laertius (tr. by Hicks in the
     <title>L.C.L.</title>).</note> Being by nature far superior as regards virtue to the rest of
     men, he cultivated assiduously a virtue that wins applause; for he devoted much time to every
     branch of knowledge and became practised in every kind of virtue. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>While still a youth, for instance, he availed himself of the best teachers, and when he
     attained to manhood he spent his time in the company of the men who enjoyed the greatest
     influence for their pursuit of wisdom. As a consequence, by reason of his companionship and
     association with men of this kind, he came to be called one of the Seven Wise Men and won for
     himself the highest rank in sagacity, not only among the men just mentioned, but also among all
     who were regarded with admiration. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The same Solon, who had acquired great fame by his legislation, also in his
     conversations and answers to questions as a private citizen became an object of wonder by
     reason of his attainments in learning. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The same Solon, although the city<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> followed the whole Ionian manner of life and
     luxury and a carefree existence had made the inhabitants effeminate, worked a change in them by
     accustoming them to practise virtue and to emulate the deeds of virile folk. And it was because
     of this that Harmodius and Aristogeiton,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The famous
      Tyrannicides of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>; Harmodius killed Hipparchus, son of Peisistratus. See following note, and Book 10.17 and notes.</note> their

     possessed of great military forces and had purposely amassed a large amount of silver and gold,
     used to call to his court the wisest men from among the Greeks, spend some time in their
     company, and then send them away with many presents, he himself having been greatly aided
     thereby toward a life of virtue. And on one occasion he summoned Solon, and showing him his
     military forces and his wealth he asked him whether he thought there was any other man more
     blest than he. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And Solon replied, with the freedom of speech
     customary among lovers of wisdom, that no man while yet living was blest; for the man who waxes
     haughty over his prosperity and thinks that he has Fortune as his helpmeet does not know
     whether she will remain with him to the last. Consequently, he continued, we must look to the
     end of life, and only of the man who has continued until then to be fortunate may we properly
     say that he is blest. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And at a later time, when Croesus had
     been taken prisoner by Cyrus and was about to be burned upon a great pyre,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><date value="-546">546</date> B.C.</note> he recalled the answer Solon had
     given him. And so, while the fire was already blazing about him, he kept continually calling
     the name of Solon. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And Cyrus sent men to find out the reason
     for his continual calling of the name of Solon; and on learning the cause Cyrus changed his
     purpose, and since he believed that Solon's reply was the truth, he ceased regarding Croesus
     with contempt, put out the burning pyre, saved the life of Croesus, and counted him henceforth
     as one of his friends. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Solon
     believed that the boxers and short-distance runners and all other athletes contributed nothing
     worth mentioning to the safety of states, but that only men who excel in prudence and virtue
     are able to protect their native lands in times of danger. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When there was a dispute
     about the golden tripod,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The tripod, found in the sea by
      fishermen, was to be given to the wisest man, and passed through the hands of each of the
      Seven Wise Men, each insisting that another was wiser than himself. Cp. chap. 13.2 infra and
       <bibl n="Plut. Sol. 4">Plut. Sol. 4</bibl>.</note> the Pythian priestess delivered the
     following oracle: <milestone unit="section" n="2"/><quote type="oracle">
      <l met="dactylic"><placeName key="tgn,7002386">Miletus</placeName>' son, dost ask Apollo's
       will</l>
      <l>About the tripod? Who is first of all</l>
      <l>In wisdom, his the tripod is, I say.</l>
     </quote>But some writers have a different account, as follows: War had broken out among the
     Ionians, and when the tripod was brought up in their seine by some fishermen, they inquired of
     the god how they might end the war. And the priestess replied<quote type="oracle">
      <l met="dactylic">Never shall cease the war twixt Meropes</l>
      <l>And Iones, until that golden stand</l>
      <l>Hephaestus worked with skill ye send away;</l>
      <l>And it shall come to that man's dwelling-place</l>
      <l>Who in his wisdom hath foreseen the things</l>
      <l>That are and likewise things that are to be.</l>
     </quote>
     <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Milesians, wishing to
     follow the injunction of the oracle, desired to award the prize to Thales of <placeName key="tgn,7002386">Miletus</placeName>. But Thales said that he was not the wisest of all and
     advised them to send it to another and wiser man. And in this manner the other six of the Seven
     Wise Men likewise rejected the tripod, and it was given to Solon, who was thought to have
     surpassed all men in both wisdom and understanding. And Solon advised that it be dedicated to
     Apollo, since he was wiser than all of them. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Solon, seeing toward the end of his life
     how Peisistratus, to please the masses, was playing the demagogue and was on the road to
      tyranny,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Shortly before <date value="-560">560</date> B.C.</note> tried at first by arguments to turn him from his intention; and when Peisistratus
     paid no attention to him, he once appeared in the market-place arrayed in full armour, although
     he was already a very old man. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And when the people, the sight
     being so incongruous, flocked to him, he called upon the citizens to seize their arms and at
     once make an end of the tyrant. But no man paid any attention to him, all of them concluding
     that he was mad and some declaring that he was in his dotage. Peisistratus, who had already
     gathered a guard of a few spearmen, came up to Solon and asked him, "Upon what resources do you
     rely that you wish to destroy my tyranny?" And when Solon replied, "Upon my old age,"
     Peisistratus, in admiration of his common sense, did him no harm. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We are
     told that the Scythian Anacharsis, who took great pride in his wisdom, once came to <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName> and inquired of the oracle who of the Greeks was wiser
     than he. And the oracle replied:<quote type="oracle">
      <l met="dactylic">A man of Oeta, Myson, they report,</l>

     village called Chenae, and he spent his entire time in the country and was unknown to most men.
     He was included among the Seven Wise Men in the place of Periander of Corinth, who was rejected
     because he had turned into a harsh tyrant.<bibl>Const. Exc. 2 (1), p. 217.</bibl>

<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="fragment" n="FR9.4" ed="P"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Solon was curious to see the place where
     Myson spent his days, and found him at the threshing-floor fitting a handle to a plow. And to
     make trial of the man Solon said, "Now is not the season for the plow, Myson." "Not to use it,"
     he replied, "but to make it ready."<bibl>Const. Exc. 4, p. 283.</bibl>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="fragment" n="FR9.5" ed="P"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the case of <placeName key="tgn,1017181" >Chilon</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">One of the Seven Wise Men.</note> his
     life agreed with his teaching, a thing one rarely finds. As for the philosophers of our time,
     for instance, most of them are to be seen uttering the noblest sentiments, but following the
     basest practices, and the solemnity and sagacity expressed in their pronouncements are refuted
     when the speakers are put to the proof. But as for Chilon, not to mention the virtue which he
     displayed in every deed throughout his life, he thought out and expressed many precepts which
     are worthy of record.<bibl>Const. Exc. 2 (1), p. 218.</bibl>
     </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="fragment" n="FR9.6" ed="P"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Chilon came to <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Delphi</placeName> he thought to dedicate to the god the firstlings, as it
     were, of his own wisdom, and engraved upon a column these three maxims: "Know thyself";
     "Nothing overmuch"; and the third, "A pledge, and ruin is nigh." Each of these maxims, though
     short and laconic,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><placeName key="tgn,1017181" >Chilon</placeName> was a Spartan (Laconian) ephor in <date value="-556">556</date> B.C.</note> displays deep reflection. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For the maxim "Know
     thyself" exhorts us to become educated and to get prudence, it being only by these means that a
     man may come to know himself, either because it is chiefly those who are uneducated and
     thoughtless that think themselves to be very sagacious&mdash;and that, according to Plato,
     is of all kinds of ignorance the worst<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The ignorance, Plato would say, that mistakes itself for knowledge.</note> &mdash;or because such people
     consider wicked men to be virtuous, and honest men, on the contrary, to be of no account; for
     only in this one way may a man know himself and his neighbour&mdash;by getting an education
     and a sagacity that are superior. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Likewise, the maxim "Nothing overmuch" exhorts us to observe due measure in all things
     and not to make an irrevocable decision about any human affairs, as the Epidamnians once did.
     This people, who dwelt on the shores of the Adriatic, once quarrelled among themselves, and
     casting red-hot masses of iron right into the sea they swore an oath that they would never make
     up their mutual enmity until the masses of iron should be brought up hot out of the sea.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">According to <bibl n="Hdt. 1.165">Hdt. 1.165</bibl> the Phocaeans emphasized in a similar manner their resolve never to return to their native
     city.</note> And although they had sworn so severe an oath and had taken no thought of the
     admonition "Nothing overmuch," later under the compulsion of circumstances they put an end to
     their enmity, leaving the masses of iron to lie cold in the depths of the sea. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And as for the maxim "A pledge, and ruin
     is nigh," some have assumed that by it <placeName key="tgn,1017181">Chilon</placeName> was
     advising against marriage; for among most Greek peoples the agreement to marry is also called a
     "pledge," and this is confirmed by the common experience of men in that the worst and most
     numerous ills of life are due to wives. But some writers say that such an interpretation is
     unworthy of <placeName key="tgn,1017181">Chilon</placeName>, because if marriage were destroyed
     life could not continue, and that he declares that "ruin" is nigh to such pledges as those made
     in connection with contracts and with agreements on other matters, all of which are concerned
     with money. As Euripides says:<quote type="verse">
      <l met="iambic">No pledge I give, observing well the loss</l>
      <l>Which those incur who of the pledge are fond;</l>
      <l>And writings there at <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName> say me nay.</l>
     </quote><bibl n="Eur. Fr. 923">Eur. fr. 923 &lsqb;Nauck&lpar;2&rpar;&rsqb;</bibl>
     <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But some also say that it is
     not the meaning of <placeName key="tgn,1017181">Chilon</placeName> nor is it the act of a good
     citizen, not to come to the aid of a friend when he needs help of this kind; but rather that he
     advises against strong asseverations, against eagerness in giving pledges, and against
     irrevocable decisions in human affairs, such as the Greeks once made in connection with their
     victory over Xerxes. For they took oath at <placeName key="tgn,7011028" >Plataea</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">In <date value="-479">479</date> B.C.</note> that they would hand down enmity to the Persians as an inheritance even to their
     children's children, so long as the rivers run into the sea, as the race of men endures, and as
     the earth brings forth fruit; and yet, despite the binding pledge they had taken against fickle
     fortune, after a time they were sending ambassadors to Artaxerxes, Xerxes' son, to negotiate a
     treaty of friendship and alliance.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">This would probably
      refer to the Peace of Callias in 448 (or earlier), but in it there was no question of an
      alliance. However, in 412 <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Sparta</placeName> made a treaty with
       <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> against <placeName key="tgn,7001393" >Athens</placeName>.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Chilon's precepts, though
     brief, embrace the entire counsel necessary for the best life, since these pithy sayings of his
     are worth more than all the votive offerings set up in <placeName key="perseus,Delphi" >Delphi</placeName>. The golden ingots of Croesus<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">See
       <bibl n="Hdt. 1.50">Hdt. 1.50</bibl>.</note> and other handiwork like them have vanished and
     were but great incentives to men who chose to lift impious hands against the temple; but
     Chilon's maxims are kept alive for all time, stored up as they are in the souls of educated men
     and constituting the fairest treasure, on which neither Phocians nor Gauls would be quick to
     lay their hands.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The reference is to the sack of
       <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> by the Phocians in <dateRange from="-356" to="-346">356</dateRange>-346 B.C. and by the Gauls in <date value="-279">279</date> B.C.</note><bibl>Const. Exc. 4, pp. 283-285.</bibl>

     self-disparagement. Consequently he was regarded by all as a man who, beyond dispute, was
     perfect in respect of every virtue: for as to his legislation, he showed himself statesmanlike

     the reply that all the islanders were collecting horses and were planning a campaign against
     the Lydians, Croesus is said to have exclaimed, "Would that some one could persuade the
     islanders to fight against the Lydians on horseback!" For the Lydians are skilled horsemen and
     Croesus believed that they would come off victorious on land. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Whereupon Pittacus, or Bias, answered him, "Well, you say that the Lydians, who live on the

     in return for the evils which have befallen the Greeks on the mainland, they may avenge
     themselves at sea on the man who has enslaved their kinsmen?" Croesus, in admiration of this

<div2 type="chapter" n="26">

     lauded his good fortune. And he also sent for Solon as well as for such others as enjoyed the

     of approval upon his own felicity. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And there came to him
     Anacharsis the Scythian and Bias and Solon and Pittacus, to whom he showed the highest honour
     at banquets and at his council, and he displayed his wealth before them and the magnitude of
     his own power. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now in those days men of learning sought
     brevity of speech. And Croesus, after he had displayed to the men the felicity of his kingdom
     and the multitude of the peoples subject to him, asked Anacharsis, who was older than the other
     men of wisdom, "Whom do you consider to be the bravest of living beings?" He replied, "The
     wildest animals; for they alone willingly die in order to maintain their freedom." <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And Croesus, believing that he had erred in his reply, and that a second
     time he would give an answer to please him, asked him, "Whom do you judge to be the most just
     of living beings?" And Anacharsis again answered, "The wildest animals; for they alone live in
     accordance with nature, not in accordance with laws; since nature is a work of God, while law
     is an ordinance of man, and it is more just to follow the institutions of God than those of
     men." <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Then Croesus, wishing to make Anacharsis appear
     ridiculous, inquired of him, "And are the beasts, then, also the wisest?" And Anacharsis agreed
     that they were, adding this explanation: "The peculiar characteristic of wisdom consists in
     showing a greater respect to the truth which nature imparts than to the ordinance of the law."
     And Croesus laughed at him and the answers he had given, as those of one coming from <placeName key="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName> and from a bestial manner of living. </p>

     living; for until that time no one may properly be considered to be blest. For it often happens
     that those who have been regarded before then as blest of Fortune all their lives have at the
     very close of their lives fallen upon the greatest misfortunes." <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The king then said, "Do you not judge me to be the wealthiest?" And Solon made the same
     reply, explaining that not those who have the greatest possessions, but those who consider
     wisdom to be the most valuable of all possessions, are to be regarded as the wealthiest; and
     that wisdom, seeing that there is nothing which can be balanced against it, confers upon those
     who value it highly, and upon them alone, a wealth which is the greatest and most secure.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Croesus then asked Bias
     whether, in his opinion, Solon had answered correctly or had erred. And he replied, "Correctly;
     for he wishes to make his decision after he has seen the possessions you have in yourself,
     whereas up to now he has seen only the possessions which lie about you; and it is through the
     former, not the latter, that men have felicity." The king said, "But even if you do not give
     first honour to wealth in gold, at least you see my friends, so great a multitude as no other
     man possesses." But Bias answered, "Even the number of friends is uncertain because of your
     good fortune." <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And Croesus, we

     drawing his sword, he announced that he had a slave all ready for slaughter, and that he would
     slay her together with the slave, as having been taken in adultery and having received at the
     hand of her husband's nearest of kin the punishment she deserved. Therefore, he continued, it
     would be the wiser thing for her to submit to his desires without calling out, and as a reward
     for her favour she would receive great gifts and be his wife and become queen, exchanging the
     hearth of a private citizen for the first place in the state. <milestone unit="section" n="3" /><placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName>, panic-stricken at so unexpected a thing

     asked them not to allow the man to go unpunished who had sinned against the laws both of
     hospitality and of kinship. As for herself, she said, it was not proper for the victim of a
     deed of such wanton insolence to look upon the sun, and plunging a dagger into her breast she
     slew herself.<bibl>Const. Exc. 2 (1), pp. 226-227.</bibl>

      <placeName key="tgn,2119029">Lucretia</placeName> by Sextus and her suicide because of the
     wrong done her, we do not believe it would be right to leave no record of the nobility of her
     choice. For the woman who renounced life of her own will in order that later generations might
     emulate her deed we should judge to be fittingly worthy of immortal praise, in order that women
     who choose to maintain the purity of their persons altogether free from censure may compare
     themselves with an authentic example. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Other women, indeed,
     even when such an act as this on their part is known, conceal what has been done, as a means of
     avoiding the punishment which is meted out for guilty acts; but she made known to the world
     what had been done in secret and then slew herself, leaving in the end of her life her fairest
     defence. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And whereas other women advance a claim for pardon in
     matters done against their will, she fixed the penalty of death for the outrage done to her by
     force, in order that, even if one should wish to defame her, he should not have it in his power
     to condemn her choice as having been made of her own free will. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />For since men by nature prefer slander to praise, she cut the ground from under the
     accusation men who love to find fault might raise; for she considered it to be shameful that
     anyone could say that while her husband, to whom she was wedded in accordance with the laws,
     was still living, she had had relations with another man, contrary to the laws, and shameful
     also that she who had been involved in an act for which the laws decree the penalty of death
     upon the guilty should cling to life any longer. And so she chose by a brief anticipation of
     death, a debt that in any case she owed to nature, to exchange disgrace for the highest
      approval.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Much the same liberty has been taken with the translation as the Byzantine excerptor undoubtedly took with the Greek of Diodorus, who never
      went to quite such pains to point a moral or was so involved.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently, not only did she win immortal glory in exchange
     for mortal life through her own act of virtue, but she also impelled her kinsmen and all the

     her. </p>

     also greatly admired by the Persians because of his sagacity and courage. This man, being
     elated by pride and at the height of his physical vigour, was eager to be the leader of great
     armaments; consequently he persuaded Xerxes to enslave the Greeks, who had ever been enemies of
     the Persians. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And Xerxes, being won over by him and desiring
     to drive all the Greeks from their homes, sent an embassy to the Carthaginians to urge them to
     join him in the undertaking and closed an agreement with them, to the effect that he would wage
     war upon the Greeks who lived in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, while the

     hundred war vessels. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="2">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Xerxes, vying with the zeal displayed by the Carthaginians,
     surpassed them in all his preparations to the degree that he excelled the Carthaginians in the
     multitude of peoples at his command. And he began to have ships built throughout all the
     territory along the sea that was subject to him, both <placeName key="tgn,7016833" >Egypt</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName> and

     of three years, as did the Carthaginians, on his preparations, he made ready more than twelve
     hundred warships. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He was aided in this by his father Darius,
     who before his death had made preparations of great armaments; for Darius, after Datis, his
     general, had been defeated by the Athenians at Marathon, had continued to be angry with the
     Athenians for having won that battle. But Darius, when already about to cross over<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">i.e. from <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> into
       <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> via the Northern Aegean.</note> against the
     Greeks, was stopped in his plans by death, whereupon Xerxes, induced both by the design of his
     father and by the counsel of Mardonius, as we have stated, made up his mind to wage war upon
     the Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when all
     preparations for the campaign had been completed, Xerxes commanded his admirals to assemble the
     ships at Cyme and <placeName key="tgn,7018000">Phocaea</placeName>, and he himself collected
     the foot and cavalry forces from all the satrapies and advanced from <placeName key="tgn,7017509">Susa</placeName>. And when he had arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Sardis" >Sardis</placeName>, he dispatched heralds to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>,
     commanding them to go to all the states and to demand of the Greeks water and earth.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The submission of water and earth was a token of fealty or non-resistance.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Then, dividing his army, he sent in advance a sufficient
     number of men both to bridge the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> and to dig
     a canal through <placeName key="tgn,7002722">Athos</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">A Persian fleet had been wrecked off the promontory of Mt. Athos in <date value="-492">492</date> B.C.</note> at the neck of the Cherronesus, in this way not only
     making the passage safe and short for his forces but also hoping by the magnitude of his
     exploits to strike the Greeks with terror before his arrival. Now the men who had been sent to
     make ready these works completed them with dispatch, because so many labourers co-operated in
     the task. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And the Greeks, when they learned of the great size
     of the Persian armaments, dispatched ten thousand hoplites into <placeName key="tgn,7001399" >Thessaly</placeName> to seize the passes of <placeName key="tgn,7014367">Tempe</placeName>;
      Synetus<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><bibl n="Hdt. 7.173">Hdt. 7.173</bibl> gives the name as Euaenetus.</note> commanded the Lacedaemonians and Themistocles the Athenians. These
     commanders dispatched ambassadors to the states and asked them to send soldiers to join in the
     common defence of the passes; for they eagerly desired that all the Greek states should each
     have a share in the defence and make common cause in the war against the Persians. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But since the larger number of the Thessalians and other Greeks who
     dwelt near the passes had given the water and earth to the envoys of Xerxes when they arrived,
     the two generals despaired of the defence at <placeName key="tgn,7014367">Tempe</placeName> and
     returned to their own soil. </p>

     the Greeks who were meeting in congress at the Isthmus<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">At
       <placeName key="tgn,7010734">Corinth</placeName>.</note> voted to make the Greeks who
     voluntarily chose the cause of the Persians pay a tithe to the gods, when they should be
     successful in the war, and to send ambassadors to those Greeks who were neutral to urge them to
     join in the struggle for the common freedom. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Of the latter,
     some joined the alliance without reservation, while others postponed any decision for a
     considerable time, clinging to their own safety alone and anxiously waiting for the outcome of
     the war; the Argives, however, sending ambassadors to the common congress, promised to join the
     alliance if the congress would give them a share in the command. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>To them the representatives declared plainly that, if they thought it a more terrible
     thing to have a Greek as general than a barbarian as master, they would do well to remain
     neutral, but if they were ambitious to secure the leadership of the Greeks, they should, it was
     stated, first have accomplished deeds deserving of this leadership and then strive for such an
     honour. After these events, when the ambassadors sent by Xerxes came to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and demanded both earth and water, all<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">That is, all the states which had joined the alliance.</note>

     one place. And he held there also the enumeration of the entire army, and the number of his
     land forces was over eight hundred thousand men, while the sum total of his ships of war
     exceeded twelve hundred, of which three hundred and twenty were Greek, the Greeks providing the
     complement of men and the king supplying the vessels. All the remaining ships were listed as
     barbarian; and of these the Egyptians supplied two hundred, the Phoenicians three hundred, the
     Cilicians eighty, the Pamphylians forty, the Lycians the same number, also the Carians eighty,

     whether he believed he was leading the soldiers to some paltry task. Whereupon he replied,
     "Ostensibly I am leading them to the defence of the passes, but in fact to die for the freedom

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Xerxes, after having enumerated his armaments, pushed on with the entire army, and the
     whole fleet accompanied the land forces in their advance as far as the city of Acanthus, and
     from there the ships passed through the place where the canal had been dug into the other sea
     expeditiously and without loss. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But when Xerxes arrived at the
     Gulf of Melis,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Diodorus, in his eagerness to recount the

     learned that the enemy had already seized the passes. Consequently, having joined to his forces
     the armament there, he summoned his allies from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" >Europe</placeName>, a little less than two hundred thousand men; so that he now possessed in
     all not less than one million soldiers exclusive of the naval contingent.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The size of Xerxes' army has been often discussed. Munro (<title>Camb. Anc.
       Hist.</title> 4, pp. 271 ff.) concludes that Xerxes had one hundred and eighty thousand combatants and a fleet of some seven hundred and thirty warships.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And the sum total of the masses who served on the ships of war
     and who transported the food and general equipment was not less than that of those we have
     mentioned, so that the account usually given of the multitude of the men gathered together by
     Xerxes need cause no amazement; for men say that the unfailing rivers ran dry because of the
     unending stream of the multitude, and that the seas were hidden by the sails of the ships.
     However this may be, the greatest forces of which any historical record has been left were
     those which accompanied Xerxes. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />After the Persians had encamped on the Spercheius River, Xerxes dispatched envoys to
      <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> to discover, among other things,
     how the Greeks felt about the war with him; and he commanded them to make this proclamation:
     "King Xerxes orders all to give up their arms, to depart unharmed to their native lands, and to
     be allies of the Persians; and to all Greeks who do this he will give more and better lands
     than they now possess." <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But when Leonidas heard the commands
     of the envoys, he replied to them: "If we should be allies of the king we should be more useful
     if we kept our arms, and if we should have to wage war against him, we should fight the better
     for our freedom if we kept them; and as for the lands which he promises to give, the Greeks
     have learned from their fathers to gain lands, not by cowardice, but by valour." </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The
     king, on hearing from his envoys the replies of the Greeks, sent for Demaratus, a Spartan who
     had been exiled from his native land and taken refuge with him, and with a scoff at the replies
     he asked the Laconian, "Will the Greeks flee more swiftly than my horses can run, or will they
     dare to face such armaments in battle?" <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And Demaratus, we are
     told, replied, "You yourself are not unacquainted with the courage of the Greeks, since you use
     Greek forces to quell such barbarians as revolt. So do not think that those who fight better
     than the Persians to maintain your sovereignty, will risk their lives less bravely against the
     Persians to maintain their own freedom." But Xerxes with a scoff at him ordered Demaratus to
     stay by his side in order that he might witness the Lacedaemonians in flight. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Xerxes with his army came against the
     Greeks at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>. And he put the Medes in
     front of all the other peoples, either because he preferred them by reason of their courage or
     because he wished to destroy them in a body; for the Medes still retained a proud spirit, the
     supremacy which their ancestors had exercised having only recently been overthrown. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And he also designated together with the Medes the brothers and sons of
     those who had fallen at Marathon, believing that they would wreak vengeance upon the Greeks
     with the greatest fury. The Medes, then, having been drawn up for battle in the manner we have
     described, attacked the defenders of <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae" >Thermopylae</placeName>; but Leonidas had made careful preparation and massed the Greeks in
     the narrowest part of the pass. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The fight which followed was a fierce one, and since the
     barbarians had the king as a witness of their valour and the Greeks kept in mind their liberty
     and were exhorted to the fray by Leonidas, it followed that the struggle was amazing.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For since the men stood shoulder to shoulder in the fighting
     and the blows were struck in close combat, and the lines were densely packed, for a
     considerable time the battle was equally balanced. But since the Greeks were superior in valour
     and in the great size of their shields, the Medes gradually gave way; for many of them were
     slain and not a few wounded. The place of the Medes in the battle was taken by Cissians and
     Sacae, selected for their valour, who had been stationed to support them; and joining the
     struggle fresh as they were against men who were worn out they withstood the hazard of combat
     for a short while, but as they were slain and pressed upon by the soldiers of Leonidas, they
     gave way. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the barbarians used small round or irregularly
     shaped shields, by which they enjoyed an advantage in open fields, since they were thus enabled
     to move more easily, but in narrow places they could not easily inflict wounds upon an enemy
     who were formed in close ranks and had their entire bodies protected by large shields, whereas
     they, being at a disadvantage by reason of the lightness of their protective armour, received
     repeated wounds. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At last
     Xerxes, seeing that the entire area about the passes was strewn with dead bodies and that the
     barbarians were not holding out against the valour of the Greeks, sent forward the picked
     Persians known as the "Immortals," who were reputed to be pre-eminent among the entire host for
     their deeds of courage. But when these also fled after only a brief resistance, then at last,
     as night fell, they ceased from battle, the barbarians having lost many dead and the Greeks a
     small number. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the following day Xerxes, now that the battle had turned out contrary
     to his expectation, choosing from all the peoples of his army such men as were reputed to be of
     outstanding bravery and daring, after an earnest exhortation announced before the battle that
     if they should storm the approach he would give them notable gifts, but if they fled the
     punishment would be death. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>These men hurled themselves upon
     the Greeks as one mighty mass and with great violence, but the soldiers of Leonidas closed
     their ranks at this time, and making their formation like a wall took up the struggle with
     ardour. And so far did they go in their eagerness that the lines which were wont to join in the
     battle by turns would not withdraw, but by their unintermitted endurance of the hardship they
     got the better and slew many of the picked barbarians. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The day
     long they spent in conflict, vying with one another; for the older soldiers challenged the
     fresh vigour of the youth, and the younger matched themselves against the experience and fame
     of their elders. And when finally even the picked barbarians turned in flight, the barbarians
     who were stationed in reserve blocked the way and would not permit the picked soldiers to flee;
     consequently they were compelled to turn back and renew the battle. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While the king was in a state of dismay, believing that
     no man would have the courage to go into battle again, there came to him a certain Trachinian,
     a native of the region, who was familiar with the mountainous area. This man was brought into
     the presence of Xerxes and undertook to conduct the Persians by way of a narrow and precipitous
     path, so that the men who accompanied him would get behind the forces of Leonidas, which, being
     surrounded in this manner, would be easily annihilated. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The
     king was delighted, and heaping presents upon the Trachinian he dispatched twenty thousand
     soldiers with him under cover of night. But a certain man among the Persians named
     Tyrrhastiadas, a Cymaean by birth, who was honourable and upright in his ways, deserting from
     the camp of the Persians in the night came to Leonidas, who knew nothing of the act of the
     Trachinian, and informed him. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Greeks, on hearing of this, gathered together about the
     middle of the night and conferred about the perils which were bearing down on them. And
     although some declared that they should relinquish the pass at once and make their way in
     safety to the allies, stating that any who remained in the place could not possibly come off
     with their lives, Leonidas, the king of the Lacedaemonians, being eagerly desirous to win both
     for himself and for the Spartans a garland of great glory, gave orders that the rest of the
     Greeks should all depart and win safety for themselves, in order that they might fight together
     with the Greeks in the battles which still remained; but as for the Lacedaemonians, he said,
     they must remain and not abandon the defence of the pass, for it was fitting that those who
     were the leaders of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> should gladly die striving
     for the meed of honour.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The heroism of the Spartans has
      been depreciated by Munro (<title>Camb. Anc. Hist.</title> 4, pp. 297 ff.) who thinks that Leonidas believed he had "one day more."</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Immediately, then, all the rest departed, but Leonidas
     together with his fellow citizens performed heroic and astounding deeds; and although the
     Lacedaemonians were but few (he detained only the Thespiaeans) and he had all told not more
     than five hundred men, he was ready to meet death on behalf of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" >Hellas</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After
     this the Persians who were led by the Trachinian, after making their way around the difficult
     terrain, suddenly caught Leonidas between their forces, and the Greeks, giving up any thought
     of their own safety and choosing renown instead, with one voice asked their commander to lead
     them against the enemy before the Persians should learn that their men had made their way
     around them. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And Leonidas, welcoming the eagerness of his
     soldiers, ordered them to prepare their breakfast quickly, since they would dine in Hades, and
     he himself, in accordance with the order he had given, took food, believing that by so doing he
     could keep his strength for a long time and endure the strain of contest. When they had hastily
     refreshed themselves and all were ready, he ordered the soldiers to attack the camp, slaying
     any who came in their way, and to strike for the very pavilion of the king. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The
     soldiers, then, in accordance with the orders given them, forming in a compact body fell by
     night upon the encampment of the Persians, Leonidas leading the attack<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><bibl n="Hdt. 7.223">Hdt. 7.223</bibl> knows nothing of this assault by the Greeks upon the Persian camp, and it is of course altogether incredible; he says that the
      fighting began about the time "when the market-place is crowded," i.e. in the forenoon, on the
      initiative of the Persians.</note> ; and the barbarians, because of the unexpectedness of the
     attack and their ignorance of the reason for it, ran together from their tents with great
     tumult and in disorder, and thinking that the soldiers who had set out with the Trachinian had
     perished and that the entire force of the Greeks was upon them, they were struck with terror.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Consequently many of them were slain by the troops of
     Leonidas, and even more perished at the hands of their comrades, who in their ignorance took
     them for enemies. For the night prevented any understanding of the true state of affairs, and
     the confusion, extending as it did throughout the entire encampment, occasioned, we may well
     believe, great slaughter; since they kept killing one another, the conditions not allowing of a
     close scrutiny, because there was no order from a general nor any demanding of a password nor,
     in general, any recovery of reason. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Indeed, if the king had
     remained at the royal pavilion, he also could easily have been slain by the Greeks and the
     whole war would have reached a speedy conclusion; but as it was, Xerxes had rushed out to the
     tumult, and the Greeks broke into the pavilion and slew almost to a man all whom they caught
     there. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So long as it was night they wandered throughout the
     entire camp seeking Xerxes&mdash;a reasonable action; but when the day dawned and the
     entire state of affairs was made manifest, the Persians, observing that the Greeks were few in
     number, viewed them with contempt; the Persians did not, however, join battle with them face to
     face, fearing their valour, but they formed on their flanks and rear, and shooting arrows and
     hurling javelins at them from every direction they slew them to a man. Now as for the soldiers
     of Leonidas who guarded the passes of <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae" >Thermopylae</placeName>, such was the end of life they met. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The merits of these men, who
     would not regard them with wonder? They with one accord did not desert the post to which
      <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> had assigned them, but gladly offered up their
     own lives for the common salvation of all Greeks, and preferred to die bravely rather than to
     live shamefully. The consternation or the Persians also, no one could doubt that they felt it.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For what man among the barbarians could have conceived of
     that which had taken place? Who could have expected that a band of only five hundred ever had
     the daring to charge against the hundred myriads? Consequently what man of later times might
     not emulate the valour of those warriors who, finding themselves in the grip of an overwhelming
     situation, though their bodies were subdued, were not conquered in spirit? These men,
     therefore, alone of all of whom history records, have in defeat been accorded a greater fame
     than all others who have won the fairest victories. For judgement must be passed upon brave
     men, not by the outcome of their actions, but by their purpose; in the one case Fortune is
     mistress, in the other it is the purpose which wins approval. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />What man would judge any to be braver than were those Spartans who, though not equal in
     number to even the thousandth part of the enemy, dared to match their valour against the
     unbelievable multitudes? Nor had they any hope of overcoming so many myriads, but they believed
     that in bravery they would surpass all men of former times, and they decided that, although the
     battle they had to fight was against the barbarians, yet the real contest and the award of
     valour they were seeking was in competition with all who had ever won admiration for their
     courage. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Indeed they alone of those of whom we have knowledge
     from time immemorial chose rather to preserve the laws of their state than their own lives, not
     feeling aggrieved that the greatest perils threatened them, but concluding that the greatest
     boon for which those who practise valour should pray is the opportunity to play a part in
     contests of this kind. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And one would be justified in believing
     that it was these men who were more responsible for the common freedom of the Greeks than those
     who were victorious at a later time in the battles against Xerxes; for when the deeds of these
     men were called to mind, the Persians were dismayed whereas the Greeks were incited to perform
     similar courageous exploits. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />And, speaking in general terms, these men alone of the Greeks down to their time passed into
     immortality because of their exceptional valour. Consequently not only the writers of history
     but also many of our poets have celebrated their brave exploits; and one of them is Simonides,
     the lyric poet, who composed the following encomium<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Frag.

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now that we have spoken at sufficient length of the valour of these men we shall
     resume the course of our narrative. Xerxes, now that he had gained the passes in the manner we
     have described and had won, as the proverb runs, a "Cadmeian victory,"<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The reference is to the dearly won victory of the Thebans over the "Seven," described in Book 4.65. The phrase is defined by Diodorus himself in Book 22 fr. 6.</note> had
     destroyed only a few of the enemy, while he had lost great numbers of his own troops. And after
     he had become master of the passes by means of his land forces, he resolved to make trial of
     contest at sea. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At once, therefore, summoning the commander of
     the fleet, Megabates, he ordered him to sail against the naval force of the Greeks and to make
     trial, with all his fleet, of a sea-battle against them. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And
     Megabates, in accordance with the king's orders, set out from Pydne in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> with all the fleet and put in at a promontory of
      <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName> which bears the name of Sepias. At this
     place a great wind arose and he lost more than three hundred warships and great numbers of
     cavalry transports and other vessels. And when the wind ceased, he weighed anchor and put in at
      <placeName key="perseus,Aphetae">Aphetae</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002751" >Magnesia</placeName>. From here he dispatched two hundred triremes, ordering the commanders to
     take a roundabout course and, by keeping <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> on the
     right, to encircle the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />The Greeks were stationed at <placeName key="perseus,Artemisium">Artemisium</placeName> in
      <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName> and had in all two hundred and eighty
     triremes; of these ships one hundred and forty were Athenian and the remainder were furnished
     by the rest of the Greeks. Their admiral was Eurybiades the Spartan, and Themistocles the
     Athenian supervised the affairs of the fleet; for the latter, by reason of his sagacity and
     skill as a general, enjoyed great favour not only with the Greeks throughout the fleet but also
     with Eurybiades himself, and all men looked to him and harkened to him eagerly. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And when a meeting of the commanders of the ships was held to discuss
     the engagement, the rest of them all favoured waiting to receive the advance of the enemy; but
     Themistocles alone expressed the opposite opinion, showing them that it was to their advantage
     to sail against the enemy with the whole fleet in one array; for in this way, he declared, they
     would have the upper hand, attacking as they would with their ships in a single body an enemy
     whose formation was broken by disorder, as it must be, for they would be issuing out of many
     harbours at some distance apart. In the end the Greeks followed the opinion of Themistocles and
     sailed against the enemy with the entire fleet. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And since the
     barbarians put out from many harbours, at the outset Themistocles, engaging with the scattered
     Persians, sank many ships and not a few he forced to turn in flight and pursued as far as the
     land; but later, when the whole fleet had gathered and a fierce battle ensued, each side gained
     the superiority in one part of the line but neither won a complete victory, and at nightfall
     the engagement was broken off. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the battle a great storm arose and destroyed many
     ships which were anchored outside the harbour, so that it appeared as if Providence were taking
     the part of the Greeks in order that, the multitude of the barbarians' ships having been
     lessened, the Greek force might become a match for them and strong enough to offer battle. As a
     result the Greeks grew ever more bold, whereas the barbarians became ever more timorous before
     the conflicts which faced them. Nevertheless, recovering themselves after the shipwreck, they
     put out with all their ships against the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And the
     Greeks, with fifty Attic triremes added to their number, took position opposed to the
     barbarians. The sea-battle which followed was much like the fighting at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName>; for the Persians were resolved to overwhelm

     fled for safety to the rugged regions about Mount Parnassus. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Then the king passed through the territory of the Dorians, doing it no harm since they were
     allies of the Persians. Here he left behind a portion of his army and ordered it to proceed to
      <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, to burn the precinct of Apollo and to
     carry off the votive offerings, while he advanced into <placeName key="tgn,7002683" >Boeotia</placeName> with the rest of the barbarians and encamped there. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The force that had been dispatched to sack the oracle had proceeded as
     far as the shrine of Athena Pronaea, but at that spot a great thunderstorm, accompanied by
     incessant lightning, suddenly burst from the heavens, and more than that, the storm wrenched
     loose huge rocks and hurled them into the host of the barbarians; the result was that large
     numbers of the Persians were killed and the whole force, dismayed at the intervention of the
     gods, fled from the region. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So the oracle of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, with the aid of some divine Providence, escaped
     pillage. And the Delphians, desiring to leave to succeeding generations a deathless memorial of
     the appearance of the gods among men, set up beside the temple of Athena Pronaea<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">This temple of Athena Pronaea ("of the fore-shrine") lay just

      Athena<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The temenos of Athena was the entire Acropolis.</note> had been razed, were exceedingly disheartened. And likewise great fear
     gripped the other Greeks who, driven from every quarter, were now cooped up in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> alone. Consequently they thought it desirable that
     all who had been charged with command should meet in council and deliberate regarding the kind
     of place that would best serve their purpose in fighting a naval battle. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Many ideas of various kinds were expressed. The Peloponnesians, thinking
     only of their own safety, declared that the contest should be held at the Isthmus; for it had
     been strongly fortified with a wall, and so, if they should suffer any reverse in the battle,
     the defeated would be able to withdraw for refuge into the most suitable place of safety
     available, the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, whereas, if they cooped
     themselves up in the little island of <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, perils
     would beset them from which it would be difficult for them to be rescued. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But Themistocles counselled that the contest of the ships be held at
      <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, for he believed that those who had few ships
     to fight with would have many advantages, in the narrows of <placeName key="tgn,7002340" >Salamis</placeName>, against a vastly superior number of vessels. And speaking generally, he
     showed that the region about the Isthmus would be altogether unsuitable for the sea-battle; for
     the contest would take place on the open sea, and the Persians because of the room for
     manoeuvring would easily subdue the small force of ships by their vastly superior numbers. And
     by presenting in like fashion many other facts pertinent to the occasion he persuaded all
     present to cast their votes with him for the plan he recommended. </p>

     decision was reached by all to fight the sea-battle at <placeName key="tgn,7002340" >Salamis</placeName>, the Greeks set about making the preparations necessary to meet the
     Persians and the peril of battle. Accordingly Eurybiades, accompanied by Themistocles,
     undertook to encourage the crews and incite them to face the impending struggle. However, the
     crews would not heed them, but since they were one and all dismayed at the magnitude of the
     Persian forces, not a man of them paid any attention to his commander, every one being intent
     upon sailing from <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And the army of

     loss at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> of their most illustrious
     warriors caused them dismay, but also the disasters which were taking place in <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> before their very eyes were filling the Greeks with utter
     despair. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Meanwhile the members of the congress of the Greeks,
     observing the unrest of the masses and the dismay prevailing everywhere, voted to build a wall
     across the Isthmus. The works were completed speedily because of the enthusiasm and the
     multitude of those engaged in the task; but while the Peloponnesians were strengthening the
     wall, which extended a distance of forty stades, from Lechaeum to Cenchreae, the forces which
     were inactive at <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, together with the entire

<div2 type="chapter" n="17">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Themistocles, perceiving that the admiral, Eurybiades, was unable to overcome the mood
     of his forces, and yet recognizing that the narrow quarters at <placeName key="tgn,7002340" >Salamis</placeName> could be a great aid in achieving the victory, contrived the following
     ruse: He induced a certain man to desert to Xerxes and to assure him that the ships at
      <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> were going to slip away from that region and
     assemble at the Isthmus. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Accordingly the king, believing the
     man because what he reported was in itself plausible, made haste to prevent the naval forces of
     the Greeks from making contact with their armies on land. Therefore he at once dispatched the
     Egyptian fleet with orders to block the strait which separates <placeName key="tgn,7002340" >Salamis</placeName> from the territory of <placeName key="tgn,7017133" >Megaris</placeName>.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">This closed the route by which the

     he dispatched to <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, ordering it to establish
     contact with the enemy and by fighting there decide the issue. The triremes were drawn up by
     peoples one after another, in order that, speaking the same language and knowing one another,
     the several contingents might assist each other with alacrity. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />When the fleet had been drawn up in this manner, the right wing was held by the Phoenicians
     and the left by the Greeks who were associated with the Persians.<milestone unit="para" ed="P" />The commanders of the Ionian contingents of the Persian fleet sent a man of <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName> to the Greeks to inform them of what the king had decided
     to do and of the disposition of his forces for battle, and to say that in the course of the
     battle they were going to desert from the barbarians. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And when
     the Samian had swum across without being observed and had informed Eurybiades about this plan,
     Themistocles, realizing that his stratagem had worked out as he had planned, was beside himself
     with joy and exhorted the crews to the fight; and as for the Greeks, they were emboldened by
     the promise of the Ionians, and although the circumstances were compelling them to fight
     against their own preference, they came down eagerly in a body from <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> to the shore in preparation for the sea-battle.

<div2 type="chapter" n="18">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When at last Eurybiades and Themistocles had completed the disposition of their
     forces, the left wing was held by the Athenians and Lacedaemonians, who in this way would be
     opposed to the ships of the Phoenicians; for the Phoenicians possessed a distinct superiority
     by reason both of their great number and of the experience in seamanship which they inherited
     from their ancestors. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Aeginetans and Megarians formed the
     right wing, since they were generally considered to be the best seamen after the Athenians and
     it was believed that they would show the best spirit, seeing that they alone of the Greeks
     would have no place of refuge in case any reverse should occur in the course of the battle. The
     centre was held by the rest of the Greek forces.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This, then, was
     the battle-order in which the Greeks sailed out, and they occupied the strait between
      <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> and the Heracleium<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The Heracleium was a shrine of Heracles on the mainland where only a narrow

     the king gave order to his admiral to advance against the enemy, while he himself moved down
     the coast to a spot directly opposite <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> from
     which he could watch the course of the battle. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Persians,
     as they advanced, could at the outset maintain their line, since they had plenty of space; but
     when they came to the narrow passage, they were compelled to withdraw some ships from the line,
     creating in this way much disorder. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The admiral, who was
     leading the way before the line and was the first to begin the fighting, was slain after having
     acquitted himself valiantly. When his ship went down, disorder seized the barbarian fleet, for
     there were many now to give orders, but each man did not issue the same commands. Consequently
     they halted the advance, and holding back their ships, they began to withdraw to where there
     was plenty of room. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Athenians, observing the disorder
     among the barbarians, now advanced upon the enemy, and some of their ships they struck with
     their rams, while from others they sheared off the rows of oars; and when the men at the oars
     could no longer do their work, many Persian triremes, getting sidewise to the enemy, were time
     and again severely damaged by the beaks of the ships. Consequently they ceased merely backing
     water, but turned about and fled precipitately. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="19">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While the Phoenician and Cyprian ships
     were being mastered by the Athenians, the vessels of the Cilicians and Pamphylians, and also of
     the Lycians, which followed them in line, at first were holding out stoutly, but when they saw
     the strongest ships taking to flight they likewise abandoned the fight. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>On the other wing the battle was stubbornly fought and for some time the
     struggle was evenly balanced; but when the Athenians had pursued the Phoenicians and Cyprians
     to the shore and then turned back, the barbarians, being forced out of line by the returning
     Athenians, turned about and lost many of their ships. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In this
     manner, then, the Greeks gained the upper hand and won a most renowned naval victory over the
     barbarians; and in the struggle forty ships were lost by the Greeks, but more than two hundred
     by the Persians, not including those which were captured together with their crews. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The king, for whom the defeat was
     unexpected, put to death those Phoenicians who were chiefly responsible for beginning the
     flight, and threatened to visit upon the rest the punishment they deserved. And the
     Phoenicians, frightened by his threats, first put into port on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, and then, when night fell, set sail for <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But Themistocles, who was
     credited for having brought about the victory, devised another stratagem no less clever than
     the one we have described. For, since the Greeks were afraid to battle on land against so many
     myriads of Persians, he greatly reduced the number of the Persian troops in the following
     manner: he sent to Xerxes the attendant of his own sons to inform him that the Greeks were
     about to sail to the bridge of boats<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Over the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> (chap. 3.6).</note> and to destroy it. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Accordingly the king, believing the report because it was plausible,
     became fearful lest he should be cut off from the route whereby he could get back to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, now that the Greeks controlled the sea, and decided to
     cross over in all possible haste from <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> into
      <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, leaving Mardonius behind in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> with picked cavalry and infantry, the total number of

     had agreed with the Persians to subdue the Greeks of <placeName key="tgn,7003122" >Sicily</placeName> at the same time and had made preparations on a large scale of such
     materials as would be useful in carrying on a war. And when they had made everything ready,
     they chose for general Hamilcar, having selected him as the man who was held by them in the
     highest esteem. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He assumed command of huge forces, both land
     and naval, and sailed forth from <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> with an
     army of not less than three hundred thousand men and a fleet of over two hundred ships of war,
     not to mention many cargo ships for carrying supplies, numbering more than three thousand. Now
     as he was crossing the Libyan sea he encountered a storm and lost the vessels which were
     carrying the horses and chariots. And when he came to port in <placeName key="tgn,7003122" >Sicily</placeName> in the harbour of <placeName key="perseus,Panormus" >Panormus</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><placeName key="tgn,7003928" >Palermo</placeName>.</note> he remarked that he had finished the war; for he had been afraid
     that the sea would rescue the Siceliotes from the perils of the conflict. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He took three days to rest his soldiers and to repair the damage which
     the storm had inflicted on his ships, and then advanced together with his host against Himera,
     the fleet skirting the coast with him. And when he had arrived near the city we have just
     mentioned, he pitched two camps, the one for the army and the other for the naval force. All
     the warships he hauled up on land and threw about them a deep ditch and a wooden palisade, and
     he strengthened the camp of the army, which he placed so that it fronted the city, and
     prolonged so that it took in the area from the wall extending along the naval camp as far as
     the hills which overhung the city. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Speaking generally, he took
     control of the entire west side, after which he unloaded all the supplies from the cargo
     vessels and at once sent off all these boats, ordering them to bring grain and the other
     supplies from <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003121" >Sardinia</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Then, taking his best troops, he
     advanced to the city, and routing the Himerans who came out against him and slaying many of
     them, he struck the inhabitants of the city with terror. Consequently Theron, the ruler of the
     Acragantini, who with a considerable force was standing by to guard Himera, in fear hastily
     sent word to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, asking Gelon to come to
     his aid as rapidly as possible. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="21">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Gelon, who had likewise held his army in readiness, on
     learning that the Himerans were in despair set out from <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse" >Syracuse</placeName> with all speed, accompanied by not less than fifty thousand
     foot-soldiers and over five thousand cavalry. He covered the distance swiftly, and as he drew
     near the city of the Himerans he inspired boldness in the hearts of those who before had been
     dismayed at the forces of the Carthaginians. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For after
     pitching a camp which was appropriate to the terrain about the city, he not only fortified it
     with a deep ditch and a palisade but also dispatched his entire body of cavalry against such
     forces of the enemy as were ranging over the countryside in search of booty. And the cavalry,
     unexpectedly appearing to men who were scattered without military order over the countryside,
     took prisoner as many as each man could drive before him. And when prisoners to the number of
     more than ten thousand had been brought into the city, not only was Gelon accorded great
     approbation but the Himerans also came to hold the enemy in contempt. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Following up what he had already accomplished, all the gates which Theron through fear
     had formerly blocked up were now, on the contrary, opened up by Gelon through his contempt of
     the enemy, and he even constructed additional ones which might prove serviceable to him in case
     of urgent need.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In a word Gelon, excelling as he did in skill as
     a general and in shrewdness, set about at once to discover how he might without any risk to his
     army outgeneral the barbarians and utterly destroy their power. And his own ingenuity was
     greatly aided by accident, because of the following circumstance. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He had decided to set fire to the ships of the enemy; and while Hamilcar was occupied
     in the naval camp with the preparation of a magnificent sacrifice to Poseidon,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Although Diodorus states below that Hamilcar was slain in
      battle, <bibl n="Hdt. 7.179">Hdt. 7.179</bibl> says that he threw himself into the fire on which he was pouring libations and offering whole victims in order to bring victory. If this
      self-immolation is authentic, the god to whom he was sacrificing was in all probability the
      Phoenician Melcarth, the Biblical Moloch.</note> cavalrymen came from the countryside bringing
     to Gelon a letter-carrier who was conveying dispatches from the people of <placeName key="perseus,Selinus">Selinus</placeName>, in which was written that they would send the
     cavalry for that day for which Hamilcar had written to dispatch them. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The day was that on which Hamilcar planned to celebrate the sacrifice. And on that day
     Gelon dispatched cavalry of his own, who were under orders to skirt the immediate neighbourhood
     and to ride up at daybreak to the naval camp, as if they were the allies from <placeName key="perseus,Selinus">Selinus</placeName>, and when they had once got inside the wooden
     palisade, to slay Hamilcar and set fire to the ships. He also sent scouts to the hills which
     overlook the city, ordering them to raise the signal as soon as they saw that the horsemen were
     inside the wall. For his part, at daybreak he drew up his army and awaited the sign which was
     to come from the scouts. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="22">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At sunrise the cavalrymen rode up to the naval camp of the
     Carthaginians, and when the guards admitted them, thinking them to be allies, they at once
     galloped to where Hamilcar was busied with the sacrifice, slew him, and then set fire to the
     ships; thereupon the scouts raised the signal and Gelon advanced with his entire army in battle
     order against the Carthaginian camp. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The commanders of the
     Phoenicians in the camp at the outset led out their troops to meet the Siceliotes and as the
     lines closed they put up a vigorous fight; at the same time in both camps they sounded with the
     trumpets the signal for battle and a shout arose from the two armies one after the other, each
     eagerly striving to outdo their adversaries in the volume of their cheering. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The slaughter was great, and the battle was swaying back and forth, when
     suddenly the flames from the ships began to rise on high and sundry persons reported that the
     general had been slain; then the Greeks were emboldened and with spirits elated at the rumours
     and by the hope of victory they pressed with greater boldness upon the barbarians, while the
     Carthaginians, dismayed and despairing of victory, turned in flight. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Since Gelon had given orders to take no prisoners, there
     followed a great slaughter of the enemy in their flight, and in the end no less than one
     hundred and fifty thousand of them were slain. All who escaped the battle and fled to a strong
     position at first warded off the attackers, but the position they had seized had no water, and
     thirst compelled them to surrender to the victors. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Gelon, who
     had won a victory in a most remarkable battle and had gained his success primarily by reason of
     his own skill as a general, acquired a fame that was noised abroad, not only among the
     Siceliotes, but among all other men as well; <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>for memory
     recalls no man before him who had used a stratagem like this, nor one who had slain more
     barbarians in one engagement or had taken so great a multitude of prisoners. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="23">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Because
     of this achievement many historians compare this battle with the one which the Greeks fought at
      <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName> and the stratagem of Gelon with the
     ingenious schemes of Themistocles, and the first place they assign, since such exceptional
     merit was shown by both men, some to the one and some to the other. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And the reason is that, when the people of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" >Greece</placeName> on the one hand and those of <placeName key="tgn,7003122" >Sicily</placeName> on the other were struck with dismay before the conflict at the multitude
     of the barbarian armies, it was the prior victory of the Sicilian Greeks which gave courage to
     the people of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> when they learned of Gelon's
     victory; and as for the men in both affairs who held the supreme command, we know that in the
     case of the Persians the king escaped with his life and many myriads together with him, whereas
     in the case of the Carthaginians not only did the general perish but also everyone who

<div2 type="chapter" n="24">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now it so happened that Gelon won his

     victory and the most honourable defeat should take place at the same time. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>After the battle at the city of the Himerans twenty warships made their
     escape from the fight, being those which Hamilcar, to serve his routine requirements, had not
     hauled up on shore. Consequently, although practically all the rest of the combatants were
     either slain or taken prisoner, these vessels managed to set sail before they were noticed. But
     they picked up many fugitives, and while heavily laden on this account, they encountered a
     storm and were all lost. A handful only of survivors got safely to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> in a small boat to give their fellow citizens a
     statement which was brief: "All who crossed over to <placeName key="tgn,7003122" >Sicily</placeName> have perished." <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Carthaginians, who had suffered a great disaster so contrary to their hopes, were
     so terror-stricken that every night they kept vigil guarding the city, in the belief that Gelon
     with his entire force must have decided to sail forthwith against <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And because of
     the multitude of the lost the city went into public mourning, while privately the homes of
     citizens were filled with wailing and lamentation. For some kept inquiring after sons, others
     after brothers, while a very large number of children who had lost their fathers, alone now in
     the world, grieved at the death of those who had begotten them and at their own desolation
     through the loss of those who could succour them. And the Carthaginians, fearing lest Gelon
     should forestall them in crossing over to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, at
     once dispatched to him as ambassadors plenipotentiary their ablest orators and counsellors.

<div2 type="chapter" n="25">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for Gelon, after his victory he not only honoured with gifts the horsemen who had
     slain Hamilcar but also decorated with rewards for prowess all others who had played the part
     of men. The fairest part of the booty he put to one side, since he wished to embellish the
     temples of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> with the spoils; as for the
     rest of the booty, much of it he nailed to the most notable of the temples in <placeName key="perseus,Himera">Himera</placeName>, and the rest of it, together with the captives, he
     divided among the allies, apportioning it in accordance with the number who had served with
     him. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The cities put the captives allotted to them in chains
     and used them for building their public works. A very great number was received by the
     Acragantini, who embellished their city and countryside; for so great was the multitude of
     prisoners at their disposal that many private citizens had five hundred captives in their
     homes. A contributing reason for the vast number of the captives among them was not only that
     they had sent many soldiers into the battle, but also that, when the flight took place, many of
     the fugitives turned into the interior, especially into the territory of the Acragantini, and
     since every man of them was taken captive by the Acragantini, the city was crammed full of the
     captured. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Most of these were handed over to the state, and it
     was these men who quarried the stones of which not only the largest temples of the gods were
     constructed but also the underground conduits were built to lead off the waters from the city;
     these are so large that their construction is well worth seeing, although it is little thought
     of since they were built at slight expense. The builder in charge of these works, who bore the
     name of Phaeax, brought it about that, because of the fame of the construction, the underground
     conduits got the name "Phaeaces" from him. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Acragantini
     also built an expensive kolumbethra,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >"Swimming-bath."</note> seven stades in circumference and twenty cubits deep. Into it the
     waters from rivers and springs were conducted and it became a fish-pond, which supplied fish in
     great abundance to be used for food and to please the palate; and since swans also in the
     greatest numbers settled down upon it, the pool came to be a delight to look upon. In later
     years, however, the pool became choked up through neglect and was destroyed by the long passage
     of time; <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>but the entire site, which was fertile, the
     inhabitants planted in vines and in trees of every description placed close together, so that
     they derived from it great revenues.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Gelon, after dismissing the
     allies, led the citizens of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> back home,
     and because of the magnitude of his success he was enthusiastically received not only among his
     fellow citizens but also throughout the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7003122" >Sicily</placeName>; for he brought with him such a multitude of captives that it looked as if
     the island had made the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> captive.

     formerly opposed him, asking forgiveness for their past mistakes and promising for the future
     to carry out his every command. With all of them he dealt equitably and concluded alliances,
     bearing his good fortune as men should, not toward them alone but even toward the
     Carthaginians, his bitterest foes. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For when the ambassadors
     who had been dispatched from <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> came to him
     and begged him with tears to treat them humanely, he granted them peace, exacting of them the
     expense he had incurred for the war, two thousand talents of silver, and requiring them further
     to build two temples in which they should place copies of the treaty. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Carthaginians, having unexpectedly gained their deliverance, not only agreed to all
     this but also promised to give in addition a gold crown to Damarete, the wife of Gelon. For
     Damarete at their request had contributed the greatest aid toward the conclusion of the peace,
     and when she had received the crown of one hundred gold talents from them, she struck a coin
     which was called from her a <emph>Damareteion.</emph> This was worth ten Attic drachmas and was

     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Gelon treated all men fairly,
     primarily because that was his disposition, but not the least motive was that he was eager to
     make all men his own by acts of goodwill. For instance, he was making ready to sail to
      <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> with a large force and to join the Greeks in
     their war against the Persians. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And he was already on the
     point of setting out to sea, when certain men from <placeName key="perseus,Corinth" >Corinth</placeName> put in at <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and
     brought the news that the Greeks had won the sea-battle at <placeName key="tgn,7002340" >Salamis</placeName> and that Xerxes and a part of his armament had retreated from <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>. Consequently he stopped his preparations for departure,
     while welcoming the enthusiasm of the soldiers; and then he called them to an assembly, issuing
     orders for each man to appear fully armed. As for himself, he came to the assembly not only
     with no arms but not even wearing a tunic and clad only in a cloak, and stepping forward he
     rendered an account of his whole life and of all he had done for the Syracusans; <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>and when the throng shouted its approval at each action he mentioned and
     showed especially its amazement that he had given himself unarmed into the hands of any who
     might wish to slay him, so far was he from being a victim of vengeance as a tyrant that they
     united in acclaiming him with one voice Benefactor and Saviour and King.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">This acclaim recognized his rule as constitutional, not "tyrannical."</note>

     believed to have been responsible for the victory, and on this account were themselves
     exultant, it became manifest to all that they were intending to dispute with the Lacedaemonians
     for the leadership on the sea; consequently the Lacedaemonians, foreseeing what was going to
     happen, did all they could to humble the pride of the Athenians. When, therefore, a judgement
     was proposed to determine the prizes to be awarded for valour, through the superior favour they
     enjoyed they caused the decision to be that of states <placeName key="tgn,7011087" >Aegina</placeName> had won the prize, and of men Ameinias of <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName>, the brother of Aeschylus the poet; for Ameinias, while commanding a

     undeserved humiliation, the Lacedaemonians, fearful lest Themistocles should be displeased at
     the outcome and should devise some great evil against them and the Greeks, honoured him with
     double the number of gifts awarded to those who had received the prize of valour. And when
     Themistocles accepted the gifts, the Athenians in assembly removed him from the generalship and

<div2 type="chapter" n="28">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the estrangement which
     had arisen between the Athenians and the other Greeks became noised abroad, there came to
      <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> ambassadors from the Persians and from the
     Greeks. Now those who had been dispatched by the Persians bore word that Mardonius the general
     assured the Athenians that, if they should choose the cause of the Persians, he would give them
     their choice of any land in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, rebuild their
     walls and temples, and allow the city to live under its own laws; but those who had been sent
     from the Lacedaemonians begged the Athenians not to yield to the persuasions of the barbarians
     but to maintain their loyalty toward the Greeks, who were men of their own blood and of the
     same speech. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And the Athenians replied to the barbarians that
     the Persians possessed no land rich enough nor gold in sufficient abundance which the Athenians
     would accept in return for abandoning the Greeks; while to the Lacedaemonians they said that as
     for themselves the concern which they had formerly held for the welfare of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> they would endeavour to maintain hereafter also, and of
     the Lacedaemonians they only asked that they should come with all speed to <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> together with all their allies. For it was evident, they
     added, that Mardonius, now that the Athenians had declared against him, would advance with his
     army against <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. And this is what actually took
     place. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For Mardonius, who was stationed in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> with all his forces, at first attempted to cause certain
     cities in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> to come over to him,
     distributing money among their leading men, but afterwards, when he learned of the reply the
     Athenians had given, in his rage he led his entire force into <placeName key="tgn,7002681" >Attica</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Apart from the army Xerxes had given him
     he had himself gathered many other soldiers from <placeName key="tgn,7002756" >Thrace</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName> and the other allied
     states, more than two hundred thousand men. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>With the advance
     into <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> of so large a force as this, the Athenians
     dispatched couriers bearing letters to the Lacedaemonians, asking their aid; and since the
     Lacedaemonians still loitered and the barbarians had already crossed the border of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, they were dismayed, and again, taking their children and
     wives and whatever else they were able to carry off in their haste, they left their native land
     and a second time fled for refuge to <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And Mardonius was so angry with them that he ravaged the

     battle. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The oath ran as follows: "I will not hold life dearer
     than liberty, nor will I desert the leaders, whether they be living or dead, but I will bury
     all the allies who have perished in the battle; and if I overcome the barbarians in the war, I

      well have been in the oath.</note> ; nor will I rebuild any one of the sanctuaries which have
     been burnt or demolished, but I will let them be and leave them as a reminder to coming
     generations of the impiety of the barbarians." <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After they had
     sworn the oath, they marched to <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> through the
     pass of Cithaeron, and when they had descended as far as the foothills near Erythrae, they
     pitched camp there. The command over the Athenians was held by Aristeides, and the supreme

     marched forth from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, and when he arrived at
     the Asopus River he pitched a camp, which he strengthened by means of a deep ditch and
     surrounded with a wooden palisade. The total number of the Greeks approached one hundred
     thousand men, that of the barbarians some five hundred thousand.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The size of the Greek army is probably slightly exaggerated, that of the Persian greatly.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The first to open the battle were the barbarians, who poured
     out upon the Greeks by night and charged with all their cavalry upon the camp. The Athenians
     observed them in time and with their army in battle formation boldly advanced to meet them, and
     a mighty battle ensued. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In the end all the rest of the Greeks
     put to flight the barbarians who were arrayed against them; but the Megarians alone, who faced
     the commander of the cavalry and the best horsemen the Persians had, being hard pressed in the
     fighting, though they did not leave their position, sent some of their men as messengers to the
     Athenians and Lacedaemonians asking them to come to their aid with all speed. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Aristeides quickly dispatched the picked Athenians who constituted his
     body-guard, and these, forming themselves into a compact body and falling on the barbarians,
     rescued the Megarians from the perils which threatened them, slew of the Persians both the
     commander of the cavalry and many others, and put the remainder to flight.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Greeks, now that they had shown their superiority so brilliantly in a
     kind of dress rehearsal, were encouraged to hope for a decisive victory; and after this
     encounter they moved their camp from the foot-hills to a place which was better suited to a
     complete victory. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For on the right was a high hill, on the
     left the Asopus River, and the space between was held by the camp, which was fortified by the
     natural impregnability of the general terrain. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Thus for the
     Greeks, who had laid their plans wisely, the limited space was a great aid to their victory,
     since the Persian battle-line could not be extended to a great length, and the result was, as
     the event was to show, that no use could be made of the many myriads of the barbarians.
     Consequently Pausanias and Aristeides, placing their confidence in the position they held, led
     the army out to battle, and when they had taken positions in a manner suitable to the terrain
     they advanced against the enemy. </p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Mardonius, having been forced to increase the depth of

     led the way, striking at the Lacedaemonians who faced him; he fought gallantly and slew many of
     the Greeks. The Lacedaemonians, however, opposed him stoutly and endured every peril of battle
     willingly, and so there was a great slaughter of the barbarians. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now so long as Mardonius and his picked soldiers continued to bear the brunt of the
     fighting, the barbarians sustained the shock of battle with good spirit; but when Mardonius
     fell, fighting bravely, and of the picked troops some were slain and others wounded, their
     spirits were dashed and they began to flee. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When the Greeks
     pressed hard upon them, the larger part of the barbarians fled for safety within the palisade,
     but as for the rest of the army, the Greeks serving with Mardonius withdrew to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, and the remainder, over four hundred thousand in

     barbarians fighting bravely from the fortified positions they held and the Greeks storming the
     wooden walls, and many were wounded as they fought desperately, while not a few were also slain
     by the multitude of missiles and met death with stout hearts. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />Nevertheless the powerful onset of the Greeks could be withstood neither by the wall the
     barbarians had erected not by their great numbers, but resistance of every kind was forced to
     give way; for it was a case of rivalry between the foremost peoples of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, the Lacedaemonians and the Athenians, who were buoyed up
     by reason of their former victories and supported by confidence in their valour. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In the end the barbarians were overpowered, and they found no mercy even
     though they pled to be taken prisoner. For the Greek general, Pausanias, observing how superior
     the barbarians were in number, took pains to prevent anything due to miscalculation from
     happening, the barbarians being many times more numerous than the Greeks; consequently he had
     issued orders to take no man prisoner, and soon there was an incredible number of dead. And in
     the end, when the Greeks had slaughtered more than one hundred thousand of the barbarians, they
     reluctantly ceased slaying the enemy. </p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Also in <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName> the Greeks fought a great
     battle with the Persians on the same day as that which took place in <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>, and since we propose to describe it, we shall take
     up the account of it from the beginning. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Leotychides the
     Lacedaemonian and Xanthippus<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The father of Pericles.</note> the Athenian, the commanders of the naval force, after the battle of
      <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> collected the fleet in <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>, and after spending some days there they sailed to
      <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> with two hundred and fifty triremes. And
     while they lay at anchor there, ambassadors came to them from <placeName key="tgn,7002673" >Samos</placeName> asking them to liberate the Greeks of <placeName key="tgn,1000004" >Asia</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Leotychides took counsel with the
     commanders, and after they had heard all the Samians had to say, they decided to undertake to
     liberate the cities and speedily sailed forth from <placeName key="perseus,Delos" >Delos</placeName>. When the Persian admirals, who were then at <placeName key="tgn,7002673" >Samos</placeName>, learned that the Greeks were sailing against them, they withdrew from
      <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName> with all their ships, and putting into port at
     Mycale in <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName> they hauled up their ships, since they
     saw that the vessels were unequal to offering battle, and threw about them a wooden palisade
     and a deep ditch; despite these defences they also summoned land forces from <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName> and the neighbouring cities and gathered in all about
     one hundred thousand men. Furthermore, they made ready all the other equipment that is useful
     in war, believing that the Ionians also would go over to the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Leotychides advanced with all the fleet ready for action against the barbarians at
     Mycale, dispatching in advance a ship carrying a herald who had the strongest voice of anyone
     in the fleet. This man had been ordered to sail up to the enemy and to announce in a loud
     voice, "The Greeks, having conquered the Persians, are now come to liberate the Greek cities of
      <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>." <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>This
     Leotychides did in the belief that the Greeks in the army of the barbarians would revolt from
     the Persians and that great confusion would arise in the camp of the barbarians; and that is
     what actually happened. For as soon as the herald approached the ships which had been hauled up
     on the shore, and made the announcement as he had been ordered, it came about that the Persians
     lost confidence in the Greeks and that the Greeks began to agree among themselves about
     revolting. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="35">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the Greeks under Leotychides had found out how the Greeks in the
     Persians' camp felt, they disembarked their forces. And on the following day, while they were
     making preparation for battle, the rumour came to them of the victory which the Greeks had won
     over the Persians at <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At this news Leotychides, after calling an assembly, exhorted his troops
     to the battle, and among the other considerations which he presented to them he announced in
     histrionic manner the victory of <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>, in the
     belief that he would make more confident those who were about to fight. And marvellous indeed
     was the outcome. For it has become known that it was on the same day that the two battles took
     place, the one which was fought at Mycale and the other which occurred at <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>It would seem,
     therefore, that Leotychides had not yet learned of the victory, but that he was deliberately
     inventing the military success and did so as a stratagem; for the great distance separating the
     places proved that the transmission of the message was impossible. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But the leaders of the Persians, placing no confidence in the Greeks of their own
     forces, took away their arms and gave them to men who were friendly to them; and then they
     called all the soldiers together and told them that Xerxes was coming in person to their aid
     with a great armament, inspiring them thereby with courage to face the peril of the battle.

<div2 type="chapter" n="36">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When both sides had drawn out their troops in battle-order and were advancing against
     each other, the Persians, observing how few the enemy were, disdained them and bore down on
     them with great shouting. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now the Samians and Milesians had
     decided unanimously beforehand to support the Greek cause and were pushing forward all together
     at the double; and as their advance brought them in sight of the Greek army, although the
     Ionians thought that the Greeks would be encouraged, the result was the very opposite.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the troops of Leotychides, thinking that Xerxes was come
     from <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName> with his army and advancing upon them,
     were filled with fear, and confusion and division among themselves arose in the army, some
     saying that they should take to their ships with all speed and depart and others that they
     should remain and boldly hold their lines. While they were still in disorder, the Persians came
     in sight, equipped in a manner to inspire terror and bearing down on them with shouting.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Greeks, having no respite for deliberation, were
     compelled to withstand the attack of the barbarians.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At the

     courage, whereas the barbarians were filled with terror and broke in flight. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>A great slaughter followed, as the troops of Leotychides and Xanthippus
     pressed upon the beaten barbarians and pursued them as far as the camp; and Aeolians
     participated in the battle, after the issue had already been decided, as well as many other
     peoples of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, since an overwhelming desire for
     their liberty entered the hearts of the inhabitants of the cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Therefore practically all
     of them gave no thought either to hostages<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Held by the Persians as sureties of the faithfulness of the Greek contingents to their oaths of loyalty to
      the Persians.</note> or to oaths, but they joined with the other Greeks in slaying the
     barbarians in their flight. This was the manner in which the Persians suffered defeat, and
     there were slain of them more than forty thousand, while of the survivors some found refuge in
     the camp and others withdrew to <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And when Xerxes learned of both the defeat in <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName> and the rout of his own troops in Mycale, he left a
     portion of his armament in <placeName key="perseus,Sardis">Sardis</placeName> to carry on the

     now sailed back to <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName> and made allies of the

     always have the enemy on their borders, an enemy far superior in military strength, while their
     allies, who lived across the sea, would be unable to render them any timely assistance. When
     the Aeolians and Ionians had heard these promises, they resolved to take the advice of the
     Greeks and set about preparing to sail with them to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" >Europe</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But the Athenians changed to the opposite
     opinion and advised them to stay where they were, saying that even if no other Greeks should
     come to their aid, the Athenians, as their kinsmen, would do so independently. They reasoned
     that, if the Ionians were given new homes by the Greeks acting in common they would no longer
     look upon <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> as their mother-city. It was for

     dispatched ambassadors to Athens who would ostensibly advise them not at present to fortify the

     all Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He was, therefore, elated over his fame and had
     recourse to many other far more ambitious undertakings which would serve to increase the
     dominant position of his native state. Thus the Peiraeus, as it is called, was not at that time
     a harbour, but the Athenians were using as their ship-yard the bay called Phaleric, which was
     quite small; and so Themistocles conceived the plan of making the Peiraeus into a harbour,
     since it would require only a small amount of construction and could be made into a harbour,
     the best and largest in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He also hoped that when this improvement had been added to what the
     Athenians possessed, the city would be able to compete for the hegemony at sea; for the
     Athenians possessed at that time the largest number of triremes and through an unbroken
     succession of battles at sea which the city had waged had gained experience and renown in naval
     conflicts. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Furthermore, he reasoned that they would have the
     Ionians on their side because they were kinsmen, and that with their aid the Athenians would
     liberate the other Greeks of Asia, who would then turn in goodwill to the Athenians because of
     this benefaction, and that all the Greeks of the islands, being immensely impressed by the
     magnitude of their naval strength, would readily align themselves with the people which had the
     power both to inflict the greatest injury and to bestow the greatest advantages. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For he saw that the Lacedaemonians, though excellently equipped so far
     as their land forces were concerned, had no natural talent for fighting on ships. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="42">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now as
     Themistocles pondered these matters, he decided that he should not make public announcement of
     his plan, knowing with certainty that the Lacedaemonians would endeavour to stop it; and so he
     announced to the citizens in Assembly that he wished both to advise upon and to introduce
     important matters which were also to the advantage of the city. But what these matters were, he
     added, it was not in the public interest to state openly, but it was fitting that a few men
     should be charged with putting them into effect; and he therefore asked the people to select
     two men in whom they had the greatest confidence and to entrust to them to pass upon the matter
     in question. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The people acceded to his advice, and the
     Assembly chose two men, Aristeides and Xanthippus, selecting them not only because of their
     upright character, but also because they saw that these men were in active rivalry with
     Themistocles for glory and leadership and were therefore opposed to him. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>These men heard privately from Themistocles about his plan and then
     declared to the Assembly that what Themistocles had disclosed to them was of great importance,
     was to the advantage of the state, and was feasible. <milestone unit="section" n="4" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The people admired the man and at the same time harboured
     suspicions of him, lest it should be with the purpose of preparing some sort of tyranny for
     himself that he was embarking upon plans of such magnitude and importance, and they urged him
     to declare openly what he had decided upon. But he made the same reply, that it was not to the
     interests of the state that there should be a public disclosure of his intentions. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Thereupon the people were far the more amazed at the man's shrewdness
     and greatness of mind, and they urged him to disclose his ideas secretly to the Council,
     assuring him that, if that body decided that what he said was feasible and advantageous, then
     they would advise it to carry his plan to completion. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />Consequently, when the Council learned all the details and decided that what he said was for
     the advantage of the state and was feasible, the people, without more ado, agreed with the
     Council, and Themistocles received authority to do whatever he wished. And every man departed
     from the Assembly in admiration of the high character of the man, being also elated in spirit
     and expectant of the outcome of the plan. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="43">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Themistocles, having received authority
     to proceed and enjoying every assistance ready at hand for his undertakings, again conceived a
     way to deceive the Lacedaemonians by a stratagem; for he was fully assured that just as the
     Lacedaemonians had interfered with the building of the wall about the city, they would in the
     same manner endeavour to obstruct the plans of the Athenians in the case of the making of the
     harbour. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Accordingly he decided to dispatch ambassadors to the
     Lacedaemonians to show them how it was to the advantage of the common interests of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> that it should possess a first-rate harbour in view of
     the expedition which was to be expected on the part of the Persians. When he had in this way
     somewhat dulled the impulse of the Spartans to interfere, he devoted himself to that work, and
     since everybody enthusiastically co-operated it was speedily done and the harbour was finished
     before anyone expected. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And Themistocles persuaded the people
     each year to construct and add twenty triremes to the fleet they already possessed, and also to
     remove the tax upon metics and artisans, in order that great crowds of people might stream into
     the city from every quarter and that the Athenians might easily procure labour for a greater
     number of crafts. Both these policies he considered to be most useful in building up the city's
     naval forces. The Athenians, therefore, were busy over the matters we have described.

<div2 type="chapter" n="44">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Lacedaemonians, having appointed Pausanias, who had held the command at <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>, admiral of their fleet, instructed him to liberate
     the Greek cities which were still held by barbarian garrisons. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />And taking fifty triremes from the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> and
     summoning from the Athenians thirty commanded by Aristeides, he first of all sailed to
      <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> and liberated those cities which still had
     Persian garrisons; <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>and after this he sailed to the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName> and took <placeName key="perseus,Byzantium" >Byzantium</placeName>, which was held by the Persians, and of the other barbarians some he
     slew and others he expelled, and thus liberated the city, but many important Persians whom he
     captured in the city he turned over to Gongylus of <placeName key="perseus,Eretria" >Eretria</placeName> to guard. Ostensibly Gongylus was to keep these men for punishment, but
     actually he was to get them off safe to Xerxes; for Pausanias had secretly made a pact of
     friendship with the king and was about to marry the daughter of Xerxes, his purpose being to
     betray the Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The man who was acting as negotiator in
     this affair was the general Artabazus, and he was quietly supplying Pausanias with large sums
     of money to be used in corrupting such Greeks as could serve their ends.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The plan of Pausanias, however, was brought to light and he got his punishment in the
     following manner. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For Pausanias emulated the luxurious life of
     the Persians and dealt with his subordinates in the manner of a tyrant, so that they were all
     angry with him, and especially those Greeks who had been assigned to some command. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Consequently, while many, as they mingled together in the army both by
     peoples and by cities, were railing at the harshness of Pausanias, some Peloponnesians<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">i.e. the allies of Sparta, who of course supplied all the warships.</note> deserted him and sailed back to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076" >Peloponnesus</placeName>, and dispatching ambassadors to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta" >Sparta</placeName> they lodged an accusation against Pausanias; and Aristeides the Athenian,
     making wise use of the opportunity, in the course of his public conferences with the states won
     them over and by his personal intimacy with them made them adherents of the Athenians.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">It was undoubtedly the contacts which Aristeides established at this time and the confidence he aroused which led the Athenians to entrust him with the
      delicate task of fixing the contribution each city should make to the Confederacy (cp. chap. 47).</note> But even more did matters play by mere chance into the hands of the Athenians by
     reason of the following facts. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="45">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Pausanias had stipulated that the men who carried the
     messages from him to the king should not return and thus become betrayers of their secret
     communications; consequently, since they were being put to death by the receivers of the
     letters, no one of them was ever returning alive. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>So one of
     the couriers, reasoning from this fact, opened his letters, and discovering that his inference
     was correct as to the killing of all who carried the messages, he turned the letters over to
     the ephors. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But when the ephors were loath to believe this,
     because the letters had been turned over to them already opened, and demanded further and more
     substantial proof, the man offered to produce Pausanias acknowledging the facts in person.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Consequently he went to Taenarum, and seating himself as a
     suppliant at the shrine of Poseidon he set up a tent with two rooms and concealed the ephors
     and certain other Spartans; and when Pausanias came to him and asked why he was a suppliant,
     the man upbraided him for directing in the letter that he should be put to death. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Pausanias said that he was sorry and went on to ask the man to forgive
     the mistake; he even implored him to help keep the matter secret, promising him great gifts,
     and the two then parted. As for the ephors and the others with them, although they had learned
     the precise truth, at that time they held their peace, but on a later occasion, when the
     Lacedaemonians were taking up the matter together with the ephors, Pausanias learned of it in
     advance, acted first, and fled for safety into the temple of Athena of the Brazen House.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The famous shrine in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta" >Sparta</placeName>.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And while the Lacedaemonians were hesitating whether to punish
     him now that he was a suppliant, we are told that the mother of Pausanias, coming to the
     temple, neither said nor did anything else than to pick up a brick and lay it against the
     entrance of the temple, and after she had done this she returned to her home. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And the Lacedaemonians, falling in with the mother's decision, walled up
     the entrance and in this manner forced Pausanias to meet his end through starvation.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><bibl n="Thuc. 1.134">Thuc. 1.134</bibl> says that he was removed from the temple just before death to avoid the pollution of the shrine.</note> Now the
     body of the dead man was turned over to his relatives for burial; but the divinity showed its
     displeasure at the violation of the sanctity of suppliants, <milestone unit="section" n="8" />for once when the Lacedaemonians were consulting the oracle at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> about some other matters, the god replied by
     commanding them to restore her suppliant to the goddess. <milestone unit="section" n="9" />Consequently the Spartans, thinking the oracle's command to be impracticable, were at a loss
     for a considerable time, being unable to carry out the injunction of the god. Concluding,
     however, to do as much as was within their power, they made two bronze statues of Pausanias and
     set them up in the temple of Athena. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="46">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for us, since throughout our entire
     history we have made it our practice in the case of good men to enhance their glory by means of
     the words of praise we pronounce over them, and in the case of bad men, when they die, to utter
     the appropriate obloquies, we shall not leave the turpitude and treachery of Pausanias to go
     uncondemned. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For who would not be amazed at the folly of this
     man who, though he had been a benefactor of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>,
     had won the battle of <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>, and had performed
     many other deeds which won applause, not only failed to safeguard the esteem he enjoyed but by
     his love of the wealth and luxury of the Persians brought dishonour upon the good name he
     already possessed? <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Indeed, elated by his successes he came to
     abhor the Laconian manner of life and to imitate the licentiousness and luxury of the Persians,
     he who least of all had reason to emulate the customs of the barbarians; for he had not learned
     of them from others, but in person by actual contact he had made trial of them and was aware
     how greatly superior with respect to virtue his ancestors' way of life was to the luxury of the
     Persians. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And in truth because
     of his own baseness Pausanias not only himself received the punishment he deserved, but he also
     brought it about that his countrymen lost the supremacy at sea. In comparison, for instance,
     take the fine tact of Aristeides in dealing with the allies: when they took note of it, both
     because of his affability toward his subordinates and his uprightness in general, it caused
     them all as with one impulse to incline toward the Athenian cause. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently the allies no longer paid any heed to the commanders who were sent from
      <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, but in their admiration of Aristeides they
     eagerly submitted to him in every matter and thus brought it about that he received the supreme
     command by sea without having to fight for it. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="47">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At once, then, Aristeides advised all the
     allies as they were holding a general assembly to designate the island of <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">That is, the temple of Apollo on that island.</note> as their common treasury and to deposit there all the money
     they collected, and towards the war which they suspected would come from the Persians to impose
     a levy upon all the cities according to their means, so that the entire sum collected would
     amount to five hundred and sixty talents.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">According to
       <bibl n="Thuc. 1.96.2">Thuc. 1.96.2</bibl> and <bibl n="Plut. Arist. 24.3">Plut. Arist.
      24.3</bibl> and <bibl n="Plut. Arist. 24.3">Plut. Arist. 24.3</bibl> the first assessment
      amounted to four hundred and sixty talents. The latest and fullest treatment of this subject

     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And when he was appointed to allocate the levy, he distributed
     the sum so accurately and justly that all the cities consented to it. Consequently, since he
     was considered to have accomplished an impossible thing, he won for himself a very high
     reputation for justice, and because he excelled in that virtue he was given the epithet of "the
     Just." <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Thus at one and the same time the baseness of Pausanias
     deprived his countrymen of the supremacy on the sea, and the all-round virtue of Aristeides
     caused <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to gain the leadership which she had
     not possessed before.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These, then, were the events of this year.

     to the sons of Anaxilas, who were not yet of age. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And Hieron,
     who became king of the Syracusans after the death of Gelon, observing how popular his brother
     Polyzelus was among the Syracusans and believing that he was waiting to seize<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">As of a third competitor waiting to fight the victor.</note>
     the kingship, was eager to put him out of the way, and so, enlisting foreign soldiers and
     gathering about his person an organized body of mercenaries, he thought that by these means he
     could hold the kingship securely. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And so, when the Sybarites
     were being besieged by the Crotoniates and called on Hieron for help, he enrolled many soldiers
     in the army, which he then put under the command of his brother Polyzelus in the belief that he
     would be slain by the Crotoniates. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When Polyzelus, suspecting
     what we have mentioned, refused to undertake the campaign, Hieron was enraged at his brother,
     and when Polyzelus took refuge with Theron, the tyrant of <placeName key="tgn,7003808" >Acragas</placeName>, he began making preparation for war upon Theron. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Subsequently to these events, Thrasydaeus
     the son of Theron was governing the city of Himera more harshly than was proper, and the result
     was that the Himerans became altogether alienated from him. <milestone unit="section" n="7" />Now they rejected the idea of going to his father and entering an accusation with him, since
     they did not believe they would have in him a fair listener; but they dispatched to Hieron
     ambassadors, who presented their complaints against Thrasydaeus and offered to hand Himera over
     to Hieron and join him in his attack upon Theron. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Hieron,
     however, having decided to be at peace with Theron, betrayed the Himerans and disclosed to him
     their secret plans. Consequently Theron, after examining into the reported plan and finding the
     information to be true, composed his differences with Hieron and restored Polyzelus to the
     favour he had previously enjoyed, and then he arrested his opponents, who were many, among the
     Himerans and put them to death. </p>

     have a substantial help ready at hand for any need that might arise, but also that from the
     recently founded state of ten thousand men he might receive the honours accorded to heroes. And
     the Naxians and Catanians whom he had removed from their native states he transferred to
     Leontini and commanded them to make their homes in that city along with the native population.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And Theron, seeing that after the slaughter of the Himerans

     Dorians and any others who so wished. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>These citizens lived

     fallen away from them and continued to threaten them with the appropriate punishment.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And when a meeting of the Gerousia<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The Spartan Senate, composed of thirty members.</note> was convened, they
     considered making war upon the Athenians for the sake of regaining the command of the sea.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Likewise, when the general Assembly was convened, the younger

     have a great war with the Lacedaemonians for the command of the sea, and for this reason were
     building additional triremes, raising a large sum of money, and dealing honourably with their

     also joined with them an auxiliary force of their neighbours, collecting in this way a total
     body of more than twenty thousand soldiers; and the Tarantini, on learning of the great size of
     the army gathered against them, both mustered the soldiers of their state and added to them
     many more of the Rhegians, who were their allies. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>A fierce
     battle took place and many fell on both sides, but in the end the Iapygians were victorious.

      Cleisthenes, and was passed in <date value="-507">507</date> B.C. but first used, according to
      Aristotle (<bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22</bibl>), twenty years later,
      "when the people had gained self-confidence." Professor T. Leslie Shear has kindly allowed me
      to see an as yet unpublished paper of his, "Ostracism and the Ostraka from the Agora," which
      he prepared in <date value="1941">1941</date>. Whereas Carcopino for the second edition of his
       <title>L'Ostracisme ath&eacute;nien</title> (<date value="1935">1935</date>) had 62
      examples of the ballots used in Athenian ostracophoria (the balloting), the collection from
      the Agora now totals 503, and in <date value="1937">1937</date> a well on the North Slope
      yielded an additional 191 pieces. There are names of persons who were never ostracized and of
      many persons who are otherwise unknown. The accuracy of Aristotle's statement that the
      institution was first used in <date value="-487">487</date> B.C. is borne out against Walker's
      theory (<title>Camb. Anc. Hist.</title> 4, p. 152) that there may well have been instances of
      its use before the Battle of Marathon in <date value="-490">490</date> B.C.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Each citizen wrote on a piece of pottery
     (<emph>ostracon</emph>) the name of the man who in his opinion had the greatest power to
     destroy the democracy; and the man who got the largest number of ostraca was obliged by the law
     to go into exile from his native land for a period of five years.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The period was ten years (Diodorus has probably confused the Athenian
      institution with a similar one of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> where the term of exile was five years (cp. chap. 87.1)), and a total of 6000 votes was required.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenians, it appears, passed such a law, not for the
     purpose of punishing wrongdoing, but in order to lower through exile the presumption of men who
     had risen too high. Now Themistocles, having been ostracized in the manner we have described,
     fled as an exile from his native city to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But the Lacedaemonians, learning of this and considering that
     Fortune had given them a favourable moment to attack Themistocles, again dispatched ambassadors
     to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>. These accused Themistocles of complicity
     in the treason of Pausanias, and asserted that his trial, since their crimes affected all
      <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, should not be held privately among the
     Athenians alone but rather before the General Congress of the Greeks which, according to
     custom, was to meet at that time.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The ostracism of
      Themistocles took place in the period <dateRange from="-472" to="-470">472</dateRange>-470
      B.C. (Walker in the <title>Camb. Anc. Hist.</title> 5, pp. 62 f.), and this attack on him by
      the Spartans a year or so later. Thucydides (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.135">Thuc. 1.135</bibl>) states
      that he was to be recalled to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> for trial,
      whether before the Assembly (so E. Meyer) or the Areopagus (Wilamowitz) is not clear. Modern
      writers generally reject Diodorus' account that his trial was to have been before the General
      Congress of the Hellenic League. It is not impossible, however, that such a suggestion was
      first made by the Spartans, but was not pressed when the Athenians offered to recall him to
       <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> for trial. Plutarch (<bibl n="Plut. Arist. 21">Plut. Arist. 21</bibl>) states that a Hellenic League to prosecute the
      war against the Persians, meeting annually, was established in 479. It is clear that Diodorus
      was thinking of the General Congress of this league and not of that of the Peloponnesian
      League (cp. J. A. O. Larsen in <title>Class. Phil.</title> 28 (<date value="1933" >1933</date>), pp. 263-265).</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And Themistocles, seeing that
     the Lacedaemonians were bent upon defaming and humbling the Athenian state, and that the
     Athenians were anxious to clear themselves of the charge against them, assumed that he would be
     turned over to the General Congress. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>This body, he knew, made
     its decisions, not on the basis of justice, but out of favour to the Lacedaemonians, inferring
     this not only from its other actions but also from what it had done in making the awards for
      valour.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chap. 27.2.</note> For in that instance those
     who controlled the voting showed such jealousy of the Athenians that, although these had
     contributed more triremes than all the others who took part in the battle, they made them out
     to be no whit better than the rest of the Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>These, then,
     were the reasons why Themistocles distrusted the members of the Congress. Furthermore, it was
     from the speech in his own defence which Themistocles had made in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> on the former occasion that the Lacedaemonians had got
     the basis for the accusation they afterwards made. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>For in that
     defence Themistocles had acknowledged that Pausanias had sent letters to him, urging him to
     share in the act of treason, and using this as the strongest piece of evidence in his behalf,
     he had established that Pausanias would not have urged him, unless he had opposed his first
     request. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="56">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It was for these reasons, as we have stated above,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">There is no reference for this statement.</note> that Themistocles fled from
      <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> to Admetus, the king of the Molossians; and
     taking refuge at Admetus' hearth he became his suppliant. The king at first received him
     kindly, urged him to be of good courage, and, in general, assured him that he would provide for
     his safety; <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>but when the Lacedaemonians dispatched some of the
     most distinguished Spartans as ambassadors to Admetus and demanded the person of Themistocles
     for punishment, stigmatizing him as the betrayer and destroyer of the whole Greek world, and
     when they went further and declared that, if Admetus would not turn him over to them, they
     together with all the Greeks would make war on him, then indeed the king, fearing on the one
     hand the threats and yet pitying the suppliant and seeking to avoid the disgrace of handing him
     over, persuaded Themistocles to make his escape with all speed without the knowledge of the
     Lacedaemonians and gave him a large sum of gold to meet his expenses on the flight. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And Themistocles, being persecuted as he was on every side, accepted the
     gold and fled by night out of the territory of the Molossians, the king furthering his flight
     in every way; and finding two young men, Lyncestians by birth, who were traders and therefore
     familiar with the roads, he made his escape in their company. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />By travelling only at night he eluded the Lacedaemonians, and by virtue of the goodwill of
     the young men and the hardship they endured for him he made his way to <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>. Here Themistocles had a personal friend, Lysitheides by
     name, who was highly regarded for his fame and wealth, and to him he fled for refuge.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now it so happened that
     Lysitheides was a friend of Xerxes the king and on the occasion of his passage through
      <placeName key="tgn,7002294">Asia Minor</placeName> had entertained the entire Persian
      host.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Plutarch (<bibl n="Plut. Them. 26">Plut. Them.

      Herodotus (<bibl n="Hdt. 7.27">Hdt. 7.27</bibl>); Thucydides does not mention him.</note>
     Consequently, since he enjoyed an intimate acquaintance with the king and yet wished out of
     mercy to save Themistocles, he promised to co-operate with him in every way. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But when Themistocles asked that he lead him to Xerxes, at first he
     demurred, explaining that Themistocles would be punished because of his past activities against
     the Persians; later, however, when he realized that it was for the best, he acceded, and
     unexpectedly and without harm he got him through safe to <placeName key="tgn,7000231" >Persia</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>For it was a custom among the Persians
     that when one conducted a concubine to the king one brought her in a closed wagon, and no man
     who met it interfered or came face to face with the passenger; and it came about that
     Lysitheides availed himself of this means of carrying out his undertaking. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>After preparing the wagon and embellishing it with costly hangings he
     put Themistocles in it; and when he had got him through in entire safety, he came into the
     presence of the king, and after he had conversed with him cautiously he received pledges from
     the king that he would do Themistocles no wrong. Then Lysitheides introduced him to the
     presence of the king, who, when he had allowed Themistocles to speak and learned that he had
     done the king no wrong, absolved him from punishment. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="57">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But when it seemed that the
     life of Themistocles had unexpectedly been saved by an enemy, he fell again into even greater
     dangers for the following reasons. Mandane was the daughter of the Darius<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Darius the Great.</note> who had slain the Magi and the full sister of
     Xerxes, and she enjoyed high esteem among the Persians. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>She
     had lost her sons at the time Themistocles had defeated the Persian fleet in the sea-battle at
      <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> and sorely grieved over the death of her
     children, and because of her great affliction she was the object of the pity of the people
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When she learned of the presence of Themistocles, she went to
     the palace clad in raiment of mourning and with tears entreated her brother to wreak vengeance
     upon Themistocles. And when the king paid no heed to her, she visited in turn the noblest
     Persians with her request and, speaking generally, spurred on the people to vengeance upon
     Themistocles. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When the mob rushed to the palace and with loud
     shouts demanded the person of Themistocles for punishment, the king replied that he would form
     a jury of the noblest Persians and that its verdict would be carried out. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>This decision was approved by all, and since a considerable time was
     given to make the preparations for the trial, Themistocles meanwhile learned the Persian
     language, and using it in his defence he was acquitted of the charges. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And the king was overjoyed that Themistocles had been saved and honoured
     him with great gifts; so, for example, he gave him in marriage a Persian woman, who was of
     outstanding birth and beauty and, besides, praised for her virtue, and &lsqb;she brought as
     her dower&rsqb; not only a multitude of household slaves for their service but also of
     drinking-cups of every kind and such other furnishings as comport with a life of pleasure and
      luxury.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">This marriage of Themistocles to a noble Persian lady is attested only by Diodorus and is almost certainly fictitious.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Furthermore, the king made him a present also of three cities
     which were well suited for his support and enjoyment, <placeName key="tgn,7002751" >Magnesia</placeName> upon the Maeander River, which had more grain than any city of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, for bread, <placeName key="tgn,5004385">Myus</placeName>
     for meat, since the sea there abounded in fish, and <placeName key="tgn,7002579" >Lampsacus</placeName>, whose territory contained extensive vineyards, for wine. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="58">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Themistocles, being now relieved of the fear which he had felt when among Greeks, the man who
     had unexpectedly, on the one hand, been driven into exile by those who had profited most by the
     benefits he had bestowed and, on the other, had received benefits from those who had suffered
     the most grievously at his hands, spent his life in the cities we have mentioned, being well
     supplied with all the good things that conduce to pleasure, and at his death he was given a
     notable funeral in <placeName key="tgn,7002751">Magnesia</placeName> and a monument that stands
     even to this day. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Some historians say that Xerxes, desiring to
     lead a second expedition against <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, invited
     Themistocles to take command of the war, and that he agreed to do so and received from the king
     guaranties under oath that he would not march against the Greeks without Themistocles.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And when a bull had been sacrificed and the oaths taken,
     Themistocles, filling a cup with its blood, drank it down and immediately died. They add that
     Xerxes thereupon relinquished that plan of his, and that Themistocles by his voluntary death
     left the best possible defence that he had played the part of a good citizen in all matters
     affecting the interests of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We have come to the death of one of the
     greatest of the Greeks, about whom many dispute whether it was because he had wronged his
     native city and the other Greeks that he fled to the Persians, or whether, on the contrary, his
     city and all the Greeks, after enjoying great benefits at his hands, forgot to be grateful for
     them but unjustly plunged him, their benefactor, into the uttermost perils. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But if any man, putting envy aside, will estimate closely not only the
     man's natural gifts but also his achievements, he will find that on both counts Themistocles
     holds first place among all of whom we have record. Therefore one may well be amazed that the

     which had been settled from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> to revolt from the
     Persians, but as for the cities whose inhabitants spoke two languages<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">It is to be presumed that Greek was their second language and so they were non-Greek or at least mixed in race.</note> and still had Persian garrisons, he had recourse

      <placeName key="tgn,7001294">Lycia</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Also, by
     taking additional ships from the allies, who were continually being added, he still further
     increased the size of his fleet.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the Persians had composed
     their land forces from their own peoples, but their navy they had gathered from both <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>
     and <placeName key="tgn,7002470">Cilicia</placeName>, and the commander of the Persian
     armaments was Tithraustes, who was an illegitimate son of Xerxes. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And when Cimon learned that the Persian fleet was lying off <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, sailing against the barbarians he engaged them in
     battle, pitting two hundred and fifty ships against three hundred and forty. A sharp struggle
     took place and both fleets fought brilliantly, but in the end the Athenians were victorious,
     having destroyed many of the enemy ships and captured more than one hundred together with their
     crews. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The rest of the ships escaped to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, where their crews left them and took to the land, and
     the ships, being bare of defenders, fell into the hands of the enemy. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="61">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon Cimon, not
     satisfied with a victory of such magnitude, set sail at once with his entire fleet against the
     Persian land army, which was then encamped on the bank of the <placeName key="tgn,6001946" >Eurymedon River</placeName>.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">In <placeName key="tgn,7016774">Pisidia</placeName>, at least 125 miles from <placeName key="tgn,1000112" >Cyprus</placeName>.</note> And wishing to overcome the barbarians by a stratagem, he manned
     the captured Persian ships with his own best men, giving them tiaras for their heads and
     clothing them in the Persian fashion generally. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The
     barbarians, so soon as the fleet approached them, were deceived by the Persian ships and garb
     and supposed the triremes to be their own. Consequently they received the Athenians as if they
     were friends. And Cimon, night having fallen, disembarked his soldiers, and being received by
     the Persians as a friend, he fell upon their encampment. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>A
     great tumult arose among the Persians, and the soldiers of Cimon cut down all who came in their
     way, and seizing in his tent Pherendates, one of the two generals of the barbarians and a
     nephew of the king, they slew him; and as for the rest of the Persians, some they cut down and
     others they wounded, and all of them, because of the unexpectedness of the attack, they forced
     to take flight. In a word, such consternation as well as bewilderment prevailed among the
     Persians that most of them did not even know who it was that was attacking them. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For they had no idea that the Greeks had come against them in force,
     being persuaded that they had no land army at all; and they assumed that it was the Pisidians,
     who dwelt in neighbouring territory and were hostile to them, who had come to attack them.
     Consequently, thinking that the attack of the enemy was coming from the mainland, they fled to
     their ships in the belief they were in friendly hands. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And
     since it was a dark night without a moon, their bewilderment was increased all the more and not
     a man was able to discern the true state of affairs. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />Consequently, after a great slaughter had occurred on account of the disorder among the
     barbarians, Cimon, who had previously given orders to the soldiers to come running to the torch
     which would be raised, had the signal raised beside the ships, being anxious lest, if the
     soldiers should scatter and turn to plundering, some miscarriage of his plans might occur.
      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And when the soldiers had all been gathered at the torch and
     had stopped plundering, for the time being they withdrew to the ships, and on the following day
     they set up a trophy and then sailed back to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>,
     having won two glorious victories, the one on land and the other on the sea; for not to this
     day has history recorded the occurrence of so unusual and so important actions on the same day
     by a host that fought both afloat and on land. </p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After Cimon had won these great successes
     by means of his own skill as general and his valour, his fame was noised abroad not only among

     forty ships, more than twenty thousand men, and a considerable sum of money. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But the Persians, having met with so great reverses, built other
     triremes in greater number, since they feared the growing might of the Athenians. For from this

     the Lacedaemonians; for great earthquakes occurred in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta" >Sparta</placeName>, and as a result the houses collapsed from their foundations and more than
     twenty thousand Lacedaemonians perished. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And since the
     tumbling down of the city and the falling in of the houses continued uninterruptedly over a
     long period, many persons were caught and crushed in the collapse of the walls and no little
     household property was ruined by the quake. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And although they
     suffered this disaster because some god, as it were, was wreaking his anger upon them, it so
     happened that other dangers befell them at the hands of men for the following reasons.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Helots and Messenians, although enemies of the
     Lacedaemonians, had remained quiet up to this time, since they stood in fear of the eminent
     position and power of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>; but when they
     observed that the larger part of them had perished because of the earthquake, they held in
     contempt the survivors, who were few. Consequently they came to an agreement with each other
     and joined together in the war against the Lacedaemonians. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The
     king of the Lacedaemonians, Archidamus, by his personal foresight not only was the saviour of
     his fellow citizens even during the earthquake, but in the course of the war also he bravely
     fought the aggressors. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For instance, when the terrible
     earthquake struck <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, he was the first Spartan
     to seize his armour and hasten from the city into the country, calling upon the other citizens
     to follow his example. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Spartans obeyed him and thus those
     who survived the shock were saved and these men King Archidamus organized into an army and
     prepared to make war upon the revolters. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="64">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Messenians together with the Helots
     at first advanced against the city of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>,
     assuming that they would take it because there would be no one to defend it; but when they
     heard that the survivors were drawn up in a body with Archidamus the king and were ready for
     the struggle on behalf of their native land, they gave up this plan, and seizing a stronghold
     in <placeName key="tgn,7011369">Messenia</placeName> they made it their base of operations and
     from there continued to overrun <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And the Spartans, turning for help to the Athenians, received from them
     an army; and they gathered troops as well from the rest of their allies and thus became able to
     meet their enemy on equal terms. At the outset they were much superior to the enemy, but at a
     later time, when a suspicion arose that the Athenians were about to go over to the Messenians,
     they broke the alliance with them, stating as their reason that in the other allies they had
     sufficient men to meet the impending battle. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenians,
     although they believed that they had suffered an affront, at the time did no more than
     withdraw; later, however, their relations to the Lacedaemonians being unfriendly, they were
     more and more inclined to fan the flames of hatred. Consequently the Athenians took this
     incident as the first cause of the estrangement of the two states, and later on they quarrelled
     and, embarking upon great wars, filled all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> with
     vast calamities. But we shall give an account of these matters severally in connection with the
     appropriate periods of time. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At the time in question the
     Lacedaemonians together with their allies marched forth against <placeName key="perseus,Ithome" >Ithome</placeName> and laid siege to it. And the Helots, revolting in a body from the
     Lacedaemonians, joined as allies with the Messenians, and at one time they were winning and at
     another losing. And since for ten years no decision could be reached in the war, for that
     length of time they never ceased injuring each other. </p>

     of Posidonia won the "stadion." In this year a war broke out between the Argives and Mycenaeans
     for the following reasons. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Mycenaeans, because of the
     ancient prestige of their country, would not be subservient to the Argives as the other cities
     of <placeName key="tgn,7002739">Argolis</placeName> were, but they maintained an independent
     position and would take no orders from the Argives; and they kept disputing with them also over
     the shrine of Hera<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The famous Heraeum, situated at about
      the same distance from <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> in the hills south of the former. In it was later a celebrated statue of Hera, of gold and ivory, by Polycleitus.</note> and claiming that they
     had the right to administer the Nemean Games<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">These Games
      had been first under the supervision of the city of Cleonae. The question of their supervision
      must have been in the air at this time, since it was transferred to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> in <date value="-460">460</date> B.C.</note> by
     themselves. Furthermore, when the Argives voted not to join with the Lacedaemonians in the
     battle at <placeName key="perseus,Thermopylae">Thermopylae</placeName> unless they were given a
     share in the supreme command, the Mycenaeans were the only people of Argolis who fought at the
     side of the Lacedaemonians. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In a word, the Argives were
     suspicious of the Mycenaeans, fearing lest, if they got any stronger, they might, on the
     strength of the ancient prestige of <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>,
     dispute the right of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> to the leadership. Such,
     then, were the reasons for the bad blood between them; and from of old the Argives had ever
     been eager to exalt their city, and now they thought they had a favourable opportunity, seeing
     that the Lacedaemonians had been weakened and were unable to come to the aid of the Mycenaeans.
     Therefore the Argives, gathering a strong army from both <placeName key="perseus,Argos" >Argos</placeName> and the cities of their allies, marched against the Mycenaeans, and after
     defeating them in battle and shutting them within their walls, they laid siege to the city.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Mycenaeans for a time resisted the besiegers with vigour,
     but afterwards, since they were being worsted in the fighting and the Lacedaemonians could
     bring them no aid because of their own wars and the disaster that had overtaken them in the
     earthquakes, and since there were no other allies, they were taken by storm through lack of
     support from outside. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Argives sold the Mycenaeans into
     slavery, dedicated a tenth part of them to the god, and razed <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae" >Mycenae</placeName>. So this city, which in ancient times had enjoyed such felicity,

     Romans elected as consuls Appius Claudius and Titus Quinctius Capitolinus. During this year
     Thrasybulus, the king of the Syracusans, was driven from his throne, and since we are writing a
     detailed account of this event, we must go back a few years and set forth clearly the whole
     story from the beginning. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Gelon, the son of Deinomenes, who far excelled all other men in valour and strategy and
     out-generalled the Carthaginians, defeated these barbarians in a great battle, as has been
      told<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chaps. 21 ff.</note>; and since he treated the
     peoples whom he had subdued with fairness and, in general, conducted himself humanely toward
     all his immediate neighbours, he enjoyed high favour among the Sicilian Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Thus Gelon, being beloved by all because of his mild rule, lived in
     uninterrupted peace until his death. But Hieron, the next oldest among the brothers,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Deinomenes had four sons, Gelon, Hieron, Polyzelus, and Thrasybulus.</note> who succeeded to the throne, did not rule over his subjects in the same
     manner; <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>for he was avaricious and violent and, speaking
     generally, an utter stranger to sincerity and nobility of character. Consequently there were a
     good many who wished to revolt, but they restrained their inclinations because of Gelon's
     reputation and the goodwill he had shown towards all the Sicilian Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After the death of Hieron, however, his brother Thrasybulus, who
     succeeded to the throne, surpassed in wickedness his predecessor in the kingship. For being a
     violent man and murderous by nature, he put to death many citizens unjustly and drove not a few
     into exile on false charges, confiscating their possessions into the royal treasury; and since,
     speaking generally, he hated those he had wronged and was hated by them, he enlisted a large
     body of mercenaries, preparing in this way a legion with which to oppose the citizen soldiery.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And since he kept incurring more and more the hatred of the
     citizens by outraging many and executing others, he compelled the victims to revolt.
     Consequently the Syracusans, choosing men who would take the lead, set about as one man to
     destroy the tyranny, and once they had been organized by their leaders they clung stubbornly to
     their freedom. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>When Thrasybulus saw that the whole city was in
     arms against him, he at first attempted to stop the revolt by persuasion; but after he observed
     that the movement of the Syracusans could not be halted, he gathered together both the
     colonists whom Hieron had settled in <placeName key="perseus,Catana">Catana</placeName> and his
     other allies, as well as a multitude of mercenaries, so that his army numbered all told almost
     fifteen thousand men. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Then, seizing Achradine, as it is

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="68">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Syracusans at the outset seized a part of the city which
     is called Tyche,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">This section adjoined Achradine on the west.</note> and operating from there they dispatched ambassadors to <placeName key="perseus,Gela">Gela</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName>, and
      <placeName key="perseus,Selinus">Selinus</placeName>, and also to Himera and the cities of the

     them in liberating <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And since all these cities acceded to this request eagerly and hurriedly
     dispatched aid, some of them infantry and cavalry and others warships fully equipped for
     action, in a brief time there was collected a considerable armament with which to aid the
     Syracusans. Consequently the Syracusans, having made ready their ships and drawn up their army
     for battle, demonstrated that they were ready to fight to a finish both on land and on sea.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now Thrasybulus, abandoned as he was by his allies and basing
     his hopes only upon the mercenaries, was master only of Achradine and the Island, whereas the
     rest of the city was in the hands of the Syracusans. And after this Thrasybulus sailed forth
     with his ships against the enemy, and after suffering defeat in the battle with the loss of
     numerous triremes, he withdrew with the remaining ships to the Island. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Similarly he led forth his army also from Achradine and drew them up for
     battle in the suburbs, but he suffered defeat and was forced to retire with heavy losses back
     to Achradine. In the end, giving up hope of maintaining the tyranny, he opened negotiations

     archon, and in <placeName key="perseus,Rome">Rome</placeName> the consuls elected were Lucius
     Valerius Publicola and Titus Aemilius Mamercus. During this year, in Asia Artabanus, an
     Hyrcanian by birth, who enjoyed the greatest influence at the court of King Xerxes and was
     captain of the royal body-guard, decided to slay Xerxes and transfer the kingship to himself.
     He communicated the plot to Mithridates the eunuch, who was the king's chamberlain and enjoyed
     his supreme confidence, and he, since he was also a relative of Artabanus as well as his
     friend, agreed to the plot. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And Artabanus, being led at night
     by Mithridates into the king's bed-chamber, slew Xerxes and then set out after the king's sons.
     These were three in number, Darius the eldest and Artaxerxes, who were both living in the
     palace, and the third, Hystaspes, who happened to be away from home at the time, since he was
     administering the satrapy of <placeName key="tgn,7016612">Bactria</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now Artabanus, coming while it was yet night to Artaxerxes, told him
     that his brother Darius had murdered his father and was shifting the kingship to himself.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He counselled him, therefore, before Darius should seize the
     throne, to see to it that he should not become a slave through sheer indifference but that he
     should ascend the throne after punishing the murderer of his father; and he promised to get the
     body-guard of the king to support him in the undertaking. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />Artaxerxes fell in with the advice and at once, with the help of the body-guard, slew his
     brother Darius. And when Artabanus saw how his plan was prospering, he called his own sons to
     his side and crying out that now was his time to win the kingship he strikes Artaxerxes with
     his sword. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Artaxerxes, being wounded merely and not seriously
     hurt by the blow, held off Artabanus and dealing him a fatal blow killed him. Thus Artaxerxes,
     after being saved in this unexpected fashion and having taken vengeance upon the slayer of his
     father, took over the kingship of the Persians. So Xerxes died in the manner we have described,
     after having been king of the Persians for more than twenty years, and Artaxerxes succeeded to
     the kingship and ruled for forty years. </p>

     making great strides toward prosperity. For the Sicilian Greeks were at peace, and the land
     they cultivated was fertile, so that the abundance of their harvests enabled them soon to
     increase their estates and to fill the land with slaves and domestic animals and every other
     accompaniment of prosperity, taking in great revenues on the one hand and spending nothing upon
     the wars to which they had been accustomed. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But later on they
     were again plunged into wars and civil strife for the following reasons. After the Syracusans
     had overthrown the tyranny of Thrasybulus, they held a meeting of the Assembly, and after
     deliberating on forming a democracy of their own they all voted unanimously to make a colossal
     statue of Zeus the Liberator and each year to celebrate with sacrifices the Festival of
     Liberation and hold games of distinction on the day on which they had overthrown the tyrant and
     liberated their native city; and they also voted to sacrifice to the gods, in connection with
     the games, four hundred and fifty bulls and to use them for the citizens' feast. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>As for all the magistracies, they proposed to assign them to the
     original citizens, but the aliens who had been admitted to citizenship under Gelon they did not
     see fit to allow to share in this dignity, either because they judged them to be unworthy or
     because they were suspicious lest men who had been brought up in the way of tyranny and had
     served in war under a monarch might attempt a revolution. And that is what actually happened.
     For Gelon had enrolled as citizens more than ten thousand foreign mercenaries, and of these
     there were left at the time in question more than seven thousand. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="73">

     were inferior to the Syracusans, yet in experience of warfare they were far superior;
     consequently, when attacks took place here and there throughout the city and isolated

     the Corinthians and Megarians over land on their borders and the cities went to war. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At first they kept making raids on each other's territory and engaging
     in clashes of small parties; but as the quarrel increased, the Megarians, who were increasingly
     getting the worse of it and stood in fear of the Corinthians, made allies of the Athenians.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>As a result the cities were again equal in military strength,
     and when the Corinthians together with Peloponnesians advanced into <placeName key="tgn,7017133">Megaris</placeName> with a strong army, the Athenians sent troops to the aid
     of the Megarians under the command of Myronides, a man who was admired for his valour. A fierce
     engagement took place which lasted a long time and each side matched the other in deeds of
     courage, but at last victory lay with the Athenians, who slew many of the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And after a few days there was another fierce battle at Cimolia, as it

     by force of arms and occupied their cities; but after this the Lacedaemonians, because of their
     kinship, dispatched Nicomedes, the son of Cleomenes, to the aid of the Dorians. He had fifteen
     hundred Lacedaemonians and ten thousand men from the rest of the Peloponnesians. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>So Nicomedes, who was the guardian of Pleistonax the king, who was still

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the Athenians learned that the Lacedaemonians had concluded the war
     against the Phocians and were about to make their return home, they decided to attack the
     Lacedaemonians while on the march. Accordingly they dispatched an army against them, including
     in it Argives and Thessalians; and with the intention of falling upon them with fifty ships and
     fourteen thousand men, they occupied the passes about Mt. Geraneia. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But the Lacedaemonians, having information of the plans of the Athenians, took the
     route to <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002683" >Boeotia</placeName>. The Athenians advanced into <placeName key="tgn,7002683" >Boeotia</placeName> and formed in line of battle, and a fierce struggle took place; and
     although in the fighting the Thessalians deserted to the Lacedaemonians, nonetheless the
     Athenians and the Argives fought the battle through and not a few fell in both armies before
     night put an end to the struggle. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After this, when a large
     supply-train was on its way from <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> for the
     Athenians, the Thessalians decided to attack it, and taking their evening meal at once, they
     intercepted by night the supply-train. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Athenians who were
     guarding the train were unaware that the Thessalians had changed sides and received them as
     friends, so that many conflicts of various kinds broke out around the convoy. For at first the
     Thessalians, who had been welcomed by the enemy in their ignorance, kept cutting down all whom
     they met, and being an organized band engaging with men who had fallen into confusion they slew
     many of the guards. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But the Athenians in the camp, when they
     learned of the attack of the Thessalians, came up with all speed, and routing the Thessalians
     at the first charge, they were making a great slaughter of them. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Lacedaemonians, however, now came to the rescue of the Thessalians with their army
     in battle order, and a pitched battle between the two armies ensued, and such was their rivalry
     that many were slain on both sides. And finally, since the battle ended in a tie, both the
     Lacedaemonians and the Athenians laid claim to the victory. However, since night intervened and
     the victory was still a matter of dispute, each sent envoys to the other and they concluded a
     truce of four months.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">This was the battle of <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName>. Thucydides (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.108">Thuc.

     Veturius Cicurinus. During this year the Thebans, who had been humbled because of their
     alliance with Xerxes,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">During the Persian invasion.</note>
     sought a way by which they might recover both their ancient influence and reputation.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Consequently, since all the Boeotians held the Thebans in
     disdain and no longer paid any attention to them, the Thebans asked the Lacedaemonians to aid
     them in winning for their city the hegemony over all <placeName key="tgn,7002683" >Boeotia</placeName>; and they promised that in return for this favour they would make war by
     themselves upon the Athenians, so that it would no longer be necessary for the Spartans to lead
     troops beyond the border of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And the Lacedaemonians &lsqb;assented&rsqb;, judging
     the proposal to be to their advantage and believing that, if <placeName key="perseus,Thebes" >Thebes</placeName> should grow in strength, she would be a kind of counterweight to the
     increasing power of the Athenians; consequently, since they had at the time a large army in
     readiness at <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName>, they increased the extent of
     the circuit wall of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and compelled the cities
     of <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> to subject themselves to the Thebans.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Athenians, however, being eager to break up the plan of
     the Lacedaemonians, made ready a large army and elected as general Myronides the son of
     Callias. He enrolled the required number of citizens and gave them orders, announcing a day on
     which he planned to march forth from the city. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And when the
     appointed time arrived and some of the soldiers had not put in appearance at the specified
     rendezvous, he took those who had reported and advanced into <placeName key="tgn,7002683" >Boeotia</placeName>. And when certain of his officers and friends said that he should wait
     for the tardy men, Myronides, who was not only a sagacious general but energetic as well,
     replied that he would not do so; for, he declared, men who of their own choice are late for the
     departure will in battle also play an ignoble and cowardly part, and will therefore not
     withstand the perils of war in defence of their country either, whereas the men who presented
     themselves ready for service on the appointed day gave clear evidence that they would not
     desert their posts in the war. And this is what actually took place; <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>for leading forth soldiers who were few in number but the bravest in courage, he drew
     them up in <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> against a vastly superior force and
     utterly defeated his opponents. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="82">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In my opinion this action was in no way inferior to any
     of the battles fought by the Athenians in former times; for neither the victory at Marathon nor
     the success over the Persians at <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName> nor the
     other renowned exploits of the Athenians seem in any way to surpass the victory which Myronides
     won over the Boeotians. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For of those other battles, some were
     fought against barbarians and others were gained with the aid of allies, but this struggle was
     won by the Athenians single-handed in pitched battle, and they were pitted against the bravest
     warriors to be found among the Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For in staunchness in
     the face of perils and in the fierce contests of war the Boeotians are generally believed to be
     surpassed by no other people; at any rate, sometime after this the Thebans at Leuctra and

      chap 83), but not this engagement, and the authority of Diodorus' account is questioned
      generally by modern historians. What Diodorus did was to mistake two accounts of the same
      battle (of Oenophyta) for two battles (cp. Busolt, <title>Griech. Gesch.</title> 3. 1, p. 319).</note> Myronides, then, after defeating the Boeotians in a remarkable battle, came to

<div2 type="chapter" n="83">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Boeotians,
     exasperated by the wasting of their land, sprang to arms as a nation and when they had taken

     conflict with stout hearts, they spent the day in fighting; but after a severe struggle the

      <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> with the exception of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>After this he

     commander of the naval forces and vied with both the valour and fame of Myronides, was eager to
     accomplish a memorable deed. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Consequently, since in those
     times no one had very yet laid waste <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>, he urged
     the Athenian people to ravage the territory of the Spartans, and he promised that by taking one
     thousand hoplites aboard the triremes he would with them lay waste <placeName key="tgn,7002745" >Laconia</placeName> and dim the fame of the Spartans. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When
     the Athenians acceded to his request, he then, wishing to take with him secretly a larger
     number of hoplites, had recourse to the following cunning subterfuge. The citizens thought that
     he would enrol for the force the young men in the prime of youth and most vigorous in body; but
     Tolmides, determined to take with him in the campaign not merely the stipulated one thousand,
     approached every young man of exceptional hardihood and told him that he was going to enrol
     him; it would be better, however, he added, for him to go as a volunteer than be thought to
     have been compelled to serve under compulsion by enrolment. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />When by this scheme he had persuaded more than three thousand to enrol voluntarily and saw
     that the rest of the youth showed no further interest, he then enrolled the thousand he had
     been promised from all who were left. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When all the other preparations for his expedition had been made, Tolmides set out to
     sea with fifty triremes and four thousand hoplites, and putting in at <placeName key="perseus,Methone">Methone</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>,
     he took the place; and when the Lacedaemonians came to defend it, he withdrew, and cruising
     along the cost to Gytheium, which was a seaport of the Lacedaemonians, he seized it, burned the
     city and also the dockyards of the Lacedaemonians, and ravaged its territory. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>From here he set out to sea and sailed to Zacynthos which belonged to
     Cephallenia; he took the island and won over all the cities on Cephallenia, and then sailed
     across to the opposite mainland and put in at <placeName key="tgn,7011174" >Naupactus</placeName>. This city he likewise seized at the first assault and in it he settled
     the prominent Messenians whom the Lacedaemonians had allowed to go free under a truce.
      <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>At this time, it may be explained, the Lacedaemonians had
     finally overcome both the Helots and Messenians, with whom they had been at war over a long
      period,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The beginning of the war is described in chap. 64 under the year 469, which is five years too early.</note> and the Messenians they had allowed

     influential citizen had to be written on an olive leaf, and when the leaves were counted, the
     man who received the largest number of leaves had to go into exile for five years. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For by this means they thought that they would humble the arrogance of
     the most powerful men in these two cities; for, speaking generally, they were not exacting from
     violators of the law a punishment for a crime committed, but were effecting a diminution of the
     influence and growing power of the men in question. Now while the Athenians called this kind of

     attending to their personal fortunes and leaning towards a life of luxury; whereas it was the

     in a word, many were exchanging the ancient and sober way of life for the ignoble pursuits;
     wealth was increasing because of the peace, but there was little if any concern for concord and

     and ravaged the territory of the Sicyonians. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And when the
     Sicyonians came out against him in full force and a battle was fought, Pericles was victorious,
     slew many as they fled, and shut them up in their city, to which he laid siege. But when he was
     unable by making assaults upon the walls to take the city, and when, besides, the

     events in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, since the Tyrrhenians were
     practising piracy at sea, the Syracusans chose Phayllus as admiral and sent him to Tyrrhenia.
     He sailed at first to the island known as Aethaleia<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" ><placeName key="tgn,7016548">Elba</placeName>.</note> and ravaged it, but he secretly
     accepted a bribe of money from the Tyrrhenians and sailed back to <placeName key="tgn,7003122" >Sicily</placeName> without having accomplished anything worthy of mention. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Syracusans found him guilty of treachery and exiled him, and
     choosing another general, Apelles, they dispatched him with sixty triremes against the
     Tyrrhenians. He overran the coast of Tyrrhenia and then passed over to Cyrnus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><placeName key="tgn,7001093">Corsica</placeName>.</note> which
     was held at those times by the Tyrrhenians, and after sacking many places in this island and

     of the same race, with the exception of Hybla, into one and a common federation; and being an
     energetic man, he was always grasping after innovations, and so he gathered a large army from
     the Sicilian League and removed the city of Menae, which was his native state, and planted it
     in the plain. Also near the sacred precinct of the Palici, as they are called, he founded an
     important city, which he named Palice after the gods just mentioned. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="89">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Since we have spoken
     of these gods, we should not omit to mention both the antiquity and the incredible nature of
     the shrine, and, in a word, the peculiar phenomenon of The Craters,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The Greek word means "Mixing Bowls." These geysers near Mt. Aetna are
      mentioned by Vergil (<bibl n="Verg. A. 9.585">Verg. Aen. 9.585</bibl>) and described at length
      by <bibl n="Macr. 5.19.15">Macrobius Sat. 5.19.15 ff.</bibl></note> as they are called.
     The myth relates that this sacred area surpasses all others in antiquity and the reverence paid
     to it, and many marvels there are reported by tradition. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For
     first of all there are craters which are not at all large in size, but they throw up
     extraordinary streams of water from a depth beyond telling and have very much the nature of
     cauldrons which are heated by a strong fire and throw up boiling water. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now the water that is thrown up gives the impression of being boiling
     hot, but this is not known for certain because of the fact that no man dares touch it; for the
     amazement caused by the spout of water is so great that men believe the phenomenon to be due to
     some divine power. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For not only does the water give out a
     strongly sulphurous smell but the yawning mouth emits a mighty and terrifying roar; and what is
     still more astonishing than this, the water neither pours over nor recedes, but has a motion
     and force in its current that lifts it to a marvellous height. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />Since so divine a majesty pervades the sacred area, the most sacred oaths are taken there and
     men who swear falsely are immediately overtaken by the punishment of heaven; thus certain men
     have lost their sight when they depart from the sacred precinct. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And so great is the awe of the deities of this shrine, that men who are pressing
     claims, when, for instance, they are being overborne by a person of superior dignity, have
     their claims adjudicated on the strength of the preliminary examination of the witnesses
     supported by oaths taken in the name of these deities. This sacred area has also been
     recognized for some time as a place of sanctuary and has been a source of great aid to luckless
     slaves who have fallen into the hands of brutal masters; <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>for
     if they have fled there for refuge, their masters have no power to remove them by force, and
     they remain there protected from harm until their masters, having gained their consent upon
     conditions of humane treatment and having given pledges, supported by such oaths, to fulfil
     their agreements, lead them away. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And history records no case,
     out of all who have given slaves such a pledge as this, of a violation; so faithful to their
     slaves does the awe in which these gods are held make those who have taken the oath. And the
     sacred area, which lies on a plain meet for a god, has been appropriately embellished with
     colonnades and every other kind of lounging-place.&mdash;But let what we have said suffice
     for this subject, and we shall return to the narrative at the point where our history broke
     off. </p>

     Romans elected as consuls Lucius Postumius and Marcus Horatius. During this year Ducetius, who
     held the leadership of the Siceli, seized the city of <placeName key="tgn,7003867" >Aetna</placeName>, having treacherously slain its leader, and then he moved with an army into
     the territory of the Acragantini and laid siege to Motyum, which was held by a garrison of
     Acragantini; and when the Acragantini and the Syracusans came to the aid of the city, he joined
     battle with them, was successful, and drove them both out of their camps. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But since at the time winter was setting in, they separated and returned
     to their homes; and the Syracusans found their general Bolcon, who was responsible for the
     defeat and was thought to have had secret dealings with Ducetius, guilty of treason and put him
     to death. With the beginning of summer they appointed a new general, to whom they assigned a
     strong army with orders to subdue Ducetius. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>This general,
     setting out with his army, came upon Ducetius while he was encamped near Nomae; a fierce
     struggle ensued and many fell on both sides, but with difficulty the Syracusans overpowered and
     routed the Siceli, slaying many of them as they fled. Of those who survived the battle the
     larger number found safety in the strongholds of the Siceli, but a few chose to share the hopes
     of Ducetius. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>While these things were taking place, the
     Acragantini forced the capitulation of the stronghold of Motyum, which was held by the Siceli
     who stayed with Ducetius, and then, uniting their troops with the Syracusans who had already
     won the victory, they now camped together. As for Ducetius, now that he had been completely
     crushed by his defeat and that some of his soldiers were deserting and others plotting against
     him, he had come to the depths of despair. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="92">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Finally, when Ducetius saw that his
     remaining friends were about to lay hands upon him, he anticipated them by slipping away at
     night and riding off to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. And while it
     was still night he entered the market-place of the Syracusans, and seating himself at the
     altars he became a suppliant of the city, placing both his person and the land which he
     controlled at the disposition of the Syracusans. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When the
     multitude poured into the market-place in amazement at the unexpected event, the magistrates
     called a meeting of the Assembly and laid before it the question of what should be done with
     Ducetius. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Some of those who were accustomed to curry favour
     with the people advised that they should punish him as an enemy and inflict on him for his
     misdeeds the appropriate penalty; but the more fairminded of the elder citizens came forward
     and declared it as their opinion that they should spare the suppliant and show due regard for
     Fortune and the wrath of the gods. The people should consider, they continued, not what
     punishment Ducetius deserved, but what action was proper for the Syracusans; for to slay the
     victim of Fortune was not fitting, but to maintain reverence for the gods as well as to spare
     the suppliant was an act worthy of the magnanimity of the people. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The people thereupon cried out as with one voice from every side to spare the
     suppliant. The Syracusans, accordingly, released Ducetius from punishment and sent him off to
      <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, ordering him to spend his life in that

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />A man may justly feel perplexed when he stops to consider the inconsistency that is to be
     found in the life of mankind; for no thing which we consider to be good is ever found to have
     been given to human beings unadulterated, nor is there any evil in an absolute form without
     some admixture of advantage. Proofs of this will be obtained if we give thought to the events
     of the past, especially to those of outstanding importance. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />For instance, the campaign of Xerxes, the king of the Persians, against <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> aroused the greatest fear among the Greeks by reason of
     the immensity of his armaments, since the war they were entering might well decide their
     slavery, and since the Greek cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> had
     already been enslaved, all men assumed that those of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" >Greece</placeName> would also suffer a similar fate. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But the
     war, contrary to expectation, came to an amazing end, and not only were the peoples of
      <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> freed of the dangers threatening them, but
     they also won for themselves great glory, and every city of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" >Hellas</placeName> enjoyed such an abundant prosperity that all men were filled with wonder at
     the complete reversal of their fortune. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For from this time
     over the next fifty years <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> made great advance in
     prosperity. In these years, for example, plenty brought increase to the arts, and the greatest
     artists of whom we have record, including the sculptor Pheidias, flourished at that time; and
     there was likewise great advance in education, and philosophy and oratory had a high place of
     honour among all Greeks, and especially the Athenians. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For the
     philosophers were Socrates and Plato and Aristotle, and the orators were Pericles<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chap. 40; but only Pericles and the generals named below belong in this period.</note> and Isocrates and his pupils; and there were likewise men who
     have become renowned for generalship, Miltiades, Themistocles, Aristeides, Cimon, Myronides,
     and others more than these, regarding whom it would be a long task to write. </p>

     or Peloponnesians, they overcame great Persian armaments both on land and on sea, and humbled
     the famed leadership of the Persians to such an extent that they forced them by the terms of a

     joined battle, in the course of which Anaxicrates, the other general, who had fought
     brilliantly, ended his life heroically; but the rest were victorious in the battle and after

     of the sea, subdued the cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>. And since a
     large Persian garrison was there in <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> and the
     city was filled with missiles and arms of every description, and of grain and supplies of every

     to become master of all <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> but also to confound
     the Persians, since their being unable to come to the aid of the Salaminians, because the
     Athenians were masters of the sea, and their having left their allies in the lurch would cause
     them to be despised, and that, in a word, the entire war would be decided if all <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> were reduced by arms. And that is what actually happened.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenians began the siege of <placeName key="tgn,7002340" >Salamis</placeName> and were making daily assaults, but the soldiers in the city, supplied as

     counsel on the war with his friends and decided that it was to his advantage to conclude a
     peace with the Greeks. Accordingly he dispatched to the generals in <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> and to the satraps the written terms on which they were
     permitted to come to a settlement with the Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />Consequently Artabazus and Megabyzus sent ambassadors to <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName> to discuss a settlement. The Athenians were favourable and dispatched
     ambassadors plenipotentiary, the leader of whom was Callias the son of Hipponicus; and so the
     Athenians and their allies concluded with the Persians a treaty of peace, the principal terms
     of which run as follows: All the Greeks cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>
     are to live under laws of their own making; the satraps of the Persians are not to come nearer

     rapid growth because of the fertility of the land. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For lying
     as the city did between two rivers, the Crathis and the <placeName key="perseus,Sybaris" >Sybaris</placeName>, from which it derived its name, its inhabitants, who tilled an extensive
     and fruitful countryside, came to possess great riches. And since they kept granting
     citizenship to many aliens, they increased to such an extent that they were considered to be
     far the first among the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>; indeed
     they so excelled in population that the city possessed three hundred thousand
      citizens.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now there arose among the Sybarites a leader of the
     people named Telys,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">In <date value="-511">511</date> B.C.</note> who brought charges against the most influential men and persuaded the Sybarites to
     exile the five hundred wealthiest citizens and confiscate their estates. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And when these exiles went to <placeName key="perseus,Croton" >Croton</placeName> and took refuge at the altars in the marketplace, Telys dispatched
     ambassadors to the Crotoniates, commanding them either to deliver up the exiles or to expect
     war. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>An assembly of the people was convened and deliberation
     proposed on the question whether they should surrender the suppliants to the Sybarites or face
     a war with a superior foe, and the Council and people were at a loss what to do. At first the
     sentiments of the masses, from fear of the war, leaned toward handing over the suppliants, but
     after this, when Pythagoras the philosopher advised that they grant safety to the suppliants,
     they changed their opinions and accepted the war on behalf of the safety of the suppliants.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When the Sybarites advanced against them with three hundred
     thousand men, the Crotoniates opposed them with one hundred thousand under the command of

     the city of <placeName key="perseus,Sybaris">Sybaris</placeName> and laid it entirely waste.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Fifty-eight years later<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >In <date value="-453">453</date> B.C.</note> Thessalians joined in settling the city, but
     after a little while they were driven out by the Crotoniates, in the period we are now
     discussing. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And shortly thereafter the city was moved to
     another site and received another name, its founders being Lampon and Xenocritus; the
     circumstances of its refounding were as follows.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Sybarites
     who were driven a second time from their native city dispatched ambassadors to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, to the Lacedaemonians and Athenians, requesting that
     they assist their repatriation and take part in the settlement. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />Now the Lacedaemonians paid no attention to them, but the Athenians promised to join in the
     enterprise, and they manned ten ships and sent them to the Sybarites under the leadership of
     Lampon and Xenocritus; they further sent word to the several cities of the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, offering a share in the colony to anyone who

      <placeName key="tgn,6005942">Thurium</placeName> after the spring. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>They divided the city lengthwise by four streets, the first of which they named
     Heracleia, the second Aphrodisia, the third Olympias, and the fourth Dionysias, and breadthwise
     they divided it by three streets, of which the first was named Heroa, the second <placeName key="perseus,Thuria">Thuria</placeName>, and the last Thurina. And since the quarters formed
     by these streets were filled with dwellings, the construction of the city appeared to be good.
      </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For a short time only did the Thurians live together in peace, and then they fell into
     serious civil strife, not without reason. The former Sybarites, it appears, were assigning the
     most important offices to themselves and the lower ones to the citizens who had been enrolled
     later; their wives they also thought should enjoy precedence among the citizenesses in the
     offering of sacrifices to the gods, and the wives of the later citizens should take second
     place to them; furthermore, the land lying near the city they were portioning out in allotments
     among themselves, and the more distant land to the newcomers. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />And when a division arose for the causes we have mentioned, the citizens who had been added
     to the rolls after the others, being more numerous and more powerful, put to death practically
     all of the original Sybarites and took upon themselves the colonization of the city. Since the
     countryside was extensive and rich, they sent for colonists in large numbers from <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and to these they assigned parts of the city and gave
     them equal shares of the land. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Those who continued to live in
     the city quickly came to possess great wealth, and concluding friendship with the Crotoniates
     they administered their state in admirable fashion. Establishing a democratic form of
     government, they divided the citizens into ten tribes, to each of which they assigned a name
     based on the nationality of those who constituted it: three tribes composed of peoples gathered
     from the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> they named the Arcadian, the
     Achaean, and the Eleian; the same number, gathered from related peoples living outside the
      <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, they named the Boeotian, Amphictyonian,
     and Dorian; and the remaining four, constituted from other peoples, the Ionian, the Athenian,
     the Euboean, and the Islander. They also chose for their lawgiver the best man among such of
     their citizens as were admired for their learning, this being Charondas.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Charondas must be placed in the late 7th and early 6th centuries B.C.
      Aristotle (<bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 2.1274a">Aristot. Pol. 2.12</bibl>) states that he legislated
      for his native city of <placeName key="perseus,Catana">Catana</placeName> and for the other
      Chalcidian cities of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, and praises the precision of his laws. The legal fragments which Diodorus attributes to him are taken to be of Neo-Pythagorean origin.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He, after examining the legislations of all peoples, singled
     out the best principles and incorporated them in his laws; and he also worked out many
     principles which were his own discovery, and these it is not foreign to our purpose to mention
     for the edification of our readers. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>First of all, in the case of men who brought home a
     stepmother over their children he ordained as their punishment that they should have no part in
     counselling their fatherland, since he believed that men who planned so badly with respect to
     their own children would likewise be bad counsellors for their fatherland. For, he said,
     whoever had been fortunate in their first marriages should rest satisfied with their good lot,
     whereas whoever had been unfortunate in marriage and then made the same mistake a second time
     should be regarded as men without sense. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Men who had been
     found guilty of false accusation should, he decreed, wear wherever they went a wreath of
     tamarisk, in order that they might show to all their fellow citizens that they had won the
     highest prize for wickedness. As a consequence certain men who had been judged guilty of this
     charge, being unable to bear their great disgrace, voluntarily removed themselves from life.
     When this took place, every man who had made a practice of false accusation was banished from
     the city, and the government enjoyed a blessed life of freedom from this evil. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Charondas also wrote a unique law on evil
     association, which had been overlooked by all other lawgivers. He took it for granted that the
     characters of good men are in some cases perverted to evil by reason of their friendship and
     intimacy with bad persons,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. <bibl n="Aesch. Seven 599" >Aesch. Seven 599-600</bibl>:<quote type="verse">

      </quote>("In every issue naught is more evil than evil partnership&mdash;the fruit thereof

     a pestilent disease, sweeps over the life of mankind and infects the souls of the most upright;
     for the road to the worse slopes downward and so provides an easier way to take; and this is
     the reason why many men of fairly good character, ensnared by deceptive pleasures, get stranded
     upon very bad habits. Wishing, therefore, to remove this source of corruption, the lawgiver
     forbade the indulgence in friendship and intimacy with unprincipled persons, provided actions
     at law against evil association, and by means of severe penalties diverted from their course
     those who were about to err in this manner. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Charondas also wrote another law which is far superior to the one just
     mentioned and had also been overlooked by lawgivers before his time. He framed the law that all
     the sons of citizens should learn to read and write, the city providing the salaries of the
     teachers; for he assumed that men of no means and unable to provide the fees from their own
     resources would be cut off from the noblest pursuits. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In fact the lawgiver rated
     reading and writing above every other kind of learning, and with right good reason; for it is
     by means of them that most of the affairs of life and such as are most useful are concluded,
     like votes, letters, covenants, laws, and all other things which make the greatest contribution
     to orderly life. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>What man, indeed, could compose a worthy
     laudation of the knowledge of letters? For it is by such knowledge alone that the dead are
     carried in the memory of the living and that men widely separated in space hold converse
     through written communication with those who are at the furthest distance from them, as they
     were at their side; and in the case of covenants in time of war between states or kings the
     firmest guarantee that such agreements will abide is provided by the unmistakable character of
     writing. Indeed, speaking generally, it is writing alone which preserves the cleverest sayings
     of men of wisdom and the oracles of the gods, as well as philosophy and all knowledge, and is
     constantly handing them down to succeeding generations for the ages to come. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Consequently, while it is true that nature is the cause of life, the
     cause of good life is the education which is based upon reading and writing. And so Charondas,
     believing as he did that the illiterate were being deprived of certain great advantages, by his
     legislation corrected this wrong and judged them to be deserving of concern and expense on the
     part of the state; <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>and he so far excelled former lawgivers who
     had required that private citizens when ill should enjoy the service of physicians at state
     expense that, whereas those legislators judged men's bodies to be worthy of healing, he gave
     healing to the souls which were in distress through want of education,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">One wonders whether Diodorus, as he wrote these words, was recalling the inscription "Healing-place of the Soul," which, he told us, stood on the library of the

     never have need of those physicians, it is our heart's desire that all our time may be spent in
     the company of teachers of knowledge. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="15">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Charondas also wrote another law which merits
     approbation&mdash;that which deals with the protection of orphans. On the surface this law
     appears to contain nothing unusual or worthy of approbation, but when it is scrutinized more
     closely and examined with care, it indicates not only earnest study but also a high claim to
     regard. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For his law provided that the property of orphans
     should be managed by the next of kin on the father's side, but that the orphans should be
     reared by their relatives on the mother's side. Now at first glance a man sees nothing wise or
     outstanding in this law, but when it is explored deeply it is found to be justly worthy of
     praise. For if the reason is sought out why he entrusted the property of orphans to one group
     and the rearing of them to another, the lawgiver is seen to have shown an unusual kind of
     ingenuity. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>That is, the relatives on the mother's side will
     not plot to take the lives of the orphans, since they have no share in their inheritance, and
     the kin on the father's side do not have the opportunity to plot against their lives, since
     they are not entrusted with the care of their persons; furthermore, since they inherit the
     property if the orphans die of disease or some other circumstance, they will administer the
     estate with greater care, believing that they hold as their own what are hopes based upon an
     act of Fortune. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="16">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Charondas also wrote a law against men who had left their post in war or
     had refused to take up arms at all in defence of their fatherland. Other lawmakers had made
     death the punishment of such men, but Charondas ordered that they should sit for three days in
     the market-place dressed in women's clothes. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And this law is
     not only more humane than those of other peoples but it also imperceptibly, by the severity of
     the disgrace it inflicts, diverts others of like mind from cowardice; for it is better to die
     than to experience such a gross indignity in one's fatherland. Moreover, he did not do away
     with the guilty men but preserved them for the state against the needs of wartime, believing
     that they would make amends, by reason of the punishment caused by that disgrace, and would be
     eager to wipe out their former shame by bolder deeds of bravery. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The lawgiver also preserved the laws he made by means of
     their severity. That is, he commanded that under every circumstance obedience should be
     rendered to the law even if it had been altogether wrongly conceived; but he allowed any law to
     be corrected, if it needed correction. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For he took the
     position that although it was right enough that a man should be overruled by a lawgiver, to be
     overruled by one in private station was quite preposterous, even if that serves the general
     interest. And it was especially by this means that he prevented men who present in jury-courts
     the pretences and cunning devices of those who have violated the laws in place of the literal
     terms of the laws from destroying by inventive sophistries their supremacy. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>As a consequence, we are told, to certain men who had offered such
     arguments before the jurors who were passing on the punishment of men who had violated the law,
     he said, "You must save either the law or the man." </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="17">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But the most amazing
     legislation of Charondas, we are told, was that which related to the revision of the laws.
     Observing that in most states the multitude of men who kept endeavouring to revise the laws led
     continually to the vitiation of the previously existing body of the laws and incited the masses
     to civil strife, he wrote a law which was peculiar and altogether unique. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He commanded, namely, that the man who proposed to revise any law should
     put his neck in a noose at the time he made his proposal of a revision, and remain in that
     position until the people had reached a decision on the revision of the law, and if the
     Assembly approved the revised law, the introducer was to be freed of the noose, but if the
     proposal of revision did not carry, the noose was to be drawn and the man die on the spot.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Such a law is also attested for <placeName key="tgn,7010899" >Locris</placeName>; cp. Bonner-Smith, <title>Administration of Justice from Homer to
       Aristotle,</title> 1, p. 75.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Such being the legislation relating to revision, fear
     restrained subsequent lawmakers and not a man dared to utter a word about revising laws; and in
     all subsequent time history records but three men who proposed revision among the Thurians, and
     these appeared because circumstances arose which rendered proposals of revision imperative.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thus, there was a law that if
     a man put out the eye of another, he should have his own eye put out, and a man with but one
     eye, having had that eye put out and thus lost his entire sight, claimed that the offender, by
     the loss in requital of but one eye, had paid a less penalty; for, he maintained, if a man who
     had blinded a fellow citizen paid only the penalty fixed by the law, he would not have suffered
     the same loss; it would be just, therefore, that the man who had destroyed the entire sight of
     a man with but one eye should have both his eyes put out, if he were to receive a like
     punishment. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently the man with one eye, taking the
     matter strongly to heart, made bold to raise in the Assembly the case of the loss he had
     suffered, at the same time both lamenting bitterly over his personal misfortune to his fellow
     citizens and suggesting to the commons that they revise the law; and in the end, putting his
     neck in a noose, he won his proposal, set at naught the existing law, and had the revision
     approved, and he escaped the death by the noose as well. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="18">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A second law, which gave a
     wife the right to divorce her husband and marry whomever she chose, was also revised. A certain
     man, who was well advanced in years and had a wife who was younger than he and had left him,
     proposed to the Thurians that they revise the law by the added provision that the wife who
     leaves a husband may marry whomever she chooses, provided the man is not younger than her
     former husband; and that likewise, if a man sends his wife away he may not marry a woman
     younger than the wife whom he had sent away. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The elderly man
     won his proposal and set at naught the former law, also escaping the peril of the noose which
     threatened him; and his wife, who had thus been prevented from living with a younger husband,
     married again the man she had left. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A third law to be revised had to do with heiresses and is also found in the
     legislation of Solon.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">See <bibl n="Plut. Sol. 20">Plut.
       Sol. 20</bibl>.</note> Charondas ordered that the next of kin be assigned in marriage to an
     heiress and that likewise an heiress be assigned in marriage to her nearest relative, who was
     required to marry her or, if she were poor, to contribute five hundred drachmas as a dowry of
     the penniless heiress. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And a certain orphan who was an
     heiress, of good birth but altogether without means of support and so unable by reason of her
     poverty to find a husband, turned to the people for aid, explaining to them with tears how
     helpless and scorned she was; and she went on to outline the revision of the law whereby, in
     place of the payment of five hundred drachmas, it should specify that the next of kin be
     required to marry the heiress who had been assigned to him. The people took pity on her and
     voted for the revision of the law, and thus the orphan escaped the peril which threatened her
     from the noose, while the nearest of kin, who was wealthy, was compelled to take to wife a
     penniless heiress without a dowry. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="19">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It remains for us to speak of the death of Charondas, in
     connection with which a peculiar and unexpected thing happened to him. He had set out to the
     country carrying a dagger because of the robbers, and on his return the Assembly was in session
     and the commons in an uproar, whereupon he approached it because he was curious about the
     matter in dispute. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But he had made a law that no man should
     enter the Assembly carrying a weapon, and since he had forgotten he was carrying the dagger at
     his side, he provided certain of his enemies with an occasion to bring an accusation against
     him. And when one of them said, "You have annulled your own law," he replied, "Not so, by Zeus,
     I will uphold it," and drawing the dagger he slew himself. Some historians, however, attribute
     this act to Diocles, the lawgiver of the Syracusans.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">See Book 13.33.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But now that we have discoursed
     at sufficient length upon Charondas the lawmaker, we wish to speak briefly also of the lawmaker
     Zaleucus, since the two men not only followed similar principles of life but were also natives
     of neighbouring cities. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="20">

     the philosopher Pythagoras. Having been accorded high favour in his native city, he was chosen
     lawmaker and committed to writing a thoroughly novel system of law, making his beginning, first
     of all, with the gods of the heavens. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For at the outset in the
     introduction to his legislation as a whole he declared it to be necessary that the inhabitants
     of the city should first of all assume as an article of their creed that gods exist, and that,
     as their minds survey the heavens and its orderly scheme and arrangement, they should judge
     that these creations are not the result of Chance or the work of men's hands; that they should
     revere the gods as the cause of all that is noble and good in the life of mankind; and that
     they should keep the soul pure from every kind of evil, in the belief that the gods take no
     pleasure in either the sacrifices or costly gifts of the wicked but in the just and honourable
     practices of good men. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And after inviting the citizens in this
     introduction to reverence and justice, he appended the further command that they should
     consider no one of their fellow citizens as an enemy with whom there can be no reconciliation,
     but that the quarrel be entered into with the thought that they will again come to agreement
     and friendship; and that the one who acts otherwise should be considered by his fellow citizens
     to be savage and untamed of soul. Also the magistrates were urged by him not to be wilful or
     arrogant, and not to render judgement out of enmity or friendship. And among his several
     ordinances a number were added of his own devising, which showed exceptionally great wisdom.

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To cite examples, whereas everywhere else wayward wives were required to pay fines,
     Zaleucus stopped their licentious behaviour by a cunningly devised punishment. That is, he made
     the following laws: a free-born woman may not be accompanied by more than one female slave,
     unless she is drunk; she may not leave the city during the night, unless she is planning to
     commit adultery; she may not wear gold jewelry or a garment with a purple border, unless she is

     easily turned men aside from harmful luxury and wanton living; for no man wished to incur the

     themselves were not equal to them in battle, dispatched ambassadors to Cercyra, asking the
     Cercyraeans on the grounds of kinship to come to their aid. When the Cercyraeans paid no
     attention to the request, they sent ambassadors to seek an alliance with the Corinthians and
     declared <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> to be their single mother-city;
     at the same time they asked for colonists. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And the
     Corinthians, partly out of pity for the Epidamnians and partly out of hatred for the
     Cercyraeans, since they alone of the colonists who had gone from <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> would not send the customary sacrificial animals to
     the mother-city, decided to go to the aid of the Epidamnians. Consequently they sent to

     the guards from <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> demanding that the
     question of the origin of the colony be decided by a court of arbiters, not by war. When the
     Corinthians made no answer to this proposal, both sides decided upon war, and they set about
     fitting out great naval armaments and gathering allies. And so the Corinthian War, as it has

     thousand talents,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Given as ten thousand in chaps. 40.2; 54.3; Book 13.21.2.</note> they had transferred to <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">In <date value="-454">454</date> B.C.</note> and given over to Pericles to guard. This man stood far above his fellow citizens
     in birth, renown, and ability as an orator. But after some time he had spent a very
     considerable amount of this money for his own purposes, and when he was called upon for an
     accounting he fell ill, since he was unable to render the statement of the monies with which he
     had been entrusted. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>While he was worried over the matter,
     Alcibiades, his nephew, who was an orphan and was being reared at the home of Pericles, though
     still a lad showed him a way out of making an explanation of the use of the money. Seeing how
     his uncle was troubled he asked him the cause of his worry. And when Pericles said, "I am asked
     for the explanation of the use of the money and I am seeking some means whereby I may be able
     to render an accounting of it to the citizens," Alcibiades replied, "You should be seeking some
     means not how to render but how not to render an accounting." <milestone unit="section" n="4" />Consequently Pericles, accepting the reply of the boy, kept pondering in what way he could
     embroil the Athenians in a great war; for that would be the best way, he thought, because of
     the disturbance and distractions and fears which would beset the city, for him to escape giving
     an exact accounting of the money. Bearing upon this expedient an incident happened to him by
     mere chance for the following causes. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="39">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The statue<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The gold and ivory statue in the Parthenon.</note> of Athena was a work of
     Pheidias, and Pericles, the son of Xanthippus, had been appointed overseer of the undertaking.
     But some of the assistants of Pheidias, who had been prevailed upon by Pericles' enemies, took
     seats as suppliants at the altars of the gods; and when they were called upon to explain their
     surprising action, they claimed that they would show that Pheidias had possession of a large
     amount of the sacred funds, with the connivance and assistance of Pericles the overseer.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Consequently, when the Assembly convened to consider the
     affair, the enemies of Pericles persuaded the people to arrest Pheidias and lodged a charge
     against Pericles himself of stealing sacred property. Furthermore, they falsely accused the
      sophist<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The general name given the teachers of advanced education in the fifth century.</note> Anaxagoras, who was Pericles' teacher, of impiety
     against the gods<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Anaxagoras was one of the most
      distinguished physical philosophers of Greece, who maintained that the universe was directed
      by unchangeable Mind and tried to give a natural explanation of eclipses, rainbows, the
      heavenly bodies, of which he said the sun was a mass of blazing metal larger than the
       <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>, and other phenomena of nature. Of course such teaching ran counter to the popular polytheism of the day.</note> ; and they
     involved Pericles in their accusations and malicious charges, since jealousy made them eager to
     discredit the eminence as well as the fame of the man.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">It
      is more than likely that the accusations against these two friends of Pericles fell some years
      before the outbreak of the war (cp. Adcock in <title>Camb. Anc. Hist.</title> 5, pp. 477-480). At any rate Thucydides' account of the causes of the war makes no mention of either Pheidias
      or Anaxagoras.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But Pericles, knowing that
     during the operations of war the populace has respect for noble men because of their urgent
     need of them, whereas in times of peace they keep bringing false accusations against the very
     same men because they have nothing to do and are envious, came to the conclusion that it would
     be to his own advantage to embroil the state in a great war, in order that the city, in its
     need of the ability and skill in generalship of Pericles, should pay no attention to the
     accusations being lodged against him and would have neither leisure nor time to scrutinize
     carefully the accounting he would render of the funds. <milestone unit="section" n="4" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when the Athenians voted to exclude the Megarians from
     both their market and harbours, the Megarians turned to the Spartans for aid. And the
     Lacedaemonians, being won over by the Megarians, in the most open manner dispatched ambassadors
     in accordance with the decision of the Council of the League,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The Peloponnesian League.</note> ordering the Athenians to rescind the action
     against the Megarians and threatening, if they did not accede, to wage war upon them together
     with the forces of their allies. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When the Assembly convened to
     consider the matter, Pericles, who far excelled all his fellow citizens in skill of oratory,
     persuaded the Athenians not to rescind the action, saying that for them to accede to the
     demands of the Lacedaemonians, contrary to their own interests, would be the first step toward
     slavery. Accordingly he advised that they bring their possessions from the countryside into the
     city and fight it out with the Spartans by means of their command of the sea. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="40">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Speaking of the war, Pericles, after defending his course in well-considered words,
     enumerated first the multitude of allies <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>
     possessed and the superiority of its naval strength, and then the large sum of money which had
     been removed from <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and which had in fact been gathered from the tribute
     into one fund for the common use of the cities; <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>from the ten
     thousand talents in the common fund four thousand had been expended on the building of the
      Propylaea<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The entrance to the Acropolis.</note>and the
     siege of <placeName key="tgn,6004814">Potidaea</placeName>; and each year there was an income
     from the tribute paid by the allies of four hundred and sixty talents. Beside this he declared
     that the vessels employed in solemn processions and the booty taken from the Medes were worth
     five hundred talents, <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>and he pointed to the multitude of
     votive offerings in the various sanctuaries and to the fact that the fifty talents of gold on
     the statue of Athena for its embellishment was so constructed as to be removable; and he showed
     that all these, if dire need befell them, they could borrow from the gods and return to them
     again when peace came, and that also by reason of the long peace the manner of life of the
     citizens had made great strides toward prosperity. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In addition to these financial resources Pericles pointed out that,
     omitting the allies and garrisons, the city had available twelve thousand hoplites, the
     garrisons and metics amounted to more than seventeen thousand, and the triremes available to
     three hundred. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>He also pointed out that the Lacedaemonians
     were both lacking in money and far behind the Athenians in naval armaments. After he had
     recounted these facts and incited the citizens to war, he persuaded the people to pay no
     attention to the Lacedaemonians. This he accomplished readily by reason of his great ability as
     an orator, which is the reason he has been called "The Olympian." <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Mention has been made of this even by Aristophanes, the poet of the Old Comedy, who

     the Athenians, and dispatching ambassadors to the king of the Persians, urged him to ally

     the upper hand because of their valour and were slaying many of their opponents; but when the
     slaves and children began pelting the Thebans with tiles from the houses and wounding them,
     they turned in flight; and some of them escaped from the city to safety, but some who found
     refuge in a house were forced to give themselves up. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>When the
     Thebans learned the outcome of the attempt from the survivors of the battle, they at once
     marched forth in all haste in full force. And since the Plataeans who dwelt in the rural

     to supply many triremes for the war. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Lacedaemonians were
     glad to accept this offer, but while they were busied with the building of the triremes, the

     dismay sent envoys to the enemy and surrendered to them both themselves and the city.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The commanders of the Lacedaemonians, summoning the Plataeans
     one by one, asked what good deed he had ever performed for the Lacedaemonians, and when each

     Spartans any harm; and when not a man could deny that he had, they condemned all of them to
     death. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Consequently they slew all who still remained, razed
     the city to the ground, and farmed out its territory. So the Plataeans, who had maintained with

     over to them. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Corinthians gladly agreed to the proposals,

     had returned to their native land, arrested and put to death the men who had always been
     popular leaders and had acted as champions of the people. They also put an end to the

     to the men responsible for the revolt against the established government. These, in fear of the

<div2 type="chapter" n="58"><p><note anchored="yes" type="Date" resp="Loeb"><date value="-426">426</date> B.C.</note><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Euthynes was archon in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the
     Romans elected in place of consuls three military tribunes, Marcus Fabius, Marcus Falinius, and
     Lucius Servilius. In this year the Athenians, who had enjoyed a period of relief from the
      plague,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chap. 45.</note> became involved again in the
     same misfortunes; <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>for they were so seriously attacked by the
     disease that of their soldiers they lost more than four thousand infantry and four hundred
     cavalry, and of the rest of the population, both free and slave, more than ten thousand. And
     since history seeks to ascertain the cause of the malignancy of this disease, it is our duty to
     explain these matters. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As a
     result of heavy rains in the previous winter the ground had become soaked with water, and many
     low-lying regions, having received a vast amount of water, turned into shallow pools and held
     stagnant water, very much as marshy regions do; and when these waters became warm in the summer
     and grew putrid, thick foul vapours were formed, which, rising up in fumes, corrupted the
     surrounding air, the very thing which may be seen taking place in marshy grounds which are by
     nature pestilential. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Contributing also to the disease was the
     bad character of the food available; for the crops which were raised that year were altogether
     watery and their natural quality was corrupted. And a third cause of the disease proved to be
     the failure of the etesian<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">That is, the "annual" winds, blowing from the northwest in summer.</note> winds to blow, by which normally most of the heat
     in summer is cooled; and when the heat intensified and the air grew fiery, the bodies of the
     inhabitants, being without anything to cool them, wasted away. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />Consequently all the illnesses which prevailed at that time were found to be accompanied by
     fever, the cause of which was the excessive heat. And this was the reason why most of the sick
     threw themselves into the cisterns and springs in their craving to cool their bodies.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Athenians, however, because the disease was so severe,
     ascribed the causes of their misfortune to the deity. Consequently, acting upon the command of
     a certain oracle, they purified the island of <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>,
     which was sacred to Apollo and had been defiled, as men thought, by the burial there of the
     dead. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Digging up, therefore, all the graves on <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, they transferred the remains to the island of
      <placeName key="tgn,5004151">Rheneia</placeName>, as it is called, which lies near <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. They also passed a law that neither birth nor burial
     should be allowed on <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>. And they also celebrated
     the festival assembly,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">An ancient festival of the Ionian

     reasons. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Trachinians had been at war with the neighbouring
     Oetaeans for many years and had lost the larger number of their citizens. Since the city was
     deserted, they thought it proper that the Lacedaemonians, who were colonists from <placeName key="perseus,Trachis">Trachis</placeName>, should assume the care of it. And the
     Lacedaemonians, both because of their kinship and because Heracles, their ancestor, in ancient
     times had made his home in <placeName key="perseus,Trachis">Trachis</placeName>, decided to
     make it a great city. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently the Lacedaemonians and the
     Peloponnesians sent forth four thousand colonists and accepted any other Greeks who wished to
     have a part in the colony; the latter numbered not less than six thousand. The result was that
     they made <placeName key="perseus,Trachis">Trachis</placeName> a city of ten thousand
     inhabitants, and after portioning out the territory in allotments they named the city
     Heracleia. </p>

      In the Bay of <placeName key="tgn,7011036">Navarino</placeName>, on which <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> lies, occurred the famous naval Battle of <placeName key="tgn,7011036">Navarino</placeName> between the allied British, Russian, and French fleet
      and the Turkish. The victory of the allied fleet, 20th October <date value="1827-10" >1827</date>, decided the issue of the Greek war of independence.</note> intending to fortify
     this stronghold as a threat to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>; for
     it is an exceptionally strong place, situated in <placeName key="tgn,7011369" >Messenia</placeName> and four hundred stades distant from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta" >Sparta</placeName>. Since he had at the time both many ships and an adequate number of
     soldiers, in twenty days he threw a wall about <placeName key="perseus,Pylos" >Pylos</placeName>. The Lacedaemonians, when they learned that <placeName key="perseus,Pylos" >Pylos</placeName> had been fortified, gathered together a large force, both infantry and
     ships. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Consequently, when they set sail for <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, they not only had a fleet of forty-five fully equipped
     triremes but also marched with an army of twelve thousand soldiers; for they considered it to
     be a disgraceful thing that men who were not brave enough to defend <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> while it was being ravaged should fortify and hold a
     fortress in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now these forces under the command of Thrasymedes pitched their camp in
     the neighbourhood of <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>. And since the troops
     were seized by an eager desire to undergo any and every danger and to take <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> by storm, the Lacedaemonians stationed the ships with
     their prows facing the entrance to the harbour in order that they might use them for blocking
     the enemy's attempt to enter, and assaulting the walls with the infantry in successive waves
     and displaying all possible rivalry, they put up contests of amazing valour. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Also to the island called <placeName key="tgn,6005594" >Sphacteria</placeName>, which extends lengthwise to the harbour and protects it from the
     winds, they transported the best troops of the Lacedaemonians and their allies. This they did
     in their desire to forestall the Athenians in getting control of the island before them, since
     its situation was especially advantageous to the prosecution of the siege. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And though they were engaged every day in the fighting before the
     fortifications and were suffering wounds because of the superior height of the wall, they did
     not relax the violence of their fighting; as a consequence, many of them were slain and not a
     few were wounded as they pressed upon a position which had been fortified. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Athenians, who had secured beforehand a place which was also a
     natural stronghold and possessed large supplies of missiles and a great abundance of everything
     else they might need, kept defending their position with spirit; for they hoped that, if they
     were successful in their design, they could carry the whole war to the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnesus</placeName> and ravage, bit by bit, the territory of the enemy.

     their assaults upon the walls, while many others were objects of wonder for their deeds of
     valour, the greatest acclaim was won by Brasidas. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For when the
     captains of the triremes lacked the courage to bring the ships to land because of the rugged
     nature of the shore, he, being himself the commander of a trireme, called out in a loud voice
     to the pilot, ordering him not to spare the vessel but to drive the trireme at full speed to
     the land; for it would be disgraceful, he cried, for Spartans to be unsparing of their lives as
     they fought for victory, and yet to spare their vessels and to endure the sight of Athenians
     holding the soil of <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And finally he succeeded in forcing the pilot to drive the ship forward and, when the

     Athenians, defending themselves from a base on Laconian soil, were gaining the mastery over the
     Spartans, whereas the Lacedaemonians, regarding their own soil as the enemy's, were assaulting
     the enemy from the sea as then base; and, as it happened, those who were masters of the land in
     this case controlled the sea, and those who held first place on the sea were beating off an
     attack on land which they held. </p>

     Romans elected as consuls Titus Quinctius and Aulus Cornelius Cossus. During this year,
     although the Peloponnesian War had just come to an end, again tumults and military movements
     occurred throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, for the following reasons.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Although the Athenians and Lacedaemonians had concluded a
     truce and cessation of hostilities in company with their allies, they had formed an alliance
     without consultation with the allied cities. By this act they fell under suspicion of having
     formed an alliance for their private ends, with the purpose of enslaving the rest of the
     Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>As a consequence the most important of the cities
     maintained a mutual exchange of embassies and conversations regarding a union of policy and an
     alliance against the Athenians and Lacedaemonians. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The leading
     states in this undertaking were the four most powerful ones, <placeName key="perseus,Argos" >Argos</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, and <placeName key="perseus,Elis" >Elis</placeName>.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There was good reason to suspect that
      <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011065" >Lacedaemon</placeName> had common designs against the rest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" >Greece</placeName>, since a clause had been added to the compact which the two had made,
     namely, that the Athenians and Lacedaemonians had the right, according as these states may deem
     it best, to add to or subtract from the agreements. Moreover, the Athenians by decree had
     lodged in ten men the power to take counsel regarding what would be of advantage to the city;
     and since much the same thing had also been done by the Lacedaemonians, the selfish ambitions
     of the two states were open for all to see. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Many cities
     answered to the call of their common freedom, and since the Athenians were disdained by reason
     of the defeat they had suffered at <placeName key="tgn,6001700">Delium</placeName> and the
     Lacedaemonians had had their fame reduced because of the capture of their citizens on the
     island of <placeName key="tgn,6005594">Sphacteria</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">See chap. 63.</note> a large number of cities joined together and selected
     the city of the Argives to hold the position of leader. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For
     this city enjoyed a high position by reason of its achievements in the past, since until the
     return of the Heracleidae<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">See Book 4.57 ff.</note>
     practically all the most important kings had come from the <placeName key="tgn,7002739" >Argolis</placeName>, and furthermore, since the city had enjoyed peace for a long time, it had
     received revenues of the greatest size and had a great store not only of money but also of men.
      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Argives, believing that the entire leadership was to be
     conceded to them, picked out one thousand of their younger citizens who were at the same time
     the most vigorous in body and the most wealthy, and freeing them also from every other service
     to the state and supplying them with sustenance at public expense, they had them undergo
     continuous training and exercise. These young men, therefore, by reason of the expense incurred
     for them and their continuous training, quickly formed a body of athletes trained to deeds of
     war. </p>

     served with Brasidas in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, a thousand in all,
     were given their freedom; then the Spartans, who had been taken prisoner on the island of

     most unfavourably disposed of them with kindly treatment. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The

     inhabitants of <placeName key="perseus,Scione">Scione</placeName>; for after reducing them by

     themselves <emph>en masse,</emph> formed their lines opposite the Lacedaemonians. A sharp
     battle followed, and the picked troops of the Argives, one thousand in number, who had received
     excellent training in warfare, were the first to put to flight their opponents and made great
     slaughter of them in their pursuit. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But the Lacedaemonians,
     after putting to flight the other parts of the army and slaying many, wheeled about to oppose
     the Argives and by their superior numbers surrounded them, hoping to destroy them to a man.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Now although the picked troops of the Argives, though in
     numbers far inferior, were superior in feats of courage, the king of the Lacedaemonians led the
     fight and held out firmly against the perils he encountered; and he would have slain all the
     Argives&mdash;for he was resolved to fulfil the promises he had made to his fellow citizens
     and wipe out, by a great deed, his former ill repute&mdash;but he was not allowed to
     consummate that purpose. For Pharax the Spartan, who was one of the advisers of Agis and
     enjoyed the highest reputation in <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, directed
     him to leave a way of escape for the picked men and not, by hazarding the issue against men who
     had given up all hope of life, to learn what valour is when abandoned by Fortune. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>So the king was compelled, in obedience to the command recently given
      him,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chap. 78.6.</note> to leave a way of escape even
     as Pharax advised. So the Thousand, having been allowed to pass through in the manner
     described, made their way to safety, and the Lacedaemonians, having won the victory in a great
     battle, erected a trophy and returned home. </p>

     as they did many to aid them, because of the prominent position their wealth and brave exploits
     gave them, they first of all seized the men who had been accustomed to be the leaders of the

     the laws and were proceeding to take the management of the state into their own hands. They

      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Since the quarrel between the two cities had become serious,

     in which the Selinuntians were the victors, having slain not a few Egestaeans. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Since the Egestaeans had been humbled and were not strong enough of

     questioned by the Council and asked how he could recognize the faces at night, he replied that
     he had seen them by the light of the moon. Since, then, the man had convicted himself of lying,
     no credence was given to his story, and of other investigators not a man was able to discover a

     but upon the other peoples they would merely lay a tribute severally which they would pay

     slew many of those who came up from the sea to their defence. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />And since a great uproar arose about the forts and the camp, the Athenians who were engaged
     in the sea-battle turned about in dismay and fled toward the last remaining fort. The
     Syracusans pursued them without order, but the Athenians, when they saw themselves unable to
     find safety on land because the Syracusans controlled two forts, were forced to turn about and
     renew the sea-battle. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And since the Syracusans had broken

     every day against the ships of the Athenians and continuing the fight. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And when Ariston the Corinthian pilot advised them to make the prows of

     great advantage in the fighting which followed. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the Attic
     triremes were built with weaker and high prows, and for this reason it followed that, when they
     rammed, they damaged only the parts of a ship that extended above the water, so that the enemy
     suffered no great damage; whereas the ships of the Syracusans, built as they were with the
     structure about the prow strong and low, would often, as they delivered their ramming blows,
     sink with one shock the triremes of the Athenians.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><bibl n="P">Thuc. 7.36</bibl> describes in considerable detail this strengthening of the bow and its effect upon the tactics of the fighting in the harbour.</note>

     endure the scorn of the Syracusans, put out against the enemy in the Great Harbour, a
     sea-battle commenced in which all the triremes joined. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Now
     though the Athenians had fast-sailing triremes and enjoyed the advantage from their long
     experience at sea as well as from the skill of their pilots, yet their superiority in these
     respects brought them no return since the sea-battle was in a narrow area; and the Syracusans,
     engaging at close quarters and giving the enemy no opportunity to turn about to ram, not only
     cast spears at the soldiers on the decks, but also, by hurling stones, forced them to leave the
     prows, and in many cases simply by ramming a ship that met them and then boarding the enemy
     vessel they made it a land-battle on the ship's deck. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The
     Athenians, being pressed upon from every quarter, turned to flight; and the Syracusans,
     pressing in pursuit, not only sank seven triremes but made a large number unfit for use.

<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At the moment when the hopes of the Syracusans had raised their spirits high because
     of their victory over the enemy both by land and by sea, Eurymedon and Demosthenes arrived,
     having sailed there from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> with a great force
     and gathered on the way allied troops from the Thurians and Messapians. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They brought more than eighty triremes and five thousand soldiers,
     excluding the crews; and they also conveyed on merchant vessels arms and money as well as siege
     machines and every other kind of equipment. As a result the hopes of the Syracusans were dashed
     again, since they believed that they could not now readily find the means to bring themselves
     up to equality with the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Demosthenes persuaded his fellow commanders to assault Epipolae, for it was impossible by any
     other means to wall off the city, and taking ten thousand hoplites and as many more light-armed
     troops, he attacked the Syracusans by night. Since the assault had not been expected, they
     overpowered some forts, and breaking into the fortifications of Epipole threw down a part of
     the wall. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But when the Syracusans ran together to the scene
     from every quarter and Hermocrates also came to the aid with the picked troops, the Athenians
     were forced out and, it being night, because of their unfamiliarity with the region were
     scattered some to one place and others to another. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The
     Syracusans and their allies, pursuing after them, slew two thousand five hundred of the enemy,
     wounded not a few, and captured much armour. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And after the
     battle the Syracusans dispatched Sicanus, one of their generals, with twelve<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><bibl n="Thuc. 7.46">Thuc. 7.46</bibl> says fifteen.</note>
     triremes to the other cities, both to announce the victory to the allies and to ask them for
     aid. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Athenians, now that their affairs had taken a turn for the worse and a wave of
     pestilence had struck the camp because the region round about it was marshy, counselled
     together how they should deal with the situation. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Demosthenes
     thought that they should sail back to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> with
     all speed, stating that to risk their lives against the Lacedaemonians in defence of their
     fatherland was preferable to settling down on <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>
     and accomplishing nothing worth while; but Nicias said that they ought not to abandon the siege
     in so disgraceful a fashion, while they were well supplied with triremes, soldiers, and funds;
     furthermore, he added, if they should make peace with the Syracusans without the approval of
     the Athenian people and sail back to their country, peril would attend them from the men who
     make it their practice to bring false charges against their generals. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Of the participants in the council some agreed with Demosthenes on putting to sea, but
     others expressed the same opinion as Nicias; and so they came to no clear decision and took no
     action. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And since help came to the Syracusans from the Siceli,
     Selinuntians, and Geloans, as well as from the Himeraeans and Camarinaeans, the Syracusans were
     the more emboldened, but the Athenians became apprehensive. Also, when the epidemic greatly
     increased, many of the soldiers were dying and all regretted that they had not set out upon
     their return voyage long since. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently, since the
     multitude was in an uproar and all the others were eager to take to the ships, Nicias found
     himself compelled to yield on the matter of their returning home. And when the generals were
     agreed, the soldiers began gathering together their equipment, loading the triremes, and
     raising the yard-arms; and the generals issued orders to the multitude that at the signal not a
     man in the camp should be late, for he who lagged would be left behind. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But when they were about to sail on the following day, on the night of
     the day before, the moon was eclipsed.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">27th August, <date value="-413">413</date> B.C.</note> Consequently Nicias, who was not only by nature a
     superstitiously devout man but also cautious because of the epidemic in the camp, summoned the
     soothsayers. And when they declared that the departure must be postponed for the customary
     three days,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">"Thrice nine days," according to <bibl n="Thuc. 7.50.4">Thuc. 7.50.4</bibl>; "another full period of the moon," according to <bibl n="Plut. Nic.
       23.6">Plut. Nic. 23.6</bibl>.</note> Demosthenes and the others were
     also compelled, out of respect for the deity, to accede. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the Syracusans learned
     from some deserters why the departure had been deferred, they manned all their triremes,
     seventy-four in number, and leading out their ground forces attacked the enemy both by land and
     by sea. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Athenians, having manned eighty-six triremes,
     assigned to Eurymedon, the general, the command of the right wing, opposite to which was
     stationed the general of the Syracusans, Agatharchus; on the other wing Euthydemus had been
     stationed and opposite to him was Sicanus commanding the Syracusans; and in command of the
     centre of the line were Menander for the Athenians and Pythes the Corinthian for the
     Syracusans. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Although the Athenian line was the longer since
     they were engaging with a superior number of triremes, yet the very factor which they thought
     would work to their advantage was not the least in their undoing. For Eurymedon endeavoured to
     outflank the opposing wing; but when he had become detached from his line, the Syracusans
     turned to face him and he was cut off and forced into a bay called Dascon which was held by the
     Syracusans. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Being hemmed in as he was into a narrow place, he
     was forced to run ashore, where some man gave him a mortal wound and he lost his life, and
     seven of his ships were destroyed in this place. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The battle
     had now spread throughout both fleets, and when the word was passed along that the general had
     been slain and some ships lost, at first only those ships gave way which were nearest to those
     which had been destroyed, but later, as the Syracusans pressed forward and pushed the fight
     boldly because of the success they had won, the whole Athenian force was overpowered and
     compelled to turn in flight. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And since the pursuit turned
     toward the shallow part of the harbour, not a few triremes ran aground in the shoals. When this
     took place, Sicanus, the Syracusan general, straightway filling a merchant ship with faggots
     and pine-wood and pitch, set fire to the ships which were wallowing in the shoals. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>But although they were put on fire, the Athenians not only quickly
     extinguished the flames but, finding no other means of safety, also vigorously fought off from
     their ships the men who were rushing against them; and the land forces ran to their aid along
     the beach on which the ships had run ashore. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And since they
     all withstood the attack with vigour, on land the Syracusans were turned back, but at sea they
     won the decision and sailed back to the city. The losses of the Syracusans were few, but of the
     Athenians not less than two thousand men and eighteen triremes. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="14">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Syracusans,
     believing that the danger no longer was the losing of their city but that, far more, the
     contest had become one for the capture of the camp together with the enemy, blocked off the
     entrance to the harbour by the construction of a barrier. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For
     they moored at anchor both small vessels and triremes as well as merchant-ships, with iron
     chains between them, and to the vessels they built bridges of boards, completing the
     undertaking in three days. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Athenians, seeing their hope of
     deliverance shut off in every direction, decided to man all their triremes and put on them
     their best land troops, and thus, by means both of the multitude of their ships and of the
     desperation of the men who would be fighting for their lives, eventually to strike terror into
     the Syracusans. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Consequently they put on board the officers
     and choicest troops from the whole army, manning in this way one hundred and fifteen triremes,
     and the other soldiers they stationed on land along the beach. The Syracusans drew up their
     infantry before the city, and fully manned seventy-four triremes; and the triremes were
     attended by free boys on small boats, who were in years below manhood and were fighting at the
     side of their fathers. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And the walls about the harbour and
     every high place in the city were crowded with people; for wives and maidens and all who,
     because of age, could not render the service war demands, since the whole war was coming to its
     decision, were eyeing the battle with the greatest anguish of spirit. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="15">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this time Nicias,
     the general of the Athenians, as he surveyed the ships and measured the magnitude of the
     struggle, could not remain at his station on shore, but leaving the land troops he boarded a
     boat and passed along the line of the Athenian triremes. Calling each captain by name and
     stretching forth his hands, he implored them all, now if ever before, to grasp the only hope
     left to them, for on the valour of those who were about to join battle at sea depended the
     preservation both of themselves, every man of them, and of their fatherland. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Those who were fathers of children he reminded of their sons; those who
     were sons of distinguished fathers he exhorted not to bring disgrace upon the valorous deeds of
     their ancestors; those who had been honoured by their fellow citizens he urged to show
     themselves worthy of their crowns; and all of them he reminded of the trophies erected at
      <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> and begged them not to bring to disrepute the
     far-famed glory of their fatherland nor surrender themselves like slaves to the Syracusans.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After Nicias had spoken to
     this effect, he returned to his station, and the men of the fleet advanced singing the paean
     and broke through the barrier of boats before the enemy could prevent them. But the Syracusans,
     putting quickly out to sea, formed their triremes in battle order and coming to grips with the
     enemy forced them to withdraw from the barrier of boats and fight a pitched battle. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And as the ships backed water, some toward the beach, others toward the
     middle of the harbour, and still others in the direction of the walls, all the triremes were
     quickly separated from each other, and after they had got clear of the boom across its entrance
     the harbour was full of ships fighting in small groups. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />Thereupon both sides fought with abandon for the victory. The Athenians, cheered by the
     multitude of their ships and seeing no other hope of safety, carried on the fight boldly and
     faced gallantly their death in battle, and the Syracusans, with their parents and children as
     spectators of the struggle, vied with one another, each man wishing the victory to come to his
     country through his own efforts. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="16">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Consequently many leaped on the prows of the hostile
     ships, when their own had been damaged by another, and were isolated in the midst of their
     enemies. In some cases they dropped grappling-irons<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><bibl n="P">Thuc. 7.65</bibl> states that these were a device of the Athenians, against which the Syracusans covered the decks of their ships with hides so that the grappling-irons would not
      take hold.</note> and forced their adversaries to fight a land-battle on their ships.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Often men whose own ships had been shattered leaped on their
     opponents' vessels, and by slaying the defenders or pushing them into the sea became masters of
     their triremes. In a word, over the entire harbour came the crash of ship striking ship and the
     cry of desperately struggling men slaying and being slain. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For
     when a ship had been intercepted by several triremes and struck by their beaks from every
     direction, the water would pour in and it would be swallowed together with the entire crew
     beneath the sea. Some who would be swimming away after their ship had been sunk would be
     wounded by arrows or slain by the blows of spears. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The pilots,
     as they saw the confusion of the battle, every spot full of uproar, and often a number of ships
     converging upon a single one, did not know what signal to give, since the same orders were not
     suitable to all situations, nor was it possible, because of the multitude of missiles, for the
     oarsmen to keep their eyes upon the men who gave them their orders. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In short, not a man could hear any of the commands amid the shattering of boats and the
     sweeping off of oars,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">As one ship brushed by another.</note> as well as amid the uproar of the men in combat on the ships and of their
     zealous comrades on land. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For of the entire beach a part was
     held by the Athenian infantry and a part by the Syracusans, so that at times the men fighting
     the sea-battle had as helpers, when along the shore, the soldiers lined up on the land.
      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The spectators on the walls, whenever they saw their own
     fighters winning, would sing songs of victory, but when they saw them being vanquished, they
     would groan and with tears offer prayers to the gods. For now and then it happened that some
     Syracusan triremes would be destroyed along the walls and their crews slain before the eyes of
     their kinsmen, and parents would witness the destruction of their children, sisters and wives
     the pitiable end of husbands and brothers. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="17">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For a long time, despite the many who
     were dying, the battle would not come to an end, since not even the men who were in desperate
     straits would dare flee to the land. For the Athenians would ask those who were breaking off
     the battle and turning to the land, "Do you think to sail to <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName> by land?" and the Syracusan infantry would inquire of any who were
     bringing their ships towards them, "Why, when we wanted to go aboard the triremes, did you
     prevent us from engaging in the battle, if now you are betraying the fatherland?" "Was the
     reason you blocked the mouth of the harbour that, after preventing the enemy from getting out,
     you might yourselves flee to the beach?" "Since it is the lot of all men to die, what fairer
     death do you seek than dying for the fatherland, which you are disgracefully abandoning though
     you have it as a witness of your fighting!" <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When the soldiers
     on the land hurled such upbraidings at the sailors who drew near, those who were fleeing for
     refuge to the beach would turn back again, even though their ships were shattered and they
     themselves were weighed down by their wounds. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But when the
     Athenians who were engaged near the city had been thrust back and began to flee, the Athenians
     next in line gave way from time to time and gradually the whole host took to flight. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Thereupon the Syracusans with great shouting pursued the ships to the
     land; and those Athenians who had not been slain out at sea, now that they had come to shallow
     water, leaped from the ships and fled to the land troops. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And
     the harbour was full of arms and wreckage of boats, since of the Attic ships sixty were lost
     and of the Syracusan eight were completely destroyed and sixteen badly damaged. The Syracusans
     drew up on the shore as many of their triremes as they could, and taking up the bodies of their
     citizens and allies who had died, honoured them with a public funeral. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="18">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The
     Athenians thronged to the tents of their commanders and begged the generals to take thought,
     not for the ships, but for the safety of themselves. Demosthenes, accordingly, declared that,
     since the barrier of boats had been broken, they should straight-way man the triremes, and he
     expressed the belief that, if they delivered an unexpected attack, they would easily succeed in
     their design.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><bibl n="Thuc. 7.72">Thuc. 7.72</bibl> states that Nicias agreed to this plan, but gave it up when the sailors, after their hard
      beating, refused to man the ships.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But Nicias advised that they leave the ships behind and
     withdraw through the interior to the cities which were their allies. This plan was agreed to by
     all, and they burned some of the ships and made preparations for the retreat. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When it was evident that the Athenians
     were going to withdraw during the night, Hermocrates advised the Syracusans to lead forth their
     entire army in the night and seize all the roads beforehand. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />And when the generals would not agree to this, both because many of the soldiers were wounded
     and because all of them were worn-out in body from the fighting, he sent some of the horsemen
     to the camp of the Athenians to tell them that the Syracusans had already dispatched men to
     seize in advance the roads and the most important positions. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />It was already night when the horsemen carried out these orders, and the Athenians, believing
     that it was men from Leontini who out of goodwill had brought them the word, were not a little
     disturbed and postponed the departure. If they had not been deceived by this trick, they would
     have got safely away. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Syracusans at daybreak dispatched
     the soldiers who were to seize in advance the narrow passes in the roads. And the Athenian
     generals, dividing the soldiers into two bodies, put the pack-animals and the sick and injured
     in the centre and stationed those who were in condition to fight in the van and the rear, and
     then set out for <placeName key="tgn,7003947">Catane</placeName>, Demosthenes commanding one
     group and Nicias the other. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="19">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Syracusans took in tow the fifty ships left behind<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">By the Athenians.</note> and brought them to the city, and
     then, taking off all the crews of their triremes and providing them with arms, they followed
     after the Athenians with their entire armament, harassing them and hindering their forward
     progress. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For three days following close on their heels and
     encompassing them on all sides they prevented them from taking a direct road toward <placeName key="tgn,7003947">Catane</placeName>, their ally; instead they compelled them to retrace their
     steps through the plain of Elorium, and surrounding them at the Asinarus River, slew eighteen
     thousand and took captive seven thousand, among whom were also the generals Demosthenes and
     Nicias. The remainder were seized as their plunder by the soldiers<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The seven thousand were formally surrendered and became prisoners of the state; the others were taken by the soldiers as their individual captives, either before the
      formal surrender or after, as they were picked up over the countryside.</note> ; <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>for the Athenians, since their escape was blocked in every direction,
     were obliged to surrender their weapons and their persons to the enemy. After this had taken
     place, the Syracusans set up two trophies, nailing to each of them the arms of a general, and
     turned back to the city. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now at
     that time the whole city of <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> offered
     sacrifices to the gods, and on the next day, after the Assembly had gathered, they considered
     what disposition they should make of the captives. A man named Diocles, who was a most notable
     leader of the populace, declared his opinion that the Athenian generals should be put to death
     under torture and the other prisoners should for the present all be thrown into the quarries;
     but that later the allies of the Athenians should be sold as booty and the Athenians should
     labour as prisoners under guard, receiving two cotyls<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">An almost starvation fare of about one pint.</note> of barley meal. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When this motion had been read, Hermocrates took the floor and endeavoured to show that

     allow him to continue, a man named Nicolaus, who had lost two sons in the war, made his way,
     supported by his slaves because of his age, to the platform. When the people saw him, they
     stopped shouting, believing that he would denounce the prisoners. As soon, then, as there was

     of saving their lives; and should the men who have shown this trust receive so severe a

     we enjoyed a deserved success, if it so be that, although they sought to wrong men who had
     treated with kindness even their foes, we, on the contrary, defeated men who ventured
     treacherously to attack a people which shows mercy even to its bitterest enemies. And so the

     by this practice it will come about that one's allies increase in number and one's enemies
     decrease. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But for us to maintain the quarrel forever and to
     pass it on to children's children is neither kindly nor safe; since it sometimes happens that
     those who appear to be more powerful turn out to be weaker by the decision of a moment than
     their former subjects. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And a witness to this is the war which
     has just now ceased: The men who came here to lay siege to the city and, by means of their
     superior power, threw a wall about it have by a change in fortune become captives, as you can
     see. It is a fine thing, therefore, by showing ourselves lenient amid the misfortunes of other

     we shall be setting up, for all time to come, a harsh law against ourselves. For it is
     impossible that men who have shown no compassion for others should themselves ever receive
     humane treatment at the hands of another and that men who have outraged others should be
     treated indulgently, or that we, after murdering so many men contrary to the traditions of the

     conquerors. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And the spirits of civilized men are gripped, I
     believe, most perhaps by mercy, because of the sympathy which nature has planted in all. The

     been overcome. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And whoever goes farther and wreaks vengeance
     upon the vanquished who flees for refuge to the leniency of his conqueror is no longer

     wise men of old: 'O man, be not high-spirited'; 'Know thyself'; 'Observe how Fortune is lord of

     celebrating victories in war should be made, not of stone, but of any wood at hand? <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Was it not in order that the memorials of the enmity, lasting as they
     would for a brief time, should quickly disappear? Speaking generally, if you wish to establish

     Alcibiades who advised this expedition. We shall find, however, that in most cases their
     advisers pay every attention to the wishes of their audience, so that the voter suggests to the
     speaker words that suit his own purpose. For the speaker is not the master of the multitude,
     but the people, by adopting measures that are honest, train the orator to propose what is best.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>If we shall pardon men guilty of irrevocable injustices when
     they lay the responsibility upon their advisers, we shall indeed be providing the wicked with
     an easy defence! It is clear that nothing in the world could be more unjust than that, while in
     the case of benefactions it is not the advisers but the people who receive the thanks of the
     recipients, in the matter of injustices the punishment is passed on to the speakers. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>"Yet some have lost their reasoning
     powers to such a degree as to assert that it is Alcibiades, over whom we have no power, who
     should be punished, but that we should release the prisoners, who are being led to their
     deserved punishment, and thus make it known to the world that the people of the Syracusans have
     no righteous indignation against base men. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But if the
     advocates of the war have in truth been the cause of it, let the people blame the speakers for
     the consequences of their deception, but you will with justice punish the people for the wrongs
     which you have suffered. And, speaking generally, if they committed the wrongs with full
     knowledge that they were so doing, because of their very intention they deserve punishment, but
     if they entered the war without a considered plan, even so they should not be let off, in order
     that they may not grow accustomed to act offhand in matters which affect the lives of other
     men. For it is not just that the ignorance of the Athenians should bring destruction to
     Syracusans or that in a case where the crime is irremediable, the criminals should retain a

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the Athenians learned of the total destruction of their forces in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, they were deeply distressed at the magnitude of the
     disaster. Yet they would not at all on that account abate their ardent aspiration for the
     supremacy, but set about both constructing more ships and providing themselves with funds
     wherewith they might contend to the last hope for the primacy. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Choosing four hundred men they put in their hands the supreme authority to direct the conduct
     of the war; for they assumed that an oligarchy was more suitable than a democracy in critical
     circumstances like these. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The events, however, did not turn
     out according to the judgement of those who held that opinion, but the Four Hundred conducted
     the war far less competently. For, although they dispatched forty ships, they sent along to
     command them two generals who were at odds with each other. Although, with the affairs of the
     Athenians at such low ebb, the emergency called for complete concord, the generals kept
     quarrelling with each other. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And finally they sailed to Oropus
     without preparation and met the Peloponnesians in a sea-battle; but since they made a wretched
     beginning of the battle and stood up to the fighting like churls, they lost twenty-two ships
     and barely got the rest safe over to <placeName key="perseus,Eretria">Eretria</placeName>.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After these events had taken

     revolted to the Lacedaemonians. And since Darius, the king of the Persians, was an ally of the
     Lacedaemonians, Pharnabazus, who had the military command of the regions bordering on the sea,
     supplied money to the Lacedaemonians; and he also summoned the three hundred triremes supplied

<div2 type="chapter" n="37">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Inasmuch as the Athenians had experienced setbacks so serious
     at one and the same time, everyone had assumed that the war was at an end; for no one expected
     that the Athenians could possibly endure such reverses any longer, even for a moment. However,
     events did not come to an end that tallied with the assumption of the majority, but on the
     contrary it came to pass, such was the superiority of the combatants, that the whole situation
     changed for the following reasons. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Alcibiades, who was in exile from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
     had for a time fought on the side of the Lacedaemonians and had rendered them great assistance
     in the war; for he was a most able orator and far the outstanding citizen in daring, and,
     besides, he was in high birth and wealth first among the Athenians. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now since Alcibiades was eager to be allowed to return to his native city, he contrived
     every device whereby he could do the Athenians some good turn, and in particular at the crucial
     moments when the Athenians seemed doomed to utter defeat. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />Accordingly, since he was on friendly terms with Pharnabazus, the satrap of Darius, and saw
     that he was on the point of sending three hundred ships to the support of the
      Lacedaemonians,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chap. 36.5.</note> he persuaded him
     to give up the undertaking; for he showed him that it would not be to the advantage of the King
     to make the Lacedaemonians too powerful. That would not, he said, help the Persians, and so a
     better policy would be to maintain a neutral attitude toward the combatants so long as they
     were equally matched, in order that they might continue their quarrel as long as possible.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Thereupon Pharnabazus, believing that Alcibiades was giving
     him good advice, sent the fleet back to <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>. Now
     on that occasion Alcibiades deprived the Lacedaemonians of so great an allied force; and some
     time later, when he had been allowed to return to <placeName key="perseus,Athens" >Athens</placeName> and been given command of a military force, he defeated the Lacedaemonians
     in many battles and completely restored again the sunken fortunes of the Athenians. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But we shall discuss these matters in more detail in connection with the

     after equipping both the ships brought from the <placeName key="tgn,7017076" >Peloponnesus</placeName> and those supplied by his allies from abroad, he dispatched Dorieus

     eighty-three, and set out for the <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, since he

      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When they arrived at Sigeium, they found the fleet already
     departed, but three ships left behind they at once captured; after this they put in at
      Eleus<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Directly opposite Sigeium.</note> and made
     preparations for the sea-battle. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Lacedaemonians, seeing
     the enemy rehearsing for the battle, did likewise, spending five days in proving their ships
     and exercising their rowers; then they drew up the fleet for the battle, its strength being
     eighty-eight ships. Now the Lacedaemonians stationed their ships on the Asian side of the
     channel, while the Athenians lined up against them on the European side, being fewer in number
     but of superior training. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Lacedaemonians put on their
     right wing the Syracusans, whose leader was Hermocrates, and the Peloponnesians themselves
     formed the whole left wing with Mindarus in command. For the Athenians Thrasyllus was stationed
     on the right wing and Thrasybulus on the left. At the outset both sides strove stubbornly for
     position in order that they might not have the current against them. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently they kept sailing around each other for a long time, endeavouring to block

     Peloponnesians, with their ships in a body, would charge swiftly forward to ram, the pilots
     would manoeuvre their own ships so skilfully that their opponents were unable to strike them at
     any other spot but could only meet them bows on, ram against ram. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Consequently Mindarus, seeing that the force of the rams was proving ineffective, gave
     orders for his ships to come to grips in small groups, or one at a time. But not by this
     manoeuvre either, as it turned out, was the skill of the Athenian pilots rendered ineffective;
     on the contrary, cleverly avoiding the on-coming rams of the ships, they struck them on the
     side and damaged many. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And such a spirit of rivalry pervaded
     both forces that they would not confine the struggle to ramming tactics, but tangling ship with
     ship fought it out with the marines. Although they were hindered by the strength of the current
     from achieving great success, they continued the struggle for a considerable time, neither side
     being able to gain the victory. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>While the fighting was thus
     equally balanced, there appeared beyond a cape twenty-five ships which had been dispatched to
     the Athenians from their allies. The Peloponnesians thereupon in alarm turned in flight toward
      <placeName key="tgn,6000031">Abydus</placeName>, the Athenians clinging to them and pursuing
     them the more vigorously. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such
     was the end of the battle; and the Athenians captured eight ships of the Chians, five of the
     Corinthians, two of the Ambraciotes, and one each of the Syracusans, Pellenians, and
     Leucadians, while they themselves lost five ships, all of them, as it happened, having been
     sunk. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>After this Thrasybulus set up a trophy on the cape where
     stands the memorial of Hecabe<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Also called "Hecabe's

     they should thereby run the risk of utterly destroying their country. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But when the Selinuntians proposed, quite apart from the territory in dispute, to carve
     off for themselves a large portion of the neighbouring territory, the inhabitants of Aegesta
     thereupon dispatched ambassadors to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>,
     asking for aid and putting their city in the hands of the Carthaginians. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When the envoys arrived and laid before the Senate the instructions the

     were eager to acquire a city so strategically situated, at the same time they stood in fear of
     the Syracusans, having just witnessed their defeat of the armaments of the Athenians.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But when Hannibal, their foremost citizen, also advised them
     to acquire the city, they replied to the ambassadors that they would come to their aid, and to

     the same time desired to wipe out the disgraces which had befallen his ancestors, was eager by
     his own efforts to achieve some advantage for his country. Hence, seeing that the Selinuntians
     were not satisfied with the cession of the territory in dispute, he dispatched ambassadors
     together with the Aegestaeans to the Syracusans, referring to them the decision of the dispute;
     and though ostensibly he pretended to be seeking that justice be done, in fact he believed
     that, after the Selinuntians refused to agree to arbitration, the Syracusans would not join
     them as allies. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Since the Selinuntians also dispatched
     ambassadors, refusing the arbitration and answering at length the ambassadors of the

      <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>After the forces had made ready in this fashion, their
     commanders raised the signal for battle and the trumpeters at a single word of command began to
     sound the attack; and since the rowers showed no lack of eagerness and the pilots managed their
     helms with skill, the contest which ensued was an amazing spectacle. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>For whenever the triremes would drive forward to ram, at that moment the pilots, at

     carry on the contest with their swords. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And since at each

     Alcibiades ran up a purple flag from his own ship, which was the signal they had agreed upon,
     the Lacedaemonians in dismay turned in flight and the Athenians, elated by the advantage they
     now possessed, pressed eagerly upon the ships trying to escape. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />And they speedily captured ten ships, but then a storm and violent winds arose, as a result
     of which they were greatly hindered in the pursuit; for because of the high waves the boats
     would not respond to the tillers, and the attempts at ramming proved fruitless, since the ships
     were receding when struck. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In the end the Lacedaemonians,

     citizens before the present civil strife was some fifteen hundred, and all of these were
     leading citizens. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And although these misfortunes had already
     befallen them, Fortune brought upon them a second disaster, in that she increased once more the
     disaffection which prevailed among them. For the foremost Corcyraeans, who desired the
     oligarchy, favoured the cause of the Lacedaemonians, whereas the masses which favoured the
     democracy were eager to ally themselves with the Athenians. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />For the peoples who were struggling for leadership in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" >Greece</placeName> were devoted to opposing principles; the Lacedaemonians, for example, made
     it their policy to put the control of the government in the hands of the leading citizens of
     their allied states, whereas the Athenians regularly established democracies in their cities.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Accordingly the Corcyraeans, seeing that their most
     influential citizens were planning to hand the city over to the Lacedaemonians, sent to the
     Athenians for an army to protect their city. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>, the general of the Athenians, sailed to <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Corcyra</placeName> and left in the city six hundred men from the Messenians

     exiles. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Now the men who had been exiled from their country
     fled to the opposite mainland; but a few days later some people still in the city who favoured
     the cause of the exiles seized the market-place, called back the exiles, and essayed a final
     decision of the struggle. When night brought an end to the fighting they came to an agreement

<div2 type="chapter" n="50">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for the generals
     themselves, they divided the naval force into three squadrons, Alcibiades commanding one,
     Theramenes another, and Thrasybulus the third. Now Alcibiades with his own squadron advanced
     far ahead of the others, wishing to draw the Lacedaemonians out to a battle, whereas Theramenes
     and Thrasybulus planned the manoeuvre of encircling the enemy and, if they sailed out, of
     blocking their retreat to the city. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Mindarus, seeing only the
     ships of Alcibiades approaching, twenty in number, and having no knowledge of the others, held
     them in contempt and boldly set sail from the city with eighty ships to attack him. Then, when
     he had come near the ships of Alcibiades, the Athenians, as they had been commanded, pretended
     to flee, and the Peloponnesians, in high spirits, pursued after them vigorously in the belief
     they were winning the victory. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But after Alcibiades had drawn
     them a considerable distance from the city, he raised the signal; and when this was given, the
     ships of Alcibiades suddenly at the same time turned about to face the enemy, and Theramenes
     and Thrasybulus sailed toward the city and cut off the retreat of the Lacedaemonians.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The troops of Mindarus, when they now observed the multitude
     of the enemy ships and realized that they had been outgeneralled, were filled with great fear.
     And finally, since the Athenians were appearing from every direction and had shut off the
     Peloponnesians from their line of approach to the city, Mindarus was forced to seek safety on
     land near Cleri, as it is called, where also Pharnabazus had his army. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Alcibiades, pursuing him vigorously, sank some ships, damaged and
     captured others, and the largest number, which were moored on the land itself, he seized and
     threw grappling-irons on, endeavouring by this means to drag them from the land. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And when the infantry of Pharnabazus rushed to the aid of the
     Lacedaemonians, there was great bloodshed, inasmuch as the Athenians because of the advantage
     they had won were fighting with greater boldness than expediency, while the Peloponnesians were
     in number far superior; for the army of Pharnabazus was supporting the Lacedaemonians and
     fighting as it was from the land the position it had was more secure. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>But when Thrasybulus saw the infantry aiding the enemy, he put the rest of his marines
     on the land with intent to assist Alcibiades and his men, and he also urged Theramenes to join
     up with the land troops of Chaereas and come with all speed, in order to wage a battle on land.

<div2 type="chapter" n="51">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While the Athenians were busying themselves with these matters, Mindarus, the
     Lacedaemonian commander, was himself fighting with Alcibiades for the ships that were being
     dragged off, and he dispatched Clearchus the Spartan with a part of the Peloponnesians against
     the troops with Thrasybulus; and with him he also sent the mercenaries in the army of
     Pharnabazus. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Thrasybulus with the marines and archers at first
     stoutly withstood the enemy, and though he slew many of them, he also saw not a few of his own
     men falling; but when the mercenaries of Pharnabazus were surrounding the Athenians and were
     crowding about them in great numbers from every direction, Theramenes appeared, leading both
     his own troops and the infantry with Chaereas. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Although the
     troops of Thrasybulus were exhausted and had given up hope of rescue, their spirits were
     suddenly revived again when reinforcements so strong were at hand. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>An obstinate battle which lasted a long time ensued; but at first the mercenaries of
     Pharnabazus began to withdraw and the continuity of their battle line was broken; and finally
     the Peloponnesians who had been left behind with Clearchus, after having both inflicted and
     suffered much punishment, were expelled. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now that the Peloponnesians had been defeated, the troops of Theramenes
     rushed to give aid to the soldiers who had been fighting under Alcibiades. Although the forces
     had rapidly assembled at one point, Mindarus was not dismayed at the attack of Theramenes, but,
     after dividing the Peloponnesians, with half of them he met the advancing enemy, while with the
     other half which he himself commanded, first calling upon each soldier not to disgrace the fair
     name of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, and that too in a fight on land, he
     formed a line against the troops of Alcibiades. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>He put up a
     heroic battle about the ships, fighting in person before all his troops, but though he slew
     many of the opponents, in the end he was killed by the troops of Alcibiades as he battled nobly
     for his fatherland. When he had fallen, both the Peloponnesians and all the allies banded
     together and broke into terror-stricken flight. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Athenians
     pursued the enemy for a distance, but when they learned that Pharnabazus was hurrying up at
     full speed with a strong force of cavalry, they returned to the ships, and after they had taken
     the city<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><placeName key="perseus,Cyzicus" >Cyzicus</placeName>.</note> they set up two trophies for the two victories, one for the
     sea-battle at the island of Polydorus, as it is called, and one for the land-battle where they
     forced the first flight of the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Now the Peloponnesians
     in the city and all the fugitives from the battle fled to the camp of Pharnabazus; and the
     Athenian generals not only captured all the ships but they also took many prisoners and an
     immeasurable quantity of booty, since they had won the victory at the same time over two
     armaments of such size.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The despair of the Lacedaemonians

     while you have on board crews most of whom are citizens. And, what is the most important, even
     if we meet defeat in our actions at sea, we still maintain without dispute the mastery on
     land&mdash;for a Spartan foot-soldier does not even know what flight means&mdash;but
     you, if you are driven from the sea, contend, not for the supremacy on land, but for
      survival.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>' <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>'It remains for me
     to show you why, despite so many and great advantages we possess in the fighting, we urge you
     to make peace. I do not affirm that <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> is
     profiting from the war, but only that she is suffering less than the Athenians. Only fools find
     satisfaction in sharing the misfortunes of their enemies, when it is in their power to make no
     trial whatsoever of misfortune. For the destruction of the enemy brings no joy that can balance
     the grief caused by the distress of one's own people. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And not
     for these reasons alone are we eager to come to terms, but because we hold fast to the custom
     of our fathers; for when we consider the many terrible sufferings which are caused by the
     rivalries which accompany war, we believe we should make it clear in the sight of all gods and
     men that we are least responsible of all men for such things." </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="53">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the Laconian had made
     these and similar representations, the sentiments of the most reasonable men among the
     Athenians inclined toward the peace, but those who made it their practice to foment war and to
     turn disturbances in the state to their personal profit chose the war. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>A supporter of this sentiment was, among others, Cleophon, who was the
     most influential leader of the populace at this time. He, taking the floor and arguing at
     length on the question in his own fashion, buoyed up the people, citing the magnitude of their
     military successes, as if indeed it is not the practice of Fortune to adjudge the advantages in
     war now to one side and now to the other. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Consequently the
     Athenians, after taking unwise counsel, repented of it when it could do them no good, and,
     deceived as they were by words spoken in flattery, they made a blunder so vital that never
     again at any time were they able truly to recover. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But these
     events, which took place at a later date, will be described in connection with the period of
     time to which they belong; at the time we are discussing the Athenians, being elated by their
     successes and entertaining many great hopes because they had Alcibiades as the leader of their

      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And after adding to his army the soldiers supplied by the

     the assaults with all speed. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>He set up six towers of

     Selinuntians. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>For in the long period of peace they had enjoyed
     they had given no attention whatever even to their walls and so they were easily subdued, since

     waited for the Syracusans, since they wished to lead their troops as one body against the
     Carthaginians; and the Syracusans, on learning the facts about the siege, first stopped the war
     they were engaged in with the Chalcidians and then spent some time in gathering the troops from
     the countryside and making great preparations, thinking that the city might be forced by siege
     to surrender but would not be taken by storm. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hannibal, when the night had passed, at daybreak launched assaults from
     every side, and the part of the city's wall which had already fallen and the portion of the
     wall next the breach he broke down with the siege-engines. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He
     then cleared the area of the fallen part of the wall and, attacking in relays of his best
     troops, gradually forced out the Selinuntians; it was not possible, however, to overpower by
     force men who were fighting for their very existence. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Both
     sides suffered heavy losses, but for the Carthaginians fresh troops kept taking over the
     fighting, while for the Selinuntians there was no reserve to come to their support. The siege
     continued for nine days with unsurpassed stubbornness, and in the event the Carthaginians
     suffered and inflicted many terrible injuries. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When the
     Iberians mounted where the wall had fallen, the women who were on the house-tops raised a great
     cry, whereupon the Selinuntians, thinking that the city was being taken, were struck with
     terror, and leaving the walls they gathered in bands at the entrances of the narrow alleys,
     endeavoured to barricade the streets, and held off the enemy for a long time. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And as the Carthaginians pressed the attack, the multitudes of women and
     children took refuge on the housetops whence they threw both stones and tiles on the enemy. For
     a long time the Carthaginians came off badly, being unable either, because of the walls of the
     houses, to surround the men in the alleys or, because of those hurling at them from the roofs,
     to fight it out on equal terms. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>However, as the struggle went
     on until the afternoon, the missiles of the fighters from the houses were exhausted, whereas
     the troops of the Carthaginians, which constantly relieved those which were suffering heavily,
     continued the fighting in fresh condition. Finally, since the troops within the walls were
     being steadily reduced in number and the enemy entered the city in ever increasing strength,
     the Selinuntians were forced out of the alleys. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="57">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And so, while the city was being taken,
     there was to be observed among the Greeks lamentation and weeping, and among the barbarians
     there was cheering and commingled outcries; for the former, as their eyes looked upon the great
     disaster which surrounded them, were filled with terror, while the latter, elated by their
     successes, urged on their comrades to slaughter. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The
     Selinuntians gathered into the market-place and all who reached it died fighting there; and the
     barbarians, scattering throughout the entire city, plundered whatever of value was to be found
     in the dwellings, while of the inhabitants they found in them some they burned together with
     their homes and when others struggled into the streets, without distinction of sex or age but
     whether infant children or women or old men, they put them to the sword, showing no sign of
     compassion. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They mutilated even the dead according to the
     practice of their people, some carrying bunches of hands about their bodies and others heads
     which they had spitted upon their javelins and spears.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 5.29 for the custom of the Gauls of preserving the heads of warriors they had

     the temples they called upon their comrades not to kill, and to these alone did they give
     assurance of their lives. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>This they did, however, not out of
     pity for the unfortunate people, but because they feared lest the women, despairing of their
     lives, would burn down the temples, and thus they would not be able to make booty of the great
     wealth which was stored up in them as dedications. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>To such a
     degree did the barbarians surpass all other men in cruelty, that whereas the rest of mankind
     spare those who seek refuge in the sanctuaries from the desire not to commit sacrilege against
     the deity, the Carthaginians, on the contrary, would refrain from laying hands on the enemy in
     order that they might plunder the temples of their gods. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>By
     nightfall the city had been sacked, and of the dwellings some had been burned and others razed
     to the ground, while the whole area was filled with blood and corpses. Sixteen thousand was the
     sum of the inhabitants who were found to have fallen, not counting the more than five thousand
     who had been taken captive. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="58">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Greeks serving as allies of the Carthaginians, as they
     contemplated the reversal in the lives of the hapless Selinuntians, felt pity at their lot. The
     women, deprived now of the pampered life they had enjoyed, spent the nights in the very midst
     of the enemies' lasciviousness, enduring terrible indignities, and some were obliged to see
     their daughters of marriageable age suffering treatment improper for their years. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For the savagery of the barbarians spared neither free-born youths nor
     maidens, but exposed these unfortunates to dreadful disasters. Consequently, as the women
     reflected upon the slavery that would be their lot in <placeName key="tgn,1000172" >Libya</placeName>, as they saw themselves together with their children in a condition in which
     they possessed no legal rights and were subject to insolent treatment and thus compelled to
     obey masters, and as they noted that these masters used an unintelligible speech and had a
     bestial character, they mourned for their living children as dead, and receiving into their
     souls as a piercing wound each and every outrage committed against them, they became frantic
     with suffering and vehemently deplored their own fate; while as for their fathers and brothers
     who had died fighting for their country, them they counted blessed, since they had not
     witnessed any sight unworthy of their own valour. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The
     Selinuntians who had escaped capture, twenty-six hundred in number, made their way in safety to
      <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName> and there received all possible kindness; for
     the Acragantini, after portioning out food to them at public expense, divided them for
     billeting among their homes, urging the private citizens, who were indeed eager enough, to
     supply them with every necessity of life. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="59">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While these events were taking place
     there arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName> three thousand picked
     soldiers from the Syracusans, who had been dispatched in advance with all speed to bring aid.
     On learning of the fall of <placeName key="perseus,Selinus">Selinus</placeName>, they sent
     ambassadors to Hannibal urging him both to release the captives on payment of ransom and to
     spare the temples of the gods. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Hannibal replied that the
     Selinuntians, having proved incapable of defending their freedom, would now undergo the
     experience of slavery, and that the gods had departed from <placeName key="perseus,Selinus" >Selinus</placeName>, having become offended with its inhabitants. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>However, since the fugitives had sent Empedion as an ambassador, to him Hannibal
     restored his possessions; for Empedion had always favoured the cause of the Carthaginians and
     before the siege had counselled the citizens not to go to war against the Carthaginians.
     Hannibal also graciously delivered up to him his kinsmen who were among the captives and to the
     Selinuntians who had escaped he gave permission to dwell in the city and to cultivate its
     fields upon payment of tribute to the Carthaginians. <milestone unit="section" n="4" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now this city was taken after it had been inhabited from its
     founding for a period of two hundred and forty-two years. And Hannibal, after destroying the
     walls of <placeName key="perseus,Selinus">Selinus</placeName>, departed with his whole army to
     Himera, being especially bent upon razing this city to the ground. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For it was this city which had caused his father to be exiled and before its walls his
     grandfather Hamilcar had been out-generalled by Gelon and then met his end,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 11.21 f.</note> and with him one hundred and fifty thousand soldiers
     had perished and no fewer than these had been taken captive. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />These were the reasons why Hannibal was eager to exact punishment, and with forty thousand
     men he pitched camp upon some hills not far from the city, while with the rest of his entire
     army he invested the city, twenty thousand additional soldiers from both Siceli and Sicani
     having joined him. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Setting up his siege-engines he shook the
     walls at a number of points, and since he pressed the battle with waves of troops in great
     strength, he wore down the defenders, especially since his soldiers were elated by their
     successes. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>He also set about undermining the walls, which he
     then shored up with wooden supports, and when these were set on fire, a large section of the
     wall soon fell. Thereupon there ensued a most bitter battle, one side struggling to force its
     way inside the wall and the other fearing lest they should suffer the same fate as the
     Selinuntians. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Consequently, since the defenders put up a
     struggle to the death on behalf of children and parents and the fatherland which all men fight
     to defend, the barbarians were thrust out and the section of the wall quickly restored. To
     their aid came also the Syracusans from <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName> and
     troops from their other allies, some four thousand in all, who were under the command of
     Diocles the Syracusan. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="60">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At that juncture, when night brought an end to all further
     striving for victory, the Carthaginians abandoned the attack. And when day came, the Himeraeans
     decided not to allow themselves to be shut in and surrounded in this ignominious manner, as
     were the Selinuntians, and so they stationed guards on the walls and led out of the city the
     rest of their soldiers together with the allies who had arrived, some ten thousand men.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And by engaging the enemy thus unexpectedly, they threw the
     barbarians into consternation, thinking as they did that allied forces had arrived to aid those
     who were penned in by the siege. And because the Himeraeans were far superior in deeds of
     daring and of skill, and especially because their single hope of safety lay in their prevailing
     in the battle, at the outset they slew the first opponents. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />And since the multitude of the barbarians thronged together in great disorder because they
     never would have expected that the besieged would dare such a move, they were under no little
     disadvantage; for when eighty thousand men streamed together without order into one place, the
     result was that the barbarians clashed with each other and suffered more heavily from
     themselves than from the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Himeraeans, having as
     spectators on the walls parents and children as well as all their relatives, spent their own
     lives unsparingly for the salvation of them all. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And since
     they fought brilliantly, the barbarians, dismayed by their deeds of daring and unexpected
     resistance, turned in flight. They fled in disorder to the troops encamped on the hills, and
     the Himeraeans pressed hard upon them, crying out to each other to take no man captive, and
     they slew more than six thousand of them, according to Timaeus, or, as Ephorus states, more
     than twenty thousand. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But Hannibal, seeing that his men were
     becoming exhausted, brought down his troops who were encamped on the hills, and reinforcing his
     beaten soldiers caught the Himeraeans in disorder as they were pushing the pursuit. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>In the fierce battle which ensued the main body of the Himeraeans turned
     in flight, but three thousand of them who tried to oppose the Carthaginian army, though they
     accomplished great deeds, were slain to a man. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="61">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This battle had already come to an end
     when there arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Himera">Himera</placeName> from the Sicilian

     returned from the campaign. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And a report also spread through
     the city that the Syracusans <emph>en masse</emph> together with their allies were on the march
     to the aid of the Himeraeans and that Hannibal was preparing to man his triremes in Motye with
     his choicest troops and, sailing to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>,
     seize that city while it was stripped of its defenders. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />Consequently Diocles, who commanded the forces in <placeName key="perseus,Himera" >Himera</placeName>, advised the admirals of the fleet to set sail with all speed for
      <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, in order that it might not happen that
     the city should be taken by storm while its best troops were fighting a war abroad. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They decided, therefore, that their best course was to abandon the city,
     and that they should embark half the populace on the triremes (for these would convey them
     until they had got beyond Himeraean territory) and with the other half keep guard until the
     triremes should return. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Although the Himeraeans complained
     indignantly at this conclusion, since there was no other course they could take, the triremes
     were hastily loaded by night with a mixed throng of women and children and of other inhabitants
     also, who sailed on them as far as <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>;
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>and Diocles, taking his own soldiers and leaving behind the
     bodies of those who had fallen in the fighting, set forth upon the journey home.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">To <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse" >Syracuse</placeName>.</note> And many Himeraeans with children and wives set out with Diocles,

<div2 type="chapter" n="62">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Those who had been left
     behind in <placeName key="perseus,Himera">Himera</placeName> spent the night under arms on the
     walls; and when with the coming of day the Carthaginians surrounded the city and launched
     repeated attacks, the remaining Himeraeans fought with no thought for their lives, expecting
     the arrival of the ships. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For that day, therefore, they
     continued to hold out, but on the next, even when the triremes were already in sight, it so
     happened that the wall began to fall before the blows of the siege-engines and the Iberians to
     pour in a body into the city. Some of the barbarians thereupon would hold off the Himeraeans
     who rushed up to bring aid, while others, gaining command of the walls, would help their
     comrades get in. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now that the city had been taken by storm,
     for a long time the barbarians continued, with no sign of compassion, to slaughter everyone
     they seized. But when Hannibal issued orders to take prisoners, although the slaughter stopped,
     the wealth of the dwellings now became the objects of plunder. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />Hannibal, after sacking the temples and dragging out the suppliants who had fled to them for
     safety, set them afire, and the city he razed to the ground, two hundred and forty years after
     its founding. Of the captives the women and children he distributed among the army and kept
     them under guard, but the men whom he took captive, some three thousand, he led to the spot
     where once his grandfather Hamilcar had been slain by Gelon<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 11.22.</note> and after torturing them put them all to death.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After this, breaking up his army, he sent the Sicilian allies
     back to their countries, and accompanying them also were the Campanians, who bitterly
     complained to the Carthaginians that, though they had been the ones chiefly responsible for the
     Carthaginian successes, the rewards they had received were not a fair return for their
     accomplishments. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Then Hannibal embarked his army on the
     warships and merchant vessels, and leaving behind sufficient troops for the needs of his allies
     he set sail from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>. And when he arrived at
      <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName> with much booty, the whole city came

     celebrated, that in which Eubatus of <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> won the

     near the city, the populace in a body, overjoyed at their successes, came out to meet them, and
     great numbers of the aliens, as well as children and women, flocked to the Peiraeus. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the return of the generals gave great cause for amazement, in that
     they brought no less than two hundred captured vessels, a multitude of captive soldiers, and a
     great store of spoils; and their own triremes they had gone to great care to embellish with
     gilded arms and garlands and, besides, with spoils and all such decorations. But most men
     thronged to the harbours to catch sight of Alcibiades, so that the city was entirely deserted,
     the slaves vying with the free. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For at that time it had come
     to pass that this man was such an object of admiration that the leading Athenians thought that
     they had at long last found a strong man capable of opposing the people openly and boldly,
     while the poor had assumed that they would have in him an excellent supporter who would
     recklessly throw the city into confusion and relieve their destitute condition. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For in boldness he far excelled all other men, he was a most eloquent
     speaker, in generalship he was unsurpassed, and in daring he was most successful; furthermore,
     in appearance he was exceedingly handsome and in spirit brilliant and intent upon great
     enterprises. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In a word, practically all men had conceived such
     assumptions regarding him that they believed that along with his return from exile good fortune
     in their undertakings had also come again to the city. Furthermore, just as the Lacedaemonians
     enjoyed success while he was fighting on their side, so they expected that they in turn would
     again prosper when they had this man as an ally. </p>

     farther and cast into the sea the stelae on which were written his sentence and all the other

     requests without reserve, since, as he stated, he carried orders from his father to supply the
     Lacedaemonians with whatever they should want. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Then Lysander,
     returning to <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName>, called to him the most
     influential men of the cities, and arranging with them to form cabals he promised that if his
     undertakings were successful he would put each group in control of its city. And it came to
     pass for this reason that these men, vying with one another, gave greater aid than was required

     sailed in haste to Clazomenae; for this city, which was an ally of the Athenians, was suffering
     from forays by some of its exiles. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But Antiochus, who was by
     nature an impetuous man and was eager to accomplish some brilliant deed on his own account,
     paid no attention to the orders of Alcibiades, but manning ten of the best ships and ordering
     the captains to keep the others ready in case they should need to accept battle, he sailed up
     to the enemy in order to challenge them to battle. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But
     Lysander, who had learned from certain deserters of the departure of Alcibiades and his best

     flight, he chased them until the Athenian captains manned the rest of their vessels and came to
     the rescue, but in no battle order at all. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In the sea-battle
     which followed between the two entire fleets not far from the land the Athenians, because of
     their disorder, were defeated and lost twenty-two ships, but of their crews only a few were
     taken captive and the rest swam to safety ashore. When Alcibiades learned what had taken place,
     he returned in haste to <placeName key="perseus,Notium">Notium</placeName> and manning all the

     learned what had happened, they issued orders for all the order men and the sturdiest of the

     of the infantry was some five stades from the wall, but the cavalry which had engaged each
     other were fighting at the very walls. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Now the Boeotians, who

     the sake of victory. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Finally, overpowering their opponents

     sent in his care a four-horse team to <placeName key="perseus,Olympia">Olympia</placeName>; and
     Alcibiades, when entering it in the usual way, listed the horses as his own; and when he was

     bones of the dead<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chap. 61.6.</note> and putting them
     upon wagons which he had constructed and embellished at great cost he conveyed them to
      <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now
     Hermocrates himself stopped at the border of Syracusan territory, since the exiles were
     forbidden by the laws from accompanying the bones farther, but he sent on some of his troops
     who brought the wagons to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Hermocrates acted in this way in order that Diocles, who opposed his
     return and was generally believed to be responsible for the lack of concern over the failure to
     bury the dead, should fall out with the masses, whereas he, by his humane consideration for the
     dead, would win the multitude back to the feeling of goodwill in which they had formerly held
     him. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Now when the bones had been brought into the city, civil
     discord arose among the masses, Diocles objecting to their burial and the majority favouring
     it. Finally the Syracusans not only buried the remains of the dead but also by turning out
      <emph>en masse</emph> paid honour to the burial procession. Diocles was exiled; but even so
     they did not receive Hermocrates back, since they were wary of the daring of the man and feared
     lest, once he had gained a position of leadership, he should proclaim himself tyrant.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Accordingly Hermocrates, seeing that the time was not
     opportune for resorting to force, withdrew again to <placeName key="perseus,Selinus" >Selinus</placeName>. But some time later, when his friends sent for him, he set out with three

     under arms, and here, since they appeared accompanied by a great multitude, they slew both
     Hermocrates and most of his supporters. Those who had not been killed in the fighting were
     brought to trial and sentenced to exile; <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>consequently some of

     this time <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>, the Athenian general, now that he had
     taken over the armaments in <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chap. 74.1.</note> fitted out the ships which were in that place and also
     collected those of the allies, since he was intent upon making his fleet a match for the ships
     of the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And the Spartans, when Lysander's period of
     command as admiral had expired, dispatched Callicratidas to succeed him. Callicratidas was a
     very young man, without guile and straight-forward in character, since he had had as yet no
     experience of the ways of foreign peoples, and was the most just man among the Spartans; and it
     is agreed by all that also during his period of command he committed no wrong against either a
     city or a private citizen but dealt summarily with those who tried to corrupt him with money
     and had them punished. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He put in at <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName> and took over the fleet, and since he had already sent
     for the ships of the allies, the sum total he took over, including those of Lysander, was one
     hundred and forty. And since the Athenians held Delphinium in the territory of the Chians, he
     sailed against them with all his ships and undertook to lay siege to it. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Athenians, who numbered some five hundred, were dismayed at the
     great size of his force and abandoned the place, passing through the enemy under a truce.
     Callicratidas took over the fortress and levelled it to the ground, and then, sailing against
     the Teians, he stole inside the walls of the city by night and plundered it. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After this he sailed to <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName>
     and with his force attacked Methymne, which held a garrison of Athenians. Although he launched
     repeated assaults, at first he accomplished nothing, but soon afterward, with the help of
     certain men who betrayed the city to him, he broke inside its walls, and although he plundered
     its wealth, he spared the lives of the inhabitants and returned the city to the Methymnaeans.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>After these exploits he made for <placeName key="tgn,7002672" >Mitylene</placeName>; and assigning the hoplites to Thorax, the Lacedaemonian, he ordered him

<div2 type="chapter" n="77">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" /><placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>, the Athenian general, had seventy ships
     which he had fitted out with everything necessary for making war at sea more carefully than any
     other general had ever done by way of preparation. Now it so happened that he had put out to
     sea with all his ships when he went to the aid of Methymne; <milestone unit="section" n="2" />but on discovering that it had already fallen, at the time he had bivouacked at one of the
     Hundred Isles, as they are called, and at daybreak, when he observed that the enemy's ships
     were bearing down on him, he decided that it would be dangerous for him to join battle in that
     place with triremes double his in number, but he planned to avoid battle by sailing outside the
     Isles and, drawing some of the enemy's triremes after him, to engage them off <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName>. For by such tactics, he assumed, in case of victory he
     could turn about and pursue and in case of defeat he could withdraw for safety to the harbour.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Consequently, having put his soldiers on board ship, he set
     out with the oars at a leisurely stroke in order that the ships of the Peloponnesians might
     draw near him. And the Lacedaemonians, as they approached, kept driving their ships faster and
     faster in the hope of seizing the hindmost ships of the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />As <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName> withdrew, the commanders of the best ships
     of the Peloponnesians pushed the pursuit hotly, and they wore out the rowers by their continued
     exertion at the oars and were themselves separated a long distance from the others. <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>, noticing this, when his ships were already near
      <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName>, raised from his flagship a red banner, for
     this was a signal for the captains of the triremes. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At this
     his ships, even as the enemy was overhauling them, suddenly turned about at the same moment,
     and the crews raised the battle-song and the trumpeters sounded the attack. The Peloponnesians,
     dismayed at the turn of events, hastily endeavoured to draw up their ships to repel the attack,
     but as there was not time for them to turn about they had fallen into great confusion because
     the ships coming up after them had left their accustomed position. </p>

     not one turned to flight, but they continued to back water while waiting for the ships which
     tarried behind; <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>but the Athenians who held the left wing,
     putting to flight their opponents, pressed upon them with increasing eagerness and pursued them
     for a long time. But when the Peloponnesians had brought all their ships together, <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>, fearing the superior numbers of the enemy, stopped the
     pursuit and sailed off to <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName> with forty ships.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>As for the Athenians who had set out in pursuit, all the
     Peloponnesian ships, swarming around them, struck terror into them, and cutting them off from
     return to the city compelled them to turn in flight to the land. And since the Peloponnesians
     pressed upon them with all their ships, the Athenians, seeing no other means of deliverance,
     fled for safety to the land and deserting their vessels found refuge in <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Mitylene</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Callicratidas, by the capture of thirty ships, was aware that the naval
     power of the enemy had been destroyed, but he anticipated that the fighting on land remained.
     Consequently he sailed on to the city, and <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>, who
     was expecting a siege when he arrived, began upon preparations about the entrance to the
     harbour; for in the shallow places of the harbour he sank small boats filled with rocks and in
     the deep waters he anchored merchantmen armed with stones.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >Carried on the yard-arms.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Now the Athenians and a great throng of the Mitylenaeans who
     had gathered from the fields into the city because of the war speedily completed the
     preparations for the siege. Callicratidas, disembarking his soldiers on the beach near the
     city, pitched a camp, and then he set up a trophy for the sea-battle. And on the next day,
     after choosing out his best ships and commanding them not to get far from his own ship, he put
     out to sea, being eager to sail into the harbour and break the barrier constructed by the
     enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/><placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName> put some
     of his soldiers on the triremes, which he placed with their prows facing the open passage, and
     some he assigned to the large vessels,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Presumably the merchantmen mentioned above.</note> while others he sent to the breakwaters of the harbour in
     order that the harbour might be fenced in on every side, both by land and by sea. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Then Conon himself with his triremes joined the battle, filling with his
     ships the space lying between the barriers; and the soldiers stationed on the large ships
     hurled the stones from the yard-arms upon the ships of the enemy, while those drawn up on the
     breakwaters of the harbour held off those who might have ventured to disembark on the land.

<div2 type="chapter" n="79">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Peloponnesians were not a whit outdone by the emulation displayed by the
     Athenians. Advancing with their ships in mass formation and with their best soldiers lined up
     on the decks they made the sea-battle also a fight between infantry; for as they pressed upon
     their opponents' ships they boldly boarded their prows, in the belief that men who had once
     been defeated would not stand up to the terror of battle. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But
     the Athenians and Mitylenaeans, seeing that the single hope of safety left to them lay in their
     victory, were resolved to die nobly rather than leave their station. And so, since an
     unsurpassable emulation pervaded both forces, a great slaughter ensued, all the participants
     exposing their bodies, without regard of risk, to the perils of battle. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The soldiers on the decks were wounded by the multitude of missiles
     which flew at them, and some of them, who were mortally struck, fell into the sea, while some,
     so long as their wounds were fresh, fought on without feeling them; but very many fell victims
     to the stones that were hurled by the stone-carrying yardarms, since the Athenians kept up a
     shower of huge stones from these commanding positions. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The
     fighting had continued, none the less, for a long while and many had met death on both sides,
     when Callicratidas, wishing to give his soldiers a breathing-spell, sounded the recall.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After some time he again manned his ships and continued the
     struggle over a long period, and with great effort, by means of the superior number of his
     ships and the strength of the marines, he thrust out the Athenians. And when the Athenians fled
     for refuge to the harbour within the city, he sailed through the barriers and brought his ships
     to anchor near the city of the Mitylenaeans. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>It may be
     explained that the entrance for whose control they had fought had a good harbour, which,
     however, lies outside the city. For the ancient city is a small island, and the later city,
     which was founded near it, is opposite it on the island of <placeName key="tgn,7002672" >Lesbos</placeName>; and between the two cities is a narrow strait which also adds strength to
     the city. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Callicratidas now, disembarking his troops, invested

     were distressed without measure. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Accordingly the Syracusans

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the sacred buildings which they constructed, and especially the temple
     of Zeus, bear witness to the grand manner of the men of that day. Of the other sacred buildings
     some have been burned and others completely destroyed because of the many times the city has
     been taken in war, but the completion of the temple of Zeus, which was ready to receive its
     roof, was prevented by the war; and after the war, since the city had been completely
     destroyed, never in the subsequent years did the Acragantini find themselves able to finish
     their buildings. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The temple has a length of three hundred and
     forty feet, a width of sixty, and a height of one hundred and twenty not including the
      foundation.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The actual dimensions of this great Olympieum are in English feet (c. 5 mm. longer than the Attic foot): length excluding steps 361 ft.;
      breadth 173 1/2; height of columns with capitals 62 1/2 (?); diameter of columns at bottom 14.</note> And being as it is the largest temple in <placeName key="tgn,7003122" >Sicily</placeName>, it may not unreasonably be compared, so far as the magnitude of its
     substructure is concerned, with the temples outside of <placeName key="tgn,7003122" >Sicily</placeName>; for even though, as it turned out, the design could not be carried out,
     the scale of the undertaking at any rate is clear. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And though
     all other men build their temples either with walls forming the sides or with rows of columns,
     thus enclosing their sanctuaries, this temple combines both these plans; for the columns were
     built in with the walls,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">i.e. they were engaged or half-columns; see the frontispiece of this Volume.</note> the part extending outside the
     temple being rounded and that within square; and the circumference of the outer part of the
     column which extends from the wall is twenty feet and the body of a man may be contained in the
     fluting, while that of the inner part is twelve feet. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The
     porticoes were of enormous size and height, and in the east pediment they portrayed The Battle
     between the Gods and the Giants in sculptures which excelled in size and beauty, and in the
     west The Capture of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, in which each one of the
     heroes may be seen portrayed in a manner appropriate to his role. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>There was at that time also an artificial pool outside the city, seven stades in
     circumference and twenty cubits deep; into this they brought water and ingeniously contrived to
     produce a multitude of fish of every variety for their public feastings, and with the fish
     swans spent their time and a vast multitude of every other kind of bird, so that the pool was
     an object of great delight to gaze upon. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And witness to the
     luxury of the inhabitants is also the extravagant cost of the monuments which they erected,
     some adorned with sculptured race-horses and others with the pet birds kept by girls and boys
     in their homes, monuments which Timaeus says he had seen extant even in his own lifetime.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Timaeus died c. <date value="-250">250</date> B.C.</note>

     generally, they led from youth onward a manner of life which was luxurious, wearing as they did

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Among the Acragantini of that time perhaps the richest
     man was Tellias, who had in his mansion a considerable number of guest-chambers and used to
     station servants before his gates with orders to invite every stranger to be his guest. There
     were also many other Acragantini who did something of this kind, mingling with others in an
     old-fashioned and friendly manner; consequently also Empedocles<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The famous fifth-century physical philosopher, a native of <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName>.</note> speaks of them as<quote type="verse">

     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Indeed once when five hundred
     cavalry from <placeName key="perseus,Gela">Gela</placeName> arrived there during a wintry
     storm, as Timaeus says in his Fifteenth Book, Tellias entertained all of them by himself and
     provided them all forthwith from his own stores with outer and under garments. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And Polycleitus<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">A native of Larissa and probably of the generation of Alexander the Great.</note> in his <title>Histories</title>
     describes the wine-cellar in the house as still existing and as he had himself seen it when in
      <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName> as a soldier; there were in it, he states,
     three hundred great casks hewn out of the very rock, each of them with a capacity of one
     hundred amphoras,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">An amphora was about nine gallons.</note> and beside them was a wine-vat, plastered with stucco and with a capacity of
     one thousand amphoras, from which the wine flowed into the casks. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And we are told that Tellias was quite plain in appearance but wonderful in character.
     So once when he had been dispatched on an embassy to the people of Centoripa and came forward
     to speak before the Assembly, the multitude broke into unseemly laughter as they saw how much
     he fell short of their expectation. But he, interrupting them, said, "Don't be surprised, for
     it is the practice of the Acragantini to send to famous cities their most handsome citizens,
     but to insignificant and most paltry cities men of their sort." </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="84">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It was not in the case
     of Tellias only that such magnificence of wealth occurred, he says, but also of many other
     inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName>. Antisthenes at any rate, who
     was called <placeName key="tgn,7011266">Rhodus</placeName>, when celebrating the marriage of
     his daughter, gave a party to all the citizens in the courtyards where they all lived and more
     than eight hundred chariots followed the bride in the procession; furthermore, not only the men
     on horseback from the city itself but also many from neighbouring cities who had been invited
     to the wedding joined to form the escort of the bride. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But
     most extraordinary of all, we are told, was the provision for the lighting: the altars in all
     the temples and those in the courtyards throughout the city he had piled high with wood, and to
     the shopkeepers he gave firewood and brush with orders that when a fire was kindled on the
     acropolis they should all do the same; <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>and when they did as
     they were ordered, at the time when the bride was brought to her home, since there were many
     torch-bearers in the procession, the city was filled with light, and the main streets through
     which the procession was to pass could not contain the accompanying throng, all the inhabitants
     zealously emulating the man's grand manner. For at that time the citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName> numbered more than twenty thousand, and when resident
     aliens were included, not less than two hundred thousand. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And
     men say that once when Antisthenes saw his son quarrelling with a neighbouring farmer, a poor
     man, and pressing him to sell him his little plot of land, for a time he merely reproved his
     son; but when his son's cupidity grew more intense, he said to him that he should not be doing
     his best to make his neighbour poor but, on the contrary, to make him rich; for then the man
     would long for more land, and when he would be unable to buy additional land from his neighbour
     he would sell what he now had. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Because of the immense prosperity prevailing in the city the Acragantini came to live on such
     a scale of luxury that a little later, when the city was under siege, they passed a decree
     about the guards who spent the nights at their posts, that none of them should have more than
     one mattress, one cover, one sheepskin, and two pillows. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When
     such was their most rigorous kind of bedding, one can get an idea of the luxury which prevailed
     in their living generally. Now it was our wish neither to pass these matters by nor yet to
     speak of them at greater length, in order that we may not fail to record the more important
     events. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="85">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Carthaginians, after transporting their armaments to <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, marched against the city of the Acragantini and made two
     encampments, one on certain hills where they stationed the Iberians and some Libyans to the
     number of about forty thousand, and the other they pitched not far from the city and surrounded
     it with a deep trench and a palisade. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And first they
     dispatched ambassadors to the Acragantini, asking them, preferably, to become their allies, but
     otherwise to stay neutral and be friends with the Carthaginians, thereby remaining in peace;
     and when the inhabitants of the city would not entertain these terms, the siege was begun at
     once. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Acragantini thereupon armed all those of military
     age, and forming them in battle order they stationed one group upon the walls and the other as
     a reserve to replace the soldiers as they became worn out. Fighting with them was also Dexippus
     the Lacedaemonian, who had lately arrived there from <placeName key="perseus,Gela" >Gela</placeName> with fifteen hundred mercenaries; for at that time, as Timaeus says, Dexippus
     was tarrying in <placeName key="perseus,Gela">Gela</placeName>, enjoying high regard by reason
     of the city of his birth. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Consequently the Acragantini invited
     him to recruit as many mercenaries as he could and come to <placeName key="tgn,7003808" >Acragas</placeName>; and together with them the Campanians who had formerly fought with
      Hannibal,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chaps. 44.1; 62.5.</note> some eight
     hundred, were also hired. These mercenaries held the height above the city which is called the
     Hill of Athena and is strategically situated overhanging the city. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Himilcar and Hannibal, the Carthaginian generals, noting, after they had surveyed the
     walls, that in one place the city was easily assailable, advanced two enormous towers against
     the walls. During the first day they pressed the siege from these towers, and after inflicting
     many casualties then sounded the recall for their soldiers; but when night had fallen the
     defenders of the city launched a counter-attack and burned the siege-engines. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="86">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Hannibal, being eager to launch assaults in an increasing number of places, ordered the
     soldiers to tear down the monuments and tombs and to build mounds extending to the walls. But
     when these works had been quickly completed because of the united labour of many hands, a deep
     superstitious fear fell upon the army. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For it happened that
     the tomb of Theron,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Tyrant of <placeName key="tgn,7003808" >Acragas</placeName>, <dateRange from="-488" to="-472">488</dateRange>-472 B.C.; cp. Book 11.53.</note> which was exceedingly large, was shaken by a stroke of lightning; consequently,
     when it was being torn down, certain soothsayers, presaging what might happen, forbade it, and
     at once a plague broke out in the army, and many died of it while not a few suffered tortures
     and grievous distress. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Among the dead was also Hannibal the
     general, and among the watch-guards who were sent out there were some who reported that in the
     night spirits of the dead were to be seen. Himilcar, on seeing how the throng was beset with
     superstitious fear, first of all put a stop to the destruction of the monuments, and then he
     supplicated the gods after the custom of his people by sacrificing a young boy to Cronus and a
     multitude of cattle to Poseidon by drowning them in the sea. He did not, however, neglect the
     siege works, but filling up the river which ran beside the city as far as the walls, he
     advanced all his siege-engines against them and launched daily assaults. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Syracusans, seeing that <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName> was under siege and fearing lest the besieged might
     suffer the same fate as befell the Selinuntians and Himeraeans,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chaps. 57 and 62 respectively.</note> had long been eager to send them
     their aid, and when at this juncture allied troops arrived from <placeName key="tgn,1000080" >Italy</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> they elected
      Daphnaeus<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">A Syracusan, later executed by Dionysius
       (<emph>infra,</emph> chap. 96.3).</note> general. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Collecting
     their forces they added along the way soldiers from Camarina and <placeName key="perseus,Gela" >Gela</placeName>, and summoning additional troops from the peoples of the interior they made
     their way towards <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName>, while thirty of their ships
     sailed along beside them. The forces which they had numbered in all more than thirty thousand
     infantry and not less than five thousand cavalry. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="87">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Himilcon learned of the approach of
     the enemy, he dispatched to meet them both his Iberians and his Campanians and more than forty
     thousand other troops. The Syracusans had already crossed the Himera River when the barbarians
     met them, and in the long battle which ensued the Syracusans were victorious and slew more than
     six thousand men. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They would have crushed the whole army
     completely and pursued it all the way to the city, but since the soldiers were pressing the
     pursuit without order, the general was concerned lest Himilcar should appear with the rest of
     his army and retrieve the defeat. For he remembered also how the Himeraeans had been utterly
     destroyed for the same reason.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">By a disorderly pursuit;
      cp. chap. 60 <emph>ad fin</emph>.</note> However, when the barbarians were in flight to their
     camp before <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName>, the soldiers in the city, seeing
     the defeat of the Carthaginians, begged their generals to lead them out, saying that the
     opportunity had come to destroy the host of the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But the
     generals, whether they had been bribed, as the report ran, or feared that Himilcon would seize
     the city if it were stripped of defenders, checked the ardour of their men. So the fleeing men
     quite safely made good their escape to the camp before the city. When Daphnaeus with his army
     arrived at the encampment which the barbarians had deserted, he took up his quarters there.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At once both the soldiers from the city mingled with his
     troops and Dexippus accompanied his men, and the multitude gathered in a tumultuous throng in
     an assembly, everyone being vexed that the opportunity had been let slip and that although they
     had the barbarians in their power, they had not inflicted on them the punishment they deserved,
     but that the generals in the city, although able to lead them forth to attack and destroy the
     host of the enemy, had let so many myriads of men off scot-free. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>While great uproar and tumult prevailed in the assembly, Menes of Camarina, who had
     been put in command, came forward and lodged an accusation against the Acragantine generals and
     so incited all who were present that, when the accused tried to offer a defence, no one would
     let them speak and the multitude began to throw stones and killed four of them, but the fifth,
     Argeius by name, who was very much younger, they spared. Dexippus the Lacedaemonian, we are
     told, also was the object of abuse on the ground that, although he held a position of command
     and was reputed to be not inexperienced in warfare, he had acted as he did treacherously.
      </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="88">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the assembly Daphnaeus led forth his forces and undertook to lay siege to the
     camp of the Carthaginians, but when he saw that it had been fortified with great outlay, he
     gave up that design; however, by covering the roads with his cavalry he seized such as were
     foraging, and by cutting off the transport of supplies brought them into serious straits.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Carthaginians, not daring to wage a pitched battle and
     being hard pinched by lack of food, were enduring great misfortunes. For many of the soldiers
     were dying of want, and the Campanians together with the other mercenaries, almost in a body,
     forced their way to the tent of Himilcar and demanded the rations which had been agreed upon;
     and if these were not given them, they threatened to go over to the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But Himilcar had learned from some source that the Syracusans were
     conveying a great amount of grain to <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName> by sea.
     Consequently, since this was the only hope he had of salvation, he persuaded the soldiers to
     wait a few days, giving them as a pledge the goblets belonging to the troops from <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He then summoned
     forty triremes from <placeName key="perseus,Panormus">Panormus</placeName> and Motye and
     planned an attack upon the ships which were bringing the supplies; and the Syracusans, because
     up to this time the barbarians had retired from the sea and winter had already set in, held the
     Carthaginians in contempt, feeling assured that they would not again have the courage to man
     their triremes. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently, since they gave little concern
     to the convoying of the supplies, Himilcar, sailing forth unawares with forty triremes, sank
     eight of their warships and pursued the rest to the beach; and by capturing all the remaining
     vessels he effected such a reversal in the expectations of both sides that the Campanians who
     were in the service of the Acragantini, considering the position of the Greeks to be hopeless,
     were bought off for fifteen talents and went over to the Carthaginians. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Acragantini at first, when the
     Carthaginians were faring badly, had enjoyed their grain and other supplies without stint,
     expecting all the while that the siege would be quickly lifted; but when the hopes of the
     barbarians began to rise and so many myriads of human beings were gathered into one city, the
     grain was exhausted before they were aware of it. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And the
     story is told that also Dexippus the Lacedaemonian was corrupted by a bribe of fifteen talents;
     for without hesitation he replied to a question of the generals of the Italian Greeks, "Yes,
     it's better if the war is settled somewhere else, for our provisions have failed." Consequently
     the generals, offering as their excuse that the time agreed upon for the campaign had elapsed,
     led their troops off to the Strait.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Presumably of
       <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messina</placeName>.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>After the departure of these troops the generals met with the
     commanders and decided to make a survey of the supply of grain in the city, and when they
     discovered that it was quite low, they perceived that they were compelled to desert the city.
     At once, then, they issued orders that all should leave on the next night. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="89">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With
     such a throng of men, women, and children deserting the city, at once endless lamentation and
     tears pervaded all homes. For while they were panic-stricken from fear of the enemy, at the
     same time they were also under necessity, because of their haste, of leaving behind as booty
     for the barbarians the possessions on which they had based their happiness; for when Fortune
     was robbing them of the comforts they enjoyed in their homes, they thought that they should be
     content that at least they were preserving their lives. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And
     one could see the abandonment not only of the opulence of so wealthy a city but also of a
     multitude of human beings. For the sick were neglected by their relatives, everyone taking
     thought for his own safety, and those who were already far advanced in years were abandoned
     because of the weakness of old age; and many, reckoning even separation from their native city
     to be the equivalent of death, laid hands upon themselves in order that they might breathe
     their last in the dwellings of their ancestors. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>However, the
     multitude which left the city was given armed escort by the soldiers to <placeName key="perseus,Gela">Gela</placeName>; and the highway and all parts of the countryside which
     led away toward the territory of the Geloans were crowded with women and children intermingled
     with maidens, who, changing from the pampered life to which they had been accustomed to a
     strenuous journey by foot and extreme hardship, held out to the end, since fear nerved their
     souls. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now these got safely to <placeName key="perseus,Gela" >Gela</placeName><note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">A little over 40 miles from <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName>.</note> and at a later time made their home in

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="90">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Himilcar, leading his army at dawn within the walls, put to death practically all who had
     been left behind; yes, even those who had fled for safety to the temples the Carthaginians
     hauled out and slew. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And we are told that Tellias, who was the
     foremost citizen in wealth and honourable character, shared in the misfortune of his country:
     He had decided to take refuge with certain others in the temple of Athena, thinking that the
     Carthaginians would refrain from acts of lawlessness against the gods, but when he saw their
     impiety, he set fire to the temple and burned himself together with the dedications in it. For
     by one deed, he thought, he would withhold from the gods impiety, from the enemy a vast store
     of plunder, and from himself, most important of all, certain physical indignity. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But Himilcar, after pillaging and industriously ransacking the temples
     and dwellings, collected as great a store of booty as a city could be expected to yield which
     had been inhabited by two hundred thousand people, had gone unravaged since the date of its
     founding, had been well-nigh the wealthiest of the Greek cities of that day, and whose
     citizens, furthermore, had shown their love of the beautiful in expensive collections of works
     of art of every description. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Indeed a multitude of paintings
     executed with the greatest care was found and an extraordinary number of sculptures of every
     description and worked with great skill. The most valuable pieces, accordingly, Himilcar sent
     to <placeName key="perseus,Carthage">Carthage</placeName>, among which, as it turned out, was
     the bull of Phalaris,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 9.18-19.</note> and the
     rest of the pillage he sold as booty. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>As regards this bull,
     although Timaeus in his <title>History</title> has maintained that it never existed at all, he
     has been refuted by Fortune herself; for some two hundred and sixty years after the capture of

     rather copiously because Timaeus, who criticized most bitterly the historians before his time
     and left the writers of history bereft of all forgiveness, is himself caught improvising in the
     very province where he most proclaims his own accuracy. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>For
     historians should, in my opinion, be granted charity in errors that come of ignorance, since
     they are human beings and since the truth of ages past is hard to discover, but historians who
     deliberately do not give the exact facts should properly be open to censure, whenever in
     flattering one man or another or in attacking others from hatred too bitterly, they stray from
     the truth. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="91">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Since Himilcar, after besieging the city for eight months, had taken it
     shortly before the winter solstice,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">December 22.</note> he
     did not destroy it at once, in order that his forces might winter in the dwellings. But when
     the misfortune that had befallen <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName> was noised
     abroad, such fear took possession of the island that of the Sicilian Greeks some removed to
      <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and others transferred their children
     and wives and all their possessions to <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Acragantini who had escaped being taken captive, when
     they arrived in <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, lodged accusations
     against their generals, asserting that it was due to their treachery that their country had
     perished. And it so happened that the Syracusans also came in for censure by the rest of the
     Sicilian Greeks, because, as they charged, they elected the kind of leaders through whose fault
     the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> ran the risk of destruction.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Nevertheless, even though an assembly of the people was held
     in <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and great fears hung over them, not a
     man would venture to offer any counsel respecting the war. While everyone was at a loss what to
     do, Dionysius, the son of Hermocrates, taking the floor, accused the generals of betraying
     their cause to the Carthaginians and stirred up the assemblage to exact punishment of them,
     urging them not to await the futile procedure prescribed by the laws but to pass judgement upon
     them at once. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And when the archons, in accordance with the
     laws, laid a fine upon Dionysius on the charge of raising an uproar, Philistus, who later
     composed his <title>History,</title><note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, in thirteen Books (Cp. <emph>infra,</emph> chap. 103.3).</note> a man of great wealth, paid the fine and urged Dionysius to speak out whatever
     he had had in his mind to say. And when Philistus went on to say that if they wanted to fine
     Dionysius throughout the whole day he would provide the money for him, from then on Dionysius,
     full of confidence, kept stirring up the multitude, and throwing the assembly into confusion he
     accused the generals of taking bribes to put the security of the Acragantini in jeopardy. And
     he also denounced the rest of the most renowned citizens, presenting them as friends of
     oligarchy. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently he advised them to choose as generals
     not the most influential citizens, but rather those who were the best disposed and most
     favourable to the people; for the former, he maintained, ruling the citizens as they do in a
     despotic manner, hold the many in contempt and consider the misfortunes of their country their
     own source of income, whereas the more humble will do none of such things, since they fear
     their own weakness. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="92">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dionysius, by suiting every word of his harangue to the
     people to the predilection of his hearers and his own personal design, stirred the anger of the
     assembly to no small degree; for the people, which for some time past had hated the generals
     for what they considered to be their bad conduct of the war and at the moment were spurred on
     by what was being said to them, immediately dismissed some of them from office and chose other
     generals, among whom was also Dionysius, who enjoyed the reputation of having shown unusual
     bravery in the battles against the Carthaginians and was admired of all the Syracusans. Having
     become elated, therefore, in his hopes, he tried every device to become tyrant of his country.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For example, after assuming office he neither participated in
     the meetings of the generals nor associated with them in any way; and while acting in this
     manner he spread the report that they were carrying on negotiations with the enemy. For in this
     way he hoped that he could most effectively strip them of their power and clothe himself alone
     with the office of general. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />While Dionysius was acting in this fashion, the most respectable citizens suspected what was
     taking place and in every gathering spoke disparagingly of him, but the common crowd, being
     ignorant of his scheme, gave him their approbation and declared that at long last the city had
     found a steadfast leader. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>However, when the assembly convened
     time and again to consider preparations for the war, Dionysius, observing that fear of the
     enemy had struck the Syracusans with terror, advised them to recall the exiles; <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>for it was absurd, he said, to seek aid from peoples of other states in
      <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> and the <placeName key="tgn,7017076" >Peloponnesus</placeName> and to be unwilling to enlist the assistance of their fellow
     citizens in facing their own dangers, citizens who, although the enemy kept promising them
     great rewards for their military co-operation, chose rather to die as wanderers on foreign soil
     than plan some hostile act against their native land. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And in
     fact, he declared, men who were now in exile because of past civil strife in the city, if at
     this time they were the recipients of this benefaction, would fight with eagerness, showing in
     this way their appreciation to their benefactors. After reciting many arguments for this
     proposal that bore on the situation, he won the votes of the Syracusans to his view; for no one
     of his colleagues in office dared oppose him in the matter both because of the eagerness shown
     by the multitude and because each observed that he himself would gain only enmity, while
     Dionysius would reap a reward of gratitude from those who had received kindness from him.
      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Dionysius took this course in the hope that he would win the
     exiles for himself, men who wished a change and would be favourably disposed toward the
     establishment of a tyranny; for they would be happy to witness the murder of their enemies, the
     confiscation of their property, and the restoration to themselves of their possessions. And
     when finally the resolution regarding the exiles was passed, these returned at once to their
     native land. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="93">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When messages were brought from <placeName key="perseus,Gela" >Gela</placeName> requesting the dispatch of additional troops, Dionysius got a favourable
     means of accomplishing his own purpose. Having been dispatched with two thousand infantry and
     four hundred cavalry, he arrived speedily at the city of the Geloans, which at that time was
     under the eye of Dexippus, the Lacedaemonian, who had been put in charge by the Syracusans.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And when Dionysius on arrival found the wealthiest citizens
     engaged in strife with the people, he accused them in an assembly and secured their
     condemnation, whereupon he put them to death and confiscated their possessions. With the money
     thus gained he paid the guards of the city under the command of Dexippus the wages which were
     owing them, while to his own troops who had come with him from <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> he promised he would pay double the wages which
     the city had determined. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In this manner he won over to himself
     the loyalty not only of the soldiers in <placeName key="perseus,Gela">Gela</placeName> but also
     of those whom he had brought with him. He also gained the approval of the populace of the
     Geloans, who believed him to be responsible for their liberation; for in their envy of the most
     influential citizens they stigmatized the superiority these men possessed as a despotism over
     themselves. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Consequently they dispatched ambassadors who sang
     his praises in <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and reported decrees in
     which they honoured him with rich gifts. Dionysius also undertook to persuade Dexippus to
     associate himself with his design, and when Dexippus would not join with him, he was on the
     point of returning with his own troops to <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse" >Syracuse</placeName>. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But the Geloans, on learning that the
     Carthaginians with their entire host were going to make <placeName key="perseus,Gela" >Gela</placeName> the first object of attack, besought Dionysius to remain and not to stand
     idly by while they suffered the same fate as the Acragantini. Dionysius replied to them that he
     would return speedily with a larger force and set forth from <placeName key="perseus,Gela" >Gela</placeName> with his own soldiers. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="94">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A play was being presented in <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> and Dionysius arrived in the city at the time when
     the people were leaving the theatre. When the populace rushed in throngs to him and were
     questioning him about the Carthaginians, they were unaware, he said, that they had more
     dangerous enemies than their foreign foes&mdash;the men within the city in charge of the
     public interests; these men the citizens trusted while they held public festivals, but these
     very men, while plundering the public funds, had let the soldiers go unpaid, and although the
     enemy was making their preparations for the war on a scale which could not be surpassed and
     were about to lead their forces upon <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>,
     the generals were giving these matters no concern whatsoever. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />The reason for such conduct, he continued, he had been aware of before, but now he had got
     fuller information. For Himilcon had sent a herald to him, ostensibly to treat about the
     captives, but in fact to urge him, now that Himilcon had induced a large number of Dionysius'
     colleagues not to bother themselves with what was taking place, at least to offer no
     opposition, since he, Dionysius, did not choose to co-operate with him. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Consequently, Dionysius continued, he did not wish to serve longer as
     general, but was present in <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName> to lay down
     his office; for it was intolerable for him, while the other generals were selling out their
     country, to be the only one to fight together with the citizens and yet be at the same time
     destined to be thought in after years to have shared in their betrayal.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Or, following Eichst&auml;dt and Reiske, "for it was intolerable for him, while the rest of the generals were selling out the state, not only to fight together with the
      citizens but also to be thought in after years to have shared in the betrayal."</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Although the populace had been
     stirred by what Dionysius had said and his words spread through the whole army, at the time
     every man departed to his home full of anxiety. But on the following day, when an assembly had
     been convened in which Dionysius won no small approval when he lodged many accusations against
     the magistrates and stirred up the populace against the generals, <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>finally some of the members cried out to appoint him general with supreme power and not
     to wait until the enemy were storming their walls; for the magnitude of the war, they urged,
     made necessary such a general, through whose leadership their cause could prosper; as for the
     traitors, their case would be debated in another assembly, since it was foreign to the present
     situation; indeed at a former time three hundred thousand Carthaginians had been conquered at
     Himera when Gelon was general with supreme power.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 11.22.</note> 
     </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="95">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And soon the multitude, as is their wont, swung to the worse decision and Dionysius
     was appointed general with supreme power. And now, since the situation corresponded to his
     desires, he proposed a decree that the pay of the mercenaries be doubled; for they would all,
     he said, if this were done, be more eager for the coming contest, and he urged them not to
     worry at all about the funds, since it would be an easy task to raise them. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the assembly was adjourned no small
     number of the Syracusans condemned what had been done, as if they themselves had not had their
     way in the matter; for as their thoughts turned to their own state they could imagine the
     tyrannical power which was to follow. Now these men, in their desire to insure their freedom,
     had unwittingly established a despot over their country; <milestone unit="section" n="3" />Dionysius, on the other hand, wishing to forestall the change of mind on the part of the
     populace, kept seeking a means whereby he could ask for a guard for his person, for if this
     were granted him he would easily establish himself in the tyranny. At once, then, he issued
     orders that all men of military age up to forty years should provide themselves with rations
     for thirty days and report to him under arms at Leontini. This city was at that time an outpost
     of the Syracusans, being full of exiles and foreigners.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >i.e. non-Syracusans.</note> For Dionysius hoped that he would have these men on his side,
     desiring as they did a change of government, and that the majority of the Syracusans would not
     even come to Leontini. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>However, while he was encamped at night
     in the countryside, he pretended that he was the object of a plot and had his personal servants
     raise a tumult and uproar; and after doing this he took refuge on the acropolis, where he
     passed the night, keeping fires burning and summoning to him his most trustworthy soldiers.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And at day-break, when the common people were gathered into
     Leontini, he delivered a long plausible speech to further his design and persuaded the populace
     to give him a guard of six hundred soldiers whomsoever he should select. It is said that
     Dionysius did this in imitation of Peisistratus the Athenian; <milestone unit="section" n="6" />for he, we are told, after wounding himself, appeared before the assembly alleging that he
     had been the victim of a plot, and because of this he received a guard at the hands of the
     citizens, by means of which he established the tyranny.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >Cp.<bibl n="Hdt. 1.59">Hdt. 1.59</bibl>; <bibl n="Plut. Sol. 30">Plut. Sol.
     30</bibl>.</note> And at this time Dionysius, having deceived the multitude by a similar
     device, put into effect the structure of his tyranny. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="96">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For instance Dionysius at
     once selected such citizens as were without property but bold in spirit, more than a thousand
     in number, provided them with costly arms, and buoyed them up with extravagant promises; the
     mercenaries also he won to himself by calling them to him and conversing with them in friendly
     fashion. He made changes also in the military posts, conferring their commands upon his most
     faithful followers; and Dexippus the Lacedaemonian he dismissed to Greece, for he was
     suspicious of this man lest he should seize a favourable opportunity and restore to the
     Syracusans their liberty. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He also called to himself the
     mercenaries in Gela and gathered from all quarters the exiles and impious, hoping that in these
     men the tyranny would find its strongest support. While in Syracuse, however, he took up his
     quarters in the naval station, having openly proclaimed himself tyrant. Although the Syracusans
     were offended, they were compelled to keep quiet; for they were unable to effect anything now,
     since not only was the city thronged with mercenary soldiers but the people were filled with
     fear of the Carthaginians who possessed such powerful armaments. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now Dionysius straightway married the daughter of Hermocrates, the conqueror of the
      Athenians,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chaps. 18.3; 34.4.</note> and gave his
     sister in marriage to Polyxenus, the brother of Hermocrates' wife. This he did out of a desire
     to draw a distinguished house into relationship with him in order to make firm the tyranny.
     After this he summoned an assembly and had his most influential opponents, Daphnaeus and
     Demarchus, put to death. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now
     Dionysius, from a scribe and ordinary private citizen, had become tyrant of the largest city of
     the Greek world<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Probably Syracuse grew to be such before the death of Dionysius.</note> ; and he maintained his dominance until his death, having ruled
     as tyrant for thirty-eight years.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather"><dateRange from="-405" to="-367">405</dateRange>-367 B.C.</note> But we shall give a detailed account of his deeds
     and of the expansion of his rule in connection with the appropriate periods of time; for it
     seems that this man, single-handed, established the strongest and longest tyranny of any
     recorded by history. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The
     Carthaginians, after their capture of the city,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >Acragas.</note> transferred to Carthage both the votive offerings and statues and every other
     object of greatest value, and when they had burned down the temples and plundered the city,
     they spent the winter there. And in the springtime they made ready every kind of engine of war
     and of missile, planning to lay siege first to the city of the Geloans. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="97">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While
     these events were taking place, the Athenians,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The narrative is resumed from chap. 79.</note> who had suffered a continued series of reverses,
     conferred citizenship upon the metics and any other aliens who were willing to fight with them;
     and when a great multitude was quickly enrolled among the citizens, the generals kept mustering
     for the campaign all who were in fit condition. They made ready sixty ships, and after fitting
     them out at great expense they sailed forth to Samos, where they found the other generals who
     had assembled eighty triremes from the rest of the islands. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />They also had asked the Samians to man and equip ten additional triremes, and with one
     hundred and fifty ships in all they set out to sea and put in at the Arginusae Islands, being
     eager to raise the siege of Mitylene. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When Callicratidas, the
     admiral of the Lacedaemonians, learned of the approach of the ships, he left Eteonicus with the
     land troops in charge of the siege, while he himself manned one hundred and forty ships and
     hurriedly put out to sea on the other side of the Arginusae. These islands, which were
     inhabited at that time and contained a small settlement of Aeolians, lie between Mitylene and
     Cyme and are but a very small distance from the mainland and the headland of Canis. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Athenians learned at once of the
     approach of the enemy, since they lay at anchor no small distance away, but refused battle
     because of the strong winds and made ready for the conflict on the following day, the
     Lacedaemonians also doing likewise, although the seers on both sides forbade it. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For in the case of the Lacedaemonians the head of the victim, which lay
     on the beach, was lost to sight when the waves broke on it, and the seer accordingly foretold
     that the admiral would die in the fight. At this prophecy Callicratidas, we are told, remarked,
     "If I die in the fight, I shall not have lessened the fame of Sparta." <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And in the case of the Athenians Thrasybulus<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">This should be Thrasyllus.</note> their general, who held the supreme command
     on that day, saw in the night the following vision. He dreamed that he was in Athens and the
     theatre was crowded, and that he and six of the other generals were playing the
      <title>Phoenician Women</title> of Euripides, while their competitors were performing the
      <title>Suppliants</title><note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Also by Euripides. Both plays are on the theme of the war of the seven Argive chiefs against Thebes.</note> ; and that it
     resulted in a "Cadmean victory"<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 11.12.1.</note>
     for them and they all died, just as did those who waged the campaign against Thebes. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>When the seer heard this, he disclosed that seven of the generals would
     be slain. Since the omens revealed victory, the generals forbade any word going out to the
     others about their own death but they passed the news of the victory disclosed by the omens
     throughout the whole army. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="98">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The admiral Callicratidas, having assembled his whole force,
     encouraged them with the appropriate words and concluded his speech as follows. "So eager am I
     myself to enter battle for my country that, although the seer declares that the victims
     foretell victory for you but death for me, I am none the less ready to die. Accordingly,
     knowing that after the death of commanders forces are thrown into confusion, I designate at
     this time as admiral to succeed me, in case I meet with some mishap, Clearchus, a man who has
     proved himself in deeds of war." <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>By these words Callicratidas
     led not a few to emulate his valour and to become more eager for the battle. The
     Lacedaemonians, exhorting one another, entered their ships, and the Athenians, after hearing
     the exhortations of their generals summoning them to the struggle, manned the triremes in haste
     and all took their positions. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Thrasyllus commanded the right
     wing and also Pericles, the son of the Pericles who, by reason of his influence, had been
     dubbed "The Olympian"; and he associated with himself on the right wing also Theramenes, giving
     him a command. At the time Theramenes was on the campaign as a private citizen, although
     formerly he had often been in command of armaments. The rest of the generals he stationed along
     the entire line, and the Arginusae Islands, as they are called, he enclosed by his battle
     order, since he wished to extend his ships as far as possible. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />Callicratidas put out to sea holding himself the right flank, and the left he entrusted to
     the Boeotians, who were commanded by Thrasondas the Theban. And since he was unable to make his
     line equal to that of the enemy by reason of the large space occupied by the islands, he
     divided his force, and forming two fleets fought two battles separately, one on each wing.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently he aroused great amazement in the spectators on
     many sides, since there were four fleets engaged and the ships that had been gathered into one
     place did not lack many of being three hundred. For this is the greatest sea-battle on record
     of Greeks against Greeks. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="99">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At the very moment when the admirals gave orders to sound the
     trumpets the whole host on each side, raising the war-cry in turn, made a tremendous shout; and
     all, as they enthusiastically struck the waves, vied with one another, every man being anxious
     to be the first to begin the battle. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For the majority were
     experienced in fighting, because the war had endured so long, and they displayed insuperable
     enthusiasm, since it was the choicest troops who had been gathered for the decisive contest;
     for all took it for granted that the conquerors in this battle would put an end to the war.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But Callicratidas especially, since he had heard from the
     seer of the end awaiting him, was eager to compass for himself a death that would be most
     renowned. Consequently he was the first to drive at the ship of Lysias the general, and
     shattering it at the first blow together with the triremes accompanying it, he sank it; and as
     for the other ships, some he rammed and made unseaworthy and from others he tore away the rows
     of oars and rendered them useless for the fighting. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Last of
     all he rammed the trireme of Pericles with a rather heavy blow and broke a great hole in the
     trireme; then, since the beak of his ship stuck tight in the gap and they could not withdraw
     it, Pericles threw an iron hand<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">A grappling-iron, first
      introduced in the fighting in the harbour of Syracuse (cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.62">Thuc.

      against the Carthaginians in <date value="-260">260</date> B.C.</note> on the ship of
     Callicratidas, and when it was fastened tight, the Athenians, surrounding the ship, sprang
     upon, it and pouring over its crew put them all to the sword. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />It was at this time, we are told, that Callicratidas, after fighting brilliantly and holding

     As soon as the defeat of the admiral became evident, the result was that the Peloponnesians
     gave way in fear. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But although the right wing of the
     Peloponnesians was in flight, the Boeotians, who held the left, continued to put up a stout
     fight for some time; for both they and the Euboeans who were fighting by their side as well as
     all the other Greeks who had revolted from the Athenians feared lest the Athenians, if they
     should once regain their sovereignty, would exact punishment of them for their revolt. But when
     they saw that most of their ships had been damaged and that the main body of the victors was
     turning against them, they were compelled to take flight. Now of the Peloponnesians some found
     safety in Chios and some in Cyme. </p>

     considerable distance, filled the whole area of the sea in the neighbourhood of the battle with
     corpses and the wreckage of ships. After this some of the generals thought that they should
     pick up the dead, since the Athenians are incensed at those who allow the dead to go

     Mitylene and raise the siege with all speed. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But in the
     meantime a great storm arose, so that the ships were tossed about and the soldiers, by reason
     both of the hardships they had suffered in the battle and the heavy waves, opposed picking up
     the dead. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And finally, since the storm increased in violence,
     they neither sailed to Mitylene nor picked up the dead but were forced by the winds to put in
     at the Arginusae. The losses in the battle were twenty-five ships of the Athenians together
     with most of their crews and seventy-seven of the Peloponnesians; <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>and as a result of the loss of so many ships and of the sailors who manned them the
     coastline of the territory of the Cymaeans and Phocaeans was strewn with corpses and wreckage.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Eteonicus, who was
     besieging Mitylene, learned from someone of the defeat of the Peloponnesians, he sent his ships
     to Chios and himself retreated with his land forces to the city of the Pyrrhaeans,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Some fifteen miles west of Mitylene.</note> which was an ally;
     for he feared lest, if the Athenians should sail against his troops with their fleet and the
     besieged make a sortie from the city, he should run the risk of losing his entire force.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And the generals of the Athenians, after sailing to Mitylene
     and picking up Conon and his forty ships, put in at Samos, and from there as their base they
     set about laying waste the territory of the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>After this
     the inhabitants of Aeolis and Ionia and of the islands which were allies of the Lacedaemonians
     gathered in Ephesus, and as they counselled together they resolved to send to Sparta and to ask
     for Lysander as admiral; for during the time Lysander had been in command of the fleet he had
     enjoyed many successes and was believed to excel all others in skill as a general. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The Lacedaemonians, however, having a law not to send the same man twice
     and being unwilling to break the custom of their fathers, chose Aracus as admiral but sent
     Lysander with him as an ordinary citizen,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Xenophon's
      statement (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 2.1.7">Xen. Hell. 2.1.7</bibl>) is more precise and credible. He says that the law forbade a man "to hold the office of admiral twice" and that Lysander was
      sent as "vice-admiral."</note> commanding Aracus to follow the advice of Lysander in every

     greatest possible number of triremes from both the Peloponnesus and their allies. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="101">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When
     the Athenians learned of their success at the Arginusae, they commended the generals for the
     victory but were incensed that they had allowed the men who had died to maintain their
     supremacy to go unburied. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Since Theramenes and Thrasybulus had
     gone off to Athens in advance of the others, the generals, having assumed that it was they who
     had made accusations before the populace with respect to the dead, dispatched letters against
     them to the people stating that it was they whom the generals had ordered to pick up the dead.
     But this very thing turned out to be the principal cause of their undoing. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For although they could have had the help of Theramenes and his
     associates in the trial, men who both were able orators and had many friends and, most
     important of all, had been participants in the events relative to the battle, they had them, on
     the contrary, as adversaries and bitter accusers. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For when the
     letters were read before the people, the multitude was at once angered at Theramenes and his
     associates, but after these had presented their defence, it turned out that their anger was
     directed again on the generals. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently the people served
     notice on them of their trial and ordered them to turn over the command of the armaments to
     Conon, whom they freed of the responsibility, while they decreed that the others should report
     to Athens with all speed. Of the generals Aristogenes and Protomachus, fearing the wrath of the
     populace, sought safety in flight, but Thrasyllus and Calliades and, besides, Lysias and
     Pericles and Aristocrates sailed home to Athens with most of their ships, hoping that they
     would have their crews, which were numerous, to aid them in the trial. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When the populace gathered in the assembly, they gave attention to the
     accusation and to those who spoke to gratify them, but any who entered a defence they unitedly
     greeted with clamour and would not allow to speak. And not the least damaging to the generals
     were the relatives of the dead, who appeared in the assembly in mourning garments and begged
     the people to punish those who had allowed men who had gladly died on behalf of their country
     to go unburied. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And in the end the friends of these relatives
     and the partisans of Theramenes, being many, prevailed and the outcome was that the generals
     were condemned to death and their property confiscated. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="102">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this action had been
     taken and while the generals were about to be led off by the public executioners to death,
     Diomedon, one of the generals, took the floor before the people, a man who was both vigorous in
     the conduct of war and thought by all to excel both in justice and in the other virtues. And
     when all became still, he said: <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>"Men of Athens, may the action
     which has been taken regarding us turn out well for the state; but as for the vows which we
     made for the victory, inasmuch as Fortune has prevented our paying them, since it is well that

      Goddesses<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The Erinyes (Furies).</note>; for it was to
     these gods that we made vows before we overcame the enemy." <milestone unit="section" n="3" />Now after Diomedon had made this request he was led off to the appointed execution together
     with the other generals, though among the better citizens he had aroused great compassion and
     tears; for that the man who was about to meet an unjust death should make no mention whatsoever
     of his own fate but on behalf of the state which was wronging him should request it to pay his
     vows to the gods appeared to be an act of a man who was god-fearing and magnanimous and
     undeserving of the fate that was to befall him. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>These men,
     then, were put to death by the eleven<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">A Board which had charge of condemned prisoners and of the execution of the death sentence. They are more
      commonly referred to simply as "The Eleven."</note> magistrates who are designated by the
     laws, although far from having committed any crime against the state, they had won the greatest
     naval battle that had ever taken place of Greeks against Greeks and fought in splendid fashion
     in other battles and by reason of their individual deeds of valour had set up trophies of
     victories over their enemies. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>To such an extent were the
     people beside themselves at that time, and provoked unjustly as they were by their political
     leaders, they vented their rage upon men who were deserving, not of punishment, but of many
     praises and crowns. </p>

     put Philocles in command, and turning over the fleet to him, they sent him to Conon with orders
     that they should share the leadership of the armaments in common. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>After he had joined Conon in Samos, he manned all the ships which numbered one hundred

     summoning him to Persia, turned over to Lysander the authority over the cities under his

     for an oligarchy, with the aid of the Lacedaemonians put an end to the government of the
     people. First of all, while the Dionysia was being celebrated, they seized in their homes and
     carried off their principal opponents and put some forty of them to the sword, and then, at the
     time when the market-place was full, they picked out three hundred of the wealthiest citizens
     and slew them. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The most respectable citizens among those who
     favoured the people, not less than one thousand, fearing the situation they were in, fled to

      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Lysander, sailing with the

     by storm, put to the sword the males of military age to the number of eight hundred, sold the
     children and women as booty, and razed the city to the ground. <milestone unit="section" n="8" />After this he sailed against Attica and many places, but accomplished nothing of importance

     Attica with a large army and pitched their camp before the walls, and Lysander with more than

     peace with the Lacedaemonians on the terms that they should tear down the two long walls and

     danger, but when the women fled to the altars about the market-place and begged to share the
     same fortune as the men, they yielded to them. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>After this,
     forming a very large number of detachments, they sent the soldiers in turn over the
     countryside; and they, because of their knowledge of the land, attacked wandering bands of the
     enemy, daily brought back many of them alive, and slew not a few. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And although the Carthaginians kept launching assaults in relays upon the city and
     breaching the walls with their battering-rams, the Geloans defended themselves gallantly; for
     the portions of the walls which fell during the day they built up again at night, the women and
     children assisting. For those who were in the bloom of their physical strength were under arms
     and constantly in battle, and the rest of the multitude stood by to attend to the defences and
     the rest of the tasks with all eagerness. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>In a word, they met
     the attack of the Carthaginians so stoutly that, although their city lacked natural defences
     and they were without allies and they could, besides, see the walls falling in a number of
     places, they were not dismayed at the danger which threatened them. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="109">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dionysius, the tyrant
     of the Syracusans, summoning aid from the Greeks of Italy and his other allies, led forth his
     army; and he also enlisted the larger part of the Syracusans of military age and enrolled the
     mercenaries in the army. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He had in all, as some record, fifty
     thousand soldiers, but according to Timaeus, thirty thousand infantry, a thousand cavalry, and
     fifty decked vessels. With a force of such size he set out to the aid of the Geloans, and when
     he drew near the city, he pitched camp by the sea. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For his
     intent was not to divide his army but to use the same base for the fighting by land as well as
     by sea; and with his light armed troops he engaged the enemy and did not allow them to forage
     over the countryside, while with his cavalry and ships he attempted to deprive the
     Carthaginians of the supplies which they got from the territory of which they were masters.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now for twenty days they were inactive, doing nothing worthy
     of mention. But after this Dionysius divided his infantry into three groups, and one division,
     which he formed of the Sicilian Greeks, he ordered to advance against the entrenched camp of
     their adversaries with the city on their left flank; the second division, which he formed of
     allies, he commanded to drive along the shore with the city on their right; and he himself with
     the contingent of mercenaries advanced through the city against the place where the
     Carthaginian engines of war were stationed. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And to the cavalry
     he gave orders that, as soon as they saw the infantry advancing, they should cross the river
     and overrun the plain, and if they should see their comrades winning, they should join in the
     fighting, but in case they were losing, they should receive any who were in distress; and to
     the troops on the ships his orders were, so soon as the Italian Greeks made their attack, to
     sail against the camp of the enemy. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="110">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the fleet carried out their orders
     at the proper time, the Carthaginians rushed to the aid of that sector in an attempt to keep
     back the attackers disembarking from the ships; and in fact that portion of the camp which the
     Carthaginians occupied was unfortified, all the part which lay along the beach. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And at this very time the Italian Greeks, who had covered the entire
     distance along the sea, attacked the camp of the Carthaginians, having found that most of the
     defenders had gone to give aid against the ships, and putting to flight the troops which had
     been left behind at this place, they forced their way into the encampment. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>At this turn of affairs the Carthaginians, turning about with the
     greater part of their troops, after a sustained fight, thrust out with difficulty the men who
     had forced their way within the trench. The Italian Greeks, overcome by the multitude of the
     barbarians, encountered as they withdrew the acute angle of the palisade and no help came to
     them; <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>for the Sicilian Greeks, advancing through the plain,
     came too late and the mercenaries with Dionysius encountered difficulties in making their way
     through the streets of the city and thus were unable to make such haste as they had planned.
     The Geloans, advancing for some distance from the city, gave aid to the Italian Greeks over
     only a short space of the area, since they were afraid to abandon the guarding of the walls,
     and as a result they were too late to be of any assistance. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />The Iberians and Campanians, who were serving in the army of the Carthaginians, pressing hard
     upon the Italian Greeks, slew more than a thousand of them. But since the crews of the ships
     held back the pursuers with showers of arrows, the rest of them got back in safety to the city.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In the other part the Sicilian Greeks, who had engaged the
     Libyans who opposed them, slew great numbers of them and pursued the rest into the encampment;
     but when the Iberians and Campanians and, besides, the Carthaginians came up to the aid of the
     Libyans, they withdrew to the city, having lost some six hundred men. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>And the cavalry, when they saw the defeat of their comrades, likewise withdrew to the
     city, since the enemy pressed hard upon them. Dionysius, having barely got through the city,
     found his army defeated and for the time being withdrew within the walls. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="111">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After
     this Dionysius called a meeting of his friends and took counsel regarding the war. When they
     all said that his position was unfavourable for a decisive battle with the enemy, he dispatched
     a herald toward evening to arrange for the taking up of the dead on the next day, and about the
     first watch of the night he sent out of the city the mass of the people, while he himself set
     out about the middle of the night, leaving behind some two thousand of his light-armed troops.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>These had been given orders to keep fires burning through the
     entire night and to make an uproar in order to cause the Carthaginians to believe that he was
     still in the city. Now these troops, as the day was beginning to break, set out to join
     Dionysius, and the Carthaginians, on learning what had taken place, moved their quarters into
     the city and plundered what had been left of the contents of the dwellings. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Dionysius arrived at Camarina, he
     compelled the residents of that city also to depart with their children and wives to Syracuse.
     And since their fear admitted of no delay, some gathered together silver and gold and whatever
     could be easily carried, while others fled with only their parents and infant children, paying
     no attention to valuables; and some, who were aged or suffering from illness, were left behind
     because they had no relatives or friends, since the Carthaginians were expected to arrive
     almost immediately. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For the fate that had befallen Selinus and
     Himera and Acragas<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chaps. 57 f., 62, and 90 respectively.</note> as well terrified the populace, all of whom felt as if they had actually
     been eyewitnesses of the savagery of the Carthaginians. For among them there was no sparing
     their captives, but they were without compassion for the victims of Fortune of whom they would
     crucify some and upon others inflict unbearable outrages. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />Nevertheless, now that two cities had been driven into exile, the countryside teemed with
     women and children and the rabble in general. And when the soldiers witnessed these conditions,
     they were not only enraged against Dionysius but also filled with pity at the lot of the
     unfortunate victims; <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>for they saw free-born boys and maidens
     of marriageable years rushing pell-mell along the road in a manner improper for their age,
     since the stress of the moment had done away with the dignity and respect which are shown
     before strangers. Similarly they sympathized also with the elderly, as they watched them being
     forced to push onward beyond their strength while trying to keep up with those in the prime of
     life. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="112">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It was for these reasons that the hatred against Dionysius was flaring up,
     since men assumed that he had so acted from this definite plan: by using the dread of the
     Carthaginians to be lord of the remaining cities of Sicily without risk. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For they reckoned up his delay in bringing aid<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">To Gela.</note>; the fact that none of his mercenaries had fallen; that he
     had retreated without reason, since he had suffered no serious reverse; and, most important of
     all, that not a single one of the Carthaginians had pursued them. Consequently, for those who
     before this were eager to seize an opportunity to revolt, all things, as if by the
     foreknowledge of the gods, were working toward the overthrow of the tyrannical power.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the Italian Greeks,
     deserting Dionysius, made their way home through the interior of the island, and the Syracusan
     cavalry at first kept watch in the hope that they might be able to slay the tyrant along the
     road; but when they saw that the mercenaries were not deserting him, they rode off with one
     accord to Syracuse. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And finding the guards of the
      dockyards<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Where Dionysius had taken up his residence (chap. 96.2).</note> knew nothing of the events at Gela, they entered these without hindrance,
     plundered the house of Dionysius which was filled with silver and gold and all other costly
     things, and seizing his wife left her so ill-used<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >According to Plutarch (<bibl n="Plut. Dio 3.1">Plut. Dion 3.1</bibl>), she subsequently committed suicide.</note> as to ensure the tyrant's keeping his anger fiercely alive, acting
     as they did in the belief that the vengeance they wreaked on Dionysius' wife would be the
     surest guarantee of their holding by each other in their attack upon him. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And Dionysius, guessing while on the way what had taken place, picked
     out the most trustworthy of his cavalry and infantry, with whom he pressed toward the city
     without checking speed; for he reasoned that he could overcome the cavalry by no other means
     than by speedy action, and he acted accordingly. For if he should make his arrival even more of
     a surprise than theirs had been, he had hope that he would easily carry out his design; and
     that is what happened. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For the cavalry assumed that Dionysius
     would now neither return to Syracuse nor remain with his army; consequently, in the belief that
     they had carried out their design, they said that he had pretended that in leaving Gela he was
     giving the slip to the Carthaginians whereas the truth in fact was that he had given the slip
     to the Syracusans. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="113">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dionysius covered a distance of four hundred stades<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">About 46 miles.</note> and arrived at the gates of Achradine
     about the middle of the night with a hundred cavalry and six hundred infantry, and finding the
     gate closed, he piled upon it reeds brought from the marshes such as the Syracusans are
     accustomed to use to bind their stucco. While the gates were being burned down, he gathered to
     his troops the laggards. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And when the fire had consumed the
     gates, Dionysius with his followers made their way through Achradine, and the stoutest soldiers
     among the cavalry, when they heard what had happened, without waiting for the main body, and
     although they were very few in number, rushed forth at once to aid in the resistance. They were
     gathered in the market-place, and there they were surrounded by the mercenaries and shot down
     to a man. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Then Dionysius, ranging through the city, slew any
     who came out here and there to resist him, and entering the houses of those who were hostile
     toward him, some of them he killed and others he banished from the city. The main body of the
     cavalry which was left fled from the city and occupied Aetne, as it is now called. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At daybreak the main body of the mercenaries and the army of the
     Sicilian Greeks arrived at Syracuse, but the Geloans and Camarinaeans, who were at odds with
     Dionysius, left him and departed to Leontini. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="114">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>. . .<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Here there was probably an account of the plague which visited the Carthaginian army.</note> Consequently Himilcar, acting under the stress of circumstances,
     dispatched a herald to Syracuse urging the vanquished to make up their differences. Dionysius
     was glad to comply and they concluded peace on the following terms: To the Carthaginians shall
     belong, together with their original colonists, the Elymi and Sicani; the inhabitants of
     Selinus, Acragas, and Himera as well as those of Gela and Camarina may dwell in their cities,
     which shall be unfortified, but shall pay tribute to the Carthaginians; the inhabitants of
     Leontini and Messene and the Siceli shall all live under laws of their own making, and the
     Syracusans shall be subject to Dionysius; and whatever captives and ships are held shall be
     returned to those who lost them. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />As soon as this treaty had been concluded, the Carthaginians sailed off to Libya, having lost
     more than half their soldiers from the plague; but the pestilence continued to rage no less in

     struck down. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But for our part,

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />All men, perhaps naturally, are disinclined to listen to obloquies that are uttered against
     them. Indeed even those whose evil-doing is in every respect so manifest that it cannot even be
     denied, none the less deeply resent it when they are the objects of censure and endeavour to
     make a reply to the accusation. Consequently all men should take every possible care not to
     commit any evil deed, and those especially who aspire to leadership or have been favoured by
     some striking gift of Fortune; <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>for since the life of such men
     is in all things an open book because of their distinction, it cannot conceal its own unwisdom.
     Let no man, therefore, who has gained some kind of pre-eminence, cherish the hope that, if he
     commits great crimes, he will for all time escape notice and go uncensured. For even if during
     his own lifetime he eludes the sentence of rebuke, let him expect that at a later time Truth
     will find him out, frankly proclaiming abroad matters long hidden from mention. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>It is, therefore, a hard fate for wicked men that at their death they
     leave to posterity an undying image, so to speak, of their entire life; for even if those
     things that follow after death do not concern us, as certain philosophers keep chanting,
     nevertheless the life which has preceded death becomes far worse throughout all time for the
     evil memory that it enjoys. Manifest examples of this may be found by those who read the

     men who became tyrants from their own lust of gain, not only involved their native land in

     of their own disgrace. The Lacedaemonians, after winning for themselves the undisputed
     sovereignty of Greece, were shorn of it from the moment when they sought to carry out unjust
     projects at the expense of their allies. For the superiority of those who enjoy leadership is

     their subjects. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Similarly Dionysius, the tyrant of the
     Syracusans, although he has been the most fortunate of such rulers, was incessantly plotted
     against while alive, was compelled by fear to wear an iron corselet under his tunic, and has

     those who were bent on oligarchy asserted that the ancient constitution should be revived, in

     co-operation, appointed Thorax the Spartan harmost<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >Commander of the Spartan garrison and governor of the city.</note> of Samos, and put in
     himself at the Peiraeus with one hundred ships. Calling an assembly of the Athenians, he
     advised them to choose thirty men to head the government and to manage all the affairs of the
     state. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And when Theramenes opposed him and read to him the
     terms of the peace, which agreed that they should enjoy the government of their fathers, and
     declared that it would be a terrible thing if they should be robbed of their freedom contrary
     to the oaths, Lysander stated that the terms of peace had been broken by the Athenians, since,
     he asserted, they had destroyed the walls later than the days of grace agreed upon. He also
     invoked the direst threats against Theramenes, saying that he would have him put to death if he
     did not stop opposing the Lacedaemonians. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Consequently
     Theramenes and the people, being struck with terror, were compelled to dissolve the democracy
     by a show of hands. Accordingly thirty men were elected with power to manage the affairs of the
     state, as directors ostensibly but tyrants in fact. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The people, observing the fair dealing of
     Theramenes and believing that his honourable principles would act to some extent to check the
     encroachments of the leaders, elected him also as one of the thirty officials. It was the duty
     of those selected to appoint both a Council and the other magistrates and to draw up laws in
     accordance with which they were to administer the state. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now
     they kept postponing the drawing up of laws, always putting forth fine-sounding excuses, but a
     Council and the other magistrates they appointed from their personal friends, so that these
     bore the name indeed of magistrates but actually were underlings of the Thirty. At first they
     brought to trial the lowest elements of the city and condemned them to death; and thus far the
     most honourable citizens approved of their actions. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But after
     this, desiring to commit acts more violent and lawless, they asked the Lacedaemonians for a
     garrison, saying that they were going to establish a form of government that would serve the
     interests of the Lacedaemonians. For they realized that they would be unable to accomplish
     murders without foreign armed aid, since all men, they knew, would unite to support the common
     security. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When the Lacedaemonians sent a garrison and
     Callibius to command it, the Thirty won the commander over by bribes and other accommodations.
     Then, choosing out from the rich such men as suited their ends, they proceeded to arrest them
     as revolutionaries, put them to death, and confiscated their possessions. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When Theramenes opposed his colleagues and threatened to join the ranks
     of those who claimed the right to be secure, the Thirty called a meeting of the Council.
     Critias was their spokesman, and in a long speech accused Theramenes of betraying this
     government of which he was a voluntary member; but Theramenes in his reply cleared himself of
     the several charges and gained the sympathy of the entire Council.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The speeches of Critias and Theramenes are given in <bibl n="Xen. Hell.

     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Critias, fearing that Theramenes might overthrow the
     oligarchy, threw about him a band of soldiers with drawn swords. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>They were going to arrest him, but, forestalling them, Theramenes leaped up to the
     altar of Hestia of the Council Chamber, crying out, "I flee for refuge to the gods, not with
     the thought that I shall be saved, but to make sure that my slayers will involve themselves in
     an act of impiety against the gods." </p>

     forward and were dragging him off, Theramenes bore his bad fortune with a noble spirit, since
     indeed he had had no little acquaintance with philosophy in company with Socrates; the
     multitude, however, in general mourned the ill-fortune of Theramenes, but had not the courage
     to come to his aid since a strong armed guard stood around him. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Now Socrates the philosopher and two of his intimates ran forward and endeavoured to hinder
     the attendants. But Theramenes entreated them to do nothing of the kind; he appreciated, he
     said, their friendship and bravery, but as for himself, it would be the greatest grief if he
     should be the cause of the death of those who were so intimately associated with him.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Socrates and his helpers, since they had no aid from anyone
     else and saw the intransigence of those in authority increasing, made no move. Then those who
     had received their orders dragged Theramenes from the altar and hustled him through the centre
     of the market-place to his execution; <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>and the populace,
     terror-stricken at the arms of the garrison, were filled with pity for the unfortunate man and
     shed tears, not only over his fate but also over their own slavery. For all the common sort,
     when they saw a man of such virtue as Theramenes treated with such contumely, had concluded
     that they in their weakness would be sacrificed without a thought. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the death of Theramenes the Thirty drew up a list
     of the wealthy, lodged false charges against them, put them to death, and seized their estates.
     They slew even Niceratus, the son of Nicias who had commanded the campaign against the
     Syracusans, a man who had conducted himself toward all men with fairness and humanity, and who
     was perhaps first of all Athenians in wealth and reputation. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />It came about, therefore, that every house was filled with pity for the end of the man, as
     fond thoughts due to their memory of his honest ways provoked them to tears. Nevertheless, the
     tyrants did not cease from their lawless conduct; rather their madness became so much the more
     acute that of the metics they slaughtered sixty of the wealthiest in order to gain possession
     of their property, and as for the citizens, since they were being killed daily, the well-to-do
     among them fled from the city almost to a man. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>They also slew
      Autolycus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">A pancratiast (boxer and wrestler) whom

     having no desire that the Athenians should ever gain strength, were delighted and made their
     attitude clear; for they voted that the Athenian exiles should be delivered up to the Thirty
     from all over Greece and that anyone who attempted to prevent this should be liable to a fine
     of five talents. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Though this decree was shocking, all the rest
     of the cities, dismayed at the power of the Spartans, obeyed it, with the exception of the
     Argives who, hating as they did the cruelty of the Lacedaemonians and pitying the hard lot of
     the unfortunate, were the first to receive the exiles in a spirit of humanity. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Also the Thebans voted that anyone who witnessed an exile being led off

<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In
     Sicily, Dionysius, the tyrant of the Siceli,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">"Siceli" must be an error for "Sicilian Greeks" or "Syracusans."</note> after concluding peace with the
     Carthaginians, planned to busy himself more with the strengthening of his tyranny; for he
     assumed that the Syracusans, now that they were relieved of the war, would have plenty of time
     to seek after the recovery of their liberty. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And, perceiving
     that the Island<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Ortygia.</note> was the strongest section
     of the city and could be easily defended, he divided it from the rest of the city by an
     expensive wall, and in this he set high towers at close intervals, while before it he built
     places of business and stoas capable of accommodating a multitude of the populace. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He also constructed on the Island at great expense a fortified acropolis
     as a place of refuge in case of immediate need, and within its wall he enclosed the dockyards
     which are connected with the small harbour that is known as Laccium. The dockyards could
     accommodate sixty triremes and had an entrance that was closed off, through which only one ship
     could enter at a time. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>As for the territory of Syracuse, he
     picked out the best of it and distributed it in gifts to his friends as well as to higher
     officers, and divided the rest of it in equal portions both to aliens and to citizens,
     including under the name of citizens the manumitted slaves whom he designated as New Citizens.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>He also distributed the dwellings among the common people,
     except those on the island, which he gave to his friends and the mercenaries.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Dionysius thought that he had now organized his tyranny properly, he
     led forth his army against the Siceli, being eager to bring all the independent peoples under
     his control, and the Siceli in particular, because of their previous alliance with the
     Carthaginians. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Accordingly he advanced against the city of the
     Herbessini and made preparations for its siege. But the Syracusans who were in the army, now
     that they had arms in their hands, began to gather in groups and upbraid each other that they
     had not joined with the cavalry in overthrowing the tyrant.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 13.112.</note> The man appointed by Dionysius to command the men at
     first warned one of those who were freespoken, and when the man retorted, stepped boldly up to
     him to give him a blow. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The soldiers, in anger at this, slew
     the commander, whose name was Doricus, and, crying to the citizens to strike for their freedom,
     sent for the cavalry from Aetne; for the cavalry, who had been banished at the beginning of the
     tyranny, occupied this outpost. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="8">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dionysius, terror-stricken at the revolt of the
     Syracusans, broke off the siege and hastened to Syracuse, being eager to secure the city. Upon
     his flight those who had revolted chose as generals the men who had slain the commander, and
     gathering to their number the cavalry from Aetne, they pitched a camp facing the tyrant on the
     height called Epipolae, and blocked his passage to the countryside. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And they at once dispatched ambassadors to the Messenians and the Rhegians, urging
     these people to join in the bid for freedom by action at sea; for it had been the practice of
     these cities at this time to man no less than eighty triremes. These triremes the cities
     dispatched at that time to the Syracusans, being eager to support them in the cause of freedom.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The revolters also proclaimed a large reward to any who would
     slay the tyrant and promised citizenship to any mercenaries who would come over to them. They
     also constructed engines of war with which to shatter and destroy the walls, launched daily
     assaults upon the Island, and kindly received any of the mercenaries who came over to them.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dionysius, being shut off as
     he now was from access to the countryside and constantly being abandoned by the mercenaries,
     gathered together his friends to counsel with them on the situation; for he had so completely
     despaired of maintaining his tyrannical power that he no longer was studying how to defeat the
     Syracusans but rather how to meet death in such a way as to end his rule not altogether
     ingloriously. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Now Heloris, one of his friends, or, as some
     say, his adopted father, declared to him, "Tyranny is a fair winding-sheet"; but Polyxenus, his
     brother-in-law, advised him to use his swiftest horse and ride off into the domain of the
     Carthaginians to the Campanians, whom Himilcon had left behind to guard the districts of
     Sicily. Philistus, however, who composed his history after these events, declared in opposition
     to Polyxenus that it was not fitting to dash from the tyranny on a galloping horse but to be
     cast out, dragged by the leg.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. <bibl n="Plut. Dio 35.5" >Plut. Dion 35.5</bibl>.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Dionysius agreed with Philistus and decided to submit to
     anything rather than abandon the throne of his free will. Consequently he sent ambassadors to
     those in revolt and urged them to allow him and his companions to leave the city, while he
     secretly dispatched messengers to the Campanians and promised them any price they should ask
     for the duration of the siege. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the events we have described the Syracusans, having
     given the tyrant permission to sail away with five ships, took matters with rather less
     concern; the cavalry, since they were of no use in the siege, they discharged, while as for the
     infantry, most of them roved off into the countryside, assuming that the tyranny was already at
     an end. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Campanians, being elated at the promises they had
     received, first of all came to Agyrium, and leaving their baggage there with Agyris, the ruler
     of the city, they set forth unencumbered for Syracuse, being in number twelve hundred cavalry.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Completing the journey in quick time, they came upon the
     Syracusans unexpectedly and, slaying many of them, they forced their way through to Dionysius.
     At this same time three hundred mercenaries had also landed to aid the tyrant, so that his
     hopes revived. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Syracusans, as the despotic power again
     gathered strength, were at odds among themselves, some maintaining that they should remain and
     continue the siege and others that they should disband their forces and abandon the city.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As soon as Dionysius learned
     of this, he led his army out against them, and falling on them while they were disordered, he
     easily routed them near the New City, as it is called. Not many of them, however, were slain,
     since Dionysius, riding among his men, stopped them from killing the fugitives. The Syracusans
     were forthwith scattered over the countryside, but a little later more than seven thousand of
     them were gathered with the cavalry at Aetne. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Dionysius, after
     burying the Syracusans who had fallen, dispatched ambassadors to Aetne, asking the exiles to
     accept terms and return to their native land, and giving his pledged word that he would not
     bear enmity against them. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Now certain of them, who had left
     behind children and wives, felt compelled to accept the offer; but the rest replied, when the
     ambassadors cited the benefaction Dionysius had performed in the burial of the dead, that he
     deserved the same favour, and they prayed to the gods that they might, the sooner the better,
     see him obtain it. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>These men, accordingly, who would by no
     means put any trust in the tyrant, remained in Aetne, watching for an opportunity against him.
     Dionysius treated with humanity the exiles who returned, wishing to encourage the rest to
     return to their native land too. To the Campanians he awarded the gifts that were due and then
     dispatched them from the city, having regard to their fickleness. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>These made their way to Entella and persuaded the men of the city to receive them as
     fellow-inhabitants; then they fell upon them by night, slew the men of military age, married
     the wives of the men with whom they had broken faith, and possessed themselves of the city.

     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>After these magistrates had taken office, the Byzantines were

     mutual differences, they asked the Lacedaemonians for a general. The Spartans, accordingly,
     sent them Clearchus to bring order to the affairs of the city; <milestone unit="section" n="3" />and he, after being entrusted with supreme authority, and having gathered a large body of
     mercenaries, was no longer their president but their tyrant. First of all, he invited their
     chief magistrates to attend a festival of some kind and put them to death, and after this,
     since there was no government in the city, he seized a group of thirty prominent Byzantines,
     put a cord about their necks, and strangled them to death. After appropriating for himself the
     property of those he had slain, he also picked out the wealthy among the rest of the citizens,
     and launching false charges against them, he put some to death and drove others into exile.
     Having thus acquired a large amount of money and assembled a great body of mercenaries, he made

     when he paid no heed to their requests, they sent an army against him under the command of
     Panthoedas. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Clearchus, on learning of his approach,
     transferred his army to Selymbria, being master also of this city, for he assumed that after
     the many crimes he had committed against the Byzantines, he would have as enemies not only the
     Lacedaemonians, but also the inhabitants of the city. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />Consequently, having decided that Selymbria would be a safer base for the war, he removed
     both his treasure and his army to that place. When he learned that the Lacedaemonians were

     place called Porus. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The struggle lasted a long while, but the
     Lacedaemonians fought splendidly and the forces of the tyrant were destroyed. Clearchus with a
     few companions was at first shut up in Selymbria and besieged there, but later he was fearful
     and slipped away by night, and crossed over to Ionia, where he became intimate with Cyrus, the

     attendants of the oracle, despite the large sum he promised them, he opened negotiations on the
     same matter with the priestesses of the oracle of Dodone, through a certain Pherecrates, who
     was a native of Apollonia and intimate with the attendants of the shrine. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Meeting with no success, he made a
     journey to Cyrene, offering as his reason payment of vows to Ammon,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Zeus-Ammon, whose shrine was in the Oasis of Siwah.</note> but actually for
     the purpose of bribing the oracle; and he took with him a great sum of money with which he
     hoped to win over the attendants of the shrine. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And in fact
     Libys, the king of those regions, was a guest-friend of his father, and it so happened that
     Lysander's brother had been named Libys by reason of the friendship with the king. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>With the king's help, then, and the money he brought, he hoped to win
     them, but not only did he fail of his design, but the overseers of the oracle sent ambassadors
     to lay charges against Lysander for his effort to bribe the oracle. When Lysander arrived at
     Lacedaemon, a trial was proposed, but he presented a persuasive defence of his conduct.
      <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Now at that time the Lacedaemonians knew nothing of
     Lysander's purpose to abolish the kings in line of descent from Heracles; but some time later,
     after his death, when some documents were being searched for in his house, they found a speech,
     composed at great expense,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Or more likely, "composed with great care".</note> which he had prepared to deliver to the people, to persuade them that the

     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>namely, Naxos, Catane, and Leontini. He was eager to be lord
     of them because they lay on the borders of Syracuse and possessed many advantages for further
     increase of his tyrannical power. First of all, then, he encamped near Aetne and won the
     fortress, the exiles there being no match for an army of such size; <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>and after this he advanced to Leontini and pitched his camp near the city along the
     river Teria. Then he at first led out his army in battle-order and dispatched a herald to the
     Leontines, commanding them to surrender the city and believing that he had struck terror into
     the inhabitants. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But when the Leontines paid no attention to
     him and had made every preparation to withstand a siege, Dionysius, having no engines of war,
     gave up the siege for the time being, but plundered their entire territory. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>From there he set out against the Siceli, pretending that he was
     engaging in war against them in order that the Catanians and the Naxians might become slacker
     in the defence of their cities. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And while he was tarrying in
     the neighbourhood of Enna, he persuaded Aeimnestus, a native of the city, to make a bid for
     tyranny, promising to aid him in the undertaking. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>But when
     Aeimnestus had succeeded in his design and then did not admit Dionysius into the city,
     Dionysius in anger changed sides and urged the Ennaeans to overthrow the tyrant. These streamed
     into the market-place with their arms, contending for their freedom, and the city was filled
     with tumult. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Dionysius, on learning of the strife, took his
     light-armed troops, speedily broke through an unoccupied place into the city, seized
     Aeimnestus, and handed him over to the Ennaeans to be punished. He himself, refraining from all
     injustice, departed from the city. This he did, not so much because he had regard for right as
     because he wanted to encourage the other cities to put faith in him. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="15">

     set out to the city of the Herbitaeans and attempted to ravage it. But accomplishing nothing,
     he made peace with them and led his army to Catane, for Arcesilaus, the general of the
     Catanians, had offered to betray the city to him. Consequently, being admitted by Arcesilaus
     about midnight, he became master of Catane. After taking their arms from the citizens, he
     placed an adequate garrison in the city. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>After this Procles,
     the commander of the Naxians, on being won over by great promises, delivered over his native
     city to Dionysius, who, after paying the promised gifts to the traitor and granting him his
     kinsmen, sold the inhabitants into slavery, turned their property over to the soldiers to
     plunder, and razed the walls and the dwellings. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He also meted
     out a similar treatment to the Catanians, selling the captives he took as booty in Syracuse.
     Now the territory of the Naxians he gave as a present to the neighbouring Siceli and granted to
     the Campanians the city of the Catanians as their dwelling-place. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After this he advanced to Leontini with his entire armed strength and laid siege to the
     city, and sending ambassadors to the inhabitants, he ordered them to hand over their city and
     enjoy citizenship in Syracuse. The Leontines, expecting that they would receive no help and
     reflecting on the fate of the Naxians and Catanians, were struck with terror in fear that they
     would suffer the same misfortune. Consequently, yielding to the exigency of the moment, they

     had streamed into the city in connection with the war against Dionysius; and many of the
     destitute among the Herbitaeans had promised him to join in the colony. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Consequently, taking the multitude of refugees, he occupied a hill lying

     masters of the city, resettled the inhabitants some seven stades from the sea; and for some

     citizenship and attached their territory to Boeotia. <milestone unit="section" n="4" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While these events were taking place, the Lacedaemonians
     brought a number of charges against the Eleians, the most serious being that they had prevented
     Agis, their king, from offering sacrifices to the god<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >Olympian Zeus.</note> and that they had not allowed the Lacedaemonians to complete in the
     Olympic Games. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently, having decided to wage war on the
     Eleians, they dispatched ten ambassadors to them, ordering them, in the first place, to allow
     their subject cities to be independent, and after that they demanded of them their quota of the
     cost of the war against the Athenians. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>This they did in quest
     of specious pretexts for themselves and of plausible openings for war. When the Eleians not
     only paid no heed to them but even accused them besides of enslaving the Greeks, they
     dispatched Pausanias, the other of their two kings, against them with four thousand soldiers.
      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>He was accompanied by many soldiers also from practically all
     the allies except the Boeotians and Corinthians. They, being offended by the proceedings of the

      <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Moving thence, he straightway encamped near Pylus and took

     make war upon the Carthaginians; but being not yet sufficiently prepared, he concealed this
     purpose of his while making the necessary preparations for the coming encounters. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And realizing that in the war with Athens the city had been blocked off
     by a wall that ran from the sea to the sea,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">See Book 13.7.</note> he took care that he should never, where caught at a similar disadvantage, be cut

     so steep that access is hardly to be won from the outside. Wishing to complete the building of
     the walls rapidly, he gathered the peasants from the countryside, from whom he selected some
     sixty thousand capable men and parcelled out to them the space to be walled. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For each stade he appointed a master-builder and for each plethron<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The sixth of a stade, roughly one hundred feet.</note> a
     mason, and the labourers from the common people assigned to the task numbered two hundred for
     each plethron. Besides these, other workers, a multitude in number, quarried out the rough
     stone, and six thousand yoke of oxen brought it to the appointed place. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And the united labour of so many workers struck the watchers with great
     amazement, since all were zealous to complete the task assigned them. For Dionysius, in order
     to excite the enthusiasm of the multitude, offered valuable gifts to such as finished first,
     special ones for the master-builders, and still others for the masons and in turn for the
     common labourers; and he in person, together with his friends, oversaw the work through all the
     days required, visiting every section and ever lending a hand to the toilers. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Speaking generally, he laid aside the dignity of his office and reduced
     himself to the ranks. Putting his hands to the hardest tasks, he endured the same toil as the
     other workers, so that great rivalry was engendered and some added even a part of the night to
     the day's labour, such eagerness had infected the multitude for the task. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>As a result, contrary to expectation, the wall was brought to completion
     in twenty days. It was thirty stades in length and of corresponding height, and the added
     strength of the wall made it impregnable to assault; for there were lofty towers at frequent
     intervals and it was constructed of stones four feet long and carefully joined. </p>

     the Lacedaemonians to recall to their minds the services he had rendered in their war against
     the Athenians and to urge them to join him as allies. The Lacedaemonians, thinking that the war
     would be to their advantage, decided to give aid to Cyrus and forthwith sent ambassadors to

     commander of the barbarian fleet was Tamos, who had fifty triremes which had been fitted out at

     providing for the coming occasion, he curried favour with the troops by affability and by
     providing abundant supplies of provisions. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="20">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After Cyrus had traversed Lydia and
     Phrygia as well as the regions bordering on Cappadocia, he arrived at the boundaries of Cilicia
     and the entrance at the Cilician Gates. This pass is narrow and precipitous, twenty stades in
     length, and bordering it on both sides are exceedingly high and inaccessible mountains; and
     walls stretch down on each side from the mountains as far as the roadway, where gates have been
     built across it. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Leading his army through these gates, Cyrus
     entered a plain which in beauty yields to no plain in Asia, and through which he advanced to
     Tarsus, the largest city of Cilicia, which he speedily mastered. When Syennesis, the lord of
     Cilicia, heard of the great size of the hostile army, he was at a great loss, since he was no
     match for it in battle. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When he was summoned to Cyrus'
     presence and had been given pledges, he went to him, and on learning the truth about the war he
     agreed to join him as an ally against Artaxerxes; and he sent one of his two sons along with
     Cyrus, giving him also a strong contingent of Cilicians for his army. For Syennesis, being by
     nature unscrupulous and having adjusted himself to the uncertainty of Fortune, had dispatched
     his other son secretly to the King to reveal to him the armaments that had been gathered
     against him and to assure him that he took the part of Cyrus out of necessity, but that he was
     still faithful to the King and, when the opportunity arose, would desert Cyrus and join the
     army of the King. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Cyrus rested
     his army twenty days in Tarsus, and after this, when he would have resumed the march, the
     troops suspected that the campaign was against Artaxerxes. And as each man reckoned up the
     length of the distances entailed and the multitude of hostile peoples through whom they would
     have to pass, he was filled with the deepest anxiety; for the word had got about that it was a
     four months' march for an army to Bactria and that a force of more than four hundred thousand
     soldiers had been mustered for the King. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently the
     soldiers became most fearful and vexed, and in anger at their commanders they attempted to kill
     them on the ground that the commanders had betrayed them. But when Cyrus entreated one and all
     of them and assured them that he was leading the army, not against Artaxerxes, but against a
     certain satrap of Syria, the soldiers yielded, and when they had received an increase in pay,
     they resumed their former loyalty to him. </p>

     Cyrus, and reported the goodwill of the Spartans toward him; and they disembarked and turned
     over to him the eight hundred infantry under the command of Cheirisophus. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The pretence was that these mercenaries were sent by the friends of
     Cyrus, but in fact everything was done with the consent of the ephors. The Lacedaemonians had
     not yet openly entered upon the war, but were concealing their purpose, awaiting the turn of
     the war.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Cyrus set out with his army, travelling toward Syria,

     was greatly concerned lest troops might have occupied them before his arrival. The place is
     narrow and precipitous in character, so that it can be easily guarded by few troops. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For two mountains lie against each other, the one jagged and with great
     crags, and the other beginning right at the road itself, and it is the largest in those
     regions, bearing the name Amanus and extending along Phoenicia; and the space between the
     mountains, some three stades in length, has walls running its whole length and gates closed to
     make a narrow passage. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Now, after passing through the Gates
     without a fight, Cyrus sent off that part of the fleet that was still with him to make the
     return voyage to Ephesus, since it was of no further use to him now that he would be travelling
     inland. After a march of twenty days he arrived at the city of Thapsacus, which lies on the
     Euphrates River. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Here he remained five days, and after winning
     the army to himself both by abundant supplies and by booty from foraging, he summoned it to an
     assembly and disclosed the truth about his campaign. When the soldiers received his words
     unfavourably, he besought them, one and all, not to leave him in the lurch, promising, besides
     other great rewards, that, when they came to Babylon, he would give every man of them five
     minas of silver.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Some ninety dollars.</note>The soldiers,
     accordingly, soaring in their expectations, were prevailed upon to follow him. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>When Cyrus crossed the Euphrates with his army, he pressed on the way

<div2 type="chapter" n="22">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>King Artaxerxes had learned some time before from Pharnabazus that Cyrus

     delayed because of the remoteness of those regions, he set out to meet Cyrus with the army that
     had been assembled. He had in all not less than four hundred thousand soldiers, including
     cavalry, as Ephorus states. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When he arrived on the plain of
     Babylonia, he pitched a camp beside the Euphrates, intending to leave his baggage in it; for he
     had learned that the enemy was not far distant and he was apprehensive of their reckless
     daring. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Accordingly he dug a trench sixty feet wide and ten
     deep and encircled the camp with the baggage-waggons of his train like a wall. Having left
     behind in the camp the baggage and the attendants who were of no use in the battle, he
     appointed an adequate guard for it, and leading forward in person his army unencumbered, he
     advanced to meet the enemy which was near at hand. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Cyrus saw the King's army advancing, he at once drew up his own force
     in battle order. The right wing, which rested on the Euphrates, was held by infantry composed
     of Lacedaemonians and some of the mercenaries, all under the command of Clearchus the
     Lacedaemonian, and helping him in the fight were the cavalry brought from Paphlagonia, more
     than a thousand. The left wing was held by the troops from Phrygia and Lydia and about a
     thousand of the cavalry, under the command of Aridaeus. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Cyrus
     himself had taken a station in the centre of the battle-line, together with the choicest troops
     gathered from Persians and the other barbarians, about ten thousand strong; and leading the van
     before him were the finest-equipped cavalry, a thousand, armed with Greek breastplates and
     swords. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Artaxerxes stationed before the length of his

     very first contact struck terror into the opposing barbarians both by the splendour of their
     arms and by the skill they displayed. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For the barbarians were
     protected by small shields and their divisions were for the most part equipped with light arms;
     and, furthermore, they were without trial in the perils of war, whereas the Greeks had been in
     constant battle by reason of the length of the Peloponnesian War and were far superior in
     experience. Consequently they straightway put their opponents to flight, pushed after them in
     pursuit, and slew many of the barbarians. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In the centre of the
     lines, it so happened, were stationed both the men who were contending for the kingship.
     Consequently, becoming aware of this fact, they made at each other, being eagerly desirous of
     deciding the issue of the battle by their own hands; for Fortune, it appears, brought the
     rivalry of the brothers over the throne to culmination in a duel as if in imitation of that
     ancient rash combat of Eteocles and Polyneices so celebrated in tragedy.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The fullest account preserved to us is in Aeschylus, <title>The Seven against

     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Cyrus was the first to hurl his javelin from a distance, and
     striking the King, brought him to the ground; but the King's attendants speedily snatched him
     away and carried him out of the battle. Tissaphernes, a Persian noble, now succeeded to the
     supreme command held by the King, and not only rallied the troops but fought himself in
     splendid fashion; and retrieving the reverse involved in the wounding of the King and arriving
     on the scene everywhere with his elite troops, he slew great numbers of the enemy, so that his
     presence was conspicuous from afar. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Cyrus, being elated by the
     success of his forces, rushed boldly into the midst of the enemy and at first slew numbers of
     them as he set no bounds to his daring; but later, as he fought too imprudently, he was struck
     by a common Persian and fell mortally wounded. Upon his death the King's soldiers gained
     confidence for the battle and in the end, by virtue of numbers and daring, wore down their
     opponents. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="24">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On the other wing Aridaeus, who was second in command to Cyrus, at first
     withstood stoutly the charge of the barbarians, but later, since he was being encircled by the
     far-extended line of the enemy and had learned of Cyrus' death, he turned in flight with the
     soldiers under his command to one of the stations where he had once stopped, which was not
     unsuited as a place for retreat. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Clearchus, when he observed
     that both the centre of his allies and the other parts as well had been routed, stopped his
     pursuit, and calling back the soldiers, set them in order; for he feared that if the entire
     army should turn on the Greeks, they would be surrounded and slain to a man. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The King's troops, after they had put their opponents to flight, first
     plundered Cyrus' baggage-train and then, when night had come on, gathered in force and set upon
     the Greeks; but when the Greeks met the attack valiantly, the barbarians withstood them only a
     short while and after a little turned in flight, being overcome by their deeds of valour and
     skill. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The troops of Clearchus, when they had slain great
     numbers of the barbarians, since it was already night, returned to the battlefield and set up a
     trophy, and about the second watch got safe to their camp. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />Such was the outcome of the battle, and of the army of the King more than fifteen thousand
     were slain, most of whom fell at the hands of the Lacedaemonians and mercenaries under the
     command of Clearchus. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>On the other side some three thousand of
     Cyrus' soldiers fell, while of the Greeks, we are told, not a man was slain, though a few were
     wounded. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the night was
     past, Aridaeus, who had fled to the stopping-place, dispatched messengers to Clearchus, urging
     him to lead his soldiers to him and to join him in making a safe return to the regions on the
     sea. For now that Cyrus had been slain and the King's armaments held the advantage, deep
     concern had seized those who had dared to take the field to unseat Artaxerxes from the throne.
      </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="25">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Clearchus called together both the generals and commanders and took counsel with them
     on the situation. While they were discussing it, there came ambassadors from the King, the
     chief of whom was a man of Greece, Phalynus by name, who was a Zacynthian. They were introduced
     to the gathering and spoke as follows: "King Artaxerxes says: Since I have defeated and slain
     Cyrus, do you surrender your arms, come to my doors, and seek how you may appease me and gain
     some favour." <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>To these words each general gave a reply much
     like that which Leonides made when he was guarding the Pass of Thermopylae, and Xerxes sent
     messengers ordering him to lay down his arms.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">See Book 11.5.5.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For Leonides at that time instructed the messengers to report
     to the King: "We believe that if we become friends of Xerxes, we shall be better allies if we
     keep our arms, and if we are forced to wage war against him, we shall fight the better if we
     keep them." <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When Clearchus had made a somewhat similar reply
     to the message, Proxenus the Theban said, "As things now stand, we have lost practically
     everything else, and all that is left to us is our valour and our arms. It is my opinion,
     therefore, that if we guard our arms, our valour also will be useful to us, but if we give them
     up, then not even our valour will be of any help to us." Consequently he gave them this message
     to the King: "If you are plotting some evil against us, with our arms we will fight against you
     for your own possessions." <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>We are told that also Sophilus, one
     of the commanders, said, "I am surprised at the words of the King; for if he believes that he
     is stronger than the Greeks, let him come with his army and take our arms away from us; but if
     he wishes to use persuasion, let him say what favour of equal worth he will grant us in
     exchange for them." <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>After these speakers Socrates the Achaean
     said, "The King is certainly acting toward us in a most astounding fashion; for what he wishes
     to take from us he requires at once, while what will be given us in return he commands us to
     request of him at a later time. In a word, if it is in ignorance of who are the victors that he
     orders us to obey his command as though we had been defeated, let him come with his numerous
     host and find out on whose side the victory lies; but if, knowing well enough that we are the
     victors, he uses lying words, how shall we trust his later promises?" <milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the messengers had received these replies, they
     departed; and Clearchus marched to the stopping-place whither the troops had retired who had
     escaped from the battle. When the entire force had gathered in the same place, they counselled
     together how they should make their way back to the sea and what route they should take.
      <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Now it was agreed that they should not return by the same way
     they had come, since much of it was waste country where they could not expect provisions to be
     available with a hostile army on their heels. They resolved, therefore, to make toward
     Paphlagonia, and set out in that direction with the army, proceeding at a leisurely pace, since
     they gathered provisions as they marched. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="26">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The King was recovering from his wound,
     and when he learned that his opponents were withdrawing, he believed that they were in flight
     and set out in haste after them with his army. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>As soon as he
     had overtaken them because of their slow progress, for the moment, since it was night, he went
     into camp near them, and when day came and the Greeks were drawing up their army for battle, he
     sent messengers to them and for the time being agreed upon a truce of three days. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>During this period they reached the following agreement: The King would
     see that his territory was friendly to them; he would provide them guides for their journey to
     the sea and would supply them with provisions on the way; the mercenaries under Clearchus and
     all the troops under Aridaeus should pass through his territory without doing any injury.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After this they started on their journey, and the King led
     his army off to Babylon. In that city he accorded fitting honours to everyone who had performed
     deeds of courage in the battle and judged Tissaphernes to have been the bravest of all.
     Consequently he honoured him with rich gifts, gave him his own daughter in marriage, and
     henceforth continued to hold him as his most trusted friend; and he also gave him the command
     which Cyrus had held over the satrapies on the sea. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Tissaphernes, seeing that the King was angered at the Greeks, promised him
     that he would destroy them one and all, if the King would supply him with armaments and come to
     terms with Aridaeus, for he believed that Aridaeus would betray the Greeks to him in the course
     of the march. The King readily accepted this suggestion and allowed him to select from his
     entire army as many of the best troops as he chose. (When Tissaphernes caught up with the
     Greeks he sent word for Clearchus and the)<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">There is clearly a break in the text, as in fact is indicated by two of the manuscripts. The words in

     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>rest of the commanders to come to him and hear what he had to
     say in person. Consequently, practically all the generals, together with Clearchus and some
     twenty captains, went to Tissaphernes, and of the common soldiers about two hundred, who wanted
     to go to market, accompanied them. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Tissaphernes invited the
     generals into his tent and the captains waited at the entrance. And after a little, at the
     raising of a red flag from Tissaphernes' tent, he seized the generals within, certain appointed
     troops fell upon the captains and slew them, and others killed the soldiers who had come to the
     market. Of the last, one made his escape to his camp and disclosed the disaster that had
     befallen them. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="27">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the soldiers learned what had taken place, at the moment they were
     panic-stricken and all rushed to arms in great disorder, since there was no one to command; but
     after this, since no one disturbed them, they elected a number of generals and put the supreme
     command in the hands of one, Cheirisophus the Lacedaemonian. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />The generals organized the army for the march on the route they thought best and proceeded
     toward Paphlagonia. Tissaphernes sent the generals in chains to Artaxerxes, who executed the
     others but spared Menon alone, since he alone, because of a quarrel with his allies,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Or "with his fellow commanders".</note> was thought to be
     ready to betray the Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Tissaphernes, following with his
     army, clung to the Greeks, but he did not dare to meet them in battle face to face, fearing as
     he did the courage and recklessness of desperate men; and although he harassed them in places
     well suited for that purpose, he was unable to do them any great harm, but he followed them,
     causing slight difficulties, as far as the country of the people known as the Carduchi.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Since Tissaphernes was unable
     to accomplish anything further, he set out with his army for Ionia; and the Greeks made their
     way for seven days through the mountains of the Carduchi, suffering greatly at the hands of the
     natives, who were a warlike people and well acquainted with the region. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>They were enemies of the King and a free people who practised the arts
     of war, and they especially trained themselves in hurling the largest stones they could with
     slings and in the use of enormous arrows, with which missiles they inflicted wounds on the
     Greeks from advantageous positions, slaying many and seriously injuring not a few. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For the arrows were more than two cubits long<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">About three feet.</note> and pierced both the shields and breastplates, so
     that no armour could withstand their force; and these arrows they used were so large, we are
     told, that the Greeks wound thongs about those that had been shot and used them as javelins to
     hurl back. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Now after they had traversed with difficulty the
     country we have mentioned, they arrived at the river Centrites, which they crossed, and entered
     Armenia. The satrap here was Tiribazus, with whom they made a truce and passed through his
     territory as friends. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="28">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As they made their way through the mountains of Armenia they
     encountered a heavy snow and the entire army came near to perishing. What happened was this. At
     first, when the air was stirred, the snow began to fall in light quantities from the heavens,
     so that the marchers experienced no trouble in their advance; but after this a wind rose and it
     came down heavier and heavier and so covered the ground that not only the road but even any
     distinguishing landmarks could no longer be seen at all. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Consequently despondency and fear seized the army, which was unwilling to turn back to
     certain destruction and unable to advance because of the heavy snow. As the storm increased in
     intensity, there came a great wind and heavy hail which beat in gusts on their faces and forced
     the entire army to come to a halt; for everyone, being unable to endure the hardship entailed
     in a further advance, was forced to remain wherever he happened to be. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Although without supplies of any kind, they stuck it out under the open
     sky that day and the following night, beset by many hardships; for because of the heavy snow
     which kept continually falling, all their arms were covered and their bodies were completely
     chilled by the frost in the air. The hardships they endured were so great that they got no
     sleep the entire night. Some lighted fires and got some help from them, and some, whose bodies
     were invaded by the frost, gave up all hope of succour, since practically all their fingers and
     toes were mortifying. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Accordingly, when the night was past, it
     was found that most of the baggage animals had perished, and of the soldiers many were dead and
     not a few, though still conscious, could not move their bodies because of the frost; and the
     eyes of some were blinded by reason of the cold and the glare from the snow. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And every man would certainly have perished had they not gone on a
     little farther and found villages full of supplies. These villages had entrances for the beasts
     of burden which were tunnelled under the ground and others for the human inhabitants who
     descended into them by ladders . . .<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">There is clearly a
      lacuna in the text. Any reconstruction should be guided by Xenophon's description (<bibl n="Xen. Anab 4.5.25">Xen. Anab 4.5.25</bibl>): "The houses here were underground, with a
      mouth like that of a well, but spacious below; and while entrances were tunnelled down for the
      beasts of burden, the human inhabitants descended by a ladder. In the houses were goats,
      sheep, etc." (tr. of Brownson in the <title>L.C.L.</title>). Such underground villages are still to be found in modern Armenia.</note> and in the houses the animals were supplied with
     hay, while the human inhabitants enjoyed a great abundance of all the necessities of life.

<div2 type="chapter" n="29">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After they had remained in the villages eight days, they went on the river Phasis.
     Here they passed four days and then made their way through the territory of the Chaoi<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Probably the Taochians of <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 4.6.5">Xen.
       Anab. 4.6.5</bibl>.</note> and the Phasians. When the natives attacked them, they defeated
     them in battle, slaying great numbers of them, seized their farms, which abounded in
     provisions, and spent fifteen days on them. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Continuing their
     advance from here, they then traversed the territory of the Chaldaeans, as they are called, in
     seven days and arrived at the river named Harpagus, which was four plethra wide. From here
     their advance brought them through the territory of the Scytini by a road across a plain, on
     which they refreshed themselves for three days, enjoying all the necessities of life in plenty.
     After this they set out and on the fourth day arrived at a large city which bore the name of
     Gymnasia. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Here the ruler of these regions concluded a truce
     with them and furnished them guides to lead them to the sea. Arriving in fifteen days at Mt.
     Chenium, when the men marching in the van caught sight of the sea, they were overjoyed and
     raised such a cry that the men in the rear, assuming that there was an attack by enemies,
     rushed to arms. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But when they had all got up to the place from
     which the sea could be seen, they raised their hands to the gods and gave thanks, believing
     they had now come through to safety; and gathering together into one spot a great number of
     stones, they formed from them great cairns on which they set up as a dedication spoils taken
     from the barbarians, wishing to leave an eternal memorial of their expedition. To the guide
     they gave as presents a silver bowl and a suit of Persian raiment; and he, after pointing out
     to them the road to the Macronians, took his departure. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The
     Greeks then entered the territory of the Macronians with whom they concluded a truce, receiving
     from them as a pledge of good faith a spear used by these barbarians and giving them in return
     a Greek one; for the barbarians declared that such an exchange had been handed down to them
     from their forefathers as the surest pledge of good faith. When they had crossed the boundaries
     of this people, they arrived at the territory of the Colchians. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />When the natives gathered here against them, the Greeks overcame them in battle and slew
     great numbers of them, and then, seizing a strong position on a hill, they pillaged the
     territory, gathered their booty on the hill, and refreshed themselves plentifully. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="30">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There
     were found in the regions great numbers of beehives which yielded valuable honey. But as many
     as partook of it succumbed to a strange affliction; for those who ate it lost consciousness,
     and falling on the ground were like dead men. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Since many
     consumed the honey because of the pleasure its sweetness afforded, such a number had soon
     fallen to the ground as if they had suffered a rout in war. Now during that day the army was
     disheartened, terrified as it was at both the strange happening and the great number of the
     unfortunates; but on the next day at about the same hour all came to themselves, gradually
     recovered their senses, and rose up from the ground, and their physical state was like that of
     men recovered after a dose of a drug. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When they had refreshed themselves for three days, they marched on to the Greek city
     of Trapezus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The modern Trebizond.</note> which is a
     colony of the Sinopians and lies in the territory of the Colchians. Here they spent thirty
     days, during which they were most magnificently entertained by the inhabitants; and they
     offered sacrifices to Heracles and to Zeus the Deliverer and held a gymnastic contest at the
     place at which, men say, the Argo put in with Jason and his men. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>From here they dispatched Cheirisophus their commander to Byzantium to get transports
     and triremes, since he claimed to be a friend of Anaxibius, the admiral of the Byzantians. The
     Greeks sent him off on a light boat, and then, receiving from the Trapezians two small boats
     equipped with oars, they plundered the neighbouring barbarians both by land and by sea.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Now for thirty days they waited for the return of
     Cheirisophus, and when he still delayed and provisions for the troops were running low, they
     set out from Trapezus and arrived on the third day at the Greek city of Cerasus, a colony of
     the Sinopians. Here they spent some days and then came to the people of the Mosynoecians.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When the barbarians assembled against them, the Greeks
     defeated them in battle, slaying great numbers of them. And when they fled for refuge to a
     stronghold where they had their dwelling and which they defended with wooden towers seven
     stories high, the Greeks launched successive assaults upon it and took it by storm. This
     stronghold was the capitol of all the other walled communities and in it, in the loftiest part,
     their king had his dwelling. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>A custom, handed down from their
     fathers, is followed that the king must remain for his entire life in the stronghold and from
     it issue his commands to the people. This was the most barbarous nation, the soldiers said,
     that they passed through: the men have intercourse with the women in the sight of all; the
     children of the wealthiest are nourished on boiled nuts; and they are all from their youth
     tattooed in various colours on both their back and breast. This territory they passed through
     in eight days and the next country, called Tibarene, in three. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="31">

     Cotyora, a Greek city and a colony of the Sinopians. Here they spent fifty days, plundering
     both the neighbouring peoples of Paphlagonia and the other barbarians. And the citizens of

     it was in Paphlagonia, it held first place among the cities of those regions; and it was in
     this city that in our day Mithridates, who went to war with the Romans, had his largest palace.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And at that city also arrived Cheirisophus, who had been
     dispatched without success to get triremes. Nevertheless, the Sinopians entertained them in
     kindly fashion and sent them on their way by sea to Heracleia, a colony of the Megarians; and
     the entire fleet came to anchor at the peninsula of Acherusia, where, we are told, Heracles led
     up Cerberus from Hades. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>As they proceeded from there on foot
     through Bithynia they fell among perils, as the natives skirmished with them along their route.
     So they barely made their way to safety to Chrysopolis in Chalcedonia, eight thousand three
     hundred surviving of the original ten thousand. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>From there

     exiles, twelve hundred in number, and delivering an unexpected attack by night on the camp of
     his opponents, he slew a large number of them, struck terror into the rest by his unexpected
     move, and forced them to flee to Athens. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>After the battle
     Thrasybulus set out straightway for the Peiraeus and seized Munychia, which was an uninhabited
     and strong hill; and the Tyrants with all the troops at their disposal went down to the
     Peiraeus and attacked Munychia, under the command of Critias. In the sharp battle which
     continued for a long time the Thirty held the advantage in numbers and the exiles in the
     strength of their position. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>At last, however, when Critias
     fell, the troops of the Thirty were dismayed and fled for safety to more level ground, the
     exiles not daring to come down against them. When after this great numbers went over to the
     exiles, Thrasybulus made an unexpected attack upon his opponents, defeated them in battle, and
     became master of the Peiraeus. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At once many of the inhabitants
     of the city<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Athens.</note> who wished to be rid of the
     tyranny flocked to the Peiraeus and all the exiles who were scattered throughout the cities of
     Greece, on hearing of the successes of Thrasybulus, came to the Peiraeus, so that from now on
     the exiles were far superior in force. In consequence they began to lay siege to the city.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The remaining citizens in
     Athens now removed the Thirty from office and sent them out of the city, and then they elected
     ten men with supreme power first and foremost to put an end to the war, in any way possible, on
     friendly terms. But these men, as soon as they had succeeded to office, paid no attention to
     these orders, but established themselves as tyrants and sent to Lacedaemon for forty warships
     and a thousand soldiers, under the command of Lysander. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But
     Pausanias, the king of the Lacedaemonians, being jealous of Lysander and observing that Sparta
     was in ill repute among the Greeks, marched forth with a strong army and on his arrival in
     Athens brought about a reconciliation between the men in the city and the exiles. As a result
     the Athenians got back their country and henceforth conducted their government under laws of
     their own making; and the men who lived in fear of punishment for their unbroken series of past
     crimes they allowed to make their home in Eleusis. </p>

     of the superior strength of the Lacedaemonians, brought the war with them to an end, agreeing
     that they would surrender their triremes to the Lacedaemonians and let the neighbouring cities
     go free. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And the Lacedaemonians, now that they had brought
     their wars to an end and were no longer concerned with them, advanced with their army against
     the Messenians, of whom some were settled in an outpost on Cephallenia and others in Naupactus,
     which the Athenians had given them, among the western Locrians.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 11.84.7.</note> Driving the Messenians from these regions, they

      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Messenians, being now driven from every place because of
     their ancient hatred of the Spartans, departed with their arms from Greece, and some of them,
     sailing to Sicily, took service as mercenaries with Dionysius, while others, about three
     thousand in number, sailed to Cyrene and joined the forces of exiles there. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For at that time disorder had broken out among the Cyrenaeans, since
     Ariston, together with certain others, had seized the city. Of the Cyrenaeans, five hundred of
     the most influential citizens had recently been put to death and the most respected among the
     survivors had been banished. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The exiles now added the
     Messenians to their number and joined battle with the men who had seized the city, and many of
     the Cyrenaeans were slain on both sides, but the Messenians were killed almost to a man.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>After the battle the Cyrenaeans negotiated with each other
     and agreed to be reconciled, and they immediately swore oaths not to remember past injuries and

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The inhabitants of Rhegium, who were colonists of Chalcis, were angered to
     see the growing power of Dionysius. For he had sold into slavery the Naxians and
      Catanians,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chap. 15.</note> their kinsmen, and to the
     Rhegians, because they were of the same blood as<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Or "they faced the same danger as".</note> these unfortunate peoples, this act was the cause of no
     ordinary concern, since all feared the same disaster would befall them. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They therefore decided to take the field speedily against the tyrant
     before he became entirely secure. Their decision upon war was forthwith supported strongly also
     by the Syracusans who had been exiled by Dionysius, for most of them were at that time resident
     in Rhegium and were continually discussing the matter and pointing out that all the Syracusans
     would seize the occasion to join in an attack. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In the end the
     Rhegians appointed generals and sent out with them six thousand infantry, six hundred cavalry,
     and fifty triremes. The generals crossed the strait and induced the generals of the Messenians
     to join in the war, declaring that it would be a terrible thing for them to stand idly by when
     Greek cities, and their neighbours, had been totally destroyed by the tyrant. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now the generals were won over by the Rhegians and, without obtaining a
     vote of the people, led forth their forces which consisted of four thousand infantry, four
     hundred cavalry, and thirty triremes. But when the armaments we have mentioned had advanced as
     far as the borders of Messene, opposition broke out among the soldiers due to a harangue
     delivered by the Messenian Laomedon; <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>for he advised them not
     to begin a war against Dionysius who had done them no wrong. Accordingly the Messenian troops,
     since the people had not approved the war, followed his advice at once, and, deserting their
     generals, turned back home; <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>and the Rhegians, since they were
     not strong enough alone for a battle, when they saw that the Messenians were disbanding their
     army, also turned back speedily to Rhegium. At the outset Dionysius had led out his army to the
     border of the Syracusan territory, awaiting the attack of the enemy; but when he learned of
     their retirement, he led his forces back to Syracuse. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>When the
     Rhegians and Messenians sent ambassadors to treat upon terms of peace, he decided that it was
     to his advantage to put an end to enmity against these states and concluded peace. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="41">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When
     Dionysius observed that some of the Greeks were deserting to the Carthaginian domain, taking
     with them their cities and their estates, he concluded that so long as he was at peace with the
     Carthaginians many of his subjects would be wanting to join their defection, whereas, if there
     were war, all who had been enslaved by the Carthaginians would revolt to him. And he also heard
     that many Carthaginians in Libya had fallen victims to a plague which had raged among them.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Thinking for these reasons, then, that he had a favourable
     occasion for war, he decided that preparation should first be effected; for he assumed that the
     war would be a great and protracted one since he was entering a struggle with the most powerful
     people of Europe. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>At once, therefore, he gathered skilled
     workmen, commandeering them from the cities under his control and attracting them by high wages
     from Italy and Greece as well as Carthaginian territory. For his purpose was to make weapons in
     great numbers and every kind of missile, and also quadriremes and quinqueremes, no ship of the
     latter size having yet been built at that time.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">W. W.
      Tarn, <title>Hellenistic Military and Naval Developments,</title> pp. 130-131, questions the invention of quinqueremes at this time, since they are not heard of again until the time of
      Alexander the Great.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After collecting many skilled workmen, he divided them into
     groups in accordance with their skills, and appointed over them the most conspicuous citizens,
     offering great bounties to any who created a supply of arms. As for the armour, he distributed
     among them models of each kind, because he had gathered his mercenaries from many nations;
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>for he was eager to have every one of his soldiers armed with
     the weapons of his people, conceiving that by such armour his army would, for this very reason,
     cause great consternation, and that in battle all of his soldiers would fight to best effect in
     armour to which they were accustomed. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And since the Syracusans
     enthusiastically supported the policy of Dionysius, it came to pass that rivalry rose high to
     manufacture the arms. For not only was every space, such as the porticoes and back rooms of the
     temples as well as the gymnasia and colonnades of the market place, crowded with workers, but
     the making of great quantities of arms went on, apart from such public places, in the most
     distinguished homes. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="42">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In fact the catapult was invented at this time in
      Syracuse,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Machines for throwing heavy missiles were known to the Assyrians several centuries before this and their use was probably brought to the west
      by the Carthaginians, from whom the western Greeks learned of them.</note> since the ablest
     skilled workmen had been gathered from everywhere into one place. The high wages as well as the
     numerous prizes offered the workmen who were judged to be the best stimulated their zeal. And
     over and above these factors, Dionysius circulated daily among the workers, conversed with them
     in kindly fashion, and rewarded the most zealous with gifts and invited them to his table.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Consequently the workmen brought unsurpassable devotion to
     the devising of many missiles and engines of war that were strange and capable of rendering
     great service. He also began the construction of quadriremes and quinqueremes, being the first
     to think of the construction of such ships. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For, hearing that
     triremes had first been built in Corinth, he was intent, in his city that had been settled by a
     colony from there, on increasing the scale of naval construction. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After obtaining leave to transport timber from Italy he dispatched half of his woodmen
     to Mount Aetne, on which there were heavy stands at that time of both excellent fir and pine,
     while the other half he dispatched to Italy, where he got ready teams to convey the timber to
     the sea, as well as boats and crews to bring the worked wood speedily to Syracuse. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When Dionysius had collected an adequate supply of wood, he began at one
     and the same time to build more than two hundred ships and to refit the one hundred and ten he
     already had; and he also constructed all about the Great Harbour, as it is now called, one
     hundred and sixty costly shipsheds, most of which could accommodate two vessels, and repaired
     the one hundred and fifty which were already there. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="43">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With so many arms and ships
     under construction at one place the beholder was filled with utter wonder at the sight. For
     whenever a man gazed at the eagerness shown in the building of the ships, he thought that every
     Greek in Sicily was engaged on their construction; and when, on the other hand, he visited the
     places where men were making arms and engines of war, he thought that all available labour was
     engaged in this alone. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Moreover, despite the unsurpassable
     zeal devoted to the products we have mentioned, there were made one hundred and forty thousand
     shields and a like number of daggers and helmets; and in addition corselets were made ready, of
     every design and wrought with utmost art, more than fourteen thousand in number. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>These Dionysius expected to distribute to his cavalry and the commanders
     of the infantry, as well as to the mercenaries who were to form his bodyguard. He also had
     catapults made of every style and a large number of the other missiles. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For half of the ships of war which were prepared, the pilots, officers
     at the bow, and rowers were drawn from citizens, while for the rest of the vessels Dionysius
     hired mercenaries. When the building of the ships and the making of arms were completed,
     Dionysius turned his attention to the gathering of soldiers; for he believed it advantageous
     not to hire them far in advance in order to avoid heavy expenses. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In this year Astydamas,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Of Athens.</note> the writer of tragedies, produced his first play; and he

     Athens and in Rome five military tribunes were established in place of the consuls, Lucius
     Julius, Marcus Furius, Marcus Aemilius, Gaius Cornelius, and Caeso Fabius. Dionysius, the
     tyrant of the Syracusans, as soon as the major part of the task of making arms and building a
     fleet was completed, turned at once to the gathering of soldiers. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>From the Syracusans he enrolled those who were fit for military service in companies
     and from the cities subject to him he summoned their able men. He also gathered mercenaries
     from Greece, and especially from the Lacedaemonians, for they, in order to aid him in building
     up his power, gave him permission to enlist as many mercenaries from them as he might wish.
     And, speaking generally, since he made a point of gathering his mercenary force from many
     nations and promised high pay, he found men who were responsive. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Since Dionysius was going to raise up a great war, he
     addressed himself to the cities of Sicily with courtesy, eliciting their goodwill. He saw that
     the Rhegians and Messenians who dwelt on the Strait<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The Strait of Messina.</note> had a strong army mobilized and he feared that, when the
     Carthaginians crossed over to Sicily, they would join the Carthaginians; for these cities would
     add no little weight to the side with which they allied themselves for the war. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Since these considerations were the cause of great concern to Dionysius,
     he made a present to the Messenians of a large piece of territory on their borders, binding
     them to him by such a benefaction; and to the Rhegians he dispatched ambassadors, urging them
     to form a connection by marriage and to give him in marriage a maiden who was a citizen of
     theirs; and he promised that he would win for them a large section of neighbouring territory
     and do all that was in his power to add to the strength of their city. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For since his wife, the daughter of Hermocrates, had been slain at the
     time the cavalry revolted,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 13.112.4.</note> he
     was eager to beget children, in the belief that the loyalty of his offspring would be the
     strongest safeguard of his tyrannical power. Nevertheless, when an assembly of the people was
     held in Rhegium to consider Dionysius' proposal, after much discussion the Rhegians voted not
     to accept the marriage connection.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">More on the reply in chap. 107.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Now that Dionysius had failed of this design, he dispatched
     his ambassadors for the same purpose to the people of the Locrians.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The Epizephyrian Locrians in the "toe" of Italy.</note> When they voted to
     approve the marriage connection, Dionysius sued for the hand of Doris, the daughter of Xenetus,
     who at that time was their most esteemed citizen. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>A few days
     before the marriage he sent to Locri a quinquereme, the first one he had built, embellished
     with silver and gold furnishings; on this he had the maiden conveyed to Syracuse, where he led
     her into the acropolis. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>And he also sought in marriage from
     among the people of his city the most notable maiden among them, Aristomache,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Daughter of Hipparinus and sister of the famous Dion (Book 16.6).</note> for whom he dispatched a chariot drawn by four white horses to bring her to his
     own home. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="45">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After Dionysius had taken in marriage both maidens at the same time, he
     gave a series of public dinners for the soldiers and the larger part of the citizens; for he
     now renounced the oppressive aspect of his tyranny, and changing to a course of equitable
     dealing, he ruled over his subjects in more humane fashion, no more putting them to death or
     banishing them, as had been his practice. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>After his marriages
     he let a few days pass and then called an assembly of the Syracusans and urged them to make war
     against the Carthaginians, declaring that they were most hostile to all Greeks generally and
     that they had designs at every opportunity on the Greeks of Sicily in particular. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the present, he pointed out, the Carthaginians were inactive because
     of the plague which had broken out among them and had destroyed the larger part of the
     inhabitants of Libya, but when they had recovered their strength, they would not refrain from
     attacking the Sicilian Greeks, against whom they had been plotting from the earliest time. It
     was therefore preferable, he continued, to wage a decisive war upon them while they were weak
     than to wait and compete when they were strong. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At the same
     time he pointed out how terrible a thing it was to allow the Greek cities to be enslaved by
     barbarians, and that these cities would the more zealously join in the war, the more eagerly
     they desired to obtain their freedom. After speaking at length in support of his policy he
     speedily won the approval of the Syracusans. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Indeed they were
     no less eager than he for war, first of all because of their hatred of the Carthaginians who
     were the cause of their being compelled to take orders from the tyrant; secondly, because they
     hoped that Dionysius would treat them in more humane fashion because of his fear of the enemy
     and of an attack upon him by the citizens he had enslaved; but most of all, because they hoped
     that once they had got weapons in their hand, they could strike for their liberty, let Fortune
     but give them the opportunity. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="46">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the meeting of the assembly the Syracusans, with
     the permission of Dionysius, seized as plunder the property of the Phoenicians; for no small
     number of Carthaginians had their homes in Syracuse and rich possessions, and many also of
     their merchants had vessels in the harbour loaded with goods, all of which the Syracusans
     plundered. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Similarly the rest of the Sicilian Greeks drove out
     the Phoenicians who dwelt among them and plundered their possessions; for although they hated
     the tyranny of Dionysius, they were still glad to join in the war against the Carthaginians
     because of the cruelty of that people. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For the very same
     reasons, too, the inhabitants of the Greek cities under the rule of the Carthaginians, as soon
     as Dionysius publicly enacted war, made open display of their hatred of the Phoenicians; for
     not only did they seize their property as plunder, but they also laid hands on their persons
     and subjected them to every kind of physical torture and outrage, remembering what they had
     themselves suffered during the time of their captivity. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So far
     did they go in the vengeance they wreaked on the Phoenicians both at this time and
     subsequently, that the Carthaginians were taught the lesson no more to transgress the law in
     their treatment of conquered peoples; for they did not fail to realize, learning as they did by
     very deeds, that in war Fortune is impartial to both combatants and in defeat both sides must
     suffer the same sort of thing that they themselves have done to those who were unfortunate.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when Dionysius had made
     ready all his preparations for the war, he determined to send messengers to Carthage with the
     announcement: The Syracusans declare war upon the Carthaginians unless they restore freedom to

      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>which contained the statement that the Syracusans had
     resolved to make war upon the Carthaginians unless they withdrew from the Greek cities. The
     herald accordingly, pursuant to his orders, sailed to Libya and delivered the letter to the
     senate. When it had been read in the council and subsequently before the people, it came about
     that the Carthaginians were not a little distressed at the thought of war; for the plague had
     killed great numbers of them, and they were also totally unprepared. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Nevertheless, they waited for the Syracusans to take the initiative and dispatched
     members of the senate with large sums of money to recruit mercenaries in Europe.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Presumably in Spain, where Hannibal had formerly gathered mercenaries (Book 13.44).</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dionysius with the Syracusans,

     of Motye, a Carthaginian colony, which they used as their chief base of operations against
     Sicily; and Dionysius hoped that with this city in his power he would have no small advantage
     over his enemies. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In the course of his march he received from
     time to time the contingents from the Greek cities, supplying the full levy of each with arms;
     for they were all eager to join his campaign, hating as they did the heavy hand of Phoenician
     domination and relishing the prospect at last of freedom. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>He
     received first the levy from Camarina, then those of Gela and Acragas; and after these he sent
     for the Himeraeans, whose home was on the other side of Sicily, and after adding the men of
     Selinus, as he passed by, he arrived at Motye with all his army. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>He had eighty thousand infantry, well over three thousand cavalry, and a little less
     than two hundred warships, and he was accompanied by not less than five hundred merchantmen
     loaded with great numbers of engines of war and all the other supplies needed. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="48">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Since
     the armament was on the great scale we have described, the people of Eryx were awed by the
     magnitude of the force and, hating the Carthaginians as they did, came over to Dionysius. The
     inhabitants of Motye, however, expecting aid from the Carthaginians, were not dismayed at
     Dionysius' armament, but made ready to withstand a siege; for they were not unaware that the
     Syracusans would make Motye the first city to sack, because it was most loyal to the
     Carthaginians. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>This city was situated on an island lying six
     stades off Sicily, and was embellished artistically to the last degree with numerous fine
     houses, thanks to the prosperity of the inhabitants. It also had a narrow artificial causeway
     extending to the shore of Sicily, which the Motyans breached at this time, in order that the
     enemy should have no approach against them. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dionysius, after reconnoitring the area, together with his engineers,
     began to construct moles leading to Motye, hauled the warships up on land at the entrance of
     the harbour, and moored the merchantmen along the beach. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After
     this he left Leptines<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Brother of the tyrant.</note> his
     admiral in command of the works, while he himself set out with the infantry of his army against
     the cities that were allies of the Carthaginians. Now the Sicani,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">On the origin of the Sicani see Book 5.6.</note> fearing the great size of
     the army, all went over to the Syracusans, and of the rest of the cities only five remained
     loyal to the Carthaginians, these being Halicyae, Solus, Aegesta, Panormus, and Entella.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Hence Dionysius plundered the territory of Solus and
     Panormus, and that also of Halicyae, and cut down the trees on it, but he laid siege to Aegesta
     and Entella with strong forces and launched continuous attacks upon them, seeking to get
     control of them by force. Such was the state of the affairs of Dionysius. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="49">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Himilcon, the general of the Carthaginians, being himself busy with the mustering of the
     armaments and other preparations, dispatched his admiral with ten triremes under orders to sail
     speedily in secret against the Syracusans,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">"To Syracuse" is meant, as also just below.</note> enter the harbour by night, and destroy the shipping left
     behind there. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>This he did, expecting to cause a diversion and
     force Dionysius to send part of his fleet back to the Syracusans. The admiral who had been
     dispatched carried out his orders with promptness and entered the harbour of the Syracusans by
     night while everyone was ignorant of what had taken place. Attacking unawares, he rammed the
     vessels lying at anchor along the shore, sank practically all of them, and then returned to
     Carthage. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Dionysius, after ravaging all the territory held by
     the Carthaginians and forcing the enemy to take refuge behind walls, led all his army against
     Motye; for he hoped that when this city had been reduced by siege, all the others would
     forthwith surrender themselves to him. Accordingly, he at once put many times more men on the
     task of filling up the strait between the city and the coast, and, as the mole was extended,
     advanced his engines of war little by little toward the walls. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="50">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Meanwhile Himilcon, the
     admiral of the Carthaginians, hearing that Dionysius had hauled his warships up on land, manned
     at once his hundred best triremes; for he assumed that if he appeared unexpectedly, he should
     easily seize the vessels which were hauled up on land in the harbour, since he would be master
     of the sea. Once he succeeded in this, he believed, he would not only relieve the siege of
     Motye but also transfer the war to the city of the Syracusans. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Sailing forth, therefore, with one hundred ships, he arrived during the night at the
     territory of Selinus, skirted the promontory of Lilybaeum, and arrived at daybreak at Motye.
     Since his appearance took the enemy by surprise, he disabled some of the vessels anchored along
     the shore by ramming and others by burning, for Dionysius was unable to come to their defence.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After this he sailed into the harbour and drew up his ships
     as if to attack the vessels which the enemy had drawn up on land. Dionysius now massed his army
     at the entrance of the harbour; but when he saw that the enemy was lying in wait to attack as
     the ships left the harbour, he refused to risk launching his ships within the harbour, since he
     realized that the narrow entrance compelled a few ships to match themselves against an enemy
     many times more numerous.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">i.e. in the narrow entrance Dionysius could not use the great advantage he had in numbers.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Consequently, using the multitude of his soldiers, he hauled
     his vessels over the land with no difficulty and launched them safely in the sea outside the
     harbour. Himilcon attacked the first ships, but was held back by the multitude of missiles; for
     Dionysius had manned the ships with a great number of archers and slingers, and the Syracusans
     slew many of the enemy by using from the land the catapults which shot sharp-pointed missiles.
     Indeed this weapon created great dismay, because it was a new invention at this time. As a
     result, Himilcon was unable to achieve his design and sailed away to Libya, believing that a
     sea-battle would serve no end, since the enemy's ships were double his in number. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="51">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After
     Dionysius had completed the mole<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">It is an interesting
      coincidence of history that the other use of a mole of such magnitude in ancient history
      against an island city was by Alexander the Great in <date value="-332">332</date> B.C.
      against Tyre, the mother-city of the Carthaginians. Alexander's mole was about half a mile
      long and reputed to be two hundred feet wide. For the story of the famous seven-month siege of
      Tyre see Book 17.40-46, <bibl n="Arr. An. 2.18">Arrian Anab. 2.18-24</bibl>, <bibl n="Curt. 4.2">Curtius, 4.2-4</bibl>.</note> by employing a large force of labourers, he
     advanced war engines of every kind against the walls and kept hammering the towers with his
     battering-rams, while with the catapults he kept down the fighters on the battlements; and he
     also advanced against the walls his wheeled towers, six stories high, which he had built to
     equal the height of the houses. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The inhabitants of Motye, now
     that the threat was at hand-grips, were nevertheless not dismayed by the armament of Dionysius,
     even though they had for the moment no allies to help them. Surpassing the besiegers in thirst
     for glory, they in the first place raised up men in crow's-nests resting on yard-arms suspended
     from the highest possible masts, and these from their lofty positions hurled lighted
     fire-brands and burning tow with pitch on the enemies' siege engines. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The flame quickly caught the wood, but the Sicilian Greeks, dashing to the rescue,
     swiftly quenched it; and meantime the frequent blows of the battering-rams broke down a section
     of the wall. Since now both sides rushed with one accord to the place, the battle that ensued
     grew furious. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For the Sicilian Greeks, believing that the city
     was already in their hands, spared no effort in retaliating upon the Phoenicians for former
     injuries they had suffered at their hands, while the people of the city, envisioning the
     terrible fate of a life of captivity and seeing no possibility of flight either by land or by
     sea, faced death stoutly. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And finding themselves shorn of the
     defence of the walls, they barricaded the narrow lanes and made the last houses provide a
     lavishly constructed wall. From this came even greater difficulties for the troops of
     Dionysius. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For after they had burst through the wall and
     seemed to be already masters of the city, they were raked by missiles from men posted in
     superior positions. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Nevertheless, they advanced the wooden
     towers to the first houses and provided them with gangways<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >These were small bridges which could be dropped or thrust from the towers across to opposing walls and in this case to the houses.</note> ; and since the siege machines were equal in
     height to the dwellings, the rest of the struggle was fought hand to hand. For the Sicilian
     Greeks would launch the gangways and force a passage by them on to the houses. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="52">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The
     Motyans, as they took account of the magnitude of the peril, and with their wives and children
     before their eyes, fought the more fiercely out of fear for their fate. There were some whose
     parents stood by entreating them not to let them be surrendered to the lawless will of victors,
     who were thus wrought to a pitch where they set no value on life; others, as they heard the
     laments of their wives and helpless children, sought to die like men rather than to see their
     children led into captivity. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Flight of course from the city
     was impossible, since it was entirely surrounded by the sea, which was controlled by the enemy.
     Most appalling for the Phoenicians and the greatest cause of their despair was the thought how
     cruelly they had used their Greek captives and the prospect of their suffering the same
     treatment. Indeed there was nothing left for them but, fighting bravely, either to conquer or
     die. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When such an obstinate mood filled the souls of the
     besieged, the Sicilian Greeks found themselves in a very difficult position. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For, fighting as they were from the suspended wooden bridges, they
     suffered grievously both because of the narrow quarters and because of the desperate resistance
     of their opponents, who had abandoned hope of life. As a result, some perished in hand-to-hand
     encounter as they gave and received wounds, and others, pressed back by the Motyans and
     tumbling from the wooden bridges, fell to their death on the ground. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In the end, while the kind of siege we have described had lasted some days, Dionysius
     made it his practice always toward evening to sound the trumpet for the recall of the fighters
     and break off the siege. When he had accustomed the Motyans to such a practice, the combatants
     on both sides retiring, he dispatched Archylus of Thurii with the elite troops, <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>who, when night had fallen, placed ladders against the fallen houses,
     and mounting by them, seized an advantageous spot where he admitted Dionysius' troops.
      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The Motyans, when they perceived what had taken place, at
     once rushed to the rescue with all eagerness, and although they were too late, none the less
     faced the struggle. The battle grew fierce and abundant reinforcements climbed the ladders,
     until at last the Sicilian Greeks wore down their opponents by weight of numbers. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="53">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Straightway Dionysius' entire army burst into the city, coming also by the mole, and now
     every spot was a scene of mass slaughter; for the Sicilian Greeks, eager to return cruelty for
     cruelty, slew everyone they encountered, sparing without distinction not a child, not a woman,
     not an elder. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Dionysius, wishing to sell the inhabitants into
     slavery for the money he could gather, at first attempted to restrain the soldiers from
     murdering the captives, but when no one paid any attention to him and he saw that the fury of
     the Sicilian Greeks was not to be controlled, he stationed heralds to cry aloud and tell the
     Motyans to take refuge in the temples which were revered by the Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When this was done, the soldiers ceased their slaughter and turned to
     looting the property; and the plunder yielded much silver and not a little gold, as well as
     costly raiment and an abundance on every other product of felicity. The city was given over by
     Dionysius to the soldiers to plunder, since he wished to whet their appetites for future
     encounters. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After this success he rewarded Archylus, who had
     been the first to mount the wall, with one hundred minas,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >Some $1800.</note> and honoured according to their merits all others who had performed deeds
     of valour; he also sold as booty the Motyans who survived, but he crucified Daimenes and other
     Greeks who had fought on the side of the Carthaginians and had been taken captive. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After this Dionysius stationed guards in the city whom he put under the
     command of Biton of Syracuse; and the garrison was composed largely of Siceli. He ordered
     Leptines his admiral with one hundred and twenty ships to lie in wait for any attempt by the
     Carthaginians to cross to Sicily; and he also assigned to him the siege of Aegesta and Entella,
     in accordance with his original plan to sack them. Then, since the summer was already coming to
     a close, he marched back to Syracuse with his army. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In Athens Sophocles, the son<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">He was the grandson of the great tragedian.</note> of Sophocles, began to produce tragedies and won

     an embassy to him and concluded an alliance. But the Aegestaeans, falling unexpectedly by night
     on their besiegers and setting fire to the tents where they were camped, threw the men in the

     against any approach of the enemy by sea.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Carthaginians, when
     they learned of the magnitude of the armament of Dionysius, resolved far to surpass him in
     their preparations. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently, lawfully according Himilcon
     sovereign power,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Strictly speaking, Himilcon was chosen one of the two annually elected suffetes, who corresponded in general to the Roman consuls,
      and put in command of the war.</note> they gathered armaments from all Libya as well as from
     Iberia, summoning some from their allies and in other cases hiring mercenaries. In the end they
     collected more than three hundred thousand infantry, four thousand cavalry in addition to
     chariots, which numbered four hundred, four hundred ships of war, and over six hundred other
     vessels to convey food and engines of war and other supplies. These are the numbers stated by
     Ephorus. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Timaeus, on the other hand, says that the troops
     transported from Libya did not exceed one hundred thousand and declares that an additional
     thirty thousand were enlisted in Sicily. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="55">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Himilcon gave sealed orders to all the
     pilots with commands to open them after they had sailed and to carry out the instructions. He
     devised this scheme in order that no spy should be able to report to Dionysius where they would
     put in; and the orders read for them to put in at Panormus. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />When a favourable wind arose, all the vessels cast off their cables and the transports put
     out to open sea, but the triremes sailed into the Libyan Sea and skirted the land.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The course of the triremes was to divert attention from the route of the transports. When sighted, as they would be, going east, Dionysius might well fear
      that they intended an attack on Syracuse. How the triremes got to Panormus without an
      encounter with Leptines is not told us.</note> The wind continued favourable, and as soon as
     the leading vessels of the transports were visible from Sicily, Dionysius dispatched Leptines
     with thirty triremes under orders to ram and destroy all he could intercept. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Leptines sailed forth promptly and straightway sank, together with their
     men, the first ships he encountered, but the rest, having all canvas spread and catching the
     wind with their sails, easily made their escape. Nevertheless, fifty ships were sunk, together
     with five thousand soldiers and two hundred chariots. <milestone unit="section" n="4" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After Himilcon had put in at Panormus and disembarked his
     army, he advanced toward the enemy, ordering the triremes to sail along beside him; and having
     himself taken Eryx by treachery as he passed, he took up quarters before Motye. Since Dionysius
     and his army were during this time at Aegeste, Himilcon reduced Motye by siege. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Although the Sicilian Greeks were eager for a battle, Dionysius
     conceived it to be better, both because he was widely separated from his allied cities and
     because the transport of his food supplies was reduced, to renew the war in other areas.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Having decided, therefore, to break camp, he proposed to the
     Sicani to abandon their cities for the present and to join him in the campaign; and in return
     he promised to give them richer territory of about equal size and, at the conclusion of the
     war, to return to their native cities any who so wished. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Of
     the Sicani only a few, fearing that, if they refused, they would be plundered by the soldiers,
     agreed to Dionysius' offer. The Halicyaeans similarly deserted him and sent ambassadors to the
     Carthaginian camp and concluded an alliance with them. And Dionysius set out for Syracuse,
     laying waste the territory through which he led his army. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="56">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Himilcon, now that his
     affairs were proceeding as he wished, made preparations to lead his army against Messene, being
     anxious to get control of the city because of its favourable facilities; for it had an
     excellent harbour, capable of accommodating all his ships, which numbered more than six
     hundred, and Himilcon also hoped that by getting possession of the straits he would be able to
     bar any aid from the Italian Greeks and hold in check the fleets that might come from the
     Peloponnesus. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>With this programme in mind, he formed relations
     of friendship with the Himeraeans and the dwellers in the fort of Cephaloedium,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Some fifteen miles east of Himera.</note> and seizing the city
     of Lipara, he exacted thirty talents from the inhabitants of the island.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">On Lipara see Book 5.10.</note> Then he set out in person with his entire
     army toward Messene, his ships sailing along the coast beside him. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Completing the distance in a brief time, he pitched his camp at Peloris, at a distance
     of one hundred stades from Messene. When the inhabitants of this city learned that the enemy
     was at hand, they could not agree among themselves about the war. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>One party, when they heard reports of the great size of the enemy's army and observed
     that they themselves were without any allies&mdash;what is more, that their own cavalry
     were at Syracuse&mdash;were fully convinced that nothing could save them from capture. What
     contributed most to their despair was the fact that their walls had fallen down and that the
     situation allowed no time for their repair. Consequently they removed from the city their
     children and wives and most valuable possessions to neighbouring cities. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Another party of the Messenians, however, hearing of a certain ancient
     oracle of theirs which ran, "Carthaginians must be bearers of water in Messene," interpreted
     the utterance to their advantage, believing that the Carthaginians would serve as slaves in
     Messene. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Consequently not only were they in a hopeful mood,
     but they made many others eager to face battle for their freedom. At once, then, they selected
     the ablest troops from among their young men and dispatched them to Peloris to prevent the
     enemy from entering their territory. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="57">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While the Messenians were busied in this
     way, Himilcon, seeing that they had sallied against his place of landing, dispatched two
     hundred ships against the city, for he hoped, as well he might, that while the soldiers were
     trying to prevent his landing, the crews of the ships would easily seize Messene, stripped of
     defenders as it was. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>A north wind sprang up and the ships with
     all canvas spread entered the harbour, while the Messenians who were on guard at Peloris, in
     spite of their hurried return, failed to arrive before the ships. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Consequently the Carthaginians invested Messene, forced their way through the fallen
     walls, and made themselves masters of the city. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Of the
     Messenians, some were slain as they put up a gallant fight, others fled to the nearest cities,
     but the great mass of the common people took to flight through the surrounding mountains and
     scattered among the fortresses of the territory; <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>of the rest,
     some were captured by the enemy and some, who had been cut off in the area near the harbour,
     hurled themselves into the sea in hopes of swimming across the intervening strait. These
     numbered more than two hundred and most of them were overcome by the current, only fifty making
     their way in safety to Italy. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Himilcon now brought his entire
     army into the city and at first set to work to reduce the forts over the countryside; but since
     they were strongly situated and the men who had fled to them put up gallant struggles, he
     retired to the city, having found himself unable to master them. After this he refreshed his
     army and made preparations to advance against Syracuse. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="58">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Siceli, who had hated
     Dionysius from of old and now had an opportunity to revolt, went over in a body, with the
     exception of the people of Assorus, to the Carthaginians. In Syracuse Dionysius set free the
     slaves and manned sixty ships from their numbers; he also summoned over a thousand mercenaries
     from the Lacedaemonians, and went about the countryside strengthening the fortresses and
     storing them with provisions. He was most concerned, however, to fortify the citadels of the
     Leontines and to store in them the harvest from the plains. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He
     also persuaded the Campanians who were dwelling in Catane to move to Aetne, as it is now
     called, since it was an exceptionally strong fortress. After this he led forth his entire army
     one hundred and sixty stades from Syracuse and encamped near Taurus, as it is called. He had at
     that time thirty thousand infantry, more than three thousand cavalry, and one hundred and
     eighty ships of war, of which only a few were triremes. <milestone unit="section" n="3" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Himilcon threw down the walls of Messene and issued orders to
     his soldiers to raze to the ground the dwellings, and to leave not a tile or timber or anything
     else but either to burn or break them. When the many hands of the soldiers speedily
     accomplished this task, no one would have known that the site had been occupied <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For, reflecting that the place was far separated from the cities which
     were his allies and yet was the most strategically situated of any in Sicily, he had determined
     that he would see either that it was kept uninhabited or that it was an arduous and prolonged
     task to rebuild it. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="59">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After Himilcon had exhibited his hatred for the Greeks by the
     calamity he visited upon the Messenians, he dispatched Magon his admiral with his naval
     armament under orders to sail to the peak known as Taurus.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >This is not the Taurus mentioned just above which lay near Syracuse, but the site of the later Tauromenium.</note> This area had been taken by Siceli in large numbers, who, however,
     had no leader. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They had formerly been given by Dionysius the
     territory of the Naxians,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chap. 15.3.</note>but at
     this time, having been induced by Himilcon's offers, they occupied this peak. Since it was a
     strong position, both at this time and subsequent to the war, they made it their home, throwing
     a wall about it, and since those who gathered remained (<emph>menein</emph>) upon Taurus, they
     named the city Tauromenium. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Himilcon, advancing with his land forces, made so rapid a march that he arrived at the place
     we have mentioned in the territory of Naxos at the same time as Magon put in there by sea. But
     since there had recently been a fiery eruption from Mt. Aetne as far as the sea, it was no
     longer possible for the land forces to advance in the company of the ships as they sailed
     beside them; for the regions along the sea were laid waste by the lava, as it is called, so
     that the land army had to take its way around the peak of Aetne. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Consequently he gave orders to Magon to come to port at Catane, while he himself
     advanced speedily through the heart of the country with the intention of joining the ships on
     the Catanaean shore; for he was concerned lest, when his forces were divided, the Sicilian
     Greeks should fight a battle with Magon at sea. And this is what actually took place.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For Dionysius, when he realized that Magon had a short sail,
     whereas the route of the land forces was toilsome and long, hastened to Catane with the object
     of attacking Magon by sea before the arrival of Himilcon. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>His
     hope was that his land forces lined up along the coast would embolden his own troops while the
     enemy would be the more fearful, and, what was the most important consideration, that if he
     should suffer a reverse of some kind, the ships in distress would be able to take refuge in the
     camp of the land forces. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>With this purpose in mind, he
     dispatched Leptines with his whole fleet under orders to engage with his ships in close order,
     and not to break his line lest he be endangered by the great numbers of his opponents; for,
     including merchantmen and oared vessels with brazen beaks, Magon had no less than five hundred
     ships. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="60">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the Carthaginians saw the shore thronged with infantry and the ships
     of the Greeks bearing down on them, they were at once not a little alarmed and began to make
     for the land; but later, when they realized the risk they ran of destruction in giving battle
     at the same time both to the fleet and to the infantry, they quickly changed their mind.
     Deciding, therefore, to face the battle at sea, they drew up their ships and awaited the
     approach of the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Leptines advanced with his thirty best
     vessels far ahead of the rest and joined battle, in no cowardly fashion, but without prudence.
     Attacking forthwith the leading ships of the Carthaginians, at the outset he sank no small
     number of the opposing triremes; but when Magon's massed ships crowded about the thirty, the
     forces of Leptines surpassed in valour, but the Carthaginians in numbers. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Consequently, as the battle grew fiercer, the steersmen laid their ships
     broadside in the fighting and the struggle came to resemble conflicts on land. For they did not
     drive upon the opposing ships from a distance in order to ram them, but the vessels were locked
     together and the fighting was hand to hand. Some, as they leaped for the enemy's ships, fell
     into the sea, and others, who succeeded in their attempt, continued the struggle on the
     opponents' ships. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In the end Leptines was driven off and
     compelled to flee to the open sea, and his remaining ships, attacking without order, were
     overcome by the Carthaginians; for the defeat suffered by the admiral raised the spirits of the
     Phoenicians and markedly discouraged the Sicilian Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="5" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the battle had ended in the manner we have described,
     the Carthaginians pursued with even greater ardour the enemy who were fleeing in disorder and
     destroyed more than one hundred of their ships, and stationing their lighter craft along the
     shore, they slew any of the sailors who were swimming toward the land army. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And as they perished in great numbers not far from the land, while the
     troops of Dionysius were unable to help them in any way, the whole region was full of corpses
     and wreckage. There perished in the sea battle no small number of Carthaginians, but the loss
     of the Sicilian Greeks amounted to more than one hundred ships and over twenty thousand men.
      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>After the battle the Phoenicians anchored their triremes in
     the harbour of Catane, took in tow the ships they had captured, and when they had brought them
     in, repaired them, so that they made the greatness of their success not only a tale for the
     ears but also a sight for the eyes of the Carthaginians.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >i.e. the army of Himilcon.</note>
     </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="61">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Sicilian Greeks made their way toward Syracuse, but as they reflected that they
     would certainly be invested and forced to endure a laborious siege, they urged Dionysius to
     seek an immediate encounter with Himilcon because of his past victory; for, they said, perhaps
     their unexpected appearance would strike terror into the barbarians and they could repair their
     late reverse. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Dionysius was at first won over by these
     advisers and ready to lead his army against Himilcon, but when some of his friends told him
     that he ran the risk of losing the city if Magon should set out with his entire fleet against
     Syracuse, he quickly changed his mind; and in fact he knew that Messene had fallen to the hands
     of the barbarians in a similar manner.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chap. 57.</note> And so, believing that it was not safe to strip the city of defenders, he set out
     for Syracuse. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The majority of the Sicilian Greeks, being
     angered at his unwillingness to encounter the enemy, deserted Dionysius, some of them departing
     to their own countries and others to fortresses in the neighbourhood. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Himilcon, who had reached in two days the coast of the
     Catanaeans, hauled all the ships up on land, since a strong wind had arisen, and, while resting
     his forces for some days, sent ambassadors to the Campanians who held Aetne, urging them to
     revolt from Dionysius. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>He promised both to give them a large
     amount of territory and to let them share in the spoils of the war; he also informed them that
     the Campanians dwelling in Entella found no fault with the Carthaginians and took their side
     against the Sicilian Greeks, and he pointed out that as a general thing the Greeks as a race
     are the enemies of all other peoples. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But since the Campanians
     had given hostages to Dionysius and had sent their choicest troops to Syracuse, they were
     compelled to maintain the alliance with Dionysius, although they would gladly have joined the
     Carthaginians. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="62">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this Dionysius, who was in terror of the Carthaginians, sent his
     brother-in-law Polyxenus as ambassador both to the Greeks in Italy and to the Lacedaemonians,
     as well as the Corinthians, begging them to come to his aid and not to suffer the Greek cities
     of Sicily to be utterly destroyed. He also sent to the Peloponnesus men with ample funds to
     recruit mercenaries, ordering them to enlist as many soldiers as they could without regard to
     economy. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Himilcon decked his ships with the spoils taken from
     the enemy and put in at the great harbour of the Syracusans, and he caused great dismay among
     the inhabitants of the city. For two hundred and fifty ships of war entered the harbour, with
     oars flashing in order and richly decked with the spoils of war; then came the merchantmen, in
     excess of three thousand, laden with more than five hundred . . .; and the whole fleet numbered
     some two thousand vessels.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">What Diodorus wrote in this sentence can never be known.</note> The result was that the harbour of the Syracusans, despite
     its great size, was blocked up by the vessels and it was almost entirely concealed from view by
     the sails. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The ships had just come to anchor when at once from
     the other side the land army advanced, consisting, as some have reported, of three hundred
     thousand infantry and three thousand cavalry. The general of the armaments, Himilcon, took up
     his quarters in the temple of Zeus and the rest of the multitude encamped in the neighbourhood
     twelve stades from the city. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After this Himilcon led out the
     entire army and drew up his troops in battle order before the walls, challenging the Syracusans
     to battle; and he also sailed up to the harbours with a hundred of his finest ships in order to
     strike terror into the inhabitants of the city and to force them to concede that they were
     inferior at sea as well. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But when no one ventured to come out
     against him, for the time being he withdrew his troops to the camp and then for thirty days
     overran the countryside, cutting down the trees and laying it all waste, in order not only to
     satisfy the soldiers with every kind of plunder, but also to reduce the besieged to despair.

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="63">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Himilcon seized the suburb of Achradine; and he also plundered the temples of both
     Demeter and Core, for which acts of impiety against the divinity he quickly suffered a fitting
     penalty. For his fortune quickly worsened from day to day, and whenever Dionysius made bold to
     skirmish with him, the Syracusans had the better of it. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Also
     at night unaccountable tumults would arise in the camp and the soldiers would rush to arms,
     thinking that the enemy was attacking the palisade. To this was added a plague which was the
     cause of every kind of suffering. But of this we shall speak a little later, in order that our
     account may not anticipate the proper time. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when he threw a wall about the camp, Himilcon destroyed practically
     all the tombs in the area, among which was that of Gelon and his wife Demarete, of costly
      construction.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 11.38.4 f.</note> He also built

     them he brought wine and grain and all other provisions, believing that the siege would
     continue a long time. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He also dispatched merchant ships to
     Sardinia and Libya to secure grain and every kind of food. Polyxenus, the brother-in-law of
     Dionysius, arrived from the Peloponnesus and Italy, bringing thirty warships from his allies,

<div2 type="chapter" n="64">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this Dionysius and Leptines had set out with warships to escort a
     supply of provisions; and the Syracusans, who were thus left to themselves, seeing by chance a
     vessel approaching laden with food, sailed out against it with five ships, seized it, and
     brought it to the city. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Carthaginians put out against them
     with forty ships, whereupon the Syracusans manned all their ships and in the ensuing battle
     both captured the flag-ship and destroyed twenty-four of the remainder; and then, pursuing the
     fleeing ships as far as the enemy's anchorage, they challenged the Carthaginians to battle.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When the latter, confused at the unexpected turn of events,
     made no move, the Syracusans took the captured ships in tow and brought them to the city.
     Elated at their success and thinking how often Dionysius had met defeat, whereas they, without
     his presence, had won a victory over the Carthaginians, they were now puffed up with pride.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And as they gathered in groups they talked together about how
     they took no steps to end their slavery to Dionysius, even though they had an opportunity to
     depose him; for up until then they had been without arms,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >Cp. chap. 10.4.</note> but now because of the war they had weapons at their command.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Even while discussions of this kind were taking place,
     Dionysius sailed into the harbour and, calling an assembly, praised the Syracusans and urged
     them to be of good courage, promising that he would speedily put an end to the war. And he was
     on the point of dismissing the assembly when Theodorus, a Syracusan, who was held in high
     esteem among the cavalry and was considered a man of action, made bold to speak as follows in
     regard to their liberty. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="65">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>"Although Dionysius has introduced some falsehoods, the last
     statement he made was true: that he would speedily put an end to the war. He could accomplish
     this if he were no longer our commander&mdash;for he has often been defeated&mdash;but
     had returned to the citizens the freedom their fathers enjoyed. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />As things are, no one of us faces battle with good courage so long as victory differs not a
     whit from defeat; for if conquered, we shall have to obey the commands of the Carthaginians,
     and if conquerors, to have in Dionysius a harsher master than they would be. For even should
     the Carthaginians defeat us in war, they would only impose a fixed tribute and would not
     prevent us from governing the city in accordance with our ancient laws; but this man has
     plundered our temples, has taken the property of private citizens together with the lives of
     their owners, and pays a wage to servants to secure the enslavement of their masters. Such
     horrors as attend the storming of cities are perpetrated by him in time of peace, yet he
     promises to put an end to the war with the Carthaginians. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But
     it behooves us, fellow citizens, to put an end not only to the Phoenician war but to the tyrant
     within our walls. For the acropolis, which is guarded by the weapons of slaves, is a hostile
     redoubt in our city; the multitude of mercenaries has been gathered to hold the Syracusans in
     slavery; and he lords it over the city, not like a magistrate dispensing justice on equal
     terms, but like a dictator who by policy makes all decisions for his own advantage. For the
     time being the enemy possess a small portion of our territory, but Dionysius has devastated it
     all and given it to those who join in increasing his tyranny. <milestone unit="section" n="4" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>"How long, then, are we to be patient though we suffer such
     abuses as brave men endure to die rather than experience them? In battle against the
     Carthaginians we bravely face the final sacrifice, but against a harsh tyrant, in behalf of
     freedom and our fatherland, even in speech we no longer dare to raise our voices; we face in
     battle so many myriads of the enemy, but we stand in shivering fear of a single ruler, who has
     not the manliness of a superior slave. </p>

     our walls, full of confidence against his fellow citizens, but unable to bear even the sight of
     the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>As a consequence Gelon, by reason both of his high
     character and of his great deeds, received the leadership by the free will not only of the
     Syracusans but also of the Sicilian Greeks, while, as for this man whose generalship has led to
     the destruction of his allies and the enslavement of his fellow citizens, how can he escape the
     just hatred of all? For not only is he unworthy of leadership but, if justice were done, would
     die ten thousand deaths. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Because of him Gela and Camarina were
     subdued, Messene lies in total ruin, twenty thousand allies are perished in a sea-battle, and,
     in a word, we have been enclosed in one city and all the other Greek cities throughout Sicily
     have been destroyed. For in addition to his other malefactions he sold into slavery Naxos and
     Catane; he has completely destroyed cities that were allies, cities whose existence was
     opportune. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>With the Carthaginians he has fought two battles
     and has come out vanquished in each. Yet when he was entrusted with a generalship by the
     citizens but one time, he speedily robbed them of their freedom, slaying those who spoke openly
     on behalf of the laws and exiling the more wealthy; he gave the wives of the banished in
     marriage to slaves and to a motley throng; he put the weapons of citizens in the hands of
     barbarians and foreigners. And these deeds, O Zeus and all the gods, were the work of a public
     clerk, of a desperate man. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="67">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>"Where, then, is the Syracusans' love of freedom? Where the
     deeds of our ancestors? I say nothing of the three hundred thousand Carthaginians who were
     totally destroyed at Himera<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 11.22.</note>; I pass
     by the overthrow of the tyrants who followed Gelon.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 11.67-68.</note> But only yesterday, as it were, when the Athenians attacked Syracuse
     with such great armaments, our fathers left not a man free to carry back word of the disaster.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>And shall we, who have such great examples of our fathers'
     valour, take orders from Dionysius, especially when we have weapons in our hands? Surely some
     divine providence has gathered us here, with allies about us and weapons in our hands, for the
     purpose of recovering our freedom, and it is within our power this day to play the part of
     brave men and rid ourselves with one accord of our heavy yoke. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />For hitherto, while we were disarmed and without allies and guarded by a multitude of
     mercenaries, we have, I dare say, yielded to the pressure of circumstances; but now, since we
     have arms in our hands and allies to give us aid as well as bear witness of our bravery, let us
     not yield but make it clear that it was circumstances, not cowardice, that made us submit to
     slavery. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Are we not ashamed that we should have as commander
     in our wars the man who has plundered the temples of our city and that we choose as
     representative in such important matters a person to whom no man of good sense would entrust
     the management of his private affairs? And though all other peoples in times of war, because of
     the great perils they face, observe with the greatest care their obligations to the gods, do we
     expect that a man of such notorious impiety will put an end to the war? </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="68">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>"In
     fact, if a man cares to put a finer point on it, he will find that Dionysius is as wary of
     peace as he is of war. For he believes that, as matters stand, the Syracusans, because of their
     fear of the enemy, will not attempt anything against him, but that once the Carthaginians have
     been defeated they will claim their freedom, since they will have weapons in their hands and
     will be proudly conscious of their deeds. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Indeed this is the
     reason, in my opinion, why in the first war he betrayed Gela and Camarina<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 13.111.</note> and made these cities desolate, and why in his
     negotiations he agreed that most of the Greek cities should be given over to the enemy.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After this he broke faith in time of peace with Naxos and
     Catane and sold the inhabitants into slavery, razing one to the ground and giving the other to
     the Campanians from Italy to dwell in. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And when, after the
     destruction of these peoples, the rest of Sicily made many attempts to overthrow his tyranny,
     he again declared war upon the Carthaginians; for his scruple against breaking his agreement in
     violation of the oaths he had taken was not so great as his fear of the surviving
     concentrations of the Sicilian Greeks.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>"Moreover, it is obvious
     that he has been at all times on the alert to effect their destruction. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>First of all at Panormus, when the enemy were disembarking and were in
     bad physical condition after the stormy passage, he could have offered battle, but did not
     choose to do so. After that he stood idly by and sent no help to Messene, a city strategically
     situated and of great size, but allowed it to be razed, not only in order that the greatest
     possible number of Sicilian Greeks should perish, but also that the Carthaginians might
     intercept the reinforcements from Italy and the fleets from the Peloponnesus. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Last of all, he joined battle offshore at Catane, careless of the
     advantage of pitching battle near the city, where the vanquished could find safety in their own
     harbours. After the battle, when strong winds sprang up and the Carthaginians were forced to
     haul their fleet up on land, he had a most favourable opportunity for victory; <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>for the land forces of the enemy had not yet arrived and the violent
     storm was driving the enemy's ships on the shore. At that time, if we had all attacked on land,
     the only outcomes left the enemy would have been, either to be captured with ease, if they left
     their ships, or to strew the coast with wreckage, if they matched their strength against the
     waves. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="69">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>"But to lodge accusations against Dionysius at greater length among
     Syracusans is, I should judge, not necessary. For if men who have suffered in very deed such
     irretrievable ruin are not roused to rage, will they, forsooth, be moved by words to wreak
     vengeance upon him&mdash;men too who have seen his behaviour as the worst of citizens, the
     harshest of tyrants, the most ignoble of all generals? <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For as
     often as we have stood in line of battle under his command, so often have we been defeated,
     whereas but just now, when we fought independently, we defeated with a few ships the enemy's
     entire force. We should, therefore, seek out another leader, to avoid fighting under a general
     who has pillaged the shrines of the gods and so finding ourselves engaged in a war against the
     gods; <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>for it is manifest that heaven opposes those who have
     selected the worst enemy of religion to be their commander. Noting that when he is present our
     armies in full force suffer defeat, whereas, when he is absent, even a small detachment is
     sufficient to defeat the Carthaginians, should not all men see in this the visible presence of
     the gods? <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Therefore, fellow citizens, if he is willing to lay
     down his office of his own accord, let us allow him to leave the city with his possessions; but
     if he does not choose to do so, we have at the present moment the fairest opportunity to assert
     our freedom. We are all gathered together; we have weapons in our hands; we have allies about
     us, not only the Greeks from Italy but also those from the Peloponnesus. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The chief command must be given, according to the laws, either to
     citizens, or to the Corinthians who dwell in our mother-city, or to the Spartans who are the
     first power in Greece." </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="70">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this speech by Theodorus the Syracusans were in high
     spirits and kept their eyes fixed on their allies; and when Pharacidas the Lacedaemonian, the
     admiral of the allies, stepped up to the platform, all expected that he would take the lead for
     liberty. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But he was on friendly terms with the tyrant and
     declared that the Lacedaemonians had dispatched him to aid the Syracusans and Dionysius against
     the Carthaginians, not to overthrow the rule of Dionysius. At this statement so contrary to
     expectation the mercenaries flocked about Dionysius, and the Syracusans in dismay made no move,
     although they called down many curses on the Spartans. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For on
     a previous occasion Aretes<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. chap. 10 above, where he is called Aristus.</note> the Lacedaemonian, at the time that he was asserting the right of the
     Syracusans to freedom, had betrayed them, and now at this time Pharacidas vetoed the movement
     of the Syracusans. For the moment Dionysius was in great fear and dissolved the assembly, but
     later he won the favour of the multitude by kindly words, honouring some of them with gifts and
     inviting some to general banquets. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the Carthaginians had seized the suburb and pillaged the temple of Demeter and
     Core, a plague struck the army. Over and above the disaster sent by influence of the deity,
     there were contributing causes: that myriads of people were gathered together, that it was the
     time of the year which is most productive of plagues, and that the particular summer had
     brought unusually hot weather. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>It also seems likely that the
     place itself was responsible for the excessive extent of the disaster; for on a former occasion
     the Athenians too, who occupied the same camp, had perished in great numbers from the
      plague,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 13.12.</note> since the terrain was
     marshy and in a hollow. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>First, before sunrise, because of the
     cold from the breeze over the waters, their bodies were struck with chills, but in the middle
     of the day the heat was stifling, as must be the case when so great a multitude is gathered
     together in a narrow place. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="71">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the plague first attacked the Libyans, and, as many of
     them perished, at first they buried the dead, but later, both because of the multitude of
     corpses and because those who tended the sick were seized by the plague, no one dared approach
     the suffering.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Perhaps the text added: "or the dead."</note> When even nursing was thus omitted, there was no remedy for the disaster.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For by reason of the stench of the unburied and the miasma
     from the marshes, the plague began with a catarrh; then came a swelling in the throat;
     gradually burning sensations ensued, pains in the sinews of the back, and a heavy feeling in
     the limbs; then dysentery supervened and pustules upon the whole surface of the body.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In most cases this was the course of the disease; but some
     became mad and totally lost their memory; they circulated through the camp, out of their mind,
     and struck at anyone they met. In general, as it turned out, even help by physicians was of no
     avail both because of the severity of the disease and the swiftness of the death; for death
     came on the fifth day or on the sixth at the latest, amidst such terrible tortures that all
     looked upon those who had fallen in the war as blessed. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In
     fact all who watched beside the sick were struck by the plague, and thus the lot of the ill was
     miserable, since no one was willing to minister to the unfortunate. For not only did any not
     akin abandon one another, but even brothers were forced to desert brothers, friends to
     sacrifice friends out of fear for their own lives.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Hans
      Zinsser (<title>Rats, Lice and History,</title> pp. 124-127) thinks that this plague was "the severe, confluent type of smallpox in which death on the fifth or sixth day is not
      exceptional," despite the fact that there is almost general agreement among scholars that
      smallpox was not known in the Greek and Roman classical period.</note>

<div2 type="chapter" n="72">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Dionysius heard of the disaster that had struck the Carthaginians, he manned
     eighty ships and ordered Pharacidas and Leptines the admirals to attack the enemy's ships at
     daybreak, while he himself, profiting by a moonless night, made a circuit with his army and,
     passing by the temple of Cyane,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 5.4.</note>
     arrived near the camp of the enemy at daybreak before they were aware of it. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The cavalry and a thousand infantry from the mercenaries were dispatched
     in advance against that part of the Carthaginian encampment which extended toward the interior.
     These mercenaries were the most hostile, beyond all others, to Dionysius and had engaged time
     and again in factional quarrels and uproars. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Consequently
     Dionysius had issued orders to the cavalry that as soon as they came to blows with the enemy
     they should flee and leave the mercenaries in the lurch; when this order had been carried out
     and the mercenaries had been slain to a man, Dionysius set about laying siege to both the camp
     and the forts. While the barbarians were still dismayed at the unexpected attack and bringing
     up reinforcements in disorderly fashion, he on his part took by storm the fort known as
     Polichna; and on the opposite side the cavalry, aided in an attack by some of the triremes,
     stormed the area around Dascon. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At once all the warships
     joined in the attack, and when the army raised the war-cry at the taking of the forts, the
     barbarians were in a state of panic. For at the outset they had rushed in a body against the
     land troops in order to ward off the assailants of the camp; but when they saw the fleet also
     coming up to attack, they turned back to give help to the naval station. The swift course of
     events, however, outstripped them and their haste was without result. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For even as they were mounting the decks and manning the triremes, the enemy's vessels,
     driven on by rowers, struck the ships athwart in many cases. Now one well-delivered blow would
     sink a damaged ship; but blows in repeated rammings, which broke through the nailed timbers,
     struck terrible dismay into the opponents. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Since all about the
     mightiest ships were being shattered, the rending of the vessels by the crushing blows raised a
     great noise and the shore extending along the scene of the battle was strewn with corpses.

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="73">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Syracusans, eagerly co-operating in their success, rivalled one another in great
     zeal to be the first to board the enemy's ships, and surrounding the barbarians, who were
     terror-stricken at the magnitude of the peril they faced, put them to death. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Nor did the infantry who were attacking the naval station show less zeal
     than the others, and among them, it so happened, was Dionysius himself, who had ridden on
     horseback to the section about Dascon. Finding there forty ships of fifty oars, which had been
     drawn up on the beach, and beside them merchant ships and some triremes at anchor, they set
     fire to them. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Quickly the flame leaped up into the sky and,
     spreading over a large area, caught the shipping, and none of the merchants or owners was able
     to bring any help because of the violence of the blaze. Since a strong wind arose, the fire was
     carried from the ships drawn up on land to the merchantmen lying at anchor. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When the crews dived into the water from fear of suffocation and the
     anchor cables were burnt off, the ships came into collision because of the rough seas, some of
     them being destroyed as they struck one another, and others as the wind drove them about, but
     the majority of them were victims of the fire. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Thereupon, as
     the flames swept up through the sails of the merchant-ships and consumed the yard-arms, the
     sight was like a scene from the theatre to the inhabitants of the city and the destruction of
     the barbarians resembled that of men struck by lightning from heaven for their impiety.

<div2 type="chapter" n="74">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Forthwith, elated by the Syracusan successes, both the oldest youths and such aged men
     as were not yet entirely incapacitated by years manned lighters, and approaching without order
     all together made for the ships in the harbour. Those which the fire had ruined they plundered,
     stripping them of anything that could be saved, and such as were undamaged they took in tow and
     brought to the city. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Thus even those who by age were exempt
     from war duties were unable to restrain themselves, but in their excessive joy their ardent
     spirit prevailed over their age. When the news of the victory ran through the city, children
     and women, together with their households, left their homes, everyone hurrying to the walls,
     and the whole extent was crowded with spectators. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Of these
     some raised their hands to heaven and returned thanks to the gods, and others declared that the
     barbarians had suffered the punishment of heaven for their plundering of the temples.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For from a distance the sight resembled a battle with the
     gods, such a number of ships going up in fire, the flames leaping aloft among the sails, the
     Greeks applauding every success with great shouting, and the barbarians in their consternation
     at the disaster keeping up a great uproar and confused crying. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />But as night came the battle ceased for the time, and Dionysius kept to the field against the
     barbarians, pitching a camp near the temple of Zeus. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="75">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now that the Carthaginians
     had suffered defeat on land as well as on sea, they entered into negotiations with Dionysius
     without the knowledge of the Syracusans. They asked him to allow their remaining troops to
     cross back to Libya and promised to give him the three hundred talents which they had there in
     their camp. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Dionysius replied that he would not be able to
     allow the whole army to escape, but he consented to their citizen troops alone withdrawing
     secretly at night by sea; for he knew that the Syracusans and their allies would not allow him
     to make any such terms with the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Dionysius acted as he
     did to avoid the total destruction of the Carthaginian army, in order that the Syracusans, by
     reason of their fear of the Carthaginians, should never find a time of ease to assert their
     freedom. Accordingly Dionysius agreed that the flight of the Carthaginians should take place by
     night on the fourth day hence and led his army back into the city. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Himilcon during the night conveyed the three hundred
     talents to the acropolis and delivered them to the persons stationed on the island by the
     tyrant, and then himself, when the time agreed upon had arrived, manned forty triremes during
     the night with the citizens of Carthage and began his flight, abandoning all the rest of his
     army. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>He had already made his way across the harbour, when
     some of the Corinthians observed his flight and speedily reported it to Dionysius. Since
     Dionysius took his time in calling the soldiers to arms and gathering the commanders, the
     Corinthians did not wait for him but speedily put out to sea against the Carthaginians, and
     vying with each other in their rowing they caught up with the last Phoenician ships, which they
     shattered with their rams and sent to the bottom. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>After this
     Dionysius led out the army, but the Siceli, who were serving in the army of the Carthaginians,
     forestalling the Syracusans, fled through the interior and, almost to a man, made their way in
     safety to their native homes. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Dionysius stationed guards at
     intervals along the roads and then led his army against the enemy's camp, while it was still
     night. The barbarians, abandoned as they were by their general, by the Carthaginians, and by
     the Siceli as well, were dispirited and fled in dismay. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Some
     were taken captive as they fell in with the guards on the roads, but the majority threw down
     their arms, surrendered themselves, and asked only that their lives be spared. Some Iberians
     alone massed together with their arms and dispatched a herald to treat about taking service
     with him. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Dionysius made peace with the Iberians and enrolled
     them in his mercenaries,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">These Iberians turn up later

     had in their hands practically all the cities of Sicily with the exception of Syracuse and
     expected its capture, of a sudden were forced to be anxious for their own fatherland; they who
     overthrew the tombs of the Syracusans gazed upon one hundred and fifty thousand dead lying in
     heaps and unburied because of the plague; they who wasted with fire the territory of the
     Syracusans now in their turn saw their own fleet of a sudden go up in flames; they who so
     arrogantly sailed with their whole armada into the harbour and flaunted their successes before
     the Syracusans had little thought that they were to steal away by night and leave their allies
     at the mercy of their enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The general himself, who had
     taken the temple of Zeus for his headquarters and the pillaged wealth of the sanctuaries for
     his own possession, slipped away in disgrace to Carthage with a few survivors, in order that he
     might not by dying and paying a debt to nature go unscathed for his acts of impiety, but should
     in his native land lead a life that was notorious, while reproaches were heaped on him on every
     hand. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Indeed, so calamitous was his lot that he went about the
     temples of the city in the cheapest clothing, charging himself with impiety and offering
     acknowledged retribution to heaven for his sins against the gods. In the end he passed sentence
     of death upon himself and starved himself to death. And he bequeathed to his fellow citizens a

<div2 type="chapter" n="77">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the news of the Carthaginian disaster had spread throughout Libya,
     their allies, who had long hated the oppressive rule of the Carthaginians and even more at this

      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Consequently, being led on partly by anger and partly by
     contempt for them because of the disaster they had suffered, they endeavoured to assert their
     independence. After exchanging messages with one another they collected an army, moved orward,
     and pitched camp in the open. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Since they were speedily joined
     not only by freemen but also by slaves, there was gathered in a short time a body of two
     hundred thousand men. Seizing Tynes, a city situated not far from Carthage, they based their
     line of battle on it, and since they had the better of the fighting, they confined the
     Phoenicians within their walls. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Carthaginians, against
     whom the gods were clearly fighting, at first gathered in small groups and in great confusion
     and besought the deity to put an end to its wrath; thereupon the entire city was seized by
     superstitious fear and dread, as every man anticipated in imagination the enslavement of the
     city. Consequently they voted by every means to propitiate the gods who had been sinned
     against. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Since they had included neither Core nor Demeter in
     their rites, they appointed their most renowned citizens to be priests of these goddesses, and
     consecrating statues of them with all solemnity, they conducted their rites, following the
     ritual used by the Greeks. They also chose out the most prominent Greeks who lived among them
     and assigned them to the service of the goddesses. After this they constructed ships and made
     careful provision of supplies for the war. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Meanwhile the revolters, who were a motley mass, possessed no capable
     commanders, and what was of first importance, they were short of provisions because they were
     so numerous, while the Carthaginians brought supplies by sea from Sardinia. Furthermore, they
     quarrelled among themselves over the supreme command and some of them were bought off with
     Carthaginian money and deserted the common cause. As a result, both because of the lack of
     provisions and because of treachery on the part of some, they broke up and scattered to their
     native lands, thus relieving the Carthaginians of the greatest fear.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was the state of affairs in Libya at this time. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="78">

     forth his army into the Plain of Cayster and the country around Sipylus and ravaged the
     possessions of the inhabitants. Tissaphernes, gathering ten thousand cavalry and fifty thousand
     infantry, followed close on the Lacedaemonians and cut down any who became separated from the
     main body while plundering. Agesilaus formed his soldiers in a square and clung to the
     foothills of Mt. Sipylus, awaiting a favourable opportunity to attack the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He overran the countryside as far as Sardis and ravaged the orchards and
     the pleasure-park belonging to Tissaphernes, which had been artistically laid out at great
     expense with plants and all other things that contribute to luxury and the enjoyment in peace
     of the good things of life. He then turned back, and when he was midway between Sardis and
     Thybarnae, he dispatched by night the Spartan Xenocles with fourteen hundred soldiers to a

     followed, he raised the signal to the soldiers in ambush and they, chanting the battle song,

     were hated by their allies because of their harsh rule, it would be an easy matter to overthrow
     their supremacy, given that the strongest states were of one mind. First of all, they set up a
     common Council in Corinth to which they sent representatives to form plans, and worked out in
     common the arrangements for the war. Then they dispatched ambassadors to the cities and caused
     many allies of the Lacedaemonians to withdraw from them; <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>for

      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>After the troops had arrived Medius seized Pharsalus, in
     which there was a garrison of Lacedaemonians, and sold the inhabitants as booty. After this the
     Boeotians and Argives, parting company with Medius, seized Heracleia in Trachis; and on being
     admitted at night within the walls by certain persons, they put to the sword the Lacedaemonians
     whom they seized but allowed the other Peloponnesians to leave with their possessions.
      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>They then summoned to the city the Trachinians whom the
     Lacedaemonians had banished from their homes,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">See chap. 38.4-5.</note> and gave them the city as their dwelling place; and indeed they were the most
     ancient settlers of this territory. After this Ismenias, the leader of the Boeotians, left the
     Argives in the city to serve as its garrison and himself persuaded the Aenianians and the
     Athamanians to revolt from the Lacedaemonians and gathered soldiers from among them and their
     allies. After he had recruited a little less than six thousand men, he took the field against
     the Phocians. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>While he was taking up quarters in Naryx in
     Locris, which men say was the birthplace of Ajax, the people of the Phocians came against him
     in arms under the command of Alcisthenes the Laconian. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>A sharp
     and protracted battle followed, in which the Boeotians were the victors. Pursuing the fugitives
     until nightfall, they slew not many less than a thousand, but lost of their own troops in the
     battle about five hundred. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>After the pitched battle both

     his own ship against them, believing ignoble flight to be disgraceful and unworthy of Sparta.
      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>After fighting brilliantly and slaying many of the enemy, in
     the end he was overcome, battling in a manner worthy of his native land. Conon pursued the
     Lacedaemonians as far as the land and captured fifty of their triremes. As for the crews, most

     these parts of the island had been the possession of the Siceli, when Greeks first landed there
     and founded Naxos, expelling from that very hill the Siceli who were then dwelling on it.
     Maintaining, therefore, that they had only recovered territory that belonged to their fathers
     and were justly righting the wrongs which the Greeks had committed against their ancestors,
     they put forth every effort to hold the hill. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>While
     extraordinary rivalry was being displayed on both sides, the winter solstice occurred, and
     because of the consequent winter storms the area about the acropolis was filled with snow.
     Thereupon Dionysius, who had discovered that the Siceli were careless in their guard of the
     acropolis because of its strength and the unusual height of the wall, advanced on a moonless
     and stormy night against the loftiest sectors. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After many
     difficulties both because of the obstacles offered by the crags and because of the great depth
     of the snow he occupied one peak, although his face was frosted and his vision impaired by the
     cold. After this he broke through to the other side and led his army into the city. But when
     the Siceli came up in a body, the troops of Dionysius were thrust out and Dionysius himself was
     struck on the corslet in the flight, sent scrambling, and barely escaped being taken alive.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Since the Siceli pressed upon them from superior ground, more
     than six hundred of Dionysius' troops were slain and most of them lost their complete armour,
     while Dionysius himself saved only his corslet. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>After this
     disaster the Acragantini and Messenians banished the partisans of Dionysius, asserted their

     he showed kindness to the subject cities and received the victims of Dionysius' wars. He also
     formed alliances with most of the Siceli and, after gathering armaments, launched an attack
     upon the territory of Messene. After ravaging the countryside and seizing much booty he marched
     from that place and went into camp near the city of Abacaene, which was his ally. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When Dionysius came up with his army, the forces drew up for battle, and
     after a sharp engagement Dionysius was the victor. The Carthaginians fled into the city after a
     loss of more than eight hundred men, while Dionysius withdrew for the time being to Syracuse;
     but after a few days he manned one hundred triremes and set out against the Rhegians.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Arriving unexpectedly by night before the city, he put fire
     to the gates and set ladders against the walls. The Rhegians, coming up in defence as they did
     at first in small numbers, endeavoured to put out the flames, but later, when their general
     Heloris arrived and advised them to do just the opposite, they saved the city. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For if they had put out the fire, they would not have been strong enough
     to prevent Dionysius from entering, being far too small a number; but by bringing firewood and
     timbers from the neighbouring houses they made the flames higher, until the main body of their
     troops could assemble in arms and come to the defence. <milestone unit="section" n="7" />Dionysius, who had failed of his design, traversed the countryside, wasting it in flames and

     off from retreat to their native soil. Making their appearance, which was quite unexpected and
     unconcealed, on the height, they filled the Greeks with dismay, both because of the great size
     of the army and because of the difficulty of the terrain; for the Leucanians had at the time
     thirty thousand infantry and no less than four thousand cavalry. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="102">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the Greeks were
     to their surprise caught in such hopeless peril as we have described, the barbarians descended
     into the plain. A battle took place and there fell of the Italian Greeks, overwhelmed as they
     were by the multitude of the Leucanians, more than ten thousand men, since the Leucanians gave
     orders to save no one alive. Of the survivors some fled to a height on the sea, and others,
     seeing warships sailing toward them and thinking they belonged to the Rhegians, fled in a body
     to the sea and swam out to the triremes. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The approaching fleet
     belonged to Dionysius the tyrant, under command of his brother Leptines, and had been sent to
     the aid of the Leucanians. Leptines received the swimmers kindly, set them on land, and
     persuaded the Leucanians to accept a mina<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">c. $18.00.</note> of silver for each captive, the number of whom was over a thousand. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Leptines went surety for the ransom money, reconciled the Italian Greeks
     with the Leucanians, and persuaded them to conclude peace. He won great acclaim among the
     Italian Greeks, having settled the war, as he had, to his own advantage, but without any profit
     to Dionysius. For Dionysius hoped that, if the Italian Greeks were embroiled in war with the
     Leucanians, he might appear and easily make himself master of affairs in Italy, but if they
     were rid of such a dangerous war, his success would be difficult. Consequently he relieved
     Leptines of his command<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Leptines later went into exile for a time with the Thurians, who naturally showed him every courtesy (Book 15.7.3-4).</note> and
     appointed Thearides, his other brother, commander of the fleet. <milestone unit="section" n="4" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Subsequent to these events the Romans portioned out in

     the year had ended, in Athens Antipater was archon, and in Rome Lucius Valerius and Aulus
     Mallius administered the consular magistracy. This year Dionysius, the lord of the Syracusans,
     openly indicated his design of an attack on Italy and set forth from Syracuse with a most
     formidable force. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He had more than twenty thousand infantry,
     some three thousand cavalry, forty ships of war, and not less than three hundred vessels
     transporting food supplies. On arriving at Messene on the fifth day he rested his troops in the
     city, while he dispatched his brother Thearides with thirty ships to the islands of the
     Liparaeans, since he had learned that ten ships of the Rhegians were in those waters.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Thearides, sailing forth and coming upon the ten Rhegian
     ships in a place favourable to his purpose, seized the ships together with their crews and
     speedily returned to Dionysius at Messene. Dionysius threw the prisoners in chains and turned
     them over to the custody of the Messenians; then he transported his army to Caulonia, laid
     siege to the city, advanced his siege-engines, and launched frequent assaults. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the Greeks of Italy learned that the
     armaments of Dionysius were starting to move across the strait which separated them, they in
     turn mustered their forces. Since the city of the Crotoniates was the most heavily populated
     and had the largest number of exiles from Syracuse, they gave over to them the command of the
     war, <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>and the people of Croton gathered troops from every
     quarter and chose as general Heloris the Syracusan. Since this man had been banished by
     Dionysius and was considered by all to possess action and enterprise, it was believed that he
     could be best trusted, because of his hatred, to lead a war against the tyrant. When all the
     allies had gathered in Croton, Heloris disposed them to his liking and advanced with the entire
     army toward Caulonia. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>He calculated that he would by his
     appearance at the same time both relieve the siege and also be in combat with the enemy worn
     out by their daily assaults. In all he had about twenty-five thousand infantry and two thousand
     cavalry. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="104">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Italian Greeks had accomplished the major part of their march and were
     encamped on the Eleporus River, when Dionysius drew off from the city and advanced to meet
     them. Now Heloris was in the van of his army with five hundred of his choicest troops and
     Dionysius, as it happened, was encamped forty stades from the enemy. On learning from his
     scouts that the enemy was near, he roused his army at early light and led it forward.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Meeting at day-break the troops of Heloris, who were few in
     number, he engaged them in unexpected battle, and since he had his army ready for combat, he
     gave the enemy not a moment to recover themselves. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Though
     Heloris found himself in desperate straits, he withstood the attackers with what troops he had,
     while he sent some of his friends to the camp, urging them to rush up the main body of
     soldiers. These speedily carried out their orders, and when the Italian Greeks learned of the
     danger facing their general and his troops, they came to their aid on the run. Meanwhile
     Dionysius, with his troops in close order, surrounded Heloris and his men and slew them almost
     to a man, though they offered a gallant resistance. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Since the
     Italian Greeks in their haste entered the fighting in scattered groups, the Sicilian Greeks,
     who kept their lines intact, experienced no difficulty in overcoming the enemy. Nevertheless,
     the Greeks of Italy maintained the fight for some time, although they saw their comrades
     falling in great numbers. But when they learned of the death of their general, while being
     greatly hampered as they fell foul of one another in their confusion, then at last they
     completely lost spirit and turned in flight. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="105">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Many were killed in their rout across the
     plain; but the main body made a safe retreat to a hill, which was strong enough to withstand a
     siege but had no water and could be easily contained by the enemy. Dionysius invested the hill
     and bivouacked under arms that day and through the night, giving careful attention to the
     watches. The next day the beleagured suffered severely from the heat and lack of water.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They then sent a herald to Dionysius inviting him to accept
     ransom; he, however, did not preserve moderation in his success but ordered them to lay down
     their arms and put themselves at the disposal of their conqueror. This was a harsh order and
     they held out for some time; but when they were overborne by physical necessity, they
     surrendered about the eighth hour, their bodies being now weakened. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Dionysius took a staff and struck it on the ground while numbering the prisoners as
     they descended, and they amounted to more than ten thousand. All men were apprehensive of his
     brutality, but on the contrary he showed himself most kindly; <milestone unit="section" n="4" />for he let the prisoners go subject to no authority without ransom, concluded peace with most
     of the cities, and left them independent. In return for this he received the approval of those
     he had favoured and was honoured with gold crowns; and men believed that this would probably be
     the finest act of his life. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="106">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dionysius now advanced against Rhegium and prepared to lay

     distress gripped the Rhegians, since they had neither allies nor an army that was a match for

     entreaty would be left them. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Therefore they decided to
     dispatch ambassadors to entreat him to deal moderately with them and to urge him to make no
     decision against them beyond what became a human being. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />Dionysius required three hundred talents of them, took all their ships, which amounted to
     seventy, and ordered the delivery of one hundred hostages. When all these had been turned over,
     he set out against Caulonia. The inhabitants of this city he transplanted to Syracuse, gave
     them citizenship, and allowed them exemption from taxes for five years; he then levelled the
     city to the ground and gave the territory of the Cauloniates to the Locrians. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Romans, after taking the city of

     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When these men had entered office, Dionysius, the lord of the
     Syracusans, advanced with his army to Hipponium, removed its inhabitants to Syracuse, razed the
     city to the ground, and apportioned its territory to the Locrians. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For he was continuously set upon doing the Locrians favours for the marriage they had
     agreed to, whereas he studied revenge upon the Rhegians for their affront with respect to the
     offer of kinship. For on the occasion when he sent ambassadors to them to ask them to grant him
     in marriage a maiden of their city, the Rhegians replied to the ambassadors by action of the
     people, we are told, that the only maiden they would agree to his marrying would be the
     daughter of their public executioner. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Angered because of this
     and believing that he had been grossly insulted, he was bent on getting revenge upon them.
     Indeed the peace he had concluded with them in the preceding year had come from no hankering on
     his part for friendly relations, but was designed to strip them of their naval power, which
     consisted of seventy triremes. For he believed that if the city were cut off from aid by sea he
     could easily reduce it by siege. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently, while loitering
     in Italy, he kept seeking a plausible excuse whereby he might seem to have broken the truce
     without prejudice to his own standing. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="108">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dionysius now led his forces to the
     Strait and made preparations to cross over. And first he asked the Rhegians to provide him with
     supplies for sale, promising that he would promptly return from Syracuse what they had given.
     He made this request in order that men should think that, if they did not provide the food, he
     would be justified in seizing the city, whereas if they did, he believed their food would run
     out and by sitting down before the city he would speedily master it by starvation. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Rhegians, suspecting nothing of this, at first supplied them
     lavishly with food for several days; but when he kept extending his stay, at one time claiming
     illness and at another offering other excuses, they suspected what he had in mind and no longer
     furnished his army with supplies. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Dionysius, pretending now to
     be angered at this, returned the hostages to the Rhegians, laid siege to the city, and launched
     daily assaults upon it. He also constructed a great multitude of siege weapons of unbelievable
     size by which he rocked the walls in his determination to take the city by storm. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Rhegians chose Phyton as general, armed all who could bear arms,
     gave close concern to their watches, and, as opportunity arose, sallied out and burned the
     enemy's siege engines. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Fighting brilliantly as they did for
     their fatherland on many occasions before the walls, they roused the anger of the enemy, and
     although they lost many of their own troops, they also slew no small number of the Sicilian
     Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And it happened that Dionysius himself was struck by a
     lance in the groin and barely escaped death, recovering with difficulty from the wound. The
     siege wore on because of the unsurpassable zeal the Rhegians displayed to maintain their
     freedom; but Dionysius held his armaments to the daily assaults and would not give up the task
     he had originally proposed to himself. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="109">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Olympic Games were at hand and
     Dionysius dispatched to the contest several four-horse teams, which far surpassed all others in
     swiftness, and also pavilions for the festive occasion, which were interwoven with gold and
     embellished with expensive cloth of gay and varied colours. He also sent the best professional
     reciters that they might present his poems in the gathering and thus win glory for the name of
     Dionysius, for he was madly addicted to poetry. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In charge of
     all this he sent along his brother Thearides. When Thearides arrived at the gathering, he was a
     centre of attraction for the beauty of the pavilions and the large number of four-horse teams;
     and when the reciters began to present the poems of Dionysius, at first the multitude thronged
     together because of the pleasing voices of the actors and all were filled with wonder. But on
     second consideration, when they observed how poor his verses were, they laughed Dionysius to
     scorn and went so far in their rejection that some of them even ventured to rifle the tents.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Indeed the orator Lysias,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Of Athens.</note> who was at that time in Olympia, urged the multitude not to
     admit to the sacred festival the representatives from a most impious tyranny; and at this time
     he delivered his <title>Olympiacus.</title><note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Enough of the
      oration is preserved (<bibl n="Lys. 33">Lys. 33</bibl>) to show that Lysias urged the Greeks
      to unite against their two great enemies, the Persian King and Dionysius. Plutarch (<bibl n="P">Plut. Them. 25</bibl>), on the authority of Theophrastus, tells a similar story of c.
       <date value="-470">470</date> B.C. when Hiero of Syracuse is represented as sending chariot
      horses and a costly pavilion to Olympia and Themistocles as urging that the pavilion be torn
      down and the horses prevented from competing. The story is clearly a pure fabrication based on
      this account of Diodorus (see Walker in <title>Camb. Anc. Hist.</title> 5, p. 36).</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In the course of the contest chance brought it about that some
     of Dionysius' chariots left the course and others collided among themselves and were wrecked.
     Likewise the ship which was on its way to Sicily carrying the representatives from the games
     was wrecked by strong winds near Taras<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Tarentum.</note> in
     Italy. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Consequently the sailors who got safe to Syracuse
     spread the story throughout the city, we are told, that the badness of the verses caused the
     ill-success, not only of the reciters, but of the teams and of the ship with them. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When Dionysius learned of the ridicule that had been heaped upon his
     verses, his flatterers told him that every fair accomplishment is first an object of envy and
     then of admiration. He therefore did not give up his devotion to writing. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Romans fought a battle at Gurasium

     were hard put to it by their double war, that against the Greeks and that against the Persians,
     dispatched their admiral Antalcidas to Artaxerxes to treat for peace. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Antalcidas discussed as well as he could the circumstances of his mission and the King
     agreed to make peace on the following terms: "The Greek cities of Asia are subject to the King,

     opposition, but the Athenians and Thebans and some of the other Greeks were deeply concerned
     that the cities of Asia should be left in the lurch. But since they were not by themselves a

<div2 type="chapter" n="111">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It was about the eleventh month of Dionysius' siege of
     Rhegium, and since he had cut off relief from every direction, the inhabitants of the city were
     faced by a terrible dearth of the necessities of life. We are told, indeed, that at the time a
     medimnus of wheat among the Rhegians cost five minas.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >About $60 a bushel.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>So reduced were they by lack of food that at first they ate
     their horses and other beasts of burden, then fed upon boiled skins and leather, and finally
     they would go out from the city and eat the grass near the walls like so many cattle. To such
     an extent did the demand of nature compel the wants of man to turn for their satisfaction to
     the food of dumb animals. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When Dionysius learned what was
     taking place, far from showing mercy to those who were perforce suffering beyond man's
     endurance, on the contrary he brought in cattle to clear the place of the green-stuff, with the
     result that it was completely stripped. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Consequently the
     Rhegians, overcome by their excessive hardships, surrendered their city to the tyrant, giving
     him complete power over their lives. Within the city Dionysius found heaps of dead who had
     perished from lack of food, and the living too whom he captured were like dead men and weakened
     in body. He got together more than six thousand captives and the multitude he sent off to
     Syracuse with orders that those who could pay as ransom a mina of silver should be freed, but
     to sell as slaves those who were unable to raise that sum. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="112">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dionysius seized Phyton, the
     general of the Rhegians, and drowned his son in the sea, but Phyton himself he at first bound
     on his loftiest siege engines, wreaking a vengeance upon him such as is to be seen upon the
     stage of tragedy. He also sent one of his servants to him to tell him that Dionysius had
     drowned his son in the sea the day before; to whom Phyton replied, "He has been more fortunate
     than his father by one day." <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>After this Dionysius had him led
     about the city under flogging and subjected to every indignity, a herald accompanying him and
     announcing that Dionysius was inflicting this unusual vengeance upon the man because he had
     persuaded the city to undertake the war. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But Phyton, who had
     shown himself a brave general during the siege and had won approval for all his other
     qualities, endured his mortal punishment with no low-born spirit. Rather he preserved his
     spirit undaunted and cried out that he was punished because he would not betray the city to
     Dionysius, and that heaven would soon visit such punishment upon Dionysius himself. The courage
     of the man aroused sympathy even among the soldiers of Dionysius, and some of them began to
     protest. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Dionysius, fearing that some of the soldiers might
     make bold to snatch Phyton out of his hands, ceased to punish him and drowned the unfortunate
     man at sea together with his near of kin. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>So this man suffered
     monstrous tortures unworthy of his merits. He won many of the Greeks to grieve for him at the

     twelve cities of Tyrrhenia; but others state that before the Trojan War Pelasgians fled from
     Thessaly to escape the flood of Deucalion's time and settled in this region. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now it happened, when the Celts divided up the territory by tribes, that
     those known as the Sennones received the area which lay farthest from the mountains and along
     the sea. But since this region was scorching hot, they were distressed and eager to move; hence
     they armed their younger men and sent them out to seek a territory where they might settle. Now
     they invaded Tyrrhenia, and being in number some thirty thousand they sacked the territory of
     the Clusini. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this very time
     the Roman people sent ambassadors<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Three, all of the Fabian gens.</note> into Tyrrhenia to spy out the army of the Celts. The ambassadors arrived at
     Clusium, and when they saw that a battle had been joined, with more valour than wisdom they

      one<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Quintus Fabius Ambustus.</note> of the ambassadors
     was successful in killing a rather important commander. When the Celts learned of this, they
     dispatched ambassadors to Rome to demand the person of the envoy who had thus commenced an
     unjust war. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The senate at first sought to persuade the envoys
     of the Celts to accept money in satisfaction of the injury, but when they would not consider
     this, it voted to surrender the accused. But the father of the man to be surrendered, who was

     seventy thousand men. The military tribunes of the Romans, exercising their special power, when
     they heard of the advance of the Celts, armed all the men of military age. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They then marched out in full force and, crossing the Tiber,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Diodorus is the only ancient writer who places this battle of the Allia on the right, and not the left, bank of the Tiber.</note> led their troops for

     soldiers of the Romans, easily drove them from the hills. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />Consequently, as these fled in masses to the Romans on the plain, the ranks were thrown into
     confusion and fled in dismay before the attack of the Celts. Since the bulk of the Romans fled
     along the river and impeded one another by reason of their disorder, the Celts were not
     behind-hand in slaying again and again those who were last in line. Hence the entire plain was
     strewn with dead. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Of the men who fled to the river the bravest
     attempted to swim across with their arms, prizing their armour as highly as their lives; but
     since the stream ran strong, some of them were borne down to their death by the weight of the
     arms, and some, after being carried along for some distance, finally and after great effort got
     off safe. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>But since the enemy pressed them hard and was making
     a great slaughter along the river, most of the survivors threw away their arms and swam across
     the Tiber. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="115">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Celts, though they had slain great numbers on the bank of the river,
     nevertheless did not desist from the zest for glory but showered javelins upon the swimmers;
     and since many missiles were hurled and men were massed in the river, those who threw did not
     miss their mark. So it was that some died at once from mortal blows, and others, who were
     wounded only, were carried off unconscious because of loss of blood and the swift current.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When such disaster befell, the greater part of the Romans who
     escaped occupied the city of Veii, which had lately been razed by them, fortified the place as
     well as they could, and received the survivors of the rout. A few of those who had swum the
     river fled without their arms to Rome and reported that the whole army had perished. When word
     of such misfortunes as we have described was brought to those who had been left behind in the
     city, everyone fell into despair; <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>for they saw no possibility
     of resistance, now that all their youth had perished, and to flee with their children and wives
     was fraught with the greatest danger since the enemy were close at hand. Now many private
     citizens fled with their households to neighbouring cities, but the city magistrates,
     encouraging the populace, issued orders for them to bring speedily to the Capitoline grain and
     every other necessity. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When this had been done, both the
     acropolis and the Capitoline were stored not only with supplies of food but with silver and
     gold and the costliest raiment, since the precious possessions had been gathered from over the
     whole city into one place. They gathered such valuables as they could and fortified the place
     we have mentioned during a respite of three days. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For the
     Celts spent the first day cutting off, according to their custom, the heads of the dead.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Cp. Book 5.29.4-5.</note> And for two days they lay encamped
     before the city, for when they saw the walls deserted and yet heard the noise made by those who
     were transferring their most useful possessions to the acropolis, they suspected that the
     Romans were planning a trap for them. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But on the fourth day,
     after they had learned the true state of affairs, they broke down the gates and pillaged the
     city except for a few dwellings on the Palatine. After this they delivered daily assaults on
     strong positions, without, however, inflicting any serious hurt upon their opponents and with
     the loss of many of their own troops. Nevertheless, they did not relax their ardour, expecting
     that, even if they did not conquer by force, they would wear down the enemy in the course of
     time, when the necessities of life had entirely given out. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="116">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While the Romans were in
     such throes, the neighbouring Tyrrhenians advanced and made a raid with a strong army on the
     territory of the Romans, capturing many prisoners and not a small amount of booty. But the
     Romans who had fled to Veii, falling unexpectedly upon the Tyrrhenians, put them to flight,
     took back the booty, and captured their camp. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Having got
     possession of arms in abundance, they distributed them among the unarmed, and they also
     gathered men from the countryside and armed them, since they intended to relieve the siege of
     the soldiers who had taken refuge on the Capitoline. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>While
     they were at a loss how they might reveal their plans to the besieged, since the Celts had
     surrounded them with strong forces, a certain Cominius Pontius undertook to get the cheerful
     news to the men on the Capitoline. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Starting out alone and
     swimming the river by night, he got unseen to a cliff of the Capitoline that was hard to climb
     and, hauling himself up it with difficulty, told the soldiers on the Capitoline about the
     troops that had been collected in Veii and how they were watching for an opportunity and would
     attack the Celts. Then, descending by the way he had mounted and swimming the Tiber, he
     returned to Veii. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Celts, when they observed the tracks of
     one who had recently climbed up, made plans to ascend at night by the same cliff. Consequently
     about the middle of the night, while the guards were neglectful of their watch because of the
     strength of the place, some Celts started an ascent of the cliff. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>They escaped detection by the guards, but the sacred geese of Hera, which were kept
     there, noticed the climbers and set up a cackling. The guards rushed to the place and the Celts
     deterred did not dare proceed farther. A certain Marcus Mallius, a man held in high esteem,
     rushing to the defence of the place, cut off the hand of the climber with his sword and,
     striking him on the breast with his shield, rolled him from the cliff. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>In like manner the second climber met his death, whereupon the rest all
     quickly turned in flight. But since the cliff was precipitous they were all hurled headlong and
     perished. As a result of this, when the Romans sent ambassadors to negotiate a peace, they were
     persuaded, upon receipt of one thousand pounds of gold, to leave the city and to withdraw from
     Roman territory. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Romans,
     now that their houses had been razed to the ground and the majority of their citizens slain,
     gave permission to anyone who wished to build a home in any place he chose, and supplied him at
     state expense with roof-tiles; and up to the present time these are known as "public tiles."
      <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Since every man naturally built his home where it suited his
     fancy, the result was that the streets of the city were narrow and crooked; consequently, when
     the population increased in later days, it was impossible to straighten the streets. Some also
     say that the Roman matrons, because they contributed their gold ornaments to the common safety,
     received from the people as a reward the right to ride through the city in chariots. </p>

     the Romans were in a weakened condition because of the misfortune we have described, the
     Volscians went to war against them. Accordingly the Roman military tribunes enrolled soldiers,
     took the field with their army, and pitched camp on the Campus Martius, as it is called, two
     hundred stades distant from Rome. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Since the Volscians lay over
     against them with a larger force and were assaulting the camp, the citizens in Rome, fearing
     for the safety of those in the encampment, appointed Marcus Furius dictator.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The famous Marcus Furius Camillus. The name of his master of

     and marched out during the night. At day-break they caught the Volscians as they were
     assaulting the camp, and appearing on their rear easily put them to flight. When the troops in
     the camp then sallied forth, the Volscians were caught in the middle and cut down almost to a
     man. Thus a people that passed for powerful in former days was by this disaster reduced to the
     weakest among the neighbouring tribes. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After the battle the dictator, on hearing that Bola was being besieged by the
      Aeculani,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Otherwise the Aequi.</note> who are now called
     the Aequicoli, led forth his troops and slew most of the besieging army. From here he marched
     to the territory of Sutrium, a Roman colony, which the Tyrrhenians had forcibly occupied.
     Falling unexpectedly upon the Tyrrhenians, he slew many of them and recovered the city for the
     people of Sutrium. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Gauls on
     their way from Rome laid siege to the city of Veascium which was an ally of the Romans. The
     dictator attacked them, slew the larger number of them, and got possession of all their
     baggage, included in which was the gold which they had received for Rome and practically all
     the booty which they had gathered in the seizure of the city. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />Despite the accomplishment of such great deeds, envy on the part of the tribunes prevented
     his celebrating a triumph. There are some, however, who state that he celebrated a triumph for
     his victory over the Tuscans in a chariot drawn by four white horses, for which the people two
     years later fined him a large sum of money. But we shall recur to this in the appropriate
     period of time.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">There is no later mention of this story.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Those Celts who had passed into Iapygia turned back through
     the territory of the Romans; but soon thereafter the Cerii made a crafty attack on them by
     night and cut all of them to pieces in the Trausian Plain. <milestone unit="section" n="8" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The historian Callisthenes<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Callisthenes of Olynthus was better known for his history of Alexander the

    </argument>
    <div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Throughout our entire treatise our practice has been to employ the customary freedom of
     speech enjoyed by history, and we have added just praise of good men for their fair deeds and
     meted out just censure upon bad men whenever they did wrong. By this means, as we believe, we
     shall lead men whose nature fortunately inclines them to virtue to undertake, because of the
     immortality fame accords them, the fairest deeds, whereas by appropriate obloquies we shall
     turn men of the opposite character from their impulse to evil. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Consequently, since we have come in our writing to the period when the Lacedaemonians fell
     upon deep distress in their unexpected defeat at Leuctra, and again in their unlooked-for
     repulse at Mantineia lost the supremacy over the Greeks, we believe that we should maintain the
     principle we have set for our writing and set forth the appropriate censure of the
     Lacedaemonians. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For who would
     not judge men to be deserving of accusation who had received from their ancestors a supremacy
     with such firm foundations and that too preserved by the high spirit of their ancestor for over
     five hundred years, and now beheld it, as the Lacedaemonians of that time did, overthrown by
     their own folly? And this is easy to understand. For the men who had lived before them won the
     glory they had by many labours and great struggles, treating their subjects the while fairly
     and humanely; but their successors used their allies roughly and harshly, stirring up, besides,
     unjust and insolent wars against the Greeks, and so it is quite to be understood that they lost
     their rule because of their own acts of folly. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For the hatred
     of those they had wronged found in their disasters an opportunity to retaliate upon their
     aggressors, and they who had been unconquered from their ancestors' time were now attended by
     such contempt as, it stands to reason, must befall those who obliterate the virtues that
     characterized their ancestors. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>This explains why the Thebans,
     who for many generations had been subjects of their superiors, when they defeated them to
     everyone's surprise, became supreme among the Greeks, but the Lacedaemonians, when once they
     had lost the supremacy, were never at any time able to recover the high position enjoyed by
     their ancestors. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now that we
     have sufficiently censured the Lacedaemonians, we shall in turn pass on to the further course
     of our history, after we have first set the timelimits of this section. The preceding Book,
     which is the fourteenth of our narrative, closed with the events concerned with the enslaving
     of the Rhegians by Dionysius and the capture of Rome by the Gauls, which took place in the year
     preceding the campaign of the Persians in Cyprus against Evagoras the king. In this Book we
     shall begin with this war and close with the year preceding the reign of Philip the son of
      Amyntas.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The book covers the years <dateRange from="-386" to="-361">386</dateRange>-361 B.C.</note>

     military tribunes, Marcus Furius, Gaius, and Aemilius. This year Artaxerxes, the King of the
     Persians, made war upon Evagoras, the king of Cyprus. He busied himself for a long time with
     the preparations for the war and gathered a large armament, both naval and land; his land force
     consisted of three hundred thousand men including cavalry, and he equipped more than three
     hundred triremes. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>As commanders he chose for the land force
     his brother-in-law Orontes, and for the naval Tiribazus, a man who was held in high favour
     among the Persians. These commanders took over the armaments in Phocaea and Cyme, repaired to
     Cilicia, and passed over to Cyprus, where they prosecuted the war with vigour. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Evagoras made an alliance with
      Acoris,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The proper spelling is Hacori.</note> the king of
     the Egyptians, who was an enemy of the Persians, and received a strong force from him, and from
     Hecatomnus, the lord of Caria, who was secretly co-operating with him, he got a large sum of
     money to support his mercenary troops. Likewise he drew on such others to join in the war with
     Persia as were at odds with the Persians, either secretly or openly. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He was master of practically all the cities of Cyprus, and of Tyre and some others in
     Phoenicia. He also had ninety triremes, of which twenty were Tyrian and seventy were Cyprian,
     six thousand soldiers of his own subjects, and many more than this number from his allies. In
     addition to these he enlisted many mercenaries, since he had funds in abundance. And not a few
     soldiers were sent him by the king of the Arabs and by certain others of whom the King of the
     Persians was suspicious. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Since Evagoras had such advantages, he entered the war with
     confidence. First, since he had not a few boats of the sort used for piracy, he lay in wait for
     the supplies coming to the enemy, sank some of their ships at sea, drove off others, and
     captured yet others. Consequently the merchants did not dare to convey food to Cyprus; and
     since large armaments had been gathered on the island, <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>the
     army of the Persians soon suffered from lack of food and the want led to revolt, the
     mercenaries of the Persians attacking their officers, slaying some of them, and filling the
     camp with tumult and revolt. It was with difficulty that the generals of the Persians and the
     leader of the naval armament, known as Glos, put an end to the mutiny. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Sailing off with their entire fleet, they transported a large quantity
     of grain from Cilicia and provided a great abundance of food. As for Evagoras, King Acoris
     transported an adequate supply of grain from Egypt and sent him money and adequate supplies for
     every other need. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Evagoras, seeing that he was much inferior
     in naval strength, fitted out sixty additional ships and sent for fifty from Acoris in Egypt,
     so that he had in all two hundred triremes. These he fitted out for battle in a way to cause
     terror and by continued trials and drill got ready for a sea engagement. Consequently, when the
     King's fleet sailed past toward Citium, he fell upon the ships unexpectedly and had a great
     advantage over the Persians. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For he attacked with his ships in
     compact array ships in disorder, and since he fought with men whose plans were prepared against
     men unready, he at once at the first encounter won a prearranged victory. For, attacking as he
     did with his triremes in close order triremes that were scattered and in confusion, he sank
     some and captured others. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Still the Persian admiral Glos and
     the other commanders put up a gallant resistance, and a fierce struggle developed in which at
     first Evagoras held the upper hand. Later, however, when Glos attacked in strong force and put
     up a gallant fight, the result was that Evagoras turned in flight and lost many of his
     triremes. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Persians after their victory in the sea-fight gathered both their sea
     and land forces at the city of Citium. From this as their base they organized a siege of
     Salamis and beleaguered the city both by land and by sea. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Meantime Tiribazus crossed over to Cilicia after the sea-fight and continued thence to the
     King, reported the victory, and brought back two thousand talents for the prosecution of the
     war. Before the sea-fight, Evagoras, who had fallen in with a body of the land force near the
     sea and defeated it, had been confident of success, but when he suffered defeat in the
     sea-fight and found himself besieged, he lost heart. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />Nevertheless, deciding to continue the war, he left his son Pnytagoras behind as supreme
     commander in Cyprus and himself took ten triremes, eluded the enemy, and got away from Salamis.
     On arriving in Egypt he met the king and urged him to continue the war energetically and to
     consider the war against the Persians a common undertaking. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While these events were
     taking place, the Lacedaemonians determined to make war upon Mantineia, without regard to the
     standing treaty,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Referring to the Peace of Antalcidas (Book 14.110.3).</note> for the following reasons. The Greeks were enjoying the general peace
     of Antalcidas, in accordance with which all the cities had got rid of their garrisons and
     recovered by agreement their autonomy. The Lacedaemonians, however, who by their nature loved
     to command and by policy preferred war, would not tolerate the peace which they considered to
     be a heavy burden, and longing for their past dominance over Greece, they were poised and alert
     to begin a new movement. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At once, then, they stirred up the
     cities and formed partisan groups in them with the aid of their friends, being provided in some
     of the cities with plausible grounds for interference. For the cities, after having recovered
     their autonomy, demanded an accounting of the men who had been in control under the
     Lacedaemonian supremacy; and since the procedure was harsh, because the people bore enmity for
     past injuries and many were sent into exile, the Lacedaemonians took it upon themselves to give
     support to the defeated faction. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>By receiving these men and
     dispatching a force with them to restore them to their homes, they at first enslaved the weaker
     cities, but afterward made war on and forced the more important cities to submit, having
     preserved the general peace no longer than two years.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Seeing that
     the city of the Mantineians lay upon their borders and was full of valiant men, the
     Lacedaemonians were jealous of its growth which had resulted from the peace and were bent on
     humbling the pride of its citizens. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>First of all, therefore,
     they dispatched ambassadors to Mantineia, commanding them to destroy their walls and all of
     them to remove to the original five villages from which they had of old united to form
     Mantineia. When no one paid any attention to them, they sent out an army and laid siege to the
     city. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Mantineians dispatched ambassadors to Athens, asking
     for aid. When the Athenians did not choose to make a breach of the common peace, the
     Mantineians none the less withstood the siege on their own account and stoutly resisted the
     enemy. In this way, then, fresh wars got a start in Greece. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In Sicily Dionysius, the
     tyrant of the Syracusans, now that he was relieved of wars with the Carthaginians, enjoyed
     great peace and leisure. Consequently he devoted himself with much seriousness to the writing
     of poetry, and summoning men of repute in this line, he accorded them special honours and
     resorted to them, making use of them as instructors and revisers of his poems. Elated by the
     flattering words with which these men repaid his benefactions, Dionysius boasted far more of
     his poems than of his successes in war. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Among the poets in his
     company was Philoxenus<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Of Cythera.</note>the writer of
     dithyrambs, who enjoyed very high repute as a composer in his own line. After dinner, when the
     compositions of the tyrant, which were wretched, had been read, he was asked what was his
     judgement of the poetry. When he replied with a good deal of frankness, the tyrant, offended at
     his words, found fault with him that he had been moved by jealousy to use scurrilous language
     and commanded his servants to drag him off forthwith to the quarries. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>On the next day, however, when Philoxenus' friends made petition for a grant of pardon,
     Dionysius made up with him and again included the same men in his company after dinner. As the
     drinking advanced, again Dionysius boasted of the poetry he had written, recited some lines
     which he considered to be happily composed, and then asked, "What do you think of the verses?"
     To this Philoxenus said not a word, but called Dionysius' servants and ordered them to take him
     away to the quarries. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now at the time Dionysius, smiling at
     the ready wit of the words, tolerated the freedom of speech, since the joke took the edge off
     the censure. But when some time later his acquaintances and Dionysius as well asked him to
     desist from his untimely frankness, Philoxenus made a paradoxical offer. He would, he said, in
     his answer both respect the truth and keep the favour of Dionysius. Nor did he fail to make his
     word good. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>For when the tyrant produced some lines that
     described harrowing events, and asked, "How do the verses strike you?", he replied, "Pitiful!",
     keeping his double promise by the ambiguity. For Dionysius took the word "pitiful" as
     signifying harrowing and deeply moving, which are successful effects of good poets, and
     therefore rated him as having approved them; the rest, however, who caught the real meaning,
     conceived that the word "pitiful" was only employed to suggest failure. </p>

     same thing, as it happened, also occurred in the case of Plato the philosopher. Dionysius
     summoned this man to his court and at first deigned to show him the highest favour, since he
     saw that he practised the freedom of speech that philosophy is entitled to. But later, being
     offended at some of his statements, he became altogether alienated from him, exposed him in the
     market, and sold him as a slave for twenty minas. Those who were philosophers, however, joined
     together, purchased his freedom, and sent him off to Greece with the friendly admonition that a
     wise man should associate with tyrants either as little as possible or with the best grace

     Romans elected as consuls Lucius Lucretius and Servius Sulpicius. This year Evagoras, the king
     of the Salaminians, arrived in Cyprus from Egypt, bringing money from Acoris, the king of
     Egypt, but less than he had expected. When he found that Salamis was closely besieged and that
     he was deserted by his allies, he was forced to discuss terms of settlement. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Tiribazus, who held the supreme command, agreed to a settlement upon the
     conditions that Evagoras should withdraw from all the cities of Cyprus, that as king of Salamis
     alone he should pay the Persian King a fixed annual tribute, and that he should obey orders as
     slave to master. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Although these were hard terms, Evagoras
     agreed to them all except that he refused to obey orders as slave to master, saying that he
     should be subject as king to king. When Tiribazus would not agree to this, Orontes, who was the
     other general and envious of Tiribazus' high position, secretly sent letters to Artaxerxes
     against Tiribazus. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The charges against him were first, that
     although he was able to take Salamis, he was not doing so, but was receiving embassies from
     Evagoras and conferring with him on the question of making common cause; that he was likewise
     concluding a private alliance with the Lacedaemonians, being their friend; that he had sent to
      Pytho<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The oracle at Delphi.</note> to inquire of the god
     regarding his plans for revolt; and, most important of all, that he was winning for himself the
     commanders of the troops by acts of kindness, bringing them over by honours and gifts and
     promises. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>On reading the letter the King, believing the
     accusations, wrote to Orontes to arrest Tiribazus and dispatch him to him. When the order had
     been carried out, Tiribazus, on being brought to the King, asked for a trial and for the time
     being was put in prison. After this the King was engaged in a war with the Cadusians and
     postponed the trial, and so the legal action was deferred. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Orontes succeeded to the
     command of the forces in Cyprus. But when he saw that Evagoras was again putting up a bold
     resistance to the siege and, furthermore, that the soldiers were angered at the arrest of
     Tiribazus and so were insubordinate and listless in pressing the siege, Orontes became alarmed
     at the surprising change in the situation. He therefore sent men to Evagoras to discuss a
     settlement and to urge him to agree to a peace on the same terms Evagoras had agreed to with
     Tiribazus. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Evagoras, then, was surprisingly able to dispel the
     menace of capture, and agreed to peace on the conditions that he should be king of Salamis, pay
     the fixed tribute annually, and obey as a king the orders of the King. So the Cyprian war,
     which had lasted for approximately ten years, although the larger part of the period was spent
     in preparations and there were in all but two years of continuous warfare, came to the end we
     have described.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The war ended in <date value="-380" >380</date> B.C.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Glos, who had been in command
     of the fleet and was married to the daughter of Tiribazus, fearful that it might be thought
     that he had co-operated with Tiribazus in his plan and that he would be punished by the King,
     resolved to safeguard his position by a new project of action. Since he was well supplied with
     money and soldiers and had furthermore won the commanders of the triremes to himself by acts of
     kindness, he resolved to revolt from the King. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>At once, then,
     he sent ambassadors to Acoris, the king of the Egyptians, and concluded an alliance with him
     against the King. He also wrote the Lacedaemonians and incited them against the King, promising
     to give them a large sum of money and offering other great inducements. He pledged himself to
     full co-operation with them in Greece and to work with them in restoring the supremacy their
     fathers had exercised. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Even before this the Spartans had made
     up their minds to recover their supremacy, and at the time were already throwing the cities
     into confusion and enslaving them, as was clear to all men. Moreover, they were in bad repute
     because it was generally believed that in the agreement<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather" >The Peace of Antalcidas (Book 14.110.3).</note> they had made with the King they had betrayed
     the Greeks of Asia, and so they repented of what they had done and sought a plausible excuse
     for a war against Artaxerxes. Consequently they were glad to enter the alliance with Glos.

<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After Artaxerxes had concluded the war with the Cadusians, he brought up the trial of
     Tiribazus and assigned three of the most highly esteemed Persians as judges. At this time other
     judges who were believed to have been corrupt were flayed alive and their skins stretched tight
     on judicial benches. The judges rendered their decisions seated on these, having before their
     eyes an example of the punishment meted out to corrupt decisions. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now the accusers read the letter sent by Orontes and stated that it constituted
     sufficient cause for accusation. Tiribazus, with respect to the charge in connection with
     Evagoras, presented the agreement made by Orontes that Evagoras should obey the King as a king,
     whereas he had himself agreed upon a peace on the terms that Evagoras should obey the King as a
     slave his master. With respect to the oracle he stated that the god as a general thing gives no
     response regarding death,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Therefore he could not have inquired of the oracle about a revolt, which, if successful, would necessarily have involved
      the death of the King.</note> and to the truth of this he invoked all the Greeks present as
     witnesses. As for the friendship with the Lacedaemonians, he replied in defence that he had
     formed the friendship not for any advantage of his own but for the profit of the King; and he
     pointed out that the Greeks of Asia were thereby detached from the Lacedaemonians and delivered
     captive to the King. At the conclusion of his defence he reminded the judges of the former good
     services he had rendered the King. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is related that Tiribazus pointed out many services to the King, and one very great

     the King was riding in a chariot, two lions came at him, tore to pieces two of the four horses
     belonging to the chariot, and then charged upon the King himself; but at that very moment
     Tiribazus appeared, slew the lions, and rescued the King from the danger. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In wars also, men say, he excelled in valour, and in council his
     judgement was so good that when the King followed his advice he never made a mistake. By means
     of such a defence Tiribazus was cleared of the charges by the unanimous vote of the judges.

<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The King summoned the judges one by one and asked each of them what principles of
     justice he had followed in clearing the accused. The first said that he observed the charges to
     be debatable, while the benefactions were not contested. The second said that, though it were
     granted that the charges were true, nevertheless the benefactions exceeded the offences. The
     third stated that he did not take into account the benefactions, because Tiribazus had received
     from the King in return for them favours and honours many times as great, but that when the
     charges were examined apart by themselves, the accused did not appear to be guilty of them.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The King praised the judges for having rendered a just
     decision and bestowed upon Tiribazus the highest honours, such as were customary. Orontes,
     however, he condemned as one who had fabricated a false accusation, expelled him from his list
     of friends, and subjected him to the utmost marks of degradation.<milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Such was the state of affairs in Asia. </p>

     the siege of Mantineia, and through the summer the Mantineians maintained a gallant resistance

     was for this reason that the Lacedaemonians had formerly made it their practice in battle to
     place them, as their most trustworthy allies, on their flank. But with the coming of winter the
     river which flows beside Mantineia received a great increase from the rains and the
     Lacedaemonians diverted the flow of the river with great dikes, turned the river into the city,
     and made a pool of all the region round about. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Consequently,
     as the houses began to fall, the Mantineians in despair were compelled to surrender the city to
     the Lacedaemonians. After they received the surrender, they imposed no other hardship on the

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While
     these events were taking place, in Sicily Dionysius, the tyrant of the Syracusans, resolved to
     plant cities on the Adriatic Sea. His idea in doing this was to get control of the Ionian
      Sea,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The Greek reads "the Ionian passage-way, as it is called," since, being the lower part of the Adriatic Sea, it was the direct route between
      Greece and Italy.</note> in order that he might make the route to Epeirus safe and have there
     his own cities which could give haven to ships. For it was his intent to descend unexpectedly
     with great armaments upon the regions about Epeirus and to sack the temple at Delphi, which was
     filled with great wealth. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Consequently he made an alliance
     with the Illyrians with the help of Alcetas the Molossian, who was at the time an exile and
     spending his days in Syracuse. Since the Illyrians were at war, he dispatched to them an allied
     force of two thousand soldiers and five hundred suits of Greek armour. The Illyrians
     distributed the suits of armour among their choicest warriors and incorporated the soldiers
     among their own troops. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now that they had gathered a large
     army, they invaded Epeirus and would have restored Alcetas to the kingship over the Molossians.
     But when no one paid any attention to them, they first ravaged the country, and after that,
     when the Molossians drew up against them, there followed a sharp battle in which the Illyrians
     were victorious and slew more than fifteen thousand Molossians. After such a disaster befell
     the inhabitants of Epeirus, the Lacedaemonians, as soon as they had learned the facts, sent a
     force to give aid to the Molossians, by means of which they curbed the barbarians' great
     audacity. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While these events
     were taking place, the Parians, in accordance with an oracle, sent out a colony to the

     Lucius Valerius and Aulus Mallius, and the Eleians celebrated the Ninety-ninth Olympiad, that
     in which Dicon of Syracuse won the "stadion." This year the Parians, who had settled Pharos,
     allowed the previous barbarian inhabitants to remain unharmed in an exceedingly well fortified
     place, while they themselves founded a city by the sea and built a wall about it. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Later, however, the old barbarian inhabitants of the island took offence
     at the presence of the Greeks and called in the Illyrians of the opposite mainland. These, to
     the number of more than ten thousand, crossed over to Pharos in many small boats, wrought
     havoc, and slew many of the Greeks. But the governor of Lissus appointed by Dionysius sailed
     with a good number of triremes against the light craft of the Illyrians, sinking some and
     capturing others, and slew more than five thousand of the barbarians, while taking some two
     thousand captive. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dionysius, in
     need of money, set out to make war against Tyrrhenia with sixty triremes. The excuse he offered
     was the suppression of the pirates, but in fact he was going to pillage a holy temple, richly
     provided with dedications, which was located in the seaport of the Tyrrhenian city of Agylle,
     the name of the port being Pyrgi.<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Some fifteen miles up

     plundered the temple, and amassed no less than a thousand talents. When the men of Agylle came
     out to bring help, he overpowered them in battle, took many prisoners, laid waste their
     territory, and then returned to Syracuse. From the booty which he sold he took in no less than
     five hundred talents. Now that Dionysius was well supplied with money, he hired a multitude of
     soldiers from every land, and after bringing together a very considerable army, was obviously

     preparations for war upon the Carthaginians, looked about to find a reasonable excuse for the
     conflict. Seeing, then, that the cities subject to the Carthaginians were favourable to a
     revolt, he received such as wished to do so, formed an alliance with them, and treated them
     with fairness. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Carthaginians at first dispatched

     the Carthaginians formed an alliance with the Italian Greeks and together with them went to war
     against the tyrant; and since they wisely recognized in advance that it would be a great war,
     they enrolled as soldiers the capable youth from their own citizens, and then, raising a great
     sum of money, hired large forces of mercenary troops. As general they chose their king<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">Magon was obviously one of the two annually elected suffetes, who corresponded roughly to the Roman consuls. Diodorus must have known that the Carthaginians

     Magon and moved many tens of thousands of soldiers across to Sicily and Italy, planning to wage
     war on both fronts. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Dionysius for his part also divided his
     forces, on the one front fighting the Italian Greeks and on the other the Phoenicians. Now
     there were many battles here and there between groups of soldiers and minor and continuous
     engagements, in which nothing of consequence was achieved. But there were two important and
     famous pitched battles. In the first, near Cabala,<note anchored="yes" resp="Oldfather">The location is unknown.</note> as it is called, Dionysius, who put up an admirable fight, was
     victorious, slaying more than ten thousand of the barbarians and capturing not less than five
     thousand. He also forced the rest of the army to take refuge on a hill which was fortified but
     altogether without water. There fell also Magon their king after a splendid combat. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Phoenicians, dismayed at the magnitude of the disaster, at once sent
     an embassy to discuss terms of peace. But Dionysius declared that his only terms were
     conditional upon their retiring from the cities of Sicily and paying the cost of the war.

<div2 type="chapter" n="16">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This reply was considered by the Carthaginians to be harsh and arrogant and they
     outgeneralled Dionysius with their accustomed knavery. They pretended that they were satisfied
     with the terms, but stated that it was not in their power to hand over the cities; and in order
     that they might discuss the question with their government, they asked Dionysius to agree to a
     truce of a few days. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When the monarch agreed and the truce
     took effect, Dionysius was overjoyed, supposing that he would forthwith take over the whole of
     Sicily. The Carthaginians meanwhile gave their king Magon a magnificent funeral and replaced
     him as general with his son, who, though he was young indeed, was full of ambition and
     distinguished for his courage. He spent the entire period of the truce drilling and exercising
     his troops, and what with laborious exercise, hortatory speeches, and training in arms, he
     rendered the army obedient and competent. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>At the expiration of
     the period agreed upon both sides deployed their forces and entered the battle with high

     redressed by victory turn for turn the defeat of the Carthaginians. The former victors, who
     were loudly boasting because of their military success, were unexpectedly tripped up, and they

     Olynthians enjoyed the revenues from the land given them, and when later the king unexpectedly
     recovered strength and got back his entire kingdom, the Olynthians were not inclined to return
     the land when he asked for it. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Consequently Amyntas gathered
     an army from his own people, and forming an alliance with the Lacedaemonians persuaded them to
     send out a general and a strong force against the Olynthians. The Lacedaemonians, having
     decided to extend their control to the regions about Thrace, enrolled soldiers both from their
     citizens and from their allies, more than ten thousand in all; the army they turned over to
     Phoebidas the Spartan with orders to join forces with Amyntas and to make war together with him
     upon the Olynthians. They also sent out another army against the people of Phlius, defeated
     them in battle, and compelled them to accept the rule of the Lacedaemonians. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this time the kings of the
     Lacedaemonians were at variance with each other on matters of policy. Agesipolis, who was a
     peaceful and just man and, furthermore, excelled in wisdom, declared that they should abide by
     their oaths and not enslave the Greeks contrary to the common agreements. He pointed out that
     Sparta was in ill repute for having surrendered the Greeks of Asia to the Persians and for
     organizing the cities of Greece in her own interest, although she had sworn in the common
     agreement that she would preserve their autonomy. But Agesilaus, who was by nature a man of
     action, was fond of war and yearned for dominance over the Greeks. </p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now many of the other cities for the

     generously by the Lacedaemonians while she had suffered terribly in war with the Athenians, had
     very good reason for maintaining unabated her enmity to Athens and for continuing to observe
     inviolate her pledge to Sparta. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Nevertheless seventy cities
     eventually entered into alliance with the Athenians and participated on equal footing in the
     common council. So with the constant increase in the strength of the Athenians and the
     diminution of that of the Lacedaemonians the two states were now well matched. The Athenians,
     seeing affairs proceeding to their liking, dispatched a force to Euboea to serve at once as a
     protection for their allies and to subdue the opposition. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In
     Euboea a short time before this a certain Neogenes with the assistance of Jason of Pherae had

     of the city of the Oreitans. Because of his violent and arrogant rule the Lacedaemonians had
     then dispatched Theripides against him. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Theripides at first
     endeavoured to prevail upon the tyrant by reasoning with him to leave the citadel; but when the
     tyrant paid no heed to him, he rallied the people of the district to the cause of freedom, took
     the place by storm, and restored their freedom to the people of Oreus. For this reason the
     people who inhabit what is known as the country of the Hestiaeans continued to be loyal to the

     which is situated on a naturally steep hill, left a garrison in it, and then sailed to the
     Cyclades and won over Peparethos and Sciathos and some other islands which had been subject to
     the Lacedaemonians. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="31">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Spartans, perceiving that the impulse of their allies to
     secede was not to be checked, put an end to their former severity and began to treat the cities
     humanely. By this sort of treatment and by benefactions they rendered all their allies more
     loyal. And now that they saw that the war was becoming more serious and required strict
     attention, they set ambitiously to work on their various preparations for it, and in particular
     brought to greater perfection the organization and distribution of their soldiers and the
     services. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In fact they divided the cities and the soldiers
     that were levied for the war into ten parts.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">For other
      members of the league see Beloch, <title>Griechische Geschichte &lpar;2&rpar;,</title> 3.1.108 and note 1.</note> The first part included the Lacedaemonians, the second and third
     the Arcadians, the fourth the Eleians, the fifth the Achaeans. Corinthians and Megarians
     supplied the sixth, the seventh the Sicyonians and Phliasians and the inhabitants of the
     promontory called Acte,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">On the Argolid peninsula, inhabited by people of Epidaurus, Methone, and Troezen.</note> the eighth the Acarnanians, the ninth the
     Phocians and Locrians, and the last of all the Olynthians and the allies who lived in Thrace.
     They reckoned one hoplite to two light-armed, and one horseman as equivalent to four
      hoplites.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">This reckoning (see <bibl n="Xen. Hell.

      the rate for one hoplite.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Such was the organization, and King Agesilaus was put in
     command of the campaign. He was renowned for courage and shrewdness in the art of war and had
     been all but invincible in the former periods. For in all his wars he won admiration and
     especially when the Lacedaemonians were fighting the Persians. For he gave battle and won the
     victory over a force of many times his own number; then he overran a large part of Asia,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See Book 14.79-80, 83.</note> mastering the open country, and
     finally would probably have succeeded, had not the Spartans recalled him because of political
     affairs, in reducing the whole Persian empire to the direst straits. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For he was a man of energy, daring but highly intelligent, engaging in hazardous
     actions. Accordingly the Spartans, seeing that the magnitude of the war called for a first-rate
     leader, again appointed him commander of the whole war. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="32">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Agesilaus led forth his army
     and reached Boeotia accompanied by all the soldiers, amounting to more than eighteen thousand,
     in which were the five divisions of Lacedaemonians. Each division contained five hundred men.
     The company known as Sciritae<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">A people who lived on the
      mountainous northern frontier of Laconia. This special corps, considered apparently the cream
      of the army, formed the vanguard of an advance and the rearguard of a retreat. Thought by some
      to be lightarmed, though this is doubted by Kromayer-Veith on the strength of this and other
      passages (p. 39, <title>Heerwesen und Kriegsf&uuml;hrung der Griechen und
      R&ouml;mer,</title> Munich, 1928). (See <bibl n="Thuc. 5.67.1">Thuc.

     station with the king and it goes to the support of the sections that from time to time are in
     distress; and since it is composed of picked men, it is an important factor in turning the
     scale in pitched battles, and generally determines the victory. Agesilaus also had fifteen
     hundred cavalry. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Passing on then to the city of Thespiae,
     which was garrisoned by the Lacedaemonians, he encamped near it and for several days rested his
     men from the hardships of the march. The Athenians, having become aware of the arrival of the
     Lacedaemonians in Boeotia, immediately went to the assistance of Thebes with five thousand
     foot-soldiers and two hundred cavalry. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When these forces had
     assembled, the Thebans occupied an oblong crest about twenty stades from the city and, having
     transformed the obstacle into a bastion, awaited the attack of the enemy; for the reputation of
     Agesilaus so overawed them that they were too timid to await his attack on equal terms in the
     level country. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>As for Agesilaus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">For the campaign of this year (actually 378) see <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 5.4.35" >Xen. Hell. 5.4.35-41</bibl>, <bibl n="Xen. Ages. 26">Xen. Ages. 26</bibl>.</note> he led out
     his army in battle array against the Boeotians, and, when he had drawn near, in the first place
     launched his light-armed troops against his opponents, thus testing their disposition to fight
     him. But when the Thebans had easily from their higher position thrust his men back, he led the
     whole army against them closely arrayed to strike them with terror. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Chabrias<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">For the role of Chabrias see <bibl n="Polyaen. 2.1.2">Polyaenus 2.1.2</bibl>;<bibl n="Nep. Cha. 1">Nepos Chabrias 1</bibl>;
       <bibl n="Dem. 20.76">Dem. 20.76</bibl>.</note> the Athenian, however, leading his mercenary
     troops, ordered his men to receive the enemy with a show of contempt, maintaining all the while
     their battle lines, and, leaning their shields against their knees, to wait with upraised
     spear. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Since they did what they were ordered as at a single
     word of command, Agesilaus, marvelling at the fine discipline of the enemy and their posture of
     contempt, judged it inadvisable to force a way against the higher ground and compel his
     opponents to show their valour in a hand-to-hand contest, and, having learned by trial that
     they would dare, if forced, to dispute the victory, he challenged them in the plain. But when
     the Thebans would not come down to meet him, he withdrew the phalanx of infantry, dispatched
     the cavalry and light-armed ranks to plunder the countryside unhampered, and so took a great
     quantity of spoil. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="33">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Spartan advisers, who accompanied Agesilaus, and his
     officers expressed to him their surprise that Agesilaus, who reputedly was a man of energy and
     had the larger and more powerful force, should have avoided a decisive contest with the enemy.
     To them Agesilaus made answer that, as it was, the Lacedaemonians had won the victory without
     the risk; for when the countryside was being sacked, the Boeotians had not dared to rally to
     its defence; but if, when the enemy themselves had conceded the victory, he had forced them to
     endure the risks of battle, perhaps through the uncertainty of fortune the Lacedaemonians might
     even have come to grief in the contest. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now at the time he was
     thought in this reply of his to have estimated the possible outcome fairly well, but later in
     the light of events he was believed to have uttered no mere human saying but a divinely
     inspired oracle. For the Lacedaemonians, having taken the field against the Thebans with a
     mighty army and having compelled them to fight for their freedom, met with a great disaster.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They were defeated, namely, at Leuctra first, where they lost

     too highly, of laying them unexpectedly low and so teaching them to hope for nothing in excess.
     At any rate Agesilaus, prudently satisfied with his first success, brought his army through
     unharmed. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this Agesilaus
     returned with his army to the Peloponnese, while the Thebans, saved by the generalship of

     before, but the Thebans, by occupying certain new obstacles, prevented the enemy from
     devastating the country, though they did not venture to offer battle in the plains face to face
     against the whole army of the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>As Agesilaus advanced to
     the attack, they came out to meet him gradually. A bitter battle raged for a long time, in
     which at first Agesilaus' men prevailed, but later, as the Thebans poured forth in full force
     from the city, Agesilaus, beholding the multitude of men streaming down upon him, summoned his
     soldiers by trumpet to withdraw from the battle. The Thebans, who found themselves now for the
     first time not inferior to the Lacedaemonians, erected a trophy of victory and thereafter faced
     the army of the Spartans with confidence. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>With regard to the fighting of the land forces, such was the issue. At sea
     about the same time occurred a great naval battle between Naxos and Paros, of which the cause
     was as follows. Pollis, the admiral of the Lacedaemonians, learning that a large shipment of
     grain was on its way to Athens in freighters, lay in wait watching for the grain fleet as it
     put in to port, intending to attack the freighters. The Athenian people, being informed of
     this, sent out a convoy to guard the grain in transit, which in fact brought it safe to the
     Peiraeus. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Later Chabrias, the Athenian admiral, with the whole
     navy sailed to Naxos and laid it under siege. Bringing his siege-engines to bear against the
     walls, when he had shaken them, he then bent every effort to take the city by storm. While
     these things were going on, Pollis, the admiral of the Lacedaemonians, sailed into port to
     assist the Naxians. In eager rivalry both sides engaged in a sea-battle, and forming in line of
     battle charged each other.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">The battle of Naxos took place in

     <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Pollis had sixty-five triremes; Chabrias eighty-three. As the
     ships bore down on one another, Pollis, leading the right wing, was first to attack the
     opposing triremes on the left wing, which Cedon the Athenian commanded. In a brilliant contest
     he slew Cedon himself and sank his ship; and, in similar fashion engaging the other ships of
     Cedon and tearing them open with the beaks of his ships, he destroyed some and others he forced
     to flee. When Chabrias beheld what was happening, he dispatched a squadron of the ships under
     his command and brought support to the men who were hard pressed and so retrieved the defeat of
     his own side. He himself with the strongest part of the fleet in a valiant struggle destroyed
     many triremes and took a large number captive. </p>

     performed by the victorious generals, condemned them to death on the charge that they had

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The
     Egyptian king Nectanebos learned the size of the Persian armies, but was emboldened, chiefly by
     the strength of the country, for Egypt is extremely difficult of approach, and secondly by the
     fact that all points of invasion from land or sea had been carefully blocked. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For the Nile empties into the Egyptian Sea by seven mouths,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See Book 1.33.5 ff.</note> and at each mouth a city had been
     established along with great towers on each bank of the stream and a wooden bridge commanding
     its entrance. He especially fortified the Pelusiac mouth because it is the first to be
     encountered by those approaching from Syria and seemed to be the most likely route of the enemy
     approach. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He dug channels connecting with this, fortified the
     entrances for ships at the most suitable points, and inundated the approaches by land while
     blocking the sea approaches by embankments. Accordingly it was not easy either for the ships to
     sail in, or for the cavalry to draw near, or for the infantry to approach. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Pharnabazus' staff, finding the Pelusiac mouth so remarkably fortified
     and guarded by a multitude of soldiers, rejected utterly the plan of forcing a way through it
     and decided to make the invasion by ship through another mouth. Accordingly they voyaged on the
     open sea so that the ships should not be sighted by the enemy, and sailed in by the mouth known
     as Mendesian, which had a beach stretching over a considerable space. Landing here with three
     thousand men, Pharnabazus and Iphicrates pushed forward to the walled stronghold at the mouth.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Egyptians rushed out with three thousand horse and
     infantry, and a sharp battle ensued, but many men from their ships came to increase the number
     of the Persians, until finally the Egyptians were surrounded, many slain, and not a few
     captured alive; and the rest were driven in confusion into the city. Iphicrates' men dashed in
     with the defenders inside the walls, took possession of the fortress, razed it, and enslaved
     the inhabitants. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="43">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this, discord set in amongst the commanders, causing the failure of
     the enterprise. For Iphicrates, learning from the captives that Memphis,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See Book 1.50.3 ff.</note> the most strategically situated of the Egyptian
     cities, was undefended, advised sailing immediately up to Memphis before the Egyptian forces
     arrived there, but Pharnabazus thought they should await the entire Persian force; for in this
     way the campaign against Memphis would be less dangerous. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When
     Iphicrates demanded that he be given the mercenaries that were on hand and promised if he had
     them to capture the city, Pharnabazus became suspicious of his boldness and his courage for
     fear lest he take possession of Egypt for himself. Accordingly when Pharnabazus would not
     yield, Iphicrates protested that if they let slip the exact moment of opportunity, they would
     make the whole campaign a failure. Some generals indeed bore a grudge against him and were
     attempting to fasten unfair charges upon him. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Meanwhile the
     Egyptians, having had plenty of time to recuperate, first sent an adequate garrison into
     Memphis, and then, proceeding with all their forces against the ravaged stronghold at the
     Mendesian mouth of the Nile and being now at a great advantage owing to the strength of their
     position, fought constant engagements with the enemy. With ever-increasing strength they slew
     many Persians and gained confidence against them. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>As the

     and made small oval ones of moderate size, thus successfully achieving both objects, to furnish
     the body with adequate cover and to enable the user of the small shield, on account of its
     lightness, to be completely free in his movements. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After a
     trial of the new shield its easy manipulation secured its adoption, and the infantry who had
     formerly been called "hoplites" because of their heavy shield, then had their name changed to
     "peltasts" from the light <emph>pelta</emph> they carried.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman" >Consult H. W. Parke, <title>Greek Mercenary Soldiers,</title> 79 ff., who quotes this passage
      and upholds Diodorus in that "he regards the peltast's equipment as a modification introduced
      into hoplite troops." See also <bibl n="Nep. Iph. 1.3">Nepos Iphicrates 1.3-4</bibl>.</note>
     As regards spear and sword, he made changes in the contrary direction: namely, he increased the
     length of the spears by half, and made the swords almost twice as long. The actual use of these
     arms confirmed the initial test and from the success of the experiment won great fame for the
     inventive genius of the general. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He made soldiers' boots that
     were easy to untie and light and they continue to this day to be called "iphicratids" after
     him. He also introduced many other useful improvements into warfare, but it would be tedious to
     write about them. So the Persian expedition against Egypt, for all its huge preparations,
     disappointed expectations and proved a failure in the end. </p>

     their term of office great earthquakes occurred in the Peloponnese accompanied by tidal waves
     which engulfed the open country and cities in a manner past belief; for never in the earlier
     periods had such disasters befallen Greek cities, nor had entire cities along with their
     inhabitants disappeared as a result of some divine force wreaking destruction and ruin upon
     mankind. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The extent of the destruction was increased by the
     time of its occurrence; for the earthquake did not come in the daytime when it would have been
     possible for the sufferers to help themselves, but the blow came at night, so that when the
     houses crashed and crumbled under the force of the shock, the population, owing to the darkness
     and to the surprise and bewilderment occasioned by the event, had no power to struggle for
     life. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The majority were caught in the falling houses and
     annihilated, but as day returned some survivors dashed from the ruins and, when they thought
     they had escaped the danger, met with a greater and still more incredible disaster. For the sea
     rose to a vast height, and a wave towering even higher washed away and drowned all the
     inhabitants and their native lands as well. Two cities in Achaia bore the brunt of this
     disaster, Helice and Bura,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See <bibl n="Strab. 1.3.18" >Strabo 1.3.18</bibl>: "Then there are Bura and Helice; Bura disappeared in a chasm of the

      These cities are in Achaia, Helice east of Aegium on the Corinthian Gulf and Bura inland. It
      is strange that no mention occurs of Delphi if the same earthquake caused the fire of 373

     reasons for the occurrence, alleging that the disaster was occasioned by the anger of the gods

      Achaia and Ionia. Helice and Bura are specially mentioned there as two places of refuge of the
      Ionians from the Achaeans. Cp. <bibl n="Strab. 14.1.20">Strabo 14.1.20</bibl> for the festival celebrated near Mycale.</note> were in the habit of holding a common assemblage of all the
     Ionians and of offering sacrifices of great antiquity on a large scale to Poseidon in a lonely
     region near the place called Mycale. Later, however, as a result of the outbreak of wars in
     this neighbourhood, since they were unable to hold the Panionia there, they shifted the
     festival gathering to a safe place near Ephesus. Having sent an embassy to Delphi, they
     received an oracle telling them to take copies of the ancient ancestral altars at Helice, which
     was situated in what was then known as Ionia,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See chap. 48.3
      for earthquake and tidal wave. On the connection of Helice and Bura with the Ionians see <bibl n="Strab. 8.7.2">Strabo 8.7.2 and 4</bibl>: "after Bura, Helice, whither the Ionians fled for refuge after they were conquered in battle by the Achaeans, and whence at last they were

     in obedience to the oracle sent men to Achaia to make the copies, and they spoke before the

     Helice, however, who had an ancient saying that they would suffer danger when Ionians should
     sacrifice at the altar of Poseidon, taking account of the oracle, opposed the Ionians in the
     matter of the copies, saying that the sanctuary was not the common property of the Achaeans,
     but their own particular possession. The inhabitants of Bura also took part with them in this.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But since the Achaeans by common decree had concurred, the

     Poseidon in his anger brought ruin upon the offending cities through the earthquake and the
     flood. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>That it was Poseidon's wrath that was wreaked upon
     these cities they allege that clear proofs are at hand: first, it is distinctly conceived that
     authority over earthquakes and floods belongs to this god,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman" >When the generation to which Zeus belonged overthrew the older gods the universe was apportioned to Zeus, sky and dry land, to Poseidon, the water, to Dis, the underworld. With
      his trident Poseidon controlled the waters and by smiting the earth with it produced
      earthquakes ("Poseidon the earth-shaker").</note> and also it is the ancient belief that the
     Peloponnese was an habitation of Poseidon; and this country is regarded as sacred in a way to
     Poseidon, and, speaking generally, all the cities in the Peloponnese pay honour to this god
     more than to any other of the immortals. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Furthermore, the
     Peloponnese has beneath its surface huge caverns and great underground accumulations of flowing
     water. Indeed there are two rivers in it which clearly have underground courses; one of them,
     in fact, near Pheneus, plunges into the ground, and in former times completely disappeared,
     swallowed up by underground caves, and the other, near Stymphalus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">The first is the river Ladon, a tributary of the Alpheus, flowing past Pheneus,

      boeotarchs no longer representative of separate states but elected from all Boeotian citizens
      and reduced in number from eleven to seven (chap. 52). The deciding power lay with the

     being exasperated by this, decided to lead a large army against them as common enemies, for
     they cast an extremely jealous eye upon their increase of power, fearing lest with the
     leadership of all Boeotia they might break up the Spartan supremacy, given a suitable
     opportunity. For they constantly practised gymnastics and had great bodily strength, and since
     they were naturally lovers of war, they were inferior to no Greek nation in deeds of valour.

     glory of its ancestors in the heroic age and aspired to mighty deeds. In this year, then, the

     their allies as well. </p>

     During their term of office the Thebans, since they were not participants in the truce, were
     forced to undertake alone the war with the Lacedaemonians; for there was no city that could
     legally join them, because all had agreed to the general peace. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />The Lacedaemonians, since the Thebans were isolated, determined to fight them and reduce
     Thebes to complete slavery. And since the Lacedaemonians were making their preparations without
     concealment and the Thebans were destitute of allies, everyone assumed that they would easily
     be defeated by the Spartans. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Accordingly some of the Greeks
     who were friendly to the Thebans sympathized with them at the prospect of defeat, while others
     who were at odds with them were overjoyed at the thought that Thebes would in a trice be
     reduced to utter slavery. Finally the Lacedaemonians, their huge army ready, gave command of it
     to Cleombrotus their king,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Cleombrotus was already in Phocis

     they never meddled with affairs in Laconia and the Spartans had no right to touch those of
     Boeotia, such being the tenor of their answers, the Lacedaemonians sent Cleombrotus forth
     immediately with his army against Thebes; and the Spartan allies were eager for the war,
     confident that there would be no contest or battle but that they would master the Boeotians
     without a struggle. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="52">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Spartans accordingly advanced till they came to Coroneia,
     where they encamped and waited for such of their allies as were tardy. The Thebans, in view of
     the presence of the enemy, first voted to remove their wives and children to safety in Athens,
     then chose Epameinondas general and turned over to him the command in the war, giving him as
     his advisers six boeotarchs. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Epameinondas, having conscripted
     for the battle all Thebans of military age and the other Boeotians who were willing and
     qualified, led forth from Thebes his army, numbering in all not more than six thousand.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>As the soldiers were marching out from the city it seemed to
     many that unfavourable omens appeared to the armament. For by the gates Epameinondas was met by
     a blind herald, who, seeking recovery of runaway slaves, just as was usual,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">The Thebans had recently been slaves to Sparta, so the proclamation portended their destruction if they were led forth from the city. This translation is based on the
      assumption that the crier was reporting names and descriptions of slaves who had run away and

      to arrest them and keep them safe for the owner.</note> cried his warning not to take them
     from Thebes nor to spirit them away, but to bring them home and keep them secure. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now the older people amongst those who heard the herald considered it an
     omen for the future; but the younger folk kept quiet so as not to appear through cowardice to
     hold Epameinondas back from the expedition. But Epameinondas replied to those who told him that
     he must observe the omens:<quote type="verse">
      <l met="dactylic">One only omen is best, to fight for the land that is ours.</l>
     </quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 12.243">Hom. Il. 12.243</bibl>
     <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Though Epameinondas astounded
     the cautious by his forthright answer, a second omen appeared more unfavourable than the
     previous one. For as the clerk advanced with a spear and a ribbon attached to it and signalled
     the orders from headquarters, a breeze came up and, as it happened, the ribbon was torn from
     the spear and wrapped itself around a slab that stood over a grave, and there were buried in
     this spot some Lacedaemonians and Peloponnesians who had died in the expedition under
     Agesilaus. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Some of the older folk who again chanced to be
     there protested earnestly against leading the force out in the face of the patent opposition of
     the gods; but Epameinondas, deigning them no reply, led forth his army, thinking that
     considerations of nobility and regard for justice should be preferred as motives to the omens
     in question. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Epameinondas accordingly, who was trained in
     philosophy and applied sensibly the principles of his training, was at the moment widely
     criticized, but later in the light of his successes was considered to have excelled in military
     shrewdness and did contribute the greatest benefits to his country. For he immediately led
     forth his army, seized in advance the pass at Coroneia, and encamped there. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="53">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Cleombrotus, learning that the enemy had seized the pass first, decided against forcing a
     passage there, proceeded instead through Phocis, and, when he had traversed the shore road
     which was difficult, entered Boeotia without danger. In his passage he took some of the
     fortresses and seized ten triremes.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See <bibl n="Xen.
      Hell. 6.4.3">Xen. Hell. 6.4.3-4</bibl>.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Later, when he reached the place called Leuctra, he encamped
     there and allowed the soldiers to recover after their march. As the Boeotians neared the enemy
     in their advance, and then, after surmounting some ridges, suddenly caught sight of the
     Lacedaemonians covering the entire plain of Leuctra, they were astounded at beholding the great
     size of the army. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And when the boeotarchs held a
      conference<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See <bibl n="Plut. Pel. 20">Plut. Pelopidas
      20</bibl>.</note> to decide whether they ought to remain and fight it out with an army that
     many times outnumbered them, or whether they should retreat and join battle in a commanding
     position, it chanced that the votes of the leaders were equal. For of the six boeotarchs, three
     thought that they should withdraw the army, and three that they should stay and fight it out,
     and among the latter Epameinondas was numbered. In this great and perplexing deadlock, the
     seventh boeotarch came to vote, whom Epameinondas persuaded to vote with him, and thus he
     carried the day. So the decision to stake all on the issue of battle was thus ratified.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But Epameinondas, who saw that the soldiers were
     superstitious on account of the omens that had occurred, earnestly desired through his own
     ingenuity and strategy to reverse the scruples of the soldiery. Accordingly, a number of men
     having recently arrived from Thebes, he persuaded them to say that the arms on the temple of
     Heracles had surprisingly disappeared and that word had gone abroad in Thebes that the heroes
     of old had taken them up and set off to help the Boeotians. He placed before them another man
     as one who had recently ascended from the cave of Trophonius,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Near Lebadeia. Trophonius designates an underworld Boeotian Zeus (Chthonius)

     that the Lacedaemonians were destined to meet with a great disaster by the tomb of the
     daughters of Leuctrus and Scedasus for the following reasons. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />Leuctrus was the person for whom this plain was named. His daughters and those of a certain
     Scedasus as well, being maidens, were violated by some Lacedaemonian ambassadors. The outraged

     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Many other such occurrences were reported, and when
     Epameinondas had convened an assembly and exhorted the soldiers by the appropriate pleas to
     meet the issue, they all shifted their resolutions, rid themselves of their superstition, and
     with courage in their hearts stood ready for the battle. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>There

     Fortune. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When the truce came into effect, Cleombrotus set out
     with his army from Boeotia, and there came to meet him another large army of Lacedaemonians and
     their allies under the command of Archidamus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Archidamus

     Boeotians, and taking measures to meet their boldness and recklessness in battle, had
     dispatched the second army to overcome by the superior number of their combatants the daring of
     the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Once these armies had united, the Lacedaemonians
     thought it cowardly to fear the valour of the Boeotians. So they disregarded the truce and with
     high spirits returned to Leuctra. The Boeotians too were ready for the battle and both sides
     marshalled their forces. </p>

     Epameinondas, by employing an unusual disposition of his own, was enabled through his own
     strategy to achieve his famous victory. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He selected from the
     entire army the bravest men and stationed them on one wing, intending to fight to the finish
     with them himself. The weakest he placed on the other wing and instructed them to avoid battle
     and withdraw gradually during the enemy's attack. So then, by arranging his phalanx in oblique
     formation, he planned to decide the issue of the battle by means of the wing in which were the
     elite. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When the trumpets on both sides sounded the charge and
     the armies simultaneously with the first onset raised the battle-cry, the Lacedaemonians
     attacked both wings with their phalanx in crescent formation, while the Boeotians retreated on
     one wing, but on the other engaged the enemy in double-quick time. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>As they met in hand-to-hand combat, at first both fought ardently and the battle was
     evenly poised; shortly, however, as Epameinondas' men began to derive advantage from their
     valour and the denseness of their lines, many Peloponnesians began to fall. For they were
     unable to endure the weight of the courageous fighting of the elite corps; of those who had
     resisted some fell and others were wounded, taking all the blows in front. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Now as long as King Cleombrotus of the Lacedaemonians was alive and had
     with him many comrades-in-arms who were quite ready to die in his defence, it was uncertain
     which way the scales of victory inclined; but when, though he shrank from no danger, he proved
     unable to bear down his opponents, and perished in an heroic resistance after sustaining many
     wounds, then, as masses of men thronged about his body, there was piled up a great mound of
     corpses. </p>

     king, got possession of his body, but were not strong enough to achieve victory. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For as the corps of elite outdid them in feats of courage, and the
     valour and exhortations of Epameinondas contributed greatly to its prowess, the Lacedaemonians
     were with great difficulty forced back; at first, as they gave ground they would not break

      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Arcadians, in spite of their victory, felt a prudent
     respect for the strength of Sparta and believed that they would not be able by themselves to
     cope with the Lacedaemonians. Accordingly, associating Argives and Eleians with themselves,
     they first sent envoys to Athens requesting them to join in an alliance against the Spartans,
     but as no one heeded them, they sent an embassy to the Thebans and persuaded them to join an
     alliance against the Lacedaemonians.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See <bibl n="Dem. 16.12">Dem. 16.12, 19</bibl>, and <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6.5.19">Xen. Hell.

      Elis' recalcitrancy) at this time gave Thebes the opportunity to step in.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Immediately, then, the Boeotians led out their army, taking
     some Locrians and Phocians along as allies. Now these men advanced against the Peloponnese
     under the boeotarchs Epameinondas and Pelopidas, for the other boeotarchs had willingly
     relinquished the command to these in recognition of their shrewdness in the art of war and
     their courage. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When they reached Arcadia, the Arcadians,
     Eleians, Argives, and all the other allies joined them in full force. And when more than fifty
     thousand had gathered, their leaders sitting in council decided to march upon Sparta itself and
     lay waste all Laconia. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="63">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for the Lacedaemonians, since they had cast away many of
     their young men in the disaster at Leuctra and in their other defeats had lost not a few, and
     were, taking all together, restricted by the blows of fortune to but few citizen soldiers, and,
     furthermore, since some of their allies had seceded and others were experiencing a shortage of
     men for reasons similar to their own, they sank into a state of great weakness. Hence they were
     compelled to have recourse to the aid of the Athenians, the very people over whom they had once
     set up thirty tyrants,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">The Thirty were instituted as the
      governing board at Athens by Lysander after the capture of the city (<date value="-404" >404</date> B.C.) following the defeat of Aegospotami. Though Sparta's allies wished to
      destroy Athens utterly, Sparta herself would not allow such drastic punishment, but did demand
      the dismantling of the walls, which were torn down by the Athenian populace to the
      accompaniment of flute music. Though forbidden to rebuild, when, after the victory of Cnidus
       (<date value="-394">394</date> B.C.), Conon returned to Athens, the people once again built the walls.</note> whom they had forbidden to rebuild the walls of their city, whose city they
     had aimed utterly to destroy, and whose territory, Attica, they wished to turn into a
     sheepwalk. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Yet, after all, nothing is stronger than necessity
     and fate, which compelled the Lacedaemonians to request the aid of their bitterest enemies.
     Nevertheless they were not disappointed of their hopes. For the Athenian people, magnanimous
     and generous, were not terrified by the power of Thebes, and voted to aid with all their forces
     the Lacedaemonians now that they were in danger of enslavement. Immediately they appointed
     Iphicrates general and dispatched him with twelve thousand young men the self-same day.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6.5.33">Xen. Hell. 6.5.33-49</bibl>. Diodorus brings in too soon the dispatch of Iphicrates and his army. It belongs to the spring

     spirits, advanced with the army at top speed. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Meanwhile the
     Lacedaemonians, as the enemy took up quarters on the borders of Laconia, issued in full force
     from Sparta and marched on to meet them, weakened in military force but strong in inward
     courage. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now Epameinondas and the others, perceiving that the
     country of the Lacedaemonians was difficult to invade, thought it not to their advantage to
     make the invasion with such a large force in a body, and so decided to divide their army into
     four columns and enter at several points.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">The best account

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the first contingent, composed of the Boeotians, took the middle route to the city
     known as Sellasia<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">A rendezvous deep in Laconian territory north of Sparta.</note> and caused its inhabitants to revolt from the Lacedaemonians.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Argives, entering by the borders of Tegeatis,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">South-eastern corner of Arcadia bordering Argolis.</note>

     largest number, invaded the district called Sciritis,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">A high mountainous district in the north of Laconia on the road leading from Sparta to Tegea.</note> 
     which had a large garrison under Ischolas, a man of conspicuous valour and shrewdness. Himself
     one of the most distinguished soldiers, he accomplished an heroic and memorable deed.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For, seeing that, because of the overwhelming number of the
     enemy, all who joined battle with them would be killed, he decided that while it was not in
     keeping with Spartan dignity to abandon his post in the pass, yet it would be useful to his
     country to preserve the men. He therefore in an amazing manner provided for both objects and
     emulated the courageous exploit of King Leonidas at Thermopylae.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">The historic occasion, <date value="-480">480</date> B.C., when Leonidas sent home all but three hundred Spartans, whom he kept to hold up Xerxes' advance. See Book 11.11.</note>

     to be of service to her in her hour of deadly peril. He himself, keeping his post with the
     older men, slew many of the enemy, but finally, encircled by the Arcadians, perished with all
     his corps. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Eleians, who formed the fourth contingent,
     marching by other unguarded regions, reached Sellasia, for this was the locality designated to
     all as the rendezvous. When all the army had gathered in Sellasia, they advanced upon Sparta
     itself, sacking and burning the countryside. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="65">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the Lacedaemonians, who for five
     hundred years had preserved Laconia undevastated, could not then bear to see it being sacked by
     the enemy, but hot-headedly were ready to rush forth from the city; but being restrained by the
     elders from advancing too far from their native land, lest some one attack it, they were
     finally prevailed upon to wait quietly and keep the city safe. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Now Epameinondas descended through the Taygetus<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Mountain range immediately above Sparta bordering the Eurotas River.</note> into the Eurotas valley and
     was engaged in crossing the river, whose current was swift since it was the winter season, when
     the Lacedaemonians, seeing their opponents' army thrown into confusion by the difficulty of the
     crossing, seized the opportunity favourable for attack. Leaving the women, children, and the
     old men as well in the city to guard Sparta, they marshalled in full force the men of military
     age, streamed forth against the enemy, fell upon them suddenly as they crossed, and wrought
     heavy slaughter. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But as the Boeotians and Arcadians fought
     back and began to encircle the enemy with their superior numbers, the Spartans, having slain
     many, withdrew to the city, for they had clearly displayed their own courage. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Following this, as Epameinondas in full force made a formidable assault
     on the city, the Spartans with the aid of their strong natural defences slew many of those who
     pressed rashly forward, but finally the besiegers applied great pressure and thought at first
     they had overcome Sparta by force; but as those who tried to force their way were some slain,
     some wounded, Epameinondas recalled the soldiers with the trumpet, but the men of their own
     accord would approach the city, and would challenge the Spartans to a pitched battle, bidding
     them otherwise admit their inferiority to the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When the
     Spartans replied to the effect that when they found a suitable occasion they would stake
     everything on one battle, they departed from the city. And when they had devastated all Laconia
     and amassed countless spoils, they withdrew to Arcadia. <milestone unit="section" n="6" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Thereupon the Athenians,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman" >See chap. 63.2. Xenophon places the request for help from Athens after the attack on Sparta

     scene too late for action, returned to Attica without accomplishing anything of note; but
     others of their allies, to the number of four thousand men, came to reinforce the
     Lacedaemonians. Besides these they attached to their numbers the Helots who had been newly
     emancipated, a thousand, and two hundred of the Boeotian fugitives, and summoned no small
     number from the neighbouring cities, so that they created an army comparable to that of the
     enemy. As they maintained these in one body and trained them, they gained more and more
     confidence and made themselves ready for the decisive contest. </p>

     against Sparta. When they all concurred, he sought out the remnants of the Messenians, and

     might have slain many of the enemy, was satisfied with his advantage and desisted from further
     combat. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>A serious suspicion arose that he had spared the

     consideration, he pointed out that this attempt was both expedient and possible, alleging in
     particular that it was easy for those who possessed supremacy on land to acquire the mastery of
     the sea. The Athenians, for instance, in the war with Xerxes, who had two hundred ships manned
     by themselves, were subject to the commands of the Lacedaemonians who provided only ten ships.

      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>At that time<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Diodorus'

     Thebans decided to take the field against Orchomenus for the following reasons. Certain
     refugees who wanted to change the constitution of Thebes to an aristocracy induced the knights
     of Orchomenus, three hundred in all, to join them in the attempt. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>These knights, who were in the habit of meeting with some Thebans on a stated day for a
     review under arms, agreed to make the attack on this day, and along with many others who joined
     the movement and added their efforts, they met at the appointed time. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Now the men who had originated the action changed their minds, and disclosed to the
     boeotarchs the projected attack, thus betraying their fellow conspirators, and by this service
     they purchased safety for themselves. The officials arrested the knights from Orchomenus and
     brought them before the assembly, where the people voted to execute them, to sell the
     inhabitants of Orchomenus into slavery, and to raze the city. For from earliest times the
     Thebans had been ill-disposed towards them, having paid tribute to the Minyae<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Peoples of prehistoric Greece who from Orchomenus ruled a large area of central Greece.</note> in the heroic age, but later they had been liberated by
     Heracles. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>So the Thebans, thinking they had a good opportunity
     and having got plausible pretexts for punishing them, took the field against Orchomenus,
     occupied the city, slew the male inhabitants and sold into slavery the women and children.

     Lacedaemonians, in full force, were plundering the territory of Tegea. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Supposing then that Sparta was stripped of soldiers, he planned a great
     stroke, but fortune worked against him. He himself set out by night to Sparta, but the
     Lacedaemonian king Agis, suspecting the cunning of Epameinondas, shrewdly guessed what he would
     do, and sent out some Cretan runners and through them forestalling Epameinondas got word to the
     men who had been left behind in Sparta that the Boeotians would shortly appear in Lacedaemon to
     sack the city, but that he himself would come as quickly as possible with his army to bring aid
     to his native land.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 7.5.4">Xen.

      Sparta. Except for the well-known bias of Xenophon for Agesilaus, one could unhesitatingly
      suspect Diodorus, especially since no Spartan king Agis is known for this date. Cleomenes,
      brother of Agesipolis and son of Cleombrotus, succeeded the former in 370 and still ruled (see

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Cretans speedily carried out their orders, and the Lacedaemonians miraculously
     avoided the capture of their native land; for had not the attack been disclosed in advance,
     Epameinondas would have burst into Sparta undetected. We can justly praise the ingenuity of
     both generals, but should deem the strategy of the Laconian the shrewder. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>It is true that Epameinondas, without resting the entire night, covered
     the distance at top speed and at daybreak attacked Sparta. But Agesilaus, who had been left on
     guard and had learned only shortly before from the Cretans all about the enemy's plan,
     straightway devoted his utmost energy to the care of the city's defence. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He placed the oldest children and the aged on the roofs of the houses
     and instructed them from there to defend themselves against the enemy if he forced a way into
     the city, while he himself lined up the men in the prime of life and apportioned them to the
     obstacles in front of the city and to the approaches, and, having blocked all places that could
     offer passage, he awaited the attack of the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />Epameinondas, after dividing his soldiers into several columns, attacked everywhere at once,
     but when he saw the disposition of the Spartans, he knew immediately that his move had been
     revealed. Nevertheless he made the assault on all the positions one after the other, and,
     though he was at a disadvantage because of the obstacles, closed in a hand-to-hand combat.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Many a blow he received and dealt and did not call off the
     zealous rivalry until the army of the Lacedaemonians re-entered Sparta. Then as many came to

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Having
     learned from his captives that the Mantineians had come in full force to assist the

     having given orders to prepare mess, he left some of the horsemen and ordered them to burn
     fires in the camp until the morning watch, while he himself set out with his army and hurried

     his expectations he lost the victory. For just as he was approaching the unprotected city, on

     Lacedaemonians and Mantineians made their appearance as well, whereat all got ready for the
     contest which was to decide the issue and summoned their allies from every direction.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>On the side of the Mantineians were the Eleians,
     Lacedaemonians, Athenians, and a few others, who numbered all told more than twenty thousand
     foot and about two thousand horse. On the side of the Tegeans the most numerous and bravest of

     having sacrificed on both sides, declared that victory was foreshadowed by the gods. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In the disposition of forces the Mantineians with the rest of the
     Arcadians occupied the right wing with the Lacedaemonians as their neighbours and supporters,
     and next to these were Eleians and Achaeans; and the weaker of the remaining forces occupied
     the centre, while the Athenians filled the left wing. The Thebans themselves had their post on
     the left wing, supported by the Arcadians, while they entrusted the right to the Argives. The
     remaining multitude filled the middle of the line: Euboeans, Locrians, Sicyonians, Messenians,
     Malians, Aenianians, together with Thessalians and the remaining allies. Both sides divided the
     cavalry and placed contingents on each wing. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Such was the
     array of the armaments, and now as they approached one another, the trumpets sounded the battle
     charge, the armies raised the battle shout, and by the very volume of their cries betokened
     their victory. At first they engaged in a cavalry battle on the flanks in which they outbid
     each other in keen rivalry. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now as the Athenian horse attacked
     the Theban they suffered defeat not so much because of the quality of their mounts nor yet on
     the score of the riders' courage or experience in horsemanship, for in none of these
     departments was the Athenian cavalry deficient; but it was in the numbers and equipment of the
     light-armed troops and in their tactical skill that they were far inferior to their opponents.
     Indeed they had only a few javelin-throwers, whereas the Thebans had three times as many
     slingers and javelin-throwers sent them from the regions about Thessaly. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>These people practised from boyhood assiduously this type of fighting
     and consequently were wont to exercise great weight in battles because of their experience in
     handling these missiles. Consequently the Athenians, who were continually being wounded by the
     light-armed and were harried to exhaustion by the opponents who confronted them, all turned and
     fled. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But having fled beyond the flanks, they managed to
     retrieve their defeat, for even in their retreat they did not break their own phalanx, and
     encountering simultaneously the Euboeans and certain mercenaries who had been dispatched to
     seize the heights near by, they gave battle and slew them all. <milestone unit="section" n="7" />Now the Theban horse did not follow up the fugitives, but, assailing the phalanx opposing
     them, strove zealously to outflank the infantry. The battle was a hot one; the Athenians were
     exhausted and had turned to flee, when the Eleian cavalry-commander, assigned to the rear, came
     to the aid of the fugitives and, by striking down many Boeotians, reversed the course of the
     battle. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>So while the Eleian cavalry by their appearance in
     this fashion on the left wing retrieved the defeat their allies had sustained, on the other
     flank both cavalry forces lashed at one another and the battle hung for a short time in the
     balance, but then, because of the number and valour of the Boeotian and Thessalian horsemen,
     the contingents on the Mantineian side were forced back, and with considerable loss took refuge
     with their own phalanx. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="86">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the cavalry battle had the foregoing issue. But when the
     infantry forces closed with the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, a mighty, stupendous struggle
     ensued. For never at any other time when Greeks fought Greeks was such a multitude of men
     arrayed, nor did generals of greater repute or men more competent ever display such gallantry
     in battle. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For the most capable foot-soldiers of that time,
     Boeotians and Lacedaemonians, whose lines were drawn up facing one another, began the contest,
     exposing their lives to every risk. After the first exchange of spears in which most were
     shattered by the very density of the missiles, they engaged with swords. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And although their bodies were all locked with one another and they were
     inflicting all manner of wounds, yet they did not leave off; and for a long time as they
     persisted in their terrible work, because of the superlative courage displayed on each side,
     the battle hung poised. For each man, disregarding the risk of personal hurt, but desirous
     rather of performing some brilliant deed, would nobly accept death as the price of glory.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>As the battle raged severely for a long time and the conflict
     took no turn in favour of either side, Epameinondas, conceiving that victory called for the
     display of his own valour also, decided to be himself the instrument to decide the issue. So he
     immediately took his best men, grouped them in close formation and charged into the midst of
     the enemy; he led his battalion in the charge and was the first to hurl his javelin, and hit
     the commander of the Lacedaemonians. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Then, as the rest of his
     men also came immediately into close quarters with the foe, he slew some, threw others into a
     panic, and broke through the enemy phalanx. The Lacedaemonians, overawed by the prestige of
     Epameinondas and by the sheer weight of the contingent he led, withdrew from the battle, but
     the Boeotians kept pressing the attack and continually slaying any men who were in the rear
     rank, so that a multitude of corpses was piled up. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="87">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As for the Lacedaemonians, when they saw
     that Epameinondas in the fury of battle was pressing forward too eagerly, they charged him in a
     body. As the missiles flew thick and fast about him, he dodged some, others he fended off,
     still others he pulled from his body and used to ward off his attackers. But while struggling
     heroically for the victory, he received a mortal wound in the chest. As the spear broke and the
     iron point was left in his body, he fell of a sudden, his strength sapped by the wound. About
     his body a rivalry ensued in which many were slain on both sides, but at last with difficulty
     by their superiority in bodily strength, the Thebans wore the Lacedaemonians out. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>As the latter turned and fled, the Boeotians pursued for a short time
     but turned back, considering it most essential to take possession of the bodies of the dead.
     So, when the trumpeters sounded recall for their men, all withdrew from battle and both sides
     set up trophies claiming the victory. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In fact the Athenians
     had defeated the Euboeans and mercenaries in the battle for the heights and were in possession
     of the dead; while the Boeotians, because they had overpowered the Lacedaemonians and were in
     possession of the dead, were for awarding the victory to themselves. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So for a long time neither side sent envoys to recover its dead, in order that it
     should not appear to yield the primacy; but later, when the Lacedaemonians were the first to
     have sent a herald to ask for the recovery of their dead, each side buried its own. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Epameinondas, however, was carried back to camp still living, and the
     physicians were summoned, but when they declared that undoubtedly as soon as the spear-point
     should be drawn from his chest, death would ensue, with supreme courage he met his end.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For first summoning his armour-bearer he asked him if he had
     saved his shield. On his replying yes and placing it before his eyes, he again asked, which
     side was victorious. At the boy's answer that the Boeotians were victorious, he said, "It is
     time to die," and directed them to withdraw the spear point. His friends present cried out in
     protest, and one of them said: "You die childless, Epameinondas," and burst into tears. To this
     he replied, "No, by Zeus, on the contrary I leave behind two daughters, Leuctra and Mantineia,
     my victories."<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Had <foreign lang="greek">*leu=ktra</foreign> not been a neuter plural, the Greek would have permitted the more effective turn of phrase
      available in English. Cp. Philip of Macedon's daughter, Thessalonike, "Victory in

     his last. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="88">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For us who are wont to accord to the demise of great men the appropriate
     meed of praise, it would be most unfitting, so we think, to pass by the death of a man of such
     stature with no word of note. For it seems to me that he surpassed his contemporaries not only
     in skill and experience in the art of war, but in reasonableness and magnanimity as well.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For among the generation of Epameinondas were famous men:
     Pelopidas the Theban, Timotheus and Conon, also Chabrias and Iphicrates, Athenians all, and,
     besides, Agesilaus the Spartan, who belonged to a slightly older generation. Still earlier than
     these, in the times of the Medes and Persians, there were Solon, Themistocles, Miltiades, and
     Cimon, Myronides, and Pericles and certain others in Athens, and in Sicily Gelon, son of
     Deinomenes, and still others. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>All the same, if you should
     compare the qualities of these with the generalship and reputation of Epameinondas, you would
     find the qualities possessed by Epameinondas far superior. For in each of the others you would
     discover but one particular superiority as a claim to fame; in him, however, all qualities
     combined. For in strength of body and eloquence of speech, furthermore in elevation of mind,
     contempt of lucre, fairness, and, most of all, in courage and shrewdness in the art of war, he
     far surpassed them all. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So it was that in his lifetime his
     native country acquired the primacy of Hellas, but when he died lost it and constantly suffered
     change for the worse and finally, because of the folly of its leaders, experienced slavery and
     devastation. So Epameinondas, whose valour was approved among all men, in the manner we have
     shown met his death. </p>

      Mithridates hinge on the following facts: (1) Ariobarzanes in 407 was subordinate to
      Pharnabazus, satrap of Dascyleion (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 1.4.7">Xen. Hell. 1.4.7</bibl>). (2)
      Ariobarzanes about 387 succeeded Pharnabazus in the satrapy of Dascyleion when Pharnabazus was
      summoned to the court to marry the daughter of Artaxerxes (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 5.1.28">Xen.
       Hell. 5.1.28</bibl>); (3) Ariobarzanes refused to give up his throne to Pharnabazus' son,
      Artabazus (chap. 91.2), by the King's daughter when Artabazus grew up, and so became
      ringleader of the Satraps' Revolt. (Cp. <bibl n="Nep. Dat. 2.5">Nepos Datames 2.5</bibl>;
      Trogus Prol. 10; <bibl n="Dem. 15.9">Dem. 15.9</bibl>; <bibl n="Isoc. 15.111">Isoc. 15.111
      ff.</bibl>; <bibl n="Nep. Timoth. 1.2">Nepos Timotheus 1.2, 3</bibl>.) (4) Ariobarzanes was
      betrayed by his son Mithridates, sent up to court and crucified about 362. (See Harpocration;
       <bibl n="Xen. Cyrop. 8.8.4">Xen. Cyrop. 8.8.4</bibl>; <bibl n="Aristot. Pol. 5.1312a">Aristot.
       Pol. 1312a</bibl>, and <bibl n="V. Max. 9.11">Valerius Maximus 9.11, ext. 2</bibl>.) (5)
      Ariobarzanes (this passage) succeeded Mithridates in the kingship (sc. of Pontus). (6)
      Ariobarzanes died (Book 16.90.2) in 337/6 after ruling (sc. in Pontus) for twenty-six years
      (fits with this passage) and was succeeded by Mithridates. Note that Harpocration alone speaks
      of the crucifixion of Ariobarzanes. The mention by Aristotle of the attack on Ariobarzanes by
      Mithridates is tentatively placed in the year 337/6 by Rackham, <title>L.C.L.</title> 450.
      Since Xenophon mentions the murder in the <title>Education of Cyrus</title> in juxtaposition
      with Rheomithres and Tachos, it seems probable that the death of Ariobarzanes is to be placed
      in 362 and not in 337/6 when Xenophon was probably dead and the <title>Education of
      Cyrus</title> was almost certainly finished. One must therefore agree with Judeich (P.-W.
       <title>Realencyclop&auml;die, s.v.</title> "Ariobarzanes") that numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4
      refer to the same man, a different Ariobarzanes from numbers 5 and 6. Beloch
       (<title>Griechische Geschichte &lpar;2&rpar;,</title> 3.2. sect. 60) comes to this conclusion and says that Diodorus is here mistaken in stating that Ariobarzanes takes over the
      throne from Mithridates. If this is Mithridates I of Pontus, he is succeeded by his son
      Ariobarzanes who is most likely the nephew of the satrap Ariobarzanes in question here. The
      nephew Ariobarzanes, probably known as Ariobarzanes of Cios (and Arrhine (?), cp. Book
      20.111.4), is succeeded by his son Mithridates II. The uncle, the revolting satrap, also had a

     conduct the war through the agency of his generals, though the advice was sound. In fact when

      8</bibl>. Plutarch appears to be the most reliable. In particular Agesilaus is elsewhere
      reported to have changed allegiance from Tachos to Nectanebos. According to Olmstead
       (<title>History of the Persian Empire,</title> 417, 419-420) Agesilaus served in Egypt from 360 to 358.</note> Nectanebos, who had collected more than a hundred thousand men, came
     against Tachos and challenged him to fight a battle for the kingship. Now Agesilaus, observing
     that the king was terrified and lacked the courage to risk a battle, bade him take heart.
     "For," said he, "it is not those who have the advantage of numbers who win the victory, but
     those who excel in valour." But since the king paid no heed to Agesilaus, he was obliged to
     withdraw with him to a large city. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Egyptians at first
     started to assault them once they were shut in it, but when they had lost many men in their
     attacks on the walls, they then began to surround the city with a wall and a ditch. As the work
     was rapidly nearing completion by reason of the large number of workers, and the provisions in
     the city were exhausted, Tachos despaired of his safety, but Agesilaus, encouraging the men and
     attacking the enemy by night, unexpectedly succeeded in bringing all the men out safely.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And since the Egyptians had pursued close on their heels and
     the district was now flat, the Egyptians supposed that they had the enemy surrounded by
     superior numbers, and would utterly destroy them, but Agesilaus seized a position which had on
     each side a canal fed by the river and thus halted the enemy's attack. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Then having drawn up his force in conformity with the terrain and
     protected his army by the river channels, he joined battle. The superior numbers of the

    </argument>
    <div2 type="chapter" n="1">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />In all systematic historical treatises it behooves the historian to include in his books
     actions of states or of kings which are complete in themselves from beginning to end; for in
     this manner I conceive history to be most easy to remember and most intelligible to the reader.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now incomplete actions, the conclusion of which is
     unconnected with the beginning, interrupt the interest of the curious reader, whereas if the
     actions embrace a continuity of development culminating naturally, the narrative of events will
     achieve a well-rounded perfection. Whenever the natural pattern of events itself harmonizes
     with the task of the historian, from that point on he must not deviate at all from this
      principle.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">In Book 1.3 Diodorus sets forth his design for the History. Inasmuch as it is a "universal history," the fortunes of a single man, e.g.
      Philip, might well be spread over a considerable compass, since the author pursues the
      chronological order. The fortunes of Philip have a particular advantage, in that Diodorus can
      deal with them compactly&mdash;he says here in a single book&mdash;and still maintain
      his chronological plan.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Consequently, now that I have reached the actions of Philip
     son of Amyntas, I shall endeavour to include the deeds performed by this king within the
     compass of the present Book. For Philip was king over the Macedonians for twenty-four years,
     and having started from the most insignificant beginnings built up his kingdom to be the
     greatest of the dominions in Europe, and having taken over Macedonia when she was a slave to
     the Illyrians, made her mistress of many powerful tribes and states. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And it was by his own valour that he took over the supremacy of all Hellas with the
     consent of the states, which voluntarily subordinated themselves to his authority. Having
     subdued in war the men who had been plundering the shrine at Delphi and having brought aid to
     the oracle, he won a seat in the Amphictyonic Council, and because of his reverence for the
     gods received as his prize in the contest, after the defeat of the Phocians, the votes which
     had been theirs. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Then when he had conquered in war Illyrians,
     Paeonians, Thracians, Scythians, and all the peoples in the vicinity of these, he planned to
     overthrow the Persian kingdom, and, after transporting his armaments into Asia, was in the act
     of liberating the Greek cities; but, cut short by Fate in mid-career, he left armies so
     numerous and powerful that his son Alexander had no need to apply for allies in his attempt to
     overthrow the Persian supremacy.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">The events in this chapter are taken up in the later narrative where proper annotations will appear.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>And these deeds he accomplished, not by the favour of Fortune,
     but by his own valour. For King Philip excelled in shrewdness in the art of war, courage, and
     brilliance of personality. But, not to anticipate his achievements in my introduction, I shall
     proceed to the continuous thread of the narrative after first briefly retracing his early
     period. </p>

      Alexander send him to Thebes (Book 15.67.4) as does <bibl n="Plut. Pel. 26.4">Plut. Pelopidas

       gr.</title> 3.227), and the author of the article on Philip in P.-W.
       (<title>Realencyclop&auml;die,</title> 19.2266) agree that Ptolemy of Alorus, paramour
      and later husband of Eurydice, widow of Amyntas III, was the monarch who sent Philip to
      Thebes, basing their account on Aeschines (<bibl n="Aeschin. 2.26">Aeschin. 2.26 ff.</bibl>),
      who places Philip at the court of Ptolemy when he succeeded Alexander II (369). Philip was
      probably in Thebes 368-365. His adoption of the "oblique order of battle" from Epameinondas is
      probably the most striking result of his sojourn in Thebes (see Wilcken, <title>Alexander the
       Great,</title> translated by G. C. Richards, 30).</note> They in turn entrusted the lad to
     the father of Epameinondas and directed him both to keep careful watch over his ward and to
     superintend his upbringing and education. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Since Epameinondas
     had as his instructor a philosopher of the Pythagorean school,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Lysis of Tarentum (see <bibl n="Nep. Ep. 2.2">Nepos Epaminondas 2.2</bibl>).
      But Wesseling quotes <bibl n="Plut. de Genio 584b">Plut. De Genio Socratis 584b</bibl>, to show
      that Lysis died shortly before the deliverance of Thebes. For the education of Epameinondas
      see Book 15.39.2. According to <bibl n="Plut. Pel. 26.5">Plut. Pelopidas 26.5</bibl>, Philip
      was a hostage in the house of Pammenes (see Books 15.94.2 and 16.34.1-2) and not in the house
      of Epameinondas' father, whose name was Polymnus (<bibl n="Nep. Ep. 1.1">Nepos Epaminondas
      1.1</bibl>). Certainly Epameinondas had passed his student days when Philip was a hostage, since he had already won the battle of Leuctra.</note> Philip, who was reared along with him,
     acquired a wide acquaintance with the Pythagorean philosophy. Inasmuch as both students showed
     natural ability and diligence they proved to be superior in deeds of valour. Of the two,
     Epameinondas underwent the most rigorous tests and battles, and invested his fatherland almost
     miraculously with the leadership of Hellas, while Philip, availing himself of the same initial
     training, achieved no less fame than Epameinondas. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For after

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Macedonians because of the disaster sustained in the battle and the magnitude of
     the dangers pressing upon them were in the greatest perplexity. Yet even so, with such fears
     and dangers threatening them, Philip was not panic-stricken by the magnitude of the expected
     perils, but, bringing together the Macedonians in a series of assemblies and exhorting them
     with eloquent speeches to be men, he built up their morale, and, having improved the
     organization of his forces and equipped the men suitably with weapons<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">For the reorganization of the Macedonian army see Pickard-Cambridge,
       <title>Cambridge Ancient History,</title> 6.205. The addition of foot-soldiers to form the
      famous "Phalanx" and the provision of a long pike, <emph>sarissa,</emph> were the most
      important military reforms. See also Wilcken, <title>Alexander the Great</title> (trans.), 31-32.</note> of war, he held constant manoeuvres of the men under arms and competitive
     drills. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Indeed he devised the compact order and the equipment
     of the phalanx, imitating the close order fighting with overlapping shields of the warriors at
      Troy,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See <bibl n="Hom. Il. 13.131">Hom. Il.

     multitudes by his gifts and his promises to the fullest loyalty, and endeavoured to counteract
     by clever moves the crowd of impending dangers. For instance, when he observed that the
     Athenians were centring all their ambition upon recovering Amphipolis and for this reason were
     trying to bring Argaeus back to the throne, he voluntarily withdrew from the city, after first
     making it autonomous.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Amphipolis was coveted by the
      Athenians (who had lost it to Brasidas in the Peloponnesian War) because of its commanding
      position by the Strymon River, giving access to the plains of Macedonia, and its nearness to
      forests needed in shipbuilding and to the gold and silver mines of Mt. Pangaeus. Between this
      occasion when Amphipolis was declared autonomous to thwart Argaeus, who had promised to hand
      it over to Athens if they made him king, and Philip's capture of the town (see chap. 8.2 ff.),
      a secret treaty was made by which Philip promised to procure Amphipolis for Athens if he were
      assured of a free hand in Pydna, formerly Macedonian but then in the Athenian League. See

     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Then he sent an embassy to the Paeonians, and by corrupting
     some with gifts and persuading others by generous promises he made an agreement with them to
     maintain peace for the present. In similar fashion he prevented the return of Pausanias by
     winning over with gifts the king<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">The Thracian king mentioned chap. 2.6.</note> who was on the point of attempting his restoration. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Mantias, the Athenian general, who had sailed into Methone,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See chap. 2.6.

      Aegae.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Old capital of Macedonia, considerably inland.</note> And Argaeus approached the city and invited the population of Aegae to welcome
     his return and become the founders of his own kingship. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When
     no one paid any attention to him, he turned back to Methone, but Philip, who suddenly appeared

     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now that he was relieved of the war with the Athenians and had
     information that the king of the Paeonians, Agis, was dead, he conceived that he had the
     opportunity to attack the Paeonians. Accordingly, having conducted an expedition into Paeonia
     and defeated the barbarians in a battle, he compelled the tribe to acknowledge allegiance to
     the Macedonians. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And since the Illyrians were still left as
     enemies, he was ambitious to defeat them in war also. So, having quickly called an assembly and
     exhorted his soldiers for the war in a fitting speech, he led an expedition into the Illyrian
     territory, having no less than ten thousand foot-soldiers and six hundred horsemen. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Bardylis,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">For the power of this king see chap. 2.5.</note> the king of the Illyrians, having learned of the presence of the enemy,
     first dispatched envoys to arrange for a cessation of hostilities on the condition that both
     sides remained possessed of the cities which they then controlled. But when Philip said that he
     indeed desired peace but would not, however, concur in that proposal unless the Illyrians
     should withdraw from all the Macedonian cities, the envoys returned without having accomplished
     their purpose, and Bardylis, relying upon his previous victories and the gallant conduct of the
     Illyrians, came out to meet the enemy with his army; and he had ten thousand picked infantry
     soldiers and about five hundred cavalry. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When the armies
     approached each other and with a great outcry clashed in the battle, Philip, commanding the
     right wing, which consisted of the flower of the Macedonians serving under him, ordered his
     cavalry to ride past the ranks of the barbarians and attack them on the flank, while he himself
     falling on the enemy in a frontal assault began a bitter combat.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See chap. 8.1; <bibl n="Just. 7.6.7">Justin 7.6.7</bibl> and <bibl n="Fron. Str. 2.3.2">Frontinus Strat. 2.3.2</bibl>. Beloch has a critical account of this
      battle, which he places near Monastir, in <title>Griechische Geschichte

     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But the Illyrians, forming themselves into a square,
     courageously entered the fray. And at first for a long while the battle was evenly poised
     because of the exceeding gallantry displayed on both sides, and as many were slain and still
     more wounded, the fortune of battle vacillated first one way then the other, being constantly
     swayed by the valorous deeds of the combatants; but later as the horsemen pressed on from the
     flank and rear and Philip with the flower of his troops fought with true heroism, the mass of
     the Illyrians was compelled to take hastily to flight. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>When
     the pursuit had been kept up for a considerable distance and many had been slain in their
     flight, Philip recalled the Macedonians with the trumpet and erecting a trophy of victory
     buried his own dead, while the Illyrians, having sent ambassadors and withdrawn from all the
     Macedonian cities, obtained peace. But more than seven thousand Illyrians were slain in this

     together the men who had survived the razing of Naxos by Dionysius. Having settled the hill

     his "remaining on Tauros."<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">For a different story see Book 14.59.2. Naxos (three miles from Tauromenium) was destroyed by Dionysius in 403 (Book 14.15.2)
      and its territory assigned to neighbouring Siculi (ibid. 3). These occupied the hill of Taurus
      to the north of Naxos and gave it the name Tauromenium. The Siculi in 394 warded off a
      surprise winter attack of Dionysius (Book 14.87-88). By the peace of 392 Dionysius regained
      Tauromenium, expelled the Siculi, and settled his mercenaries on the spot (Book 14.96.4).
      Probably this present settlement by Andromachus is to be regarded as a new foundation. See
      Wesseling's note on Book 14.59.</note> And as the city made quick progress, the inhabitants

     Euboea. A good many close combats and skirmishes occurred in which sometimes the Thebans were
     superior and sometimes the Athenians carried off the victory. Although no important pitched
     battle was fought to a finish, yet when the island had been devastated by the intestinal

     For this reason the Athenians and Philip were rivals against one another for the alliance with
     the Olynthians. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>However that may be, Philip, when he had
     forced Potidaea to surrender, led the Athenian garrison out of the city and, treating it
     considerately, sent it back to Athens&mdash;for he was particularly solicitous toward the
     people of Athens on account of the importance and repute of their city&mdash;but, having

     output so much by his improvements that they could bring him a revenue of more than a thousand

      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The cause for Dion's successes was, above all others, his own
     nobility of spirit, his courage, and the willing support of those who were to be liberated, but
     still more important than all these were the pusillanimity of the tyrant and his subjects'
     hatred of him; for when all these characteristics merged at a single critical moment, they
     unexpectedly brought to a successful close deeds which were considered impossible. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But we must forgo these reflections and
     turn to the detailed narrative of the events as they severally occurred. Dion, having sailed
     from Zacynthos, which lies by Cephallenia, with two merchantmen, put in at the harbour of
     Acragas named Minoa. This had been founded of olden time by Minos, king of the Cretans, on the
     occasion when, in his search for Daedalus, he had been entertained by Cocalus, king of the
      Sicanians,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">For this myth see Book 4.77-79. There is no mention of "founding" Minoa in chap. 79.</note> but in the period with which we are concerned
     this city was subject to the Carthaginians, and its governor, named Paralus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman"><bibl n="Plut. Dio 25">Plut. Dion 25-26.3</bibl>, gives a more
      detailed account of Dion's voyage and his landing at Minoa. Synalus (<bibl n="Plut. Dio 25.5" >Plut. Dion 25.5</bibl>) is there the name given to the Carthaginian commander, Dion's
      friend. It is very possible that Carthage favoured Dion's project since it gave every
      indication of weakening the military power of Syracuse (see Beloch, <title>Griechische
       Geschichte &lpar;2&rpar;,</title> 3.1.258).</note> who was a friend of Dion, received
     him enthusiastically. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Dion, having unloaded from the
     merchantmen five thousand suits of armour, handed them over to Paralus and requested him to
     transport them on wagons to Syracuse, while he himself, taking along the mercenaries<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">These seem to be the mercenaries he had brought, not new ones (see chap. 6.5).</note> numbering a thousand, led them against Syracuse. On the march he
     persuaded the peoples of Acragas, Gela, and some of the Sicanians and Sicels who dwelt in the
     interior, also the people of Camarina, to join in the liberation of the Syracusans, and then
     advanced to overthrow the tyrant. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Since many men with their
     arms streamed in from all sides, soon more than twenty thousand soldiers were gathered.
     Likewise many also of the Greeks from Italy and of the Messenians were summoned, and all came

     having brought them all to a general assembly, he disclosed that he had come for the liberation
     of the Greeks of Sicily, and he urged them to elect as generals those men who were well
     qualified to effect the restoration of their independence and the dissolution of the entire

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Since the Syracusans had constructed a crosswall of their own from sea to
     sea, the mercenaries fell upon the wall with a loud and terrifying outcry, massacred many of
     the garrison and, getting inside the wall, engaged in a struggle with those who were coming out
     to the rescue. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Dion, being unexpectedly tricked by the
     violation of the truce, came to meet the enemy with his best soldiers and joining battle
     wrought extensive slaughter. For when fighting took place, as if in a stadium, within the
     narrow interval afforded by the crosswall, a multitude of soldiers collected in a contracted
     space. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For this reason on both sides men outstanding in
     gallantry met in the action and since Dionysius' mercenaries, by the size of the promised
     rewards, and the Syracusans, by the hope of freedom, were wrought up to a high pitch of
     rivalry, at first the battle stood equally poised, as the valour of both sides in the fight was
     equal. Many fell, and not a few were wounded, receiving all the blows in front; for on the one
     hand those in the front rank courageously met death defending the rest, and those arrayed
     behind them covering them with their shields as they fell and holding firm in the desperate
     peril took the most dangerous risks to win the victory. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After
     this engagement Dion, wishing to display his valour in the battle and eager to win the victory
     by his own deeds, forced his way into the midst of the enemy and there in an heroic encounter
     slew many and having disrupted the whole battle line of the mercenaries was suddenly cut off
     and isolated in the crowd. Many missiles hurled at him fell upon his shield and helmet, but he
     escaped these owing to the protection of his armour, but receiving a wound on his right arm he
     was borne down by the weight of the blow and barely escaped capture by the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Syracusans, fearing for their general's safety, dashed into the
     mercenaries in heavy formation and rescued the distressed Dion from his perils, then
     overpowering the enemy, forced them to flee. Since likewise in the other part of the wall the
     Syracusans had the superiority, the tyrant's mercenaries were chased in a body inside the gates
     of the Island. The Syracusans, who had now won victory in a significant battle and had securely
     recovered their freedom, set up a trophy to signalize the tyrant's defeat.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">For this battle see <bibl n="Plut. Dio 30.4">Plut. Dion 30.4-8</bibl>.</note>

     from Dionysius, and having succeeded in entering the walls by night captured a portion of the
     city. A sharp engagement ensued, and the Syracusans came to the aid of the Leontinians, so that
     he was defeated and was driven out of Leontini. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Heracleides,
     who had been left behind by Dion as commander of his men-of-war, having been hindered by storms

     Dion's return and the liberation of the Syracusans, but he now came with twenty men-of-war and
     fifteen hundred soldiers. Being a man of very great distinction and considered worthy of the
     position, he was chosen admiral by the Syracusans, and, having been assigned to the supreme
     command of the armed forces along with Dion, he participated in the war against Dionysius.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After this Philistus, who had been appointed general and had
     fitted out sixty triremes, fought a naval battle with the Syracusans, who had about the same
     number. As the fight became sharp Philistus at first was superior because of his own gallantry,
     but later on, when he was intercepted by the enemy, the Syracusans, encircling the ships from
     all sides, put forth strenuous efforts to capture the general alive, but Philistus, with
     apprehensions of torture after his capture, slew himself after having performed a great many
     very important services to the tyrants and having proved himself the most faithful of their
     friends to the men in power. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Syracusans, after they had

     was ready to surrender the citadel to the people on the condition that he took his mercenaries
     and his property and went abroad to Italy, and Dion counselled the Syracusans to accept his
     offer. But the people, persuaded by their inopportune demagogues, refused, believing that they

     the others declaring that Dion should have the supremacy over the entire government.
     Furthermore, large sums for wages were due to the Peloponnesian mercenaries who had liberated
     Syracuse and the city was short of funds, so the mercenaries, deprived of their money, banded
     together in excess of three thousand, and since all had been selected for meritorious conduct
     and because of their training in actual warfare were hardened veterans, they were far more than

     had betaken themselves to sleep, he placed against it the ladders that had been constructed in
     case they were needed. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The bravest of the mercenaries climbed
     on the wall with these, slaughtered the guards, and opened the gates. As the men poured into

     bring aid, but, their efforts being hampered by the wine, some were slain and some fled. When
     the city had been captured and almost all the soldiers from the citadel had rushed inside the

     attacked the residences. They carried off much property and took off as slaves many women and
     children and household servants besides. Where the Syracusans formed to meet them in narrow

     The mercenaries from the citadel, having already obtained their objective, after plundering the

     Byzantians were continuing the Social War against the Athenians, both sides were making great
     preparations, for they wished to decide the war by a naval battle. The Athenians had
      previously<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See chap. 7.3-4.</note> sent Chares forth with
     sixty ships, but now, manning sixty more and placing as generals in command the most
     distinguished of their citizens, Iphicrates and Timotheus, they dispatched this expedition
     along with Chares to continue war upon their allies who had revolted. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Chians, Rhodians, and Byzantians together with their allies manned one hundred
     ships and then sacked Imbros and Lemnos, Athenian islands, and having descended on Samos with a
     large contingent laid waste the countryside and besieged the city by land and by sea; and by
     ravaging many other islands that were subject to Athens they collected money for the needs of
     the war. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>All the Athenian generals now met and planned at
     first to besiege the city of the Byzantians, and when later the Chians and their allies
     abandoned the siege of Samos and turned to assist the Byzantians, all the fleets became massed
     in the Hellespont. But just at the time when the naval battle was about to take place a great
     wind fell upon them and thwarted their plans. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When Chares,
     however, though the elements were against him, wished to fight, but Iphicrates and Timotheus
     opposed on account of the heavy sea, Chares, calling upon his soldiers to bear him witness,
     accused his colleagues of treason and wrote to the assembly about them, charging that they had
     purposely shirked the sea-fight.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See <bibl n="Nep. Timoth. 3">Nepos Timotheus 3</bibl>. Menestheus, son of Iphicrates and son-in-law of Timotheus, was

      battle of Embata, not in the Hellespont, but near Erythrae. See Nepos, l.c.: "hinc male re

     relieve the Athenians of its expense, undertook a hazardous operation. Now Artabazus had
     revolted from the Persian King and with only a few soldiers was on the point of joining combat
     with the satraps who had more than seventy thousand. Chares with all his forces took part with
     Artabazus in a battle and defeated the King's army. And Artabazus, out of gratitude for his
     kindness, made him a present of a large sum of money, with which he was able to furnish his
     entire army with supplies.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See chap. 34.1; <bibl n="Isoc. 7.8">Isoc. 7.8, 10, 81</bibl>; <bibl n="Plut. Arat. 16">Plut. Aratus 16</bibl>;

     when the King sent ambassadors and denounced Chares, they changed their minds; for word had
     been spread abroad that the King had promised Athens' enemies that he would join them in their
     war against the Athenians with three hundred ships. The assembly, accordingly, taking a
     cautious attitude, decided to bring to a close the war against their revolted allies; and
     finding that they too desired peace they easily came to terms with them.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See <bibl n="Dem. 15.26">Dem. 15.26</bibl>; <bibl n="Isoc. 8.16">Isoc.

     number of talents. When they did not discharge the assessments, the hieromnemones<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Recorders or officers in charge of sacred business at meetings of the Amphictyonic Council, two from each nation.</note> of the Amphictyons brought charges
     against the Phocians and demanded of the Council that if the Phocians did not pay the money to
     the god, they should lay under a curse the land of those who were cheating the god. Likewise
     they declared that the others against whom judgments had been passed should discharge their
     fines, the Lacedaemonians being in this category, and if they did not obey, they should incur
     the common hatred of the Greeks for their knavery. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When the
     Greeks all ratified the decisions of the Amphictyons and the territory of the Phocians was
     about to be placed under the curse, Philomelus, who had the highest reputation among the
     Phocians, harangued his fellow countrymen, explaining that they were unable to pay the money on
     account of the magnitude of the fine, and that to allow the territory to be cursed was not only
     cowardly but involved them in danger since it was the destruction of the means by which they
     all lived. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>He endeavoured also to prove that the judgments of
     the Amphictyons were unjust in the highest degree, since they had inflicted huge fines for the
     cultivation of what was a very small parcel of land. Accordingly he advised them to treat the
     fines as null and void and declared that the Phocians had strong grounds for their case against
     the Amphictyons: for in ancient times they had held control and guardianship of the oracle. As
     witness he offered the most ancient and greatest of all poets, Homer who said:<quote type="verse">
      <l met="dactylic">Now over Phocians Schedius ruled and e'en Epistrophus,</l>
      <l>They dwelt in Cyparissus<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Town near Delphi.</note> and in

     </quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.517">Hom. Il. 2.517-519</bibl>
     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>On this account he said they should enter a claim for the
     guardianship of the oracle on the ground that this belonged to the Phocians as an inheritance
     from their fathers. He promised that he would succeed with the enterprise if they would appoint
     him general with absolute power for the entire programme and give him complete authority.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See <bibl n="Polyaen. 5.45">Polyaenus 5.45</bibl>.</note>
     </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="24">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the Phocians out of fear of the judgement elected him general with absolute
     power, Philomelus set about energetically to fulfil his promise. First he went to Sparta, where
     he conversed in private with Archidamus king of the Lacedaemonians, representing that the king
     had an equal interest in the effort to render null and void the judgments of the Amphictyons,
     for there existed serious and unjust pronouncements of that Council to the injury of the
     Lacedaemonians also. He accordingly disclosed to Archidamus that he had decided to seize Delphi
     and that if he succeeded in obtaining the guardianship of the shrine he would annul the decrees
     of the Amphictyons. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Although Archidamus approved of the
     proposal, he said he would not for the present give assistance openly, but that he would
     co-operate secretly in every respect, providing both money and mercenaries. Philomelus, having
     received from him fifteen talents and having added at least as much on his own account, hired
     foreign mercenaries and chose a thousand of the Phocians, whom he called peltasts. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Then, after he had gathered a multitude of soldiers and had seized the
     oracle, he slew the group of Delphians called Thracidae<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman" >Unknown. Wesseling thinks they may be the <foreign lang="greek">*foi/bou *delfoi\
      qe/rapes</foreign>, noble attendants of the shrine, cp. <bibl n="Eur. Ion 94">Eur. Ion
      94</bibl>.</note> who sought to oppose him and confiscated their possessions; but, observing
     that the others were terror-stricken, he exhorted them to be of good cheer since no danger
     would befall them. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When news of the seizure of the shrine was
     noised abroad, the Locrians, who lived near by,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Near Amphissa. The account of the battle is repeated chap. 28.3.</note> straightway took the field
     against Philomelus. A battle took place near Delphi and the Locrians, having been defeated with
     the loss of many of their men, fled to their own territory, and Philomelus, being elated by his
     victory, hacked from the slabs the pronouncements of the Amphictyons, deleted the letters
     recording their judgements, <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>and personally caused the report
     to be circulated that he had resolved not to plunder the oracle nor had he purposed to commit
     any other lawless deed, but that in support of the ancestral claim to the guardianship and
     because of his desire to annul the unjust decrees of the Amphictyons, he was vindicating the
     ancestral laws of the Phocians. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="25">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Boeotians, coming together in an assembly, voted to
     rally to the support of the oracle and immediately dispatched troops. While these things were
     going on, Philomelus threw a wall around the shrine and began to assemble a large number of
     mercenaries by raising the pay to half as much again, and selecting the bravest of the Phocians
     he enrolled them and quickly had a considerable army; for with no less than five thousand
     troops he took up a position in defence of Delphi, already a formidable adversary for those who
     wished to make war upon him. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Later on, having led an
     expedition into the territory of the Locrians and laid waste much of the enemy's land, he
     encamped near a river that flowed past a stronghold. Though he made assaults upon this, he was
     unable to take it and finally desisted from the siege, but joining battle with the Locrians he
     lost twenty of his men, and not being able to get possession of their bodies, he asked through
     a herald the privilege of taking them up. The Locrians, refusing to grant this, gave answer
     that amongst all the Greeks it was the general law that temple-robbers should be cast forth
     without burial. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Philomelus so resented this that he joined
     battle with the Locrians and, bending every effort, slew some of the enemy, and having got
     possession of their bodies compelled the Locrians to make an exchange of the dead. As he was
     master of the open country, he sacked a large portion of Locris and returned to Delphi, having
     given his soldiers their fill of the spoils of war. After this, since he wished to consult the
     oracle for the war, he compelled the Pythian priestess to mount her tripod and deliver the
     oracle. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="26">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Since I have mentioned the tripod, I think it not inopportune to recount
     the ancient story which has been handed down about it. It is said that in ancient times goats
     discovered the oracular shrine, on which account even to this day the Delphians use goats
     preferably when they consult the oracle. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They say that the
     manner of its discovery was the following. There is a chasm at this place where now is situated
     what is known as the "forbidden" sanctuary, and as goats had been wont to feed about this
     because Delphi had not as yet been settled, invariably any goat that approached the chasm and
     peered into it would leap about in an extraordinary fashion and utter a sound quite different
     from what it was formerly wont to emit. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The herdsman in charge
     of the goats marvelled at the strange phenomenon and having approached the chasm and peeped
     down it to discover what it was, had the same experience as the goats,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See <bibl n="Plut. De. Defect. 437b">Plut. De defectu oraculorum 42</bibl>; <bibl n="Just. 24.6">Justin 24.6</bibl>.</note> for the goats began to act like beings possessed
     and the goatherd also began to foretell future events. After this as the report was bruited
     among the people of the vicinity concerning the experience of those who approached the chasm,
     an increasing number of persons visited the place and, as they all tested it because of its
     miraculous character, whosoever approached the spot became inspired. For these reasons the
     oracle came to be regarded as a marvel and to be considered the prophecy-giving shrine of
     Earth. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For some time all who wished to obtain a prophecy
     approached the chasm and made their prophetic replies to one another; but later, since many
     were leaping down into the chasm under the influence of their frenzy and all disappeared, it
     seemed best to the dwellers in that region, in order to eliminate the risk, to station one
     woman there as a single prophetess for all and to have the oracles told through her. And for
     her a contrivance was devised which she could safely mount, then become inspired and give
     prophecies to those who so desired. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And this contrivance has
     three supports and hence was called a tripod, and, I dare say, all the bronze tripods which are
     constructed even to this day are made in imitation of this contrivance.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Schol. on <bibl n="Aristoph. Pl. 9">Aristoph. Pl. 9</bibl>.</note> In what
     manner, then, the oracle was discovered and for what reasons the tripod was devised I think I
     have told at sufficient length. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>It is said that in ancient
     times virgins delivered the oracles because virgins have their natural innocence intact and are
     in the same case as Artemis; for indeed virgins were alleged to be well suited to guard the
     secrecy of disclosures made by oracles. In more recent times, however, people say that
     Echecrates the Thessalian, having arrived at the shrine and beheld the virgin who uttered the
     oracle, became enamoured of her because of her beauty, carried her away with him and violated
     her; and that the Delphians because of this deplorable occurrence passed a law that in future a
     virgin should no longer prophesy but that an elderly woman of fifty should declare the oracles
     and that she should be dressed in the costume of a virgin, as a sort of reminder of the
     prophetess of olden times.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such are the details of the legend
     regarding the discovery of the oracle; and now we shall turn to the activities of Philomelus.
      </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="27">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Philomelus had control of the oracle he directed the Pythia to make her
     prophecies from the tripod in the ancestral fashion. But when she replied that such was not the
     ancestral fashion, he threatened her harshly and compelled her to mount the tripod. Then when
     she frankly declared, referring to the superior power of the man who was resorting to violence:
     "It is in your power to do as you please," he gladly accepted her utterance and declared that
     he had the oracle which suited him. He immediately had the oracle inscribed and set it up in
     full view, and made it clear to everyone that the god gave him the authority to do as he
     pleased. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Having got together an assembly and disclosed the
     prophecy to the multitude and urged them to be of good cheer, he turned to the business of the
     war. There came to him an omen as well, in the temple of Apollo, namely an eagle which, after
     flying over the temple of the god and swooping down to earth, preyed upon the pigeons which
     were maintained in the temple precincts, some of which it snatched away from the very altars.
     Those versed in such matters declared that the omen indicated to Philomelus and the Phocians
     that they would control the affairs of Delphi. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Elated
     accordingly by these events, he selected the best qualified of his friends for the embassies,
     and sent some to Athens, some to Lacedaemon, and some to Thebes; and he likewise sent envoys to
     the other most distinguished cities of the Greek world, explaining that he had seized Delphi,
     not with any designs upon its sacred properties but to assert a claim to the guardianship of
     the sanctuary; for this guardianship had been ordained in early times as belonging to the
     Phocians. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He said he would render due account of the property
     to all the Greeks and expressed himself as ready to report the weight and the number of the
     dedications to all who wished an examination. But he requested that, if any through enmity or
     envy were to engage in war against the Phocians, these cities should preferably join forces
     with him, or, if not, at least maintain peaceful relations.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman" >See chap. 33.2.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When the envoys had accomplished their appointed mission, the
     Athenians, Lacedaemonians, and some others arranged an alliance with him and promised
     assistance, but the Boeotians, Locrians, and some others passed decrees to the contrary intent
     and renewed the war in behalf of the god upon the Phocians.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such
     were the events of this year. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="28">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Diotimus was archon at Athens, the Romans elected as
     consuls Gaius Marcius and Gnaeus Manlius. During their term of office Philomelus, foreseeing
     the magnitude of the war, began to gather a multitude of mercenaries and to select for active
     duty those of the Phocians who were fit. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Although the war
     required additional funds, he kept his hands off the sacred dedications, but he did exact from
     the Delphians, who were exceptionally prosperous and wealthy, a sufficient sum of money to pay
     the mercenaries. Having accordingly prepared a large army, he led it into the open country and
     was obviously holding himself ready to join issue with any who were hostile to the Phocians.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And when the Locrians took the field against him a battle was
     fought near the cliffs called Phaedriades,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">A semicircular
      range of rocks on Mt. Parnassus facing south, hence "Resplendent." Aesop is said to have been

     enemy and taken not a few alive, while some he forced to hurl themselves over the precipices.
     After this battle the Phocians were elated by their success, but the Locrians, being quite
     dejected, sent ambassadors to Thebes asking the Boeotians to come to their support and the
     god's. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The Boeotians because of their reverence for the gods
     and because of the advantage they gained if the decisions of the Amphictyons were enforced,
     sent embassies to the Thessalians and the other Amphictyons demanding that they make war in
     common against the Phocians. But when the Amphictyons voted the war against the Phocians much
     confusion and disagreement reigned throughout the length and breadth of Greece. For some
     decided to stand by the god and punish the Phocians as temple-robbers, while others inclined
     toward giving the Phocians assistance.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Chapters 27-28 cover

     Amphictyons against the Spartans, the charge being that Phoebidas the Spartan had seized the
      Cadmeia,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See Book 15.20.2.</note> and the Amphictyons
     assessed a fine of five hundred talents for the offence. Then when the Lacedaemonians had had
     judgement entered against them and failed to pay the fine during the period set by the laws,
     the Thebans again brought suit, this time for double damages. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />When the Amphictyons set the judgement at a thousand talents, the Lacedaemonians, on account
     of the large amount of the fine, made declarations similar to those of the Phocians, saying
     that an unjust judgement had been rendered against them by the Amphictyons. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Wherefore, though their interests were now common, the Lacedaemonians
     hesitated to begin war by themselves on account of the adverse judgement, but thought that it
     was more seemly to annul the judgments of the Amphictyons through the agency of the Phocians.
     For these particular reasons they were very ready to fight on the side of the Phocians and they
     co-operated in securing for them the guardianship of the sanctuary. </p>

     because of their reverence for the gods, but the worst knaves, and those who despised the gods,
     because of their own greed, eagerly gathered about Philomelus and quickly a strong army was
     formed out of those whose object it was to plunder the shrine. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />So Philomelus, because of the magnitude of his resources, soon had prepared a considerable
     army. He immediately advanced into the territory of the Locrians with soldiers both foot and
     horse amounting to more than ten thousand. When the Locrians marshalled their forces to meet
     him and the Boeotians came to the support of the Locrians, a cavalry battle ensued in which the
     Phocians had the superiority. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After this the Thessalians
     together with the allies from neighbouring districts, having assembled to the number of six
     thousand, arrived in Locris and joining battle with the Phocians met with a defeat by a hill
     called Argolas.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Unmentioned elsewhere.</note> When the
     Boeotians put in an appearance with thirteen thousand men and the Achaeans from the

     present who had enlisted with the temple-robbers; and immediately, making the deed follow the
     word, shot them all down. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But the mercenaries serving with the
     Phocians were so enraged by this that they demanded of Philomelus that he mete out the like
     punishment to the enemy, and then, when, bending every effort, they had taken captive many men
     who were straggling up and down the countryside where the enemy were, they brought them back
     and all these Philomelus shot. Through this punishment they forced the opposite side to give up
     their overweening and cruel vengeance. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>After this, as the
     armies were invading another district and were making a march through heavily wooded rough

     archon at Athens, the Romans elected as consuls Marcus Poplius and Marcus Fabius. During their
     term of office, now that the Boeotians had won a victory over the Phocians and were of the
     opinion that the fate of Philomelus, who was chiefly responsible for the plundering of the
     temple and who had been punished by gods and men, would deter the rest from like villainy, they
     returned to their own country. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But the Phocians, now freed
     from the war, for the present returned to Delphi and there meeting with their allies in a
     common assembly deliberated on the war. The moderate party inclined toward the peace, but the
     irreligious, the hot-headed and avaricious were of the opposite opinion and were looking around
     to find the proper spokesman to support their lawless aims. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />When Onomarchus arose and delivered a carefully argued speech urging them to adhere to their
     original purpose, he swung the sentiment of the gathering toward war, though he did so not so
     much with the intention of consulting the common welfare as with a view to his own interests,
     for he had been sentenced frequently and severely by the Amphictyons in the same manner as the
     rest and had not discharged the fines. Accordingly, seeing that war was more desirable for
     himself than peace, he quite logically urged the Phocians and their allies to adhere to the
     project of Philomelus. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Having been chosen general with supreme
     command, he began to collect a large number of mercenaries, and, filling the gaps in his ranks
     caused by the casualties and having increased his army by the large number of foreigners
     enrolled, he set about making great preparations of allies and of everything else that is
     serviceable for war. </p>

     it much taller and larger. He accordingly assumed that a sign was being given to him from the
     gods that there would be an increase of glory because of his services as general. But the truth
     turned out to be otherwise, rather the contrary was indicated because of the fact that the
     Amphictyons had dedicated the statue out of the fines paid by the Phocians who had acted
     lawlessly toward the shrine and had been fined for so doing. What was indicated was that the
     fine of the Phocians would take on an increase at the hands of Onomarchus; and such turned out
     to be the case. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Onomarchus, when he had been chosen general in
     supreme command, prepared a great supply of weapons from the bronze and iron, and having struck
     coinage from the silver and gold distributed it among the allied cities and chiefly gave it as
     bribes to the leaders of those cities. Indeed he succeeded in corrupting many of the enemy too,
     some of whom he persuaded to fight on his side, and others he required to maintain the peace.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He easily accomplished everything because of man's greed. In
     fact he persuaded even the Thessalians, who were held in highest esteem amongst the allies, by
     bribes to maintain the peace. In his dealings with the Phocians also he arrested and executed
     those who opposed him and confiscated their property. After invading the territory of the

     believing that he would dominate all Thessaly. When Philip in company with the Thessalians
     joined battle against the Phocians, Onomarchus with his superior numbers defeated him in two
     battles and slew many of the Macedonians. As for Philip, he was reduced to the uttermost perils
     and his soldiers were so despondent that they had deserted him, but by arousing the courage of

     gathered them all together, numbering more than twenty thousand foot and three thousand horse.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>A severe battle took place and since the Thessalian cavalry

     Archidamus in command, and the Megalopolitans,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">They even
      sent ambassadors to Athens begging help. It was on this occasion that Demosthenes delivered

     fight by themselves, summoned aid from their allies. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now the
     Argives, Sicyonians, and Messenians in full force and with all speed came to their assistance;
     and the Thebans dispatched four thousand foot and five hundred horse with Cephision placed in
     charge as general. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The Megalopolitans accordingly, having
     taken the field with their allies, encamped near the headwaters of the Alpheius River, while
     the Lacedaemonians were reinforced by three thousand foot-soldiers from the Phocians and one
     hundred fifty cavalry from Lycophron and Peitholaus, the exiled tyrants of Pherae, and, having
     mustered an army capable of doing battle, encamped by Mantineia. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Then having advanced to the Argive city of Orneae,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman" >Cp. chap. 34.3.</note> they captured it before the arrival of the enemy, for it was an ally
     of the Megalopolitans. When the Argives took the field against them, they joined battle and
     defeated them and slew more than two hundred. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Then the Thebans
     appeared, and since they were in number twice as many though inferior in discipline, a stubborn
     battle was engaged; and as the victory hung in doubt, the Argives and their allies withdrew to
     their own cities, while the Lacedaemonians, after invading Arcadia and taking the city

     the Thebans came to its rescue, was expelled from that city. Then the Boeotians, who now with a

     the countryside; and having taken also some of the small towns and gathered an abundance of

     Persians, who had in the period treated above made an expedition into Egypt with vast

     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>To make clear the history of these events I shall set forth
     first the causes of the war by reviewing again briefly the period to which these events
     properly belong. We recall that, when the Egyptians revolted from the Persians in the earlier
     period, Artaxerxes, known as Ochus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Possibly Diodorus has Artaxerxes II (Mnemon) in mind (cp. Book 15.90 ff.), for both Demosthenes and Isocrates state
      that Ochus conducted in person the unsuccessful expedition.</note> himself unwarlike, remained
     inactive, and though he sent out armies and generals many times, failed in his attempts because
     of the cowardice and inexperience of the leaders. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>And so,
     though regarded with contempt by the Egyptians, he was compelled to be patient because of his
     own inertia and peace-loving nature. But in the period now under discussion, when the
     Phoenicians and the kings in Cyprus had imitated the Egyptians and in contemptuous disregard of
     him made a move to revolt, he became enraged and decided to make war upon the insurgents.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>So he rejected the practice of sending out generals, and
     adopted the plan of carrying out in person the struggles to preserve his kingdom. Wherefore,
     having made great provision of arms, missiles, food, and forces, he assembled three hundred
     thousand foot-soldiers, thirty thousand horsemen, three hundred triremes, and five hundred
     merchantmen and other ships to carry the supplies. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="41">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He began to make war also on the
     Phoenicians for the following reasons. In Phoenicia there is an important city called Tripolis,
     whose name is appropriate to its nature, for there are in it three cities, at a distance of a
     stade from one another, and the names by which these are called are the city of the Aradians,
     of the Sidonians, and of the Tyrians. This city enjoys the highest repute amongst the cities of
     Phoenicia, for there, as it happens, the Phoenicians held their common council and deliberated
     on matters of supreme importance. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now since the King's satraps
     and generals dwelt in the city of the Sidonians and behaved in an outrageous and high-handed
     fashion toward the Sidonians in ordering things to be done, the victims of this treatment,
     aggrieved by their insolence, decided to revolt from the Persians. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Having persuaded the rest of the Phoenicians to make a bid for their independence,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Cp. <bibl n="Isoc. 5.102">Isoc. 5.102</bibl>.</note> they sent
     ambassadors to the Egyptian king Nectanebos, who was an enemy of the Persians, and after
     persuading him to accept them as allies they began to make preparations for the war. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Inasmuch as Sidon was distinguished for its wealth and its private
     citizens had amassed great riches from its shipping, many triremes were quickly outfitted and a
     multitude of mercenaries gathered, and, besides, arms, missiles, food, and all other materials
     useful in war were provided with dispatch. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The first hostile
     act was the cutting down and destroying of the royal park in which the Persian Kings were wont
     to take their recreation; the second was the burning of the fodder for the horses which had
     been stored up by the satraps for the war; last of all they arrested such Persians as had
     committed the acts of insolence and wreaked vengeance upon them. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Such was the beginning of the war with the Phoenicians, and Artaxerxes, being apprised
     of the rash acts of the insurgents, issued threatening warnings to all the Phoenicians and in
     particular to the people of Sidon. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="42">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In Babylon the King, after assembling his infantry and
     cavalry forces, immediately assumed command of them and advanced against the Phoenicians. While
     he was still on the way, Belesys, the satrap of Syria, and Mazaeus, the governor of Cilicia,
     having joined forces, opened the war against the Phoenicians. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Tennes, the king of Sidon, acquired from the Egyptians four thousand Greek mercenary soldiers
     whose general was Mentor the Rhodian. With these and the citizen soldiery he engaged the
     aforementioned satraps, defeated them, and drove the enemy out of Phoenicia. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>While these things were going on, a war
     broke out in Cyprus also, the actions in which were interwoven with the war we have just
     mentioned. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For in this island were nine populous cities, and
     under them were ranged the small towns which were suburbs of the nine cities. Each of these
     cities had a king who governed the city and was subject to the King of the Persians. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>All these kings in common agreement and in imitation of the Phoenicians
     revolted, and having made preparations for the war, declared their own kingdoms independent.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Incensed at these actions, Artaxerxes wrote to Idrieus,
     despot of Caria, who had just acquired his office and was a friend and ally of the Persians by
     inheritance from his ancestors, to collect an infantry force and a navy to carry on a war with
     the kings in Cyprus. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Idrieus, after making ready immediately
     forty triremes and eight thousand mercenary soldiers, sent them to Cyprus, having placed in
     command as their generals Phocion the Athenian and Evagoras, who had in the former period been
     king in the island.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">This expedition to Cyprus is placed by

     <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>So these two, having sailed to Cyprus, at once led their army
     against Salamis, the largest of the cities. Having set up a palisade and fortified the
     encampment, they began to besiege the Salaminians by land and also by sea. Since all the island
     had enjoyed peace for a long time and the territory was wealthy, the soldiers, who had
     possession of the open country, gathered much booty. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>When word
     of their affluence got abroad, many soldiers from the opposite coast of Syria and Cilicia
     flocked over voluntarily in the hope of gain. Finally, after the army with Evagoras and Phocion
     had been doubled in size, the kings throughout Cyprus fell into a state of great anxiety and
      terror.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was the situation in Cyprus. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="43">

     The ruler of Sidon, Tennes,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">For Tennes in this chapter the MSS. consistently read Mentor.</note> who was informed of the great size of the Persian army
     and thought that the insurgents were incapable of fighting against it, decided to provide for
     his personal safety. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Accordingly, without the knowledge of the
     people of Sidon, he sent the most faithful of his own henchmen, Thettalion, to Artaxerxes with
     the promise that he would betray Sidon to him, would assist him in vanquishing Egypt, and would
     render him great service, since he was acquainted with the topography of Egypt and knew
     accurately the landing-places along the Nile. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The King on
     hearing from Thettalion these particulars was extremely pleased and said that he would free
     Tennes of the charges relative to the revolt, and he promised to give him rich rewards if he
     performed all that he had agreed upon. But when Thettalion added that Tennes wished him also to
     confirm his promise by giving his right hand, thereupon the King, flying into a rage at the
     thought that he was not trusted, handed Thettalion over to his attendants and gave orders to
     take off his head. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>But when, as Thettalion was being led off
     to his punishment, he simply said: "You, O King, will do as you please, but Tennes, though he
     is able to achieve complete success, since you refuse the pledge, will assuredly not perform
     any of his promises," the King, hearing what he said, again changed his mind and recalling the
     attendants directed them to release Thettalion, and then he gave him his right hand, which is
     the surest pledge amongst the Persians. Thettalion accordingly returned to Sidon and reported
     what had happened to Tennes without the knowledge of the people of Sidon. </p>

     their friendship for the Persians, but were opposed to sending troops as allies. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>But the Thebans, choosing Lacrates as general, dispatched him with a
     thousand hoplites. And the Argives sent three thousand men; they did not, however, choose a
     general themselves, but when the King requested Nicostratus specifically as general, they
     concurred. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now Nicostratus was good both in action and in
     counsel, but there was madness mingled with his intelligence; for since he excelled in bodily
     strength, he would imitate Heracles when on a campaign by wearing a lion's skin and carrying a
     club in battle. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Following the example of these states, the
     Greeks who inhabited the sea-coast of Asia Minor dispatched six thousand men, making the total
     number of Greeks who served as allies ten thousand. Before their arrival the Persian King,
     after he had traversed Syria and reached Phoenicia, encamped not far from Sidon. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>As for the Sidonians, while the King had been slow to move, they
     attended assiduously to the preparation of food, armour, and missiles. Likewise they had
     encompassed their city with huge triple ditches and constructions of lofty walls. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>They had also an ample number of citizen soldiers well trained in
     exercises and hard work and of superior bodily condition and strength. In wealth and in other
     resources the city far excelled the other cities of Phoenicia and, most important of all, it
     had more than a hundred triremes and quinqueremes. </p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Tennes, having confided his scheme for
     betrayal to Mentor<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Cp. chap. 42.2.</note> the commander of
     the mercenaries from Egypt, left him to guard a portion of the city and to act in concert with
     his agents handling the betrayal, while he himself, with five hundred men, marched out of the
     city, pretending that he was going to a common meeting of the Phoenicians, and he took with him
     the most distinguished of the citizens, to the number of one hundred, in the role of advisers.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>When they had come near the King he suddenly seized the
     hundred and delivered them to Artaxerxes. The King, welcoming him as a friend, had the hundred
     shot as instigators of the revolt, and when five hundred of the leading Sidonians carrying
     olive branches as suppliants approached him, he summoned Tennes and asked him if he was able to
     deliver the city to him; for he was very eager not to receive Sidon on the terms of a
     capitulation, since his aim was to overwhelm the Sidonians with a merciless disaster and to
     strike terror into the other cities by their punishment. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When
     Tennes assured him that he would deliver up the city, the King, maintaining his merciless rage,
     had all five hundred shot down while still holding the supplicant branches. Thereupon Tennes,
     approaching the mercenaries from Egypt, prevailed upon them to lead him and the King inside the
     walls. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>So Sidon by this base betrayal was delivered into the

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then on the next day,
     as the King divided the Greek army into three contingents, each contingent had a Greek general,
     and stationed along beside him a Persian officer, a man preferred above the others for valour
     and loyalty. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Now the forward position was held by the
     Boeotians, who had as general the Theban Lacrates and as Persian officer Rhosaces. The latter
     was a descendant of one of the seven Persians who deposed the Magi<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See the famous account in <bibl n="Hdt. 3.76">Hdt. 3.76-79</bibl>.</note>;
     he was satrap of Ionia and Lydia, and he was accompanied by a large force of cavalry and no
     small body of infantry composed of barbarians. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Next in line
     was the Argive contingent of which Nicostratus was general and with him as Persian colleague
     Aristazanes. The latter was an usher<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">It was the duty of an
      usher to make announcements to the King, and introduce ambassadors of foreign nations and
      others who required an audience with the King. Only those seven who had slain the Magi were

     friends after Bagoas; and assigned to him were five thousand elite soldiers and eighty
     triremes. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Of the third contingent Mentor was general, he who
     had betrayed Sidon, having the mercenaries that were formerly under his command; and associated
     with him on the expedition was Bagoas, whom the King trusted most, a man exceptionally daring
     and impatient of propriety; and he had the King's Greeks and an ample force of barbarians and
     not a few ships. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The King himself with the remainder of the
     army held himself in reserve for the whole operation.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">As an

     the distribution of the army on the Persian side, the king of the Egyptians, Nectanebos, was
     dismayed neither by the multitude of the enemy nor by the general disposition of the Persian
     forces, though his numbers were far inferior. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>In fact he had
     twenty thousand Greek mercenaries, about the same number of Libyans, and sixty thousand
     Egyptians of the caste known amongst them as "The Warriors", and besides these an incredible
     number of river-boats suited for battles and engagements on the Nile. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The bank of the river facing Arabia had been strongly fortified by him, being a region
     crowded with towns and, besides, all intersected by walls and ditches. Although he had ready
     also all the other preparations which were adequate for the war, yet because of his own poor
     judgement he soon met with complete disaster. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="48">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The reason for his defeat was chiefly his
     lack of experience as a general and the fact that the Persians had been defeated by him in the
     previous expedition. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For he had then had as his generals men
     who were distinguished and superior both in valour and in sagacity in the art of war,
      Diophantus<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Cp. <bibl n="Isoc. L. 8.8">Isoc. L. 8.8</bibl>.
      Diophantus was still absent from Athens at the time of this letter, <date value="-350" >350</date> B.C.</note> the Athenian and Lamius the Spartan, and it was because of them that
     he had been victorious in all respects. At this time, however, since he supposed that he
     himself was a competent general, he would not share the command with anyone and so, because of
     his inexperience, was unable to execute any of the moves that would have been useful in this
     war. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Now when he had provided the towns here and there with
     considerable garrisons, he maintained a strict guard there, and having in his own command
     thirty thousand Egyptians, five thousand Greeks, and half the Libyans, he held them in reserve
     to defend the most exposed approaches. Such being the disposition of the forces on both sides,
     Nicostratus, the general of the Argives, having as guides Egyptians whose children and wives
     were held as hostages by the Persians, sailed by with his fleet through a canal into a hidden
     district and, disembarking his men and fortifying a site for a camp, encamped there. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The mercenaries of the Egyptians who were keeping a strict guard in the
     neighbourhood, observing the presence of the enemy, straightway made a sally in number not less
     than seven thousand. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Cleinius the Coan, their commander, drew
     up his force in line of battle. And when those who had sailed in were drawn up opposite, a
     sharp battle ensued in the course of which the Greeks serving with the Persians, fighting
     brilliantly, slew the general Cleinius and cut down more than five thousand of the rest of the
     soldiers. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Nectanebos the Egyptian king, on hearing of the loss
     of his men, was terror-stricken, thinking that the rest of the Persian army also would easily
     cross the river. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Assuming that the enemy with their entire
     army would come to the very gates of Memphis, he decided first and foremost to take
     precautionary measures to protect the city. Accordingly he returned to Memphis with the army he
     had retained and began to prepare for the siege. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="49">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Lacrates the Theban, who was in command
     of the first contingent, hastened to begin the siege of Pelusium. First he diverted the stream
     of the canal to other directions, then when the channel had become dry he filled it with earth
     and brought siege engines against the city. When a large portion of the walls fell, the
     garrison in Pelusium quickly built others to oppose the advance and reared huge towers of wood.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The battle for the walls continued for several days running
     and at first the Greeks in Pelusium vigorously warded off the besiegers; but when they learned
     of the king's withdrawal to Memphis they were so terror-stricken that they sent envoys to
     arrange for a settlement. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Since Lacrates gave them pledges
     backed by oaths to the effect that if they surrendered Pelusium they would all be conveyed back
     to Greece with whatever they could carry on their backs, they delivered over the citadel.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>After this Artaxerxes dispatched Bagoas with barbarian
     soldiers to take over Pelusium, and the soldiers, arriving at the place as the Greeks were
     issuing forth, seized upon many of the articles they were carrying out. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The victims of this injustice in their anger called loudly upon the gods
     who were guardians of their oaths, whereupon Lacrates became incensed, put the barbarians to
     flight, slaying a number of them, thus standing by the Greeks, the sufferers from the broken
     pledges. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>But when Bagoas fled to the King and brought
     accusation against Lacrates, Artaxerxes decided that Bagoas' contingent had met with their just
     deserts and put to death the Persians who were responsible for the robbery. So it was in this
     fashion that Pelusium was delivered over to the Persians. <milestone unit="section" n="7" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Mentor, who was in command of the third contingent, captured
     Bubastus and many other cities and made them subject to the King by a single strategic device.
     For since all the cities were garrisoned by two peoples, Greeks and Egyptians, Mentor passed
     the word around to the soldiers that King Artaxerxes had decided to treat magnanimously those
     who voluntarily surrendered their cities, but to mete out the same penalty to those who were
     overcome by force as he had imposed on the people of Sidon; and he instructed those who guarded
     the gates to give free passage to any who wished to desert from the other side. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Accordingly, since the captured Egyptians were leaving the barracks
     without hindrance, the aforementioned word was quickly scattered amongst all the cities of
     Egypt. Immediately, therefore, the mercenaries were everywhere at variance with the natives and
     the cities were filled with strife; for each side was privately endeavouring to surrender its
     posts and nursing private hopes of gain in exchange for this favour; and this is what actually
     happened in the case of the city of Bubastus first. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="50">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When, namely, the forces of
     Mentor and Bagoas were encamped near Bubastus, the Egyptians, without the knowledge of the
     Greeks, sent an envoy to Bagoas offering to deliver the city if he would consent to their
     safety. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Greeks, having knowledge of the mission, overtook
     the envoy and by dire threats extracted the truth, whereat they were much enraged and attacked
     the Egyptians, slew some, wounded others, and herded the rest into a quarter of the city.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The discomfited men, having notified Bagoas of what had taken
     place, asked him to come with all speed and receive the city from themselves. But the Greeks
     had been privately treating with Mentor, who gave them secret encouragement, as soon as Bagoas
     should enter Bubastus, to attack the barbarians. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Later on,
     when Bagoas with the Persians was entering the city without the sanction of the Greeks and a
     portion of his men had got inside, the Greeks suddenly closed the gates and attacked those who
     were inside the walls, and, having slain all the men, took Bagoas himself prisoner. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The latter, seeing that his hopes of safety lay in Mentor, besought him
     to spare his life and promised in future to do nothing without his advice. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Mentor, who now prevailed upon the Greeks to set Bagoas free and to
     arrange the surrender through himself, won credit himself for his success, but, having become
     responsible for Bagoas' life, he made an agreement with him for common action, and after an
     exchange of pledges on this matter kept the agreement faithfully till the end of his life.
      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The result of this was that these two by their co-operation
     in the service of the King attained later on to the greatest power of all the friends and
     relatives at Artaxerxes' court. In fact Mentor, having been appointed to the chief command in
     the coastal districts of Asia, performed great services to the King in gathering mercenaries
     from Greece and sending them to Artaxerxes, and in the course of his activities administering
     all his duties courageously and loyally. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>As for Bagoas, after
     he had administered all the King's affairs in the upper satrapies,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">In the interior. Bagoas was commander of the King's bodyguard. He arranged the succession by the use of poison (cp. Book 17.5.3-4) and was himself its victim.</note> he rose
     to such power because of his partnership with Mentor that he was master of the kingdom, and
     Artaxerxes did nothing without his advice. And after Artaxerxes' death he designated in every
     case the successor to the throne and enjoyed all the functions of kingship save the title. But
     of these matters we shall record the details in their proper chronological sequence. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="51">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At the
     time under consideration, after the surrender of Bubastus, the remaining cities,
     terror-stricken, were delivered to the Persians by capitulation. But King Nectanebos, while
     still tarrying in Memphis and perceiving the trend of the cities toward betrayal, did not dare
     risk battles for his dominion. So giving up hope of his kingship and taking with him the
     greater part of his possessions, he fled into Aethiopia. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Artaxerxes, after taking over all Egypt and demolishing the walls of the most important
     cities, by plundering the shrines gathered a vast quantity of silver and gold, and he carried
     off the inscribed records from the ancient temples, which later on Bagoas returned to the
     Egyptian priests on the payment of huge sums by way of ransom. <milestone unit="section" n="3" />Then when he had rewarded the Greeks who had accompanied him on the campaign with lavish
     gifts, each according to his deserts, he dismissed them to their native lands; and, having
     installed Pherendates as satrap of Egypt, he returned with his army to Babylon, bearing many
     possessions and spoils and having won great renown by his successes. </p>

     Publius Valerius. During their term of office Artaxerxes, seeing that Mentor the general had
     performed great services for him in the war against the Egyptians, advanced him over and above
     his other friends. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Esteeming him worthy of honour for his
     gallant actions, he gave him a hundred talents of silver and also the best of expensive
     decorations, and he appointed him satrap of the Asiatic coast and placed him in charge of the
     war against the rebels, having designated him general in supreme command. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>And since Mentor was related<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman" >Artabazus was his brother-in-law, Memnon his brother (see below). (Cp. <bibl n="Dem. 23.157" >Dem. 23.157</bibl>: <foreign lang="greek">o( *me/mnwn kai\ o( *me/ntwr, oi( khdestai\ tou=

     Persians in the preceding period<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">See chaps. 22.1 and 34.2.</note> and at the time now under consideration were fugitives from Asia residing at the
     court of Philip, he requested the King and prevailed upon him to dismiss the charges against
     them. Immediately afterwards he also summoned them both to come to his presence with all their
     families; <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>for there had been born to Artabazus by the sister
     of Mentor and Memnon eleven sons and ten daughters.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Some of
      their names are known (see P.-W. <title>Realencyclop&auml;die, s.v.</title> "Artabazus," 3).</note> And Mentor was so enchanted with the large number of children born to the marriage
     that he promoted the lads, giving them the most distinguished commands in the armed forces.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>He made his first campaign against Hermias<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">A philosopher, eunuch, and slave of Eubulus. Aristotle, who knew
      him through the Academy (cp. <bibl n="Plat. L. 6">Plat. L. 6</bibl>), lived with him, and
      after his death married his adopted daughter Pythias. The events of this chapter concerning
      the arrest of Hermias certainly occurred at a later date, since Aristotle is reported
      (Dionysius, <title>Epist. ad Ammaeum,</title> ch. 5) to have spent three years at the court of
      Hermias after the death of Plato. Tarn gives the date of Hermias' arrest as 342

     revolted from the King and was master of many fortresses and cities. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Having promised Hermias that he would prevail upon the King to dismiss the charges
     against him too, he met him at a conference and then, playing him false, arrested him. After
     getting possession of his signet-ring and writing to the cities that a reconciliation had been
     effected with the King through Mentor's intervention, he sealed the letters with Hermias' ring,
     and sent the letters and with them agents who were to take over the districts. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>The populations of the cities, trusting the documents and being quite
     content to accept the peace, all surrendered their fortresses and cities. Now that Mentor
     through deception had quickly and without risk recovered the towns of the rebels, he won great
     favour with the King, who concluded that he was capable of performing the duties of general
     realistically. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Similarly with regard to the other commanders
     who were at odds with the Persians, whether by force or by stratagem, he soon subdued them
      all.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And this was the state of affairs in Asia. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In Europe Philip, the Macedonian king,

     intimidated some of the other towns and compelled them to submit. Then coming against Pherae in
     Thessaly he expelled Peitholaus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">Inconsistent with chaps. 37, 38 unless Peitholaus had recovered Pherae in the meantime.</note> who was in control of
     the city. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>While these things were going on, there occurred in
     Pontus the death of Spartacus king of Pontus after a rule of five years. His brother

     term of office Philip, whose aim was to subdue the cities on the Hellespont, acquired without a

     battles and confined them to the defence of their walls; then in the continuous assaults that
     he made he lost many of his men in encounters at the walls, but finally bribed the chief
     officials of the Olynthians, Euthycrates and Lasthenes,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman" >Euthycrates and Lasthenes became the stock examples of fifth columnists (see <bibl n="Dem. 8.40">Dem. 8.40</bibl>; <bibl n="Dem. 19.265">Dem. 19.265, 342</bibl>; also, on

     enslaving the inhabitants he sold both men and property as booty. By so doing he procured large
     sums for prosecuting the war and intimidated the other cities that were opposed to him. Having
     rewarded with appropriate gifts such soldiers as had behaved gallantly in the battle and
     distributed a sum of money to men of influence in the cities, he gained many tools ready to
     betray their countries. Indeed he was wont to declare that it was far more by the use of gold

     that he wished to obtain a boon from him but he feared lest, if he disclosed the request he had

     forthwith any favour he might ask. He replied that there were two virgin daughters of a friend

     silver, and they zealously dug up the ground about the hearth and the tripod. The man who gave
     information about the treasure offered as witness the most famous and ancient of poets Homer,
     who says in a certain passage:<quote type="verse">

     to dig about the tripod, great earthquakes occurred and roused fear in the hearts of the
     Phocians, and since the gods clearly indicated in advance the punishment they would visit upon
     the temple-robbers, the soldiers desisted from their efforts. The leader of this sacrilege, the
     aforementioned Philon, was promptly punished as he deserved for his crime against the god.

     similar tenor the Amphictyons laid down regulations for the custody of the oracle and other
     matters affecting due respect for the gods and the general peace and concord of the Greeks.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Thereafter, when Philip had helped the Amphictyons give

     to record the punishment which was visited by the gods upon those who had committed the outrage

     all persons who had the slightest connection with the sacrilege that were hounded by the

     of a lingering disease and so was unable even to secure a quick release from his punishment.
     And the last of all, Phalaecus, who had gathered the remnants of the pillaged property, passed
     his life for a considerable length of time wandering about in great fear and danger, though it
     was not Heaven's intent that he should be happier than those who participated with him in the
     sacrilege, but that by being tortured longer and by becoming known to many for his misfortunes,
     his sad fate might become notorious. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>For when he had taken

     the last remnants of the pillaging, but later he hired in Corinth some large freighters and
     with four light vessels prepared for the voyage to Italy and Sicily, thinking that in these
     regions he would either seize some city or obtain service for pay, for a war was in progress,
     as it chanced, between the Lucanians and the Tarentines. To his fellow passengers he said that

     who were in the largest ship, on which Phalaecus himself was a passenger, conferred with one
     another because they suspected that no one had sent for them. For they could see on board no
     officers sent by the peoples who were soliciting aid, and the voyage in prospect was not short,
     but long and dangerous. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Accordingly, since they not only
     distrusted what they had been told but also feared the overseas campaign, they conspired
     together, above all those who had commands among the mercenary troops. Finally drawing their
     swords and menacing Phalaecus and the pilot they forced them to reverse their course. And when
     those who were sailing in the other boats also did the same, they put in again at a
     Peloponnesian harbour. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Then they gathered at the Malean
     promontory in Laconia and there found Cnossian envoys who had sailed in from Crete to enlist
     mercenaries. After these envoys had conversed with Phalaecus and the commanders and had offered
     rather high pay, they all sailed off with them. Having made port at Cnossus in Crete, they
     immediately took by storm the city called Lyctus.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">An

     Lacedaemonians, who were the stock of their ancestors, envoys soliciting help, whereupon the
     Spartans, who were willing to join them because of their relationship, quickly assembled an
     army and navy and as general in command of it appointed King Archidamus. But as they were about
     to set sail for Italy, a request came from the Lyctians to help them first. Consenting to this,
     the Lacedaemonians sailed to Crete, defeated the mercenaries and restored to the Lyctians their

     was severely criticized as the one who was chiefly responsible for the seizure of Delphi.

      fell in the battle of Megalopolis in the autumn of 331. The error of fifteen years seems to
      have arisen from the fact that in this passage (placed under year 346) Diodorus records the

     become tyrants. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Corinthians, concluding that it was only
     right to assist people who were offshoots of themselves,<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman" >Syracuse was a Corinthian colony founded in 734.</note> voted to send as general Timoleon,
     son of Timaenetus, a man of highest prestige amongst his fellow citizens for bravery and
     sagacity as a general and, in a word, splendidly equipped with every virtue. A peculiar
     coincidence befell him which contributed toward his being chosen to the generalship. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Timophanes, his brother, a man of outstanding wealth and effrontery
     amongst the Corinthians, had for some time past been clearly aiming at a tyranny and at the
     moment was winning the poor to his cause and laying up a store of suits of armour and parading
     about the market-place accompanied by a band of ruffians, not actually claiming to be tyrant
     but practising the arts of tyranny. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Timoleon, who was much
     averse to the rule of one man, first attempted to dissuade his brother from his overt attempt,
     but when the latter refused to heed and continued all the more his headstrong career, Timoleon,
     being unable by reasoning with him to make him mend his ways, put him to death as he was
     promenading in the market-place.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman">According to Plutarch the
      murder of Timophanes (not by Timoleon's own hand) occurred about twenty years before
      Timoleon's departure for Syracuse. Diodorus' account should be compared with Plutarch's and
      Nepos' <title>Timoleon</title>.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>A scuffle ensued and a mob of citizens came surging up stirred
     by the surprising character and the enormity of the deed, and dissension broke out. One side
     claimed that as the perpetrator of a kin-murder Timoleon should receive the punishment
     prescribed by the laws, whereas the other party asserted just the opposite, that they should
     applaud him as a tyrannicide. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>When the senate met to
     deliberate in the council chamber and the matter in dispute was referred to the session,
     Timoleon's personal enemies denounced him, while those more favourably inclined rallied to his
     cause and counselled letting him go free. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>While the
     investigation was still unsettled there sailed into the harbour from Syracuse the ambassadors
     who, having made known their mission to the senate, requested them to dispatch with all speed
     the general they needed. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>The session accordingly voted to send
     Timoleon and, in order to ensure the success of the project, they proposed a strange and
     amazing alternative to him. They affirmed categorically that if he ruled the Syracusans fairly,
     they adjudged him a tyrannicide, but if too ambitiously, a murderer of his brother.<note anchored="yes" resp="Sherman"><bibl n="Plut. Tim. 7.2">Plut. Timoleon 7.2</bibl> puts this in
      the mouth of one Telecleides speaking before the assembly (<foreign lang="greek" >dh=mos</foreign>), not the senate.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Timoleon, not so much in fear of the threat imposed on him by
     the senate as because of his native virtue, administered the government in Sicily fairly and
     profitably. For he subdued in war the Carthaginians, restored to their original state the Greek
     cities which had been razed by the barbarians, and made all Sicily independent; in a word,
     having found Syracuse and the other Greek cities depopulated when he took them over, he made
     them notably populous.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>These matters, however, we shall record

     <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>During this voyage, a peculiar

     a torch blazing in the sky up to the moment when the squadron made harbour in Italy. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now Timoleon had heard already in Corinth from the priestesses of

     bringing Carthaginian ambassadors. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Accosting Timoleon, they
     warned him solemnly not to start a war or even to set foot in Sicily. But the people of Rhegium
     were calling him and promised to join him as allies, and so Timoleon quickly put out from
     Metapontum hoping to outstrip the report of his coming. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Since
     the Carthaginians controlled the seas, he was afraid that they would prevent his crossing over

<div2 type="chapter" n="67">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Shortly before this,
     the Carthaginians on their part had come to see that there would be a serious war in Sicily and
     began making friendly representations to the cities in the island which were their allies.
     Renouncing their opposition to the tyrants throughout the island, they established friendship
     with them, and particularly they addressed themselves to Hicetas, the most powerful of these,
     because he had the Syracusans under his control.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">This
      anticipates the action described in chap. 68, but according to Plutarch's account (<bibl n="Plut. Tim. 7.3">Plut. Timoleon 7.3; 9.2</bibl>) Hicetas had become an ally of the Carthaginians even before Timoleon left Corinth.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They prepared and transported to Sicily a large sea and land

     devastated the countryside and blockaded the country people inside the city. The Campanians who
     occupied the city were alarmed at the odds against them and appealed for help to the other
     cities that were hostile to the Carthaginians. Of these, none responded except the city of
     Galeria. These people sent them a thousand hoplites, but the Phoenicians intercepted them,
     overwhelmed them with a large force, and cut them all down. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />The Campanians who dwelt in Aetna were at first also ready to send reinforcements to Entella

<div2 type="chapter" n="68">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now at the time when Dionysius was still master of Syracuse,

     Leontini, for that was the city which served as his base. Dionysius set out in hot pursuit and
     overtook his rear, attacking it at once, <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>but Hicetas wheeled
     upon him, joined battle, and having slain more than three thousand of the mercenaries, put the
     rest to flight. Pursuing sharply and bursting into the city with the fugitives, he got
     possession of all Syracuse except the Island.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Plut. Tim. 9.2">Plut. Timoleon 9.2</bibl>.</note><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was

     <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The Carthaginians promptly turned up with twenty triremes, but
     the people of Rhegium helped Timoleon to escape the trap. They called a general assembly in the
     city and staged a formal debate on the subject of a settlement. The Carthaginians expected that
     Timoleon would be prevailed upon to sail back to Corinth and kept a careless watch. He,
     however, giving no hint of an intention to slip away, remained close to the tribunal, but
     secretly ordered nine of his ships to put to sea immediately. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />Then, while the Carthaginians concentrated their attention on the intentionally long-winded
     Rhegians, Timoleon stole away unnoticed to his remaining ship and quickly sailed out of the
     harbour. The Carthaginians, though outmanoeuvred, set out in pursuit, <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>but his fleet had gained a substantial lead, and as night fell it was able to reach
     Tauromenium before being overtaken. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>Andromachus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">This was the father of the historian Timaeus, who may have been
      tyrant of the city, although Plutarch also (<bibl n="Plut. Tim. 10.4">Plut. Timoleon

     best soldiers and marched against the Adranitae, who were hostile to him, encamping near their
     city. Timoleon added to his force some soldiers from Tauromenium and marched out of that city,
     having all told no more than a thousand men. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Setting out at
     nightfall, he reached Adranum on the second day, and made a surprise attack on Hicetas's men
     while they were at dinner. Penetrating their defences he killed more than three hundred men,
     took about six hundred prisoners, and became master of the camp.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Plut. Tim. 12.3">Plut. Timoleon 12.3-5</bibl>, give the same figures

      Timoleon's success in the surprise attack was due in part to the circumstance that Hicetas was
      fooled because he still regarded Timoleon as an ally (H. D. Westlake, <title>Timoleon and his
       Relations with Tyrants</title> (<date value="1952">1952</date>), 15 f.). Plutarch gives the road distance between Tauromenium and Adranum as three hundred and forty furlongs.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="11"/>Capping this manoeuvre with another, he proceeded forthwith

     which far overtopped the towers of Perinthus, and from a superior height kept wearing down the
     besieged. He rocked the walls with battering rams and undermined them with saps, and cast down
     a long stretch of the wall. The Perinthians fought stoutly in their own defence and quickly
     threw up a second wall; many admirable feats were performed in the open and on the
     fortifications. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Both sides displayed great determination. The
     king, for his part, rained destruction with numerous and varied catapults upon the men fighting
     steadfastly along the battlements, while the Perinthians, although their daily losses were
     heavy, received reinforcements of men, missiles, and artillery from Byzantium. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>When they had again become a match for the enemy, they took courage and

<div2 type="chapter" n="75">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So the siege dragged on. The numbers mounted of dead and
     wounded in the city and provisions were running short. The capture of the city was imminent.
     Fortune, however, did not neglect the safety of those in danger but brought them an unexpected
     deliverance. Philip's growth in power had been reported in Asia, and the Persian king, viewing
     this power with alarm, wrote to his satraps on the coast to give all possible assistance to the
     Perinthians. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>They consequently took counsel and sent off to
     Perinthus a force of mercenaries, ample funds, and sufficient stocks of food, missiles, and
     other materials required for operations.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Similarly the people of
     Byzantium also sent them their best officers and soldiers. So the armies were again well
     matched, and as the fighting was resumed, the siege was waged with supreme determination.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Philip constantly battered the walls with his rams, making
     breaches in them, and as his catapults cleared the battlements of defenders, he would at the
     same moment drive through the breached walls with his soldiers in close formation and assail
     with scaling ladders the portions of the walls which he had cleared. Then hand-to-hand combat
     ensued and some were slain outright, others fell under many wounds. The rewards of victory
     challenged the daring of the contestants, <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>for the Macedonians
     hoped to have a wealthy city to sack and to be rewarded by Philip with gifts, the hope of
     profit steeling them against danger, while the Perinthians had before their eyes the horrors of
     capture and sustained with great courage the battle for their deliverance. </p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The
     natural setting of the city greatly aided the besieged Perinthians towards a decisive victory.

     houses are packed close together and very high. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In their
     construction along the slope of the hill they overtop one another and thus give the city the
     general aspect of a theatre. In spite of the constant breaches in the fortifications,
     consequently, the Perinthians were not defeated, for they blocked up the alley-ways and
     utilized the lowest tier of houses each time as though it were a wall of defence. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>When Philip with much labour and hard fighting mastered the city wall,
     he found that the houses afforded a stronger one, ready made by Fortune. Since, in addition,
     the city's every need was promptly met by supplies coming to Perinthus from Byzantium, he split
     his forces in two, and leaving one division under his best officers to continue the operations
     before Perinthus, marched himself with the other and, making a sudden attack on Byzantium,
     enclosed that city also in a tight siege. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Since their men and

      only to ensure the safe passage of the grain fleet from the Black Sea. Philip's capture of

     with a proposal. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In utter perplexity and dismay, the crowd
     kept their eyes on Demosthenes. Finally he came down from his seat, and bidding the people take
     heart gave it as his opinion that they must straightway send envoys to Thebes and invite the
     Boeotians to join them to make a struggle for freedom. There was no time to send envoys to
     their other allies<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">These are listed by <bibl n="Dem. 18.237" >Dem. 18.237</bibl> as Euboea, Achaia, Corinth, Megara, Leucas, and Corcyra. <bibl n="Aeschin. 3.97">Aeschin. 3.97</bibl> mentions Acarnania also.</note> invoking the treaties

     through Boeotia, the support of the Boeotians was their only recourse, especially since Philip
     was at that time the friend and ally of the Boeotians and would evidently try to take them
     along as he marched past to the war against Athens. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="85">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the people accepted the
     proposal and the decree authorizing the embassy had been drafted by Demosthenes, they turned to
     the search for their most eloquent representative. Demosthenes willingly answered the call to
     service. He carried out the mission vigorously and returned to Athens at last having secured
     the adhesion of the Thebans.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now that they had doubled their
     existing armed forces by the Boeotian alliance, the Athenians recovered their confidence.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At once they designated Chares and Lysicles as generals and
     sent forth their entire army under arms into Boeotia. All their youth reported eager for battle
     and advanced with forced marches as far as Chaeroneia in Boeotia. Impressed by the promptness
     of the Athenian arrival and themselves no less ready to act decisively, the Boeotians joined
     them with their weapons and, brigaded together, all awaited the approach of the enemy.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Philip's first move was to send envoys to the Boeotian
     League, the most eminent of whom was Pytho.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">The famous
      orator, a native of Byzantium, had long been in the service of Philip. Strabo (<bibl n="Strabo 9.2.37">Strabo 9.2.37</bibl>) states that the Corinthians also sent troops.</note>
     He was celebrated for his eloquence, but judged by the Boeotians in this contest for their
     allegiance against Demosthenes, he surpassed all the other speakers, to be sure, but was
     clearly inferior to him. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>And Demosthenes himself in his
     speeches parades his success against this orator as a great accomplishment, where he
      says:<quote>I did not then give ground before Pytho in spite of his confidence and his torrent

     <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So Philip failed to get the
     support of the Boeotians, but nevertheless decided to fight both of the allies together. He
     waited for the last of his laggard confederates to arrive, and then marched into Boeotia. His
     forces came to more than thirty thousand infantry and no less than two thousand cavalry.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Both sides were on edge for the battle, high-spirited and
     eager, and were well matched in courage, but the king had the advantage in numbers and in
     generalship. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>He had fought many battles of different sorts and
     had been victorious in most cases, so that he had a wide experience in military operations. On
     the Athenian side, the best of their generals were dead&mdash;Iphicrates, Chabrias, and
     Timotheus too&mdash;and the best of those who were left, Chares, was no better than any
     average soldier in the energy and discretion required of a commander.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Diodorus writes disparagingly of Chares also in Book 15.95.3. Here he has much compressed the narrative, since ten or eleven months elapsed between the occupation of Elateia
      and the battle of Chaeroneia.</note>

     Alexander, young in age but noted for his valour and swiftness of action, on one wing, placing
     beside him his most seasoned generals, while he himself at the head of picked men exercised the
     command over the other; individual units were stationed where the occasion required.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Diodorus's account of the battle is vague, and much is uncertain in the reconstruction of events from scattered and partial references. It seems certain that
      Philip, on the Macedonian right, did not engage the Athenians until the Thebans, on the allied
      right, had been shattered by Alexander. Since, in his later battles, Alexander normally
      commanded the cavalry guard on his own right, Philip here must have occupied the traditional
      position of the Macedonian king. But Diodorus does not say who these "picked men" were.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>On the other side, dividing the line according to nationality,
     the Athenians assigned one wing to the Boeotians and kept command of the other themselves. Once
     joined, the battle was hotly contested for a long time and many fell on both sides, so that for
     a while the struggle permitted hopes of victory to both. <milestone unit="section" n="3" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then Alexander, his heart set on showing his father his
     prowess and yielding to none in will to win, ably seconded by his men, first succeeded in
     rupturing the solid front of the enemy line and striking down many he bore heavily on the
     troops opposite him. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>As the same success was won by his
     companions, gaps in the front were constantly opened. Corpses piled up, until finally Alexander
     forced his way through the line and put his opponents to flight. Then the king also in person
     advanced, well in front and not conceding credit for the victory even to Alexander; he first
     forced back the troops stationed before him and then by compelling them to flee became the man
     responsible for the victory. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>More than a thousand Athenians
     fell in the battle and no less than two thousand were captured. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />Likewise, many of the Boeotians were killed and not a few taken prisoners. After the battle
     Philip raised a trophy of victory, yielded the dead for burial, gave sacrifices to the gods for

     has cast you in the role of Agamemnon, are you not ashamed to act the part of Thersites?" Stung
     by this well-aimed shaft of rebuke, Philip altered his whole demeanour completely. He cast off
     his garland, brushed aside the symbols of pride that marked the comus, expressed admiration for
     the man who dared to speak so plainly, freed him from captivity and gave him a place in his own
     company with every mark of honour. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Addressed by Demades with

     ambiguous but accepted it in a sense favourable to himself, namely that the oracle foretold
     that the Persian would be slaughtered like a sacrificial victim. Actually, however, it was not
     so, and it meant that Philip himself in the midst of a festival and holy sacrifices, like the
     bull, would be stabbed to death while decked with a garland. <milestone unit="section" n="4" />In any event, he thought that the gods supported him and was very happy to think that Asia

     flocked together from all directions to the festival, and the games and the marriage were
     celebrated in Aegae in Macedonia. Not only did individual notables crown him with golden crowns
     but most of the important cities as well, and among them Athens. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>As this award was being announced by the herald, he ended with the declaration that if

     which forecast the king's death.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At the state banquet, Philip
     ordered the actor Neoptolemus, matchless in the power of his voice and in his popularity, to
     present some well-received pieces, particularly such as bore on the Persian campaign. The

     the procession statues of the twelve gods wrought with great artistry and adorned with a

     his express orders his bodyguard held away from him and followed only at a distance, since he
     wanted to show publicly that he was protected by the goodwill of all the Greeks, and had no

     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Such was the pinnacle of success that he had attained, but as
     the praises and congratulations of all rang in his ears, suddenly without warning the plot
     against the king was revealed as death struck. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>We shall set
     forth the reasons for this in order that our story may be clear.<milestone unit="para" ed="P" />There was a Macedonian Pausanias who came of a family from the district Orestis.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Just. 9.6.4">Justin 9.6.4-8</bibl>. The Orestis was a district in western Macedonia bordering on Illyria.</note> He a was bodyguard of the king and
     was beloved by him because of his beauty. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>When he saw that the
     king was becoming enamoured of another Pausanias (a man of the same name as himself), he
     addressed him with abusive language, accusing him of being a hermaphrodite and prompt to accept
     the amorous advances of any who wished. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Unable to endure such
     an insult, the other kept silent for the time, but, after confiding to Attalus, one of his
     friends, what he proposed to do, he brought about his own death voluntarily and in a
     spectacular fashion. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For a few days after this, as Philip was
     engaged in battle with Pleurias, king of the Illyrians,<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">This battle can hardly be identified, in view of the many wars fought by Philip against the
      Illyrians. The last one mentioned by Diodorus was in chap. 69.7.</note> Pausanias stepped in
     front of him and, receiving on his body all the blows directed at the king, so met his death.
      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The incident was widely
     discussed and Attalus, who was a member of the court circle and influential with the king,
     invited the first Pausanias to dinner and when he had plied him till drunk with unmixed wine,
     handed his unconscious body over to the muleteers to abuse in drunken licentiousness.
      <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>So he presently recovered from his drunken stupor and, deeply
     resenting the outrage to his person, charged Attalus before the king with the outrage. Philip
     shared his anger at the barbarity of the act but did not wish to punish Attalus at that time
     because of their relationship, and because Attalus's services were needed urgently. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>He was the nephew<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">This is the usually stated relationship. In Book 17.2.3, Attalus is called Cleopatra's brother, but otherwise,
      with more probability, her uncle.</note> of the Cleopatra whom the king had just married as a
     new wife and he had been selected as a general of the advanced force being sent into Asia, for
     he was a man valiant in battle. For these reasons, the king tried to mollify the righteous
     anger of Pausanias at his treatment, giving him substantial presents and advancing him in
     honour among the bodyguards. </p>

      some years before the assassination of Philip, perhaps as early as <date value="-344" >344</date> B.C. (Berve, <title>Alexanderreich,</title> 2, p. 308). Pausanias waited a long time for his revenge, and it is curious that he chose the occasion most advantageous for

     but also on the one who failed to avenge him. In this design he was encouraged especially by

     his instruction how one might become most famous, the sophist replied that it would be by
     killing the one who had accomplished most, for just as long as he was remembered, so long his
     slayer would be remembered also. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Pausanias connected this
     saying with his private resentment, and admitting no delay in his plans because of his
     grievance he determined to act under cover of the festival in the following manner. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He posted horses at the gates of the city and came to the entrance of
     the theatre carrying a Celtic dagger under his cloak. When Philip directed his attending
     friends to precede him into the theatre, while the guards kept their distance, he saw that the
     king was left alone, rushed at him, pierced him through his ribs, and stretched him out
      dead<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">The date of Philip's death is discussed by K. J.
      Beloch, <title>Griechische Geschichte,</title> 3.2 (<date value="1923">1923</date>), 59. The
      news had not reached Athens by the end of the civil year <dateRange from="-337" to="-336" >337/6</dateRange> B.C.; <title>IG</title> 2&lpar;2&rpar;. 1.240 in the tenth prytany
      does not know of it. On the other hand, the time must be early in the summer, for Philip was
      busy with preparations for an invasion of Asia Minor. A possible clue to the date is furnished
      by the statement of <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 16.2">Plut. Alexander 16.2</bibl>, concerning the battle of the Granicus: this would have taken place in the month Daesius, but as that was
      unlucky, Alexander ordered the intercalation of a second Artemisius. Since there is some
      evidence that the intercalary month was the last month of the regnal year, this establishes a
      certain presumption that Philip died and Alexander came to the throne in Daesius; and this
      squares well enough with the evidence of the Attic inscription. Since Alexander died in
      Daesius, the Oxyrhynchus chronologist was correct in crediting him with thirteen years of
      reign. See below on Book 17.117.5 note.</note> ; then ran for the gates and the horses which he
     had prepared for his flight. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Immediately one group of the
     bodyguards hurried to the body of the king while the rest poured out in pursuit of the
     assassin; among these last were Leonnatus and Perdiccas and Attalus.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">This is presumably the son of Andromenes, who like Leonnatus and Perdiccas was a
      close friend and contemporary of Alexander; probably they were his bodyguards and not Philip's
      (the term may be used loosely; Attalus was never one of Alexander's seven or eight bodyguards
      proper in Asia, and Leonnatus not until 332/1, Perdiccas not until 330; Berve,
       <title>Alexanderreich,</title> 1.27). Pausanias was from Orestis, and so were two of his
      slayers, while Attalus was Perdiccas's brother-in-law. It is tempting to suppose that they
      knew of Pausanias's plan and then killed him to silence him. U. Wilcken (<title>SB Ak. Berlin,</title>
      <date value="1923">1923</date>, 151 ff.) would find in <title>P. Oxy.</title>
      <date value="1798">1798</date> evidence that Pausanias was tried and executed, but the text is
      fragmentary and obscure, and the theory is not, to my mind, supported by <bibl n="Just. 11.2.1">Justin 11.2.1</bibl>.</note> Having a good start, Pausanias would have
     mounted his horse before they could catch him had he not caught his boot in a vine and fallen.
     As he was scrambling to his feet, Perdiccas and the rest came up with him and killed him with
     their javelins. </p>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />The preceding book, which was the sixteenth of the <title>Histories,</title> began with the
     coronation of Philip the son of Amyntas and included his whole career down to his death,
     together with those events connected with other kings, peoples and cities which occurred in the
     years of his reign, twenty-four in number. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In this book we
     shall continue the systematic narrative beginning with the accession of Alexander, and include
     both the history of this king down to his death as well as contemporary events in the known
     parts of the world. This is the best method, I think, of ensuring that events will be
     remembered, for thus the material is arranged topically, and each story is told without
     interruption. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Alexander
     accomplished great things in a short space of time, and by his acumen and courage surpassed in
     the magnitude of his achievements all kings whose memory is recorded from the beginning of
     time. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In twelve years he conquered no small part of Europe and
     practically all of Asia, and so acquired a fabulous reputation like that of the heroes and
     demigods of old. But there is really no need to anticipate in the introduction any of the
     accomplishments of this king; his deeds reported one by one will attest sufficiently the
     greatness of his glory. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>On his father's side Alexander was a
     descendant of Heracles and on his mother's he could claim the blood of the Aeacids, so that
     from his ancestors on both sides he inherited the physical and moral qualities of
      greatness.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Plut. Alex. 2.1">Plut. Alexander

      accomplices (Book 16.94.4). Alexander himself was the principal beneficiary of the murder, and
      he has been suspected of complicity, especially because, as only half of Macedonian blood, he
      was not universally popular. At all events, the known victims of this purge were Alexander's
      own rivals: his older cousin Amyntas, son of King Perdiccas III; the family of Alexander of
      Lyncestis, although he himself was spared; and Philip's wife Cleopatra and her infant
      daughter, killed by Olympias. These murders were not forgotten (<bibl n="Plut. Alex. 10.4" >Plut. Alexander 10.4</bibl>; <bibl n="Plut. De Alex. 1.327c">Plut. On the Fortune of Alexander

     to the funeral of his father. He established his authority far more firmly than any did in fact
     suppose possible, <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>for he was quite young and for this reason
     not uniformly respected, but first he promptly won over the Macedonians to his support by
     tactful statements.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Just. 11.1.8">Justin
      11.1.8</bibl>.</note> He declared that the king was changed only in name and that the state
     would be run on principles no less effective than those of his father's administration. Then he
     addressed himself to the embassies which were present and in affable fashion bade the Greeks
     maintain towards him the loyalty which they had shown to his father. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He busied his soldiers with constant training in the use of their weapons and with
     tactical exercises, and established discipline in the army.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A
     possible rival for the throne remained in Attalus, who was the brother of Cleopatra, the last
     wife of Philip, and Alexander determined to kill him. As a matter of fact, Cleopatra had borne
     a child to Philip a few days before his death.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">In Book
      16.93.9, Attalus was called Cleopatra's nephew, but he was apparently her uncle and guardian
      (Berve, <title>Alexanderreich,</title> 2.94). He may well have been disaffected because of the murder of Cleopatra and her daughter, but he had no known claim upon the throne of Macedonia.
      He was, at all events, loyal to Philip and hostile to Philip's assassin (Book 16.93.5-9).</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Attalus had been sent on ahead into Asia to share the command
     of the forces with Parmenion and had acquired great popularity in the army by his readiness to
     do favours and his easy bearing with the soldiers. Alexander had good reason to fear that he
     might challenge his rule, making common cause with those of the Greeks who opposed him,
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>and selected from among his friends a certain Hecataeus and
     sent him off to Asia with a number of soldiers, under orders to bring back Attalus alive if he
     could, but if not, to assassinate him as quickly as possible. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />So he crossed over into Asia, joined Parmenion and Attalus and awaited an opportunity to
     carry out his mission. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Alexander knew that many of the Greeks were anxious to
     revolt, and was seriously worried. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In Athens, where
     Demosthenes kept agitating against Macedon, the news of Philip's death was received with
     rejoicing, and the Athenians were not ready to concede the leading position among the Greeks to
     Macedon. They communicated secretly with Attalus and arranged to co-operate with him, and they
     encouraged many of the cities to strike for their freedom. <milestone unit="section" n="3" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Aetolians voted to restore those of the Acarnanians who
     had experienced exile because of Philip. The Ambraciots were persuaded by one Aristarchus to
     expel the garrison placed in their city by Philip and to transform their government into a
     democracy. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Similarly, the Thebans voted to drive out the
     garrison in the Cadmeia and not to concede to Alexander the leadership of the Greeks. The
     Arcadians alone of the Greeks had never acknowledged Philip's leadership nor did they now
     recognize that of Alexander. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Otherwise in the Peloponnesus the
     Argives and Eleians and Lacedaemonians, with others, moved to recover their independence.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Just. 11.2.4">Justin 11.2.4-5</bibl>. Aristarchus, presumably an Ambraciot, is otherwise unknown. Diodorus has inverted the roles of the
      Arcadians and the Lacedaemonians; it was the latter who had never been subject to Philip. Cp.
      further below, chap. 4.</note> Beyond the frontiers of Macedonia, many tribes moved toward
     revolt and a general feeling of unrest swept through the natives in that quarter.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Cp. below, chap. 8.1.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But, for all the problems and
     fears that beset his kingdom on every side, Alexander, who had only just reached manhood,
     brought everything into order impressively and swiftly. Some he won by persuasion and
     diplomacy, others he frightened into keeping the peace,<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Arr. An. 1.1.3">Arrian. 1.1.3</bibl> (with reference to Athens).</note> but some had to be
     mastered by force and so reduced to submission. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="4">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>First he dealt with the Thessalians,
     reminding them of his ancient relationship to them through Heracles and raising their hopes by
     kindly words and by rich promises as well, and prevailed upon them by formal vote of the
     Thessalian League to recognize as his the leadership of Greece which he had inherited from his
      father.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Just. 11.3.1">Justin 11.3.1-2</bibl>. Alexander had in Achilles a common ancestor with the Aleuadae of Larissa.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Next he won over the neighbouring tribes similarly, and so
     marched down to Pylae, where he convened the assembly of the Amphictyons and had them pass a
     resolution granting him the leadership of the Greeks. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He gave
     audience to the envoys of the Ambraciots and, addressing them in friendly fashion, convinced
     them that they had been only a little premature in grasping the independence that he was on the
     point of giving them voluntarily. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In order to overawe those who refused to yield otherwise, he set out at the head of
     the army of the Macedonians in full battle array. With forced marches he arrived in Boeotia and
     encamping near the Cadmeia threw the city of the Thebans into a panic. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>As the Athenians immediately learned that the king had passed into
     Boeotia, they too abandoned their previous refusal to take him seriously. So much the rapid
     moves and energetic action of the young man shook the confidence of those who opposed him.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Athenians, accordingly, voted to bring into the city
     their property scattered throughout Attica and to look to the repair of their walls, but they
     also sent envoys to Alexander, asking forgiveness for tardy recognition of his leadership.
      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Even Demosthenes was included
     among the envoys; he did not, however, go with the others to Alexander, but turned back at
     Cithaeron and returned to Athens, whether fearful because of the anti-Macedonian course that he
     had pursued in politics, or merely wishing to leave no ground of complaint to the king of
     Persia. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>He was generally believed to have received large sums
     of money from that source in payment for his efforts to check the Macedonians, and indeed
     Aeschines is said to have referred to this in a speech when he taunted Demosthenes with his
      venality:<quote>At the moment, it is true, his extravagance has been glutted by the king's
      gold, but even this will not satisfy him; no wealth has ever proved sufficient for a greedy
      character.</quote><note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Aeschin. 3.173">Aeschin.
      3.173</bibl>, with a slightly different word order.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Alexander addressed the Athenian envoys kindly and freed the
     people from their acute terror.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then he called a meeting at
     Corinth of envoys and delegates, and when the usual representatives came, he spoke to them in
     moderate terms and had them pass a resolution appointing him general plenipotentiary of the
     Greeks and undertaking themselves to join in an expedition against Persia seeking satisfaction
     for the offences which the Persians had committed against Greece.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Just. 11.2.5">Justin 11.2.5</bibl>.</note> Successful in this, the king
     returned to Macedonia with his army. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="5">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now that we have described what took place in Greece, we
     shall shift our account to the events in Asia. Here, immediately after the death of Philip,
     Attalus actually had set his hand to revolt and had agreed with the Athenians to undertake
     joint action against Alexander, but later he changed his mind. Preserving the letter which had
     been brought to him from Demosthenes,<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Plut. Dem. 23.2">Plut. Demosthenes 23.2</bibl>.</note> he sent it off to Alexander and
     tried by expressions of loyalty to remove from himself any possible suspicion. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Hecataeus, however, following the instructions of the king literally,
     had him killed by treachery,<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Continued from chap. 2, above.
      It is incredible that the assassination of Attalus could have occurred without the connivance
      of Parmenion, who may have been pleased to be rid of the head of a rival faction at court (but
       <bibl n="Curt. 6.9.18">Curtius 6.9.18</bibl> reports that Attalus was Parmenion's son-in-law). And Attalus could not be left alive after the execution of his niece.</note> and
     thereafter the Macedonian forces in Asia were free from any incitement to revolution, Attalus
     being dead and Parmenion completely devoted to Alexander. <milestone unit="section" n="3" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As our narrative is now to treat of the kingdom of the
     Persians, we must go back a little to pick up the thread.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles" >Continued from Book 16.52. Cp. <bibl n="Just. 10.3">Justin 10.3</bibl>.</note> While Philip
     was still king, Ochus<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Ochus has been mentioned previously by his throne name Artaxerxes.</note> ruled the Persians and oppressed his subjects cruelly and
     harshly. Since his savage disposition made him hated, the chiliarch Bagoas, a eunuch in
     physical fact but a militant rogue in disposition, killed him by poison administered by a
     certain physician and placed upon the throne the youngest of his sons, Arses. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He similarly made away with the brothers of the new king, who were
     barely of age, in order that the young man might be isolated and tractable to his control. But
     the young king let it be known that he was offended at Bagoas's previous outrageous behaviour
     and was prepared to punish the author of these crimes, so Bagoas anticipated his intentions and
     killed Arses and his children also while he was still in the third year of his reign.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">The king lists give Arses two years, <dateRange from="-338" to="-336">338</dateRange>-336 B.C., but he was in his third regnal year at the time of his
      death. His second year, <dateRange from="-337" to="-336">337/6</dateRange> B.C., was the only full one which he enjoyed.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>The royal house was thus extinguished, and there was no one in
     the direct line of descent to claim the throne. Instead Bagoas selected a certain Dareius, a
     member of the court circle, and secured the throne for him. He was the son of Arsanes, and
     grandson of that Ostanes who was a brother of Artaxerxes, who had been king.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Artaxerxes II, <dateRange from="-405" to="-359" >405</dateRange>-<dateRange from="-359" to="-338">359</dateRange> B.C.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>As to Bagoas, an odd thing happened to him and one to point a
     moral. Pursuing his habitual savagery he attempted to remove Dareius by poison. The plan leaked
     out, however, and the king, calling upon Bagoas, as it were, to drink to him a toast and
     handing him his own cup compelled him to take his own medicine. </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dareius's selection for the
     throne was based on his known bravery, in which quality he far surpassed the other Persians.
     Once when King Artaxerxes<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Artaxerxes III (Ochus), 359-338 B.C.</note> was campaigning against the Cadusians, one of them with a wide reputation for
     strength and courage challenged a volunteer among the Persians to fight in single combat with
     him. No other dared accept, but Dareius alone entered the contest and slew the challenger,
     being honoured in consequence by the king with rich gifts, while among the Persians he was
     conceded the first place in prowess. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>It was because of this
     prowess that he was thought worthy to take over the kingship. This happened about the same time
     as Philip died and Alexander became king. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such was the man whom fate had selected to be the antagonist of
     Alexander's genius, and they opposed one another in many and great struggles for the supremacy.
     These our detailed narrative will describe in each case. And we may now proceed with our story.

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="7">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dareius became king before the death of Philip and thought to turn the coming war back
     upon Macedonia, but when Philip died, Dareius was relieved of his anxiety and despised the
     youth of Alexander. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Soon, however, when Alexander's vigour and
     rapidity of action had secured for him the leadership of all Greece and made evident the
     ability of the young man, then Dareius took warning and began to pay serious attention to his
     forces. He fitted out a large number of ships of war and assembled numerous strong armies,
     choosing at the same time his best commanders, among whom was Memnon of Rhodes,<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">See Book 16.52.4.</note> outstanding in courage and in strategic
     grasp. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>The king gave him five thousand<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">This number seems small for the task assigned Memnon, but it is hardly likely
      that it should be emended to 50,000, the total number of the King's Greek mercenaries (<bibl n="Curt. 5.11.5">Curtius 5.11.5</bibl>). Polyaenus refers to Memnon's 4000 troops (<bibl n="Polyaen. 5.44.4">Polyaenus 5.44.4</bibl>).</note> mercenaries and ordered him to march to
     Cyzicus and to try to get possession of it. With this force, accordingly, Memnon marched on
     across the range of Mt. Ida. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P" />Some tell the story that this mountain got its name from Ida, the daughter of Melisseus.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Melisseus, king of Crete, is reported to have been the father of

      the calculations of Mr. Alan E. Samuel, this would be the heliacal rising of Sirius, which

      &amp; Leipzig, <date value="1929">1929</date>, Vol. 2, Tables E 58-62). Professor Otto Neugebauer writes that the rising would occur between 18th and 20th July, but that these
      references in the Greek authors are not to be pressed too closely.</note> if one stands upon
     the highest peak, the stillness of the surrounding atmosphere gives the impression that the
     summit is elevated above the motion of the winds, and the sun can be seen rising while it is
     still night. Its rays are not circumscribed in a circular orb but its flame is dispersed in
     many places, so that you would think that there were many patches of fire burning along the
     horizon. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>Presently, then, these draw together into one huge
     flame the width of which reaches three plethra.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">The plethron was 100 Greek feet or somewhat less than 100 English feet, and varied somewhat. It is

     when the king appeared suddenly before the city and encamped with his whole army near by.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Before the king's arrival, the Thebans had had time to
     surround the Cadmeia with deep trenches and heavy stockades so that neither reinforcements nor
     supplies could be sent in, and they had sent an appeal to the Arcadians, Argives, and Eleians
     for help. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>They appealed for support from the Athenians also,
     and when they received from Demosthenes a free gift of weapons, they equipped all of their
     citizens who lacked heavy armour. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Of those who were asked for
     reinforcements, however, the Peloponnesians sent soldiers as far as the Isthmus and waited to
     see what would happen, since the king's arrival was now expected, and the Athenians, under the
     influence of Demosthenes, voted to support the Thebans, but failed to send out their forces,

<div2 type="chapter" n="9">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So when the king appeared suddenly out of
     Thrace with all his army, the alliances of the Thebans had furnished them with only a hesitant
     support while the power of their opponents possessed an obvious and evident superiority.
     Nevertheless their leaders assembled in council and prepared a resolution about the war; they
     were unanimous in deciding to fight it out for their political freedom. The measure was passed
     by the assembly, and with great enthusiasm all were ready to see the thing through. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At first the king made no move, giving
     the Thebans time to think things over and supposing that a single city would never dare to
     match forces with such an army. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>For at that time Alexander had
     more than thirty thousand infantry and no less than three thousand cavalry, all battle-seasoned
     veterans of Philip's campaigns who had hardly experienced a single reverse. This was the army
     on the skill and loyalty of which he relied to overthrow the Persian empire. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>If the Thebans had yielded to the situation and had asked the
     Macedonians for peace and an alliance, the king would have accepted their proposals with
     pleasure and would have conceded everything they asked, for he was eager to be rid of these
     disturbances in Greece so that he might without distraction pursue the war with
      Persia.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Finally, however, he realized that he was despised by
     the Thebans, and so decided to destroy the city utterly and by this act of terror take the
     heart out of anyone else who might venture to rise against him. <milestone unit="section" n="5" />He made his forces ready for battle, then announced through a herald that any of the Thebans
     who wished might come to him and enjoy the peace which was common to all the Greeks. In
     response, the Thebans with equal spirit proclaimed from a high tower that anyone who wished to
     join the Great King and Thebes in freeing the Greeks<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Plut. Alex. 11.4">Plut. Alexander 11.4</bibl>. That is, according to the terms of the
      Peace of Antalcidas (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 5.1.31">Xen. Hell. 5.1.31</bibl>). In a similar
      manner, the Athenians had appealed to the Greeks against Sparta in the decree of Aristoteles
      setting up the so-called Second Athenian League (<date value="-377">377</date> B.C.;
       <title>SIG</title> 147).</note> and destroying the tyrant of Greece should come over to them.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>This epithet stung Alexander. He flew into a towering rage
     and declared that he would pursue the Thebans with the extremity of punishment. Raging in his
     heart, he set to constructing siege engines and to preparing whatever else was necessary for
     the attack. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="10">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Elsewhere in Greece, as people learned the seriousness of the danger
     hanging over the Thebans, they were distressed at their expected disaster but had no heart to
     help them, feeling that the city by precipitate and ill-considered action had consigned itself
     to evident annihilation. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>In Thebes itself, however, men
     accepted their risk willingly and with good courage, but they were puzzled by certain sayings
     of prophets and portents of the gods.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>First there was the light
     spider's web in the temple of Demeter which was observed to have spread itself out to the size
     of an himation, and which all about shone iridescent like a rainbow in the sky. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>About this, the oracle at Delphi gave them the response:<quote type="oracle">
      <l met="dactylic">The gods to mortals all have sent this sign;</l>
      <l>To the Boeotians first, and to their neighbours.</l>
     </quote>The ancestral oracle of Thebes itself had given this response:<quote type="oracle">

     </quote>
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This sign had occurred three
     months before Alexander's descent on the city, but at the very moment of the king's arrival the
     statues in the market place were seen to burst into perspiration and be covered with great
     drops of moisture. More than this, people reported to the city officials that the marsh at
     Onchestus was emitting a sound very like a bellow, while at Dirce a bloody ripple ran along the
     surface of the water. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Finally, travellers coming from Delphi
     told how the temple which the Thebans had dedicated from the Phocian spoils was observed to
     have blood-stains on its roof.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">The naos at Delphi was the
      great temple of Apollo which was under construction in the period <dateRange from="-360" to="-330">360</dateRange>-330 B.C. The epigraphical record is assembled by E. Bourguet in
      the <title>Fouilles de Delphes,</title> 3.5 (<date value="1932">1932</date>). Much was done in
      346 in the archonship of Damoxenus, "when peace was established," and there were Theban
       <emph>naopoioi</emph> in that year, along with many others. The Thebans had taken a hand in plundering the Phocians after Philip's victory, and the Phocians were obligated to make annual
      payments to restore what they had borrowed from the sanctuary (Book 16.60.2). But there is
      otherwise no suggestion that Phocian funds were applied to the temple construction, and it is
      quite certain that the Thebans themselves did not build or rebuild or dedicate the temple of
      Apollo.</note> <milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Those who made a business of interpreting such
     portents stated that the spider web signified the departure of the gods from the city, its
     iridescence meant a storm of mixed troubles, the sweating of the statues was the sign of an
     overwhelming catastrophe, and the appearance of blood in many places foretold a vast slaughter
     throughout the city. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>They pointed out that the gods were
     clearly predicting disaster for the city and recommended that the outcome of the war should not
     be risked upon the battlefield, but that a safer solution should be sought for in
      conversations.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Still the Thebans' spirits were not daunted. On
     the contrary they were so carried away with enthusiasm that they reminded one another of the
     victory at Leuctra and of the other battles where their own fighting qualities had won unhoped
     for victories to the astonishment of the Greek world. They indulged their nobility of spirit
     bravely rather than wisely, and plunged headlong into the total destruction of their country.

<div2 type="chapter" n="11">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now the king in the course of only three days made everything ready for the assault.
     He divided his forces into three parts and ordered one to attack the palisades which had been
     erected before the city, the second to face the Theban battle line, and the third as a reserve
     to support any hard pressed unit of his forces and to enter the battle in its turn. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>For their part, the Thebans stationed the cavalry within the palisades,
     assigned their enfranchised slaves, along with refugees and resident aliens, to face those who
     drove at the walls, and themselves made ready to fight before the city with the Macedonian
     force about the king which was many times their number. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>Their
     children and wives flocked to the temples and implored the gods to rescue the city from its
      dangers.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When the Macedonians approached and each division
     encountered the opposing force of Thebans, the trumpets blew the call to arms and the troops on
     both sides raised the battle cry in unison and hurled their missiles at the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>These were soon expended and all turned to the use of the sword at close
     quarters, and a mighty struggle ensued. The Macedonians exerted a force that could hardly be
     withstood because of the numbers of their men and the weight of the phalanx, but the Thebans
     were superior in bodily strength and in their constant training in the gymnasium. Still more,
     in exaltation of spirit they were lifted out of themselves and became indifferent to personal
     danger. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Many were wounded in both armies and not a few fell
     facing the blows of the enemy. The air was filled with the roar of fighters locked in the
     struggle, moans and shouts and exhortations: on the Macedonian side, not to be unworthy of
     their previous exploits, and on the Theban, not to forget children and wives and parents
     threatened with slavery and their every household lying exposed to the fury of the Macedonians,
     and to remember the battles of Leuctra and of Mantineia and the glorious deeds which were
     household words throughout Greece. So for a long time the battle remained evenly poised because
     of the surpassing valour of the contestants. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="12">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At length Alexander saw that the Thebans
     were still fighting unflinchingly for their freedom, but that his Macedonians were wearying in
     the battle, and ordered his reserve division to enter the struggle. As this suddenly struck the
     tired Thebans, it bore heavily against them and killed many. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />Still the Thebans did not concede the victory, but on the contrary, inspired by the will to
     win, despised all dangers. They had the courage to shout that the Macedonians now openly
     confessed to being their inferiors. Under normal circumstances, when an enemy attacks in
     relays, it is usual for soldiers to fear the fresh strength of the reinforcements, but the
     Thebans alone then faced their dangers ever more boldly, as the enemy sent against them new
     troops for those whose strength flagged with weariness. <milestone unit="section" n="3" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So the Theban spirit proved unshakable here, but the king
     took note of a postern gate that had been deserted by its guards and hurried Perdiccas with a
     large detachment of troops to seize it and penetrate into the city.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Arr. An. 1.8.1">Arrian. 1.8.1</bibl>, quoting Ptolemy, places this incident at the beginning of the siege, before any other fighting, and says that Perdiccas
      acted on his own initiative. He may have tried to repeat the manoeuvre at Halicarnassus (chap.
      25.5). As later, he was presumably in command of one of the six battalions of the phalanx.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>He quickly carried out the order and the Macedonians slipped
     through the gate into the city, while the Thebans, having worn down the first assault wave of
     the Macedonians, stoutly faced the second and still had high hopes of victory. When they knew
     that a section of the city had been taken, however, they began immediately to withdraw within
     the walls, <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>but in this operation their cavalry galloped along
     with the infantry into the city and trampled upon and killed many of their own men; they
     themselves rode into the city in disorder and, encountering a maze of narrow alleys and
     trenches, lost their footing and fell and were killed by their own weapons. At the same time
     the Macedonian garrison in the Cadmeia burst out of the citadel, engaged the Thebans, and
     attacking them in their confusion made a great slaughter among them.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Plut. Alex. 11.5">Plut. Alexander 11.5</bibl>.</note>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="13">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So while the city was being taken, many and varied were the scenes of destruction
     within the walls. Enraged by the arrogance of the Theban proclamation, the Macedonians pressed
     upon them more furiously than is usual in war, and shrieking curses flung themselves on the
     wretched people, slaying all whom they met without sparing any. <milestone unit="section" n="2" />The Thebans, for their part, clinging desperately to their forlorn hope of victory, counted
     their lives as nothing and when they met a foeman, grappled with him and drew his blows upon
     themselves. In the capture of the city, no Theban was seen begging the Macedonians to spare his
     life, nor did they in ignoble fashion fall and cling to the knees of their conquerors.
      <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But neither did the agony of courage elicit pity from the foe
     nor did the day's length suffice for the cruelty of their vengeance. All the city was pillaged.
     Everywhere boys and girls were dragged into captivity as they wailed piteously the names of
     their mothers.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In sum, households were seized with all their
     members, and the city's enslavement was complete. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Of the men
     who remained, some, wounded and dying, grappled with the foe and were slain themselves as they
     destroyed their enemy; others, supported only by a shattered spear, went to meet their
     assailants and, in their supreme struggle, held freedom dearer than life. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>As the slaughter mounted and every corner of the city was piled high
     with corpses, no one could have failed to pity the plight of the unfortunates. For even
     Greeks&mdash;Thespians, Plataeans and Orchomenians and some others hostile to the Thebans
     who had joined the king in the campaign<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Just. 11.3.8">Justin 11.3.8</bibl> names Phocians, Plataeans, Thespians, and Orchomenians;

     and now demonstrated their own hatred amid the calamities of the unfortunate victims.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So it was that many terrible
     things befell the city. Greeks were mercilessly slain by Greeks, relatives were butchered by
     their own relatives, and even a common dialect induced no pity. In the end, when night finally
     intervened, the houses had been plundered and children and women and aged persons who had fled
     into the temples were torn from sanctuary and subjected to outrage without limit. </p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="14">

     certain men who were hostile to the Thebans began to recommend that they should be visited with
     the direst penalties, and they pointed out that they had taken the side of the barbarians
     against the Greeks. For in the time of Xerxes they had actually joined forces with the Persians
     and campaigned against Greece, and alone of the Greeks were honoured as benefactors by the
     Persian kings, so that the ambassadors of the Thebans were seated on thrones set in front of
     the kings. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They related many other details of similar tenor
     and so aroused the feelings of the council against the Thebans that it was finally voted to
     raze the city, to sell the captives, to outlaw the Theban exiles from all Greece, and to allow
     no Greek to offer shelter to a Theban. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The king, in accordance
     with the decree of the council, destroyed the city, and so presented possible rebels among the
     Greeks with a terrible warning. By selling off the prisoners he realized a sum of four hundred

     oppose Alexander. Memnon, the Rhodian, famed for his military competence, advocated a policy of
     not fighting a pitched battle, but of stripping the countryside and through the shortage of
     supplies preventing the Macedonians from advancing further, while at the same time they sent
     naval and land forces across to Macedonia and transferred the impact of war to Europe.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Arr. An. 1.12.9">Arrian. 1.12.9</bibl>.</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>This was the best counsel, as after-events made clear, but,

     and summoning forces from every quarter and heavily outnumbering the Macedonians, they advanced
     in the direction of Hellespontine Phrygia. They pitched camp by the river Granicus, using the

<div2 type="chapter" n="19">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When Alexander learned of the

     Persians, resting on high ground, made no move, intending to fall upon the foe as he crossed
     the river, for they supposed they could easily carry the day when the Macedonian phalanx was
     divided. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>But Alexander at dawn boldly brought his army across
     the river and deployed in good order before they could stop him.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">This account of the battle differs from that of <bibl n="Arr. An. 1.13">Arrian
       1.13</bibl> in two respects which cannot be reconciled. There, the attack takes place in the
      late afternoon and in the lower course of the Granicus, where the river flows through
      relatively flat country but in a deep and muddy bed. He, as Plutarch also (<bibl n="Plut. Alex. 16">Plut. Alexander 16</bibl>), describes the action as taking place between
      Macedonians trying to cross and Persians holding the river bank. Diodorus, in contrast, places
      the battle at dawn, and lets the Macedonians cross without difficulty and engage the Persians
      on the far bank. Probably he located the battle further upstream, in the foothills. According
      to <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 16.2">Plut. Alexander 16.2</bibl>, the battle would have occurred in the Macedonian month Daesius, but as that was unlucky militarily, Alexander ordered the
      intercalation of a second Artemisius. See further Book 16.94.3, note.</note> In return, they
     posted their mass of horsemen all along the front of the Macedonians since they had decided to
     press the battle with these.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">The novelty of this arrangement consisted in the fact that each army placed its cavalry in front at the point of contact. This
      may not have been specifically planned. Alexander threw his cavalry across the river to gain a
      bridgehead, and the Persians naturally countered with their cavalry, so that a piecemeal
      engagement followed.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Memnon of Rhodes and the satrap Arsamenes held the left wing
     each with his own cavalry; Arsites was stationed next with the horsemen from Paphlagonia; then

      names these Persians and adds Petines and Niphates, but does not give the Persian order of

     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As the horse of each side

     satrap and rode at him.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">According to <bibl n="Arr. An. 1.14.6">Arrian. 1.14.6-7</bibl>, Alexander opened the battle with a mixed force under Ptolemy the son of Philip, probably the one of the bodyguards who was killed at
      Halicarnassus. He had light troops including the Scouts under Amyntas the son of Arrhabaeus, a
      battalion of the phalanx, and a squadron of the Companions. His mission was to open a gap in
      the Persian line. Then Alexander, as usual, charged with the Companions obliquely towards the
      Persian centre.</note> <milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To the Persian, it seemed as if this
     opportunity for a single combat was god-given. He hoped that by his individual gallantry Asia
     might be relieved of its terrible menace, the renowned daring of Alexander arrested by his own
     hands, and the glory of the Persians saved from disgrace. He hurled his javelin first at
     Alexander with so mighty an impulse and so powerful a cast that he pierced Alexander's shield
     and right epomis and drove through the breastplate.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">If
      Alexander may be assumed to have carried a shield on his left arm, it would have been possible
      for the javelin to pass through this and his breastplate and catch in his <emph>epomis</emph>
      on the right shoulder (not the shoulder itself, since Alexander was not wounded; <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 16.5">Plut. Alexander 16.5</bibl>), although this would have required a
      remarkably violent cast, especially since the weapon, dangling from the right arm, must have
      passed its entire length completely through the shield. This all suggests some exaggeration if
      not confusion, and it is doubtful if the Macedonian cavalry carried shields; Alexander is
      shown without one in the mosaic from the House of the Faun in Pompeii, which, of course,
      pictures the Battle of Issus, and not that at the Granicus (cp. Berve,
      <title>Alexanderreich,</title> 1.104, n. 4; such pictures as that in Doro Levy, <title>Antioch

      they expected to fight on foot). If this shield is the same as the <emph>hoplon</emph> taken
      from Ilium and mentioned below, chap. 21.2, it may be that, as Arrian reports (<bibl n="Arr. An. 1.11.7">Arrian. 1.11.7-8</bibl>), it was actually carried before him by an attendant (this does not, of course, make the course of the javelin any more easily
      explicable). In the mosaic, Alexander wears the chlamys over his breastplate, and fastened
      with a fibula on his right shoulder.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The king shook off the weapon as it dangled by his arm, then
     applying spurs to his horse and employing the favouring momentum of his charge drove his lance
     squarely into the satrap's chest. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>At this, adjacent ranks in
     both armies cried out at the superlative display of prowess. The point, however, snapped off
     against the breastplate and the broken shaft recoiled, and the Persian drew his sword and drove
     at Alexander; but the king recovered his grip upon his lance in time to thrust at the man's
     face and drive the blow home. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>The Persian fell, but just at
     this moment, Rhosaces, his brother, galloping up brought his sword down on Alexander's head
     with such a fearsome blow that it split his helmet and inflicted a slight scalp wound.
      <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>As Rhosaces aimed another blow at the same break, Cleitus,

      Alexander simultaneously; the king killed the former, while the latter cracked his helmet and

      king, while it was Spithridates whose arm was severed by Cleitus. The text of Diodorus here
      might allow one to suppose that Alexander also was thrown to the ground, and a figure
      appearing in two of the reliefs of the Alexander Sarcophagus in Constantinople, with cracked

     of Athena, he still did not give in, but borne up by an exaltation of spirit surmounted every

<div2 type="chapter" n="23">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There are those who say that Alexander's strategic conception was sound, when he

     them of all hope of escape by flight. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He employed the same
     device, they say, at the battle of the Granicus, where he placed the stream at his rear, for no
     one could think of flight when destruction of any who were followed into the bed of the river

     palace of the kings of the Carians, and was well provided with interior fortresses. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>About the same time Memnon sent his wife<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">This wife, Barsine the daughter of Artabazus, was captured after Issus and was believed later to have born Alexander a son, Heracles.</note> and children to Dareius, because
     he calculated that leaving them in the king's care was a good way to ensure their safety, while
     at the same time the king, now that he had good hostages, would be more willing to entrust
     Memnon with the supreme command. And so it turned out. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For
     Dareius straightway sent letters to those who dwelt next the sea, directing them one and all to
     take orders from Memnon. Accordingly, having assumed the supreme command, he made all the
     necessary dispositions for a siege in the city of the Halicarnassians. </p>

     Alexander had his siege engines and provisions conveyed by sea to Halicarnassus while he
     himself with all his army marched into Caria, winning over the cities that lay on his route by

     and exemption from taxation, adding the assurance that the freedom of the Greeks was the object
     for which he had taken upon himself the war against the Persians. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>On his journey he was met by a woman named Ada, who belonged by blood to the ruling

     of war, filled in the trenches in front of the city with the aid of sheds to protect the
     workers, and rocked the towers and the curtains between them with his battering rams. Whenever
     he overthrew a portion of the wall, he attempted by hand-to-hand fighting to force an entry
     into the city over the rubble. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But Memnon at first easily beat
     off the Macedonians assaulting the walls, for he had large numbers of men in the city. Where
     the siege engines were attacking, he issued from the city at night with numbers of soldiers and
     applied fire to the machines. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Fierce fights occurred in front
     of the city, in which the Macedonians showed far superior prowess, but the Persians had the

     and, giving half of them lighted torches and forming the others so as to meet the enemy, he

     made a stand against the enemy, who had supposed that because of their mass they would be

     of the valour of the contestants and their consummate fighting spirit. The Macedonians
     prevented the fire from spreading, <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>but Ephialtes's men had the
     advantage in the battle, and he himself, who had far greater bodily strength than the rest,
     slew with his own hand many who traded blows with him. From the top of the recently erected
     replacement wall, the defenders slew many of the Macedonians with dense showers of
     missiles&mdash;for there had been erected a wooden tower, a hundred cubits high, which was
     filled with dart-hurling catapults. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>As many Macedonians fell

      she did not yet know Alexander and had no motive for such a warning; Olympias, on the other

      occupied Issus in Alexander's rear, and his narrative is very conventional. Actually, Dareius
      established a fortified line along the north bank of the river Pinarus, and Alexander was
      compelled to turn the position by a movement through the hills to the east. Cp. <bibl n="Plb. 12.17">Polybius 12.17-23</bibl>; <bibl n="Curt. 3.8">Curtius 3.8-11.15</bibl>; <bibl n="Just. 11.9.1">Justin 11.9.1-9</bibl>; <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 20.1">Plut. Alexander

     alarming fashion with his forces drawn up for battle, a frightening spectacle, Alexander
     grasped that this was a god-given opportunity to destroy the Persian power in a single victory.
     He roused his soldiers with appropriate words for a decisive effort and marshalled the
     battalions of foot and the squadrons of horse appropriately to the location. He set the cavalry
     along the front of the whole army, and ordered the infantry phalanx to remain in reserve behind
     it. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He himself advanced at the head of the right wing to the

     of attack and then the Macedonians first raised an unearthly shout followed by the Persians
     answering, so that the whole hillside bordering the battlefield echoed back the sound, and this
     second roar in volume surpassed the Macedonian warcry as five hundred thousand men shouted with

     the victory with his own hands. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>By now the rest of the cavalry
     on both sides was engaged and many were killed as the battle raged indecisively because of the

     close to carrying off Dareius into the midst of the enemy, but the king himself, in extreme

     however, bursting out into the plain and driving their horses at full gallop succeeded in
     reaching the safety of the friendly cities. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Now the Macedonian
     phalanx and the Persian infantry were engaged only briefly, for the rout of the cavalry had

     He was not crushed in spirit in spite of the tremendous setback he had received, but wrote to
     Alexander advising him to bear his success as one who was only human and to release the
     captives in return for a large ransom. He added that he would yield to Alexander the territory
     and cities of Asia west of the Halys River if he would sign a treaty of friendship with him.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Alexander summoned his Friends to a council and concealed the
     real letter. Forging another more in accord with his interests he introduced it to his advisers
     and sent the envoys away empty handed.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Diodorus is the only
      author to report this forgery. Three approaches by Dareius to Alexander are mentioned. (1)
      After the battle of Issus. <bibl n="Just. 11.12.1">Justin 11.12.1-2</bibl>, <bibl n="Arr. An. 2.14">Arrian 2.14</bibl>, and <bibl n="Curt. 4.1.7">Curtius 4.1.7-14</bibl> state
      that this letter of Dareius demanded that Alexander withdraw from Asia and release his
      captives with (Curtius, Justin) or without (Arrian) a ransom. Curtius adds that this letter
      was cast in an insulting tone, suggesting the manner of the one here stated to have been
      forged by Alexander. (2) After the capture of Tyre. Dareius now offered the hand of one of his
      daughters and all the territory west of the Halys River (<bibl n="Curt. 4.5.1">Curtius
      4.5.1-8</bibl>) or a share in the kingdom (<bibl n="Just. 11.1">Justin 11, 12.3-4</bibl>).
      This is approximately the same as the true letter which Diodorus mentions here. Arrian locates
      at this point what appears elsewhere as the third letter. (3) After the departure from Egypt
      and before Gaugamela, and connected with Alexander's kindly treatment of Dareius's queen. This
      took the form of an embassy, probably (Diodorus, 17.54.1-6; <bibl n="Curt. 4.11">Curtius
      4.11</bibl>; <bibl n="Arr. An. 2.25">Arrian 2.25</bibl>), rather than a letter (<bibl n="Just. 11.12.7">Justin 11.12.7-16</bibl>); <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 29.4">Plut. Alexander
      29.4</bibl>). Dareius offered the hand of another daughter in marriage, cession of all
      territory west of the Euphrates, and a ransom for the royal women of 10,000 (Plutarch, Arrian)
      or 30,000 (Diodorus, Curtius, Justin) talents. An extensive correspondence, largely fictional,
      between Alexander and Dareius was in circulation in antiquity, and fragments of it occur in
      the papyri (cp. <title>PSI,</title> 12.<date value="1285">1285</date>). Much of if found a

     Alexander by diplomatic means and set to work on vast preparations for war. He re-equipped
     those who had lost their armour in the defeat and he enlisted others and assigned them to
     military units. He sent for the levies from the upper satrapies,<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">These are listed by <bibl n="Arr. An. 3.8.3">Arrian. 3.8.3-6</bibl>.</note>

     vessels with both light and heavy catapults<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Probably the

     no soldier missed his mark since the targets were exposed and unsuspecting. The missiles struck
     not only from the front but also from the back, as men were working on both sides of a rather
     narrow structure and no one could protect himself from those who shot from two directions.

     moved his engines out to the end of the causeway, and attacked the walls with his stone
     throwers, while he employed his light catapults against the men stationed along the

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="43">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The Tyrians had bronze workers and machinists, and contrived
     ingenious counter-measures.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">These "counter-measures" do not
      appear elsewhere in the sources, and Tarn (<title>Alexander the Great,</title> 2.120 f.) may be right in tracing them ultimately to a technical military manual. It is not impossible that
      they may be insertions of Diodorus himself and were lacking in his source; Diodorus was
      interested in curiosities. The wheels appear again below (chap. 45.3) in somewhat different
      form. They are otherwise unknown in antiquity (Tarn, p. 121). Apparently they were made to
      whirl in front of the men on the walls, giving them observation through the spokes but
      protecting them from missiles. The translation here offers difficulties; "wheels divided by
      thick diaphragms" or "with many barriers at close intervals." Possibly the diaphragms were
      screens between the wheels.</note> Against the projectiles from the catapults they made wheels
     with many spokes, and, setting these to rotate by a certain device, they destroyed some of the
     missiles and deflected others, and broke the force of all. They caught the balls from the stone
     throwers in soft and yielding materials and so weakened their force. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>While this attack was going on from the mole, the king sailed around the city with his
     whole fleet and inspected the walls, and made it clear that he was about to attack the city
     alike by land and sea. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The

     sailed up to these, sank them all, and so returned to his camp. Wanting to double the security
     of their walls, the Tyrians built a second one at a distance of five cubits within the first;
     this was ten cubits in thickness, and the passage between the walls they filled with stones and
     earth, <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>but Alexander lashed triremes together, mounted his
     various siege engines upon them, and overthrew the wall for the space of a plethron.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">The distances are seven and one-half feet, fifteen feet, and one hundred feet respectively.</note> Through this breach the Macedonians burst into the city,

     Tyrians had the present danger before their eyes and easily imagined what a disaster the actual
     capture of the city would be, so that they spent themselves so freely in the contest as to
     despise mortal danger. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>When the Macedonians moved up towers as
     high as the walls and in this way, extending bridges, boldly assaulted the battlements, the
     Tyrians fell back on the ingenuity of their engineers and applied many counter-measures to meet
     the assault. <milestone unit="section" n="8"/>They forged great tridents armed with barbs and
     struck with these at close range the assailants standing on the towers. These stuck in the
     shields, and as ropes were attached to the tridents, they could haul on the ropes and pull them
     in. <milestone unit="section" n="9"/>Their victims were faced with the alternative of releasing
     their arms and exposing their bodies to be wounded by the missiles which showered upon them, or
     clinging to their shields for shame and perishing in the fall from the lofty towers. <milestone unit="section" n="10"/>Other Tyrians cast fishing nets over those Macedonians who were
     fighting their way across the bridges and, making their hands helpless, pulled them off and
     tumbled them down from bridge to earth. </p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="44">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They thought of another ingenious device
     also to offset the Macedonian fighting qualities, by which they involved the bravest of the
     enemy in a horrible torment which could not be avoided. They fashioned shields of bronze and
     iron and, filling them with sand, roasted them continuously over a strong fire and made the
     sand red hot. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>By means of a certain apparatus they then
     scattered this over those Macedonians who were fighting most boldly and brought those within
     its range into utter misery. The sand sifted down under breastplates and shirts, and scorching
     the skin with the intense heat inflicted upon them irremediable disaster. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>They shrieked supplications like those under torture and there was no

     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At the same time, the
     Phoenicians poured down fire and flung javelins and stones, and by the volume of their missiles
     weakened the resolution of the attackers. They let down long poles or spars equipped with
     concave cutting edges and cut the ropes supporting the rams, thus rendering these instruments
     useless. With their fire-throwers they discharged huge red-hot masses of metal into the press
     of the enemy, and where so many men were packed together they did not miss their mark. With
     "crows" and "iron hands"<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Two forms of grappling irons.</note>
     they dragged over the edge many who were stationed behind the breastworks on the towers.
      <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>With many hands at work they kept all their engines busy and

<div2 type="chapter" n="45">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They caused extreme terror by all of this
     and the fury of their fighting became hardly resistible, but the Macedonians did not lose their
     boldness. As those in front kept falling, those behind moved up and were not deterred by the
     sufferings of their comrades. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Alexander mounted the
     stone-throwing catapults in proper places and made the walls rock with the boulders that they
     threw. With the dart-throwers on the wooden towers he kept up a constant fire of all kinds of
     missiles and terribly punished the defenders of the walls. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>In
     response, the Tyrians rigged marble wheels in front of the walls and causing these to rotate by
     some mechanism they shattered the flying missiles of the catapults and, deflecting them from
     their course, rendered their fire ineffective.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Cp. chap. 43.1 above, and note.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>In addition, they stitched up hides or pairs of skins and
     stuffed them with seaweed so as to receive the blows of the stones on these. As these were soft
     and yielding, the force of the flying stones was lessened. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>In
     sum, the Tyrians defended themselves strongly in all regards and showed themselves well
     provided with the means of defence. They were bold in face of their enemies, and left the
     shelter of the walls and their positions within the towers to push out onto the very bridges
     and match the courage of the Macedonians with their own valour. <milestone unit="section" n="6" />They grappled with the enemy and, fighting hand to hand, put up a stout battle for their

     a bridge across from the wooden tower to the city walls and crossing by it alone gained a

     Tyrians. Having as witness of his prowess the great army which had defeated the Persians, he
     ordered the Macedonians to follow him, and leading the way he slew some of those who came
     within reach with his spear, and others by a blow of his sabre. He knocked down still others
     with the rim of his shield, and put an end to the high confidence of the enemy. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Simultaneously in another part of the

<div2 type="chapter" n="55">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dareius heard Alexander's answer and gave up any hope of a diplomatic settlement. He
     continued drilling his troops each day and brought their battle discipline to a satisfactory
     state. He sent off one of his Friends, Mazaeus, with a picked body of men to guard the crossing
     of the river and to seize and hold the ford. Other troops he sent out to scorch the earth over
     which the enemy must come. He thought of using the bed of the Tigris as a defence against the
     advance of the Macedonians.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">According to <bibl n="Arr. An. 3.7.1">Arrian. 3.7.1</bibl>, Mazaeus was also supposed to defend the line of the

      said to owe its name to the "arrow-swift" character of its current (<bibl n="Curt. 4.9.16" >Curtius 4.9.16</bibl>).</note> and neglected to guard it. Instead he joined forces with
     those who were burning the countryside, and having wasted a great stretch of it, judged that it
     would be unusable by the enemy because of the lack of forage. <milestone unit="section" n="3" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Alexander, nevertheless, when he came to the crossing of the
     Tigris River, learned of the ford from some of the local natives, and transferred his army to
     the east bank. This was accomplished not only with difficulty but even at substantial risk.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>The depth of the water at the ford was above a man's breast
     and the force of the current swept away many who were crossing and deprived them of their
     footing, and as the water struck their shields, it bore many off their course and brought them
     into extreme danger. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>But Alexander contrived a defence against
     the violence of the river. He ordered all to lock arms with each other and to construct a sort
     of bridge out of the compact union of their persons.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Curt. 4.9.15">Curtius 4.9.15-21</bibl>. <bibl n="Arr. An. 3.7.5">Arrian. 3.7.5</bibl> merely remarks that Alexander crossed with difficulty.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Since the crossing had been hazardous and the Macedonians had
     had a narrow escape, Alexander rested the army that day, and on the following he deployed it
     and led it forward toward the enemy, then pitched camp not far from the Persians.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">The tradition of the date of the battle is confused. Eleven days
      before it (<bibl n="Plut. Alex. 31.4">Plut. Alexander 31.4</bibl>) there occurred in the Attic
      month Boedromion an eclipse of the moon which has been identified as that of 20/21 September
      331 B.C. (<bibl n="Curt. 4.10.2">Curtius 4.10.2</bibl>; <bibl n="Arr. An. 3.7.6">Arrian.
      3.7.6</bibl>). If the Attic month followed the moon in practice as it did in theory, this
      should have been on the 15th of Boedromion, and the battle fought on the 26th or 27th. Arrian,
      however, states that the battle took place in Pyanepsion (3.15.7), presumably the month of the
      eclipse also. <bibl n="Just. 11.13.1">Justin 11.13.1</bibl> simply says that the battle occurred "postero die" after the dismissal of Dareius's embassy.</note>

     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>At first his Friends were delighted thinking that the king
     would be all the keener for the battle for his thorough relaxation. As time passed, however,
     and sleep continued to possess him, Parmenion, the senior among the Friends, issued on his own
     responsibility the order to the troops to make ready for the battle, <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>and since his sleep continued, the Friends came to Alexander and at last succeeded in
     wakening him. As all expressed astonishment at the matter and pressed him to tell the reason
     for his unconcern, Alexander said that Dareius had freed him from all anxiety by assembling all
     his forces into one place. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Now in one day the decision would
     be reached on all issues, and they would be saved toils and dangers extending over a long
     period of time. Nevertheless, Alexander summoned his officers and encouraged them for the
     battle which they faced with suitable words, and then led out his army deployed for battle
     against the Persians, ordering the cavalry squadrons to ride ahead of the infantry phalanx.

     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The Persian king received their attack and fighting from a
     chariot hurled javelins against his opponents, and many supported him. As the kings approached
     each other, Alexander flung a javelin at Dareius and missed him, but struck the driver standing
     beside him and knocked him to the ground. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>A shout went up at
     this from the Persians around Dareius, and those at a greater distance thought that the king
     had fallen. They were the first to take to flight, and they were followed by those next to
     them, and steadily, little by little, the solid ranks of Dareius's guard disintegrated. As both
     flanks became exposed, the king himself was alarmed and retreated. The flight thus became
     general. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>Dust raised by the Persian cavalry rose to a height,
     and as Alexander's squadrons followed on their heels, because of their numbers and the
     thickness of the dust, it was impossible to tell in what direction Dareius was fleeing. The air
     was filled with the groans of the fallen, the din of the cavalry, and the constant sound of
     lashing of whips.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles"><bibl n="Curt. 4.15.3">Curtius

     <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this time Mazaeus, the
     commander of the Persian right wing, with the most and the best of the cavalry, was pressing
     hard on those opposing him, but Parmenion with the Thessalian cavalry and the rest of his
     forces put up a stout resistance. <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>For a time, fighting
     brilliantly, he even seemed to have the upper hand thanks to the fighting qualities of the
     Thessalians, but the weight and numbers of Mazaeus's command brought the Macedonian cavalry
     into difficulties. <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>A great slaughter took place, and
     despairing of withstanding the Persian power, Parmenion sent off some of his horsemen to
     Alexander, begging him to come to their support quickly. They carried out their orders with
     dispatch, but finding that Alexander was already in full pursuit at a great distance from the
     battlefield they returned without accomplishing their mission. <milestone unit="section" n="8" />Nevertheless Parmenion handled the Thessalian squadrons with the utmost skill and finally,
     killing many of the enemy, routed the Persians who were by now much disheartened by the
     withdrawal of Dareius.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">This incident is variously reported.
      According to Diodorus, Alexander did not receive Parmenion's plea for help, and Parmenion
      extricated himself without it. According to <bibl n="Curt. 4.15.6">Curtius 4.15.6-8;

      received the message but did not turn back, and Parmenion extricated himself without help.

<div2 type="chapter" n="61">
<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Dareius was a clever strategist. He took advantage of the great cloud of dust and did
     not withdraw to the rear like the other barbarians, but swinging in the opposite direction and
     covering his movement by the dust, got away safely himself and brought all his troops into
     villages which lay behind the Macedonian position.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Diodorus
      is confused as to Dareius's movements after the battle, perhaps from a confusion of the
      Greater and the Lesser Zab. He placed the battle at Arbela (chap. 53.4), which lies between
      the two rivers. If Dareius made his escape up the valley of the Greater Zab, to the north, he
      would have moved into the Macedonian rear. Actually, of course, the battle took place at
      Gaugamela, in the plain north of the Greater Zab, and Dareius fled to the south to Arbela,
      escaping up the valley of the Lesser Zab (<bibl n="Curt. 4.16.8">Curtius 4.16.8</bibl>; <bibl n="Arr. An. 3.15.4">Arrian. 3.15.4-5</bibl>). Diodorus's repeated reference to the dust cloud
      may be an attempt to cover what he felt to be an inherent improbability. It is true that,
      accidentally or intentionally, dust played a part in many ancient battles (cp. E. Echols,
       <title>Classical Journal,</title> 47 (<date value="1952">1952</date>), 285-288).</note>
     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Finally all the Persians had fled, and as the Macedonians kept

     was covered with dead. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>On the Persian side in the battle fell,

      that year (<bibl n="Arr. An. 3.25.4">Arrian. 3.25.4</bibl>). The small group of bodyguards
      proper had no commander, and it is quite uncertain when Hephaestion became a member. He is
      first so called in 325 (<bibl n="Arr. An. 6.28.4">Arrian. 6.28.4</bibl>) and is conspicuously
      not so called in 328 (<bibl n="Arr. An. 4.12.6">Arrian. 4.12.6</bibl>; but Arrian's usage is
      not consistent, cp. <bibl n="Arr. An. 4.24.10">Arrian. 4.24.10</bibl>). He was presumably not a bodyguard in 330 when he and Cleitus divided Philotas's command of the Companion Cavalry.

     an agreement and signed an undertaking to go to war. According to the capacity of the

     were a long way from reaching the footstool which belonged to the throne, he picked up
     Dareius's table and placed it under the dangling legs. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>This
     fitted, and the king was pleased by the aptness of the boy, but a eunuch standing by was
     troubled in his heart at this reminder of the changes of Fortune and wept. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>Alexander noticed him and asked, "What wrong have you seen that you are
     crying?" The eunuch replied, "Now I am your slave as formerly I was the slave of Dareius. I am
     by nature devoted to my masters and I was grieved at seeing what was most held in honour by
     your predecessor now become an ignoble piece of furniture." <milestone unit="section" n="6" /><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This answer reminded the king how great a change had come
     over the Persian kingdom. He saw that he had committed an act of arrogance quite the reverse of
     his gentleness to the captives, <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>and calling the page who had
     placed the table ordered him to remove it. Then Philotas, who was present, said, "But this was
     not insolence, for the action was not commanded by you; it occurred through the providence and
     design of a good spirit." So the king took this remark for an omen, and ordered the table to be
     left standing at the foot of the throne. </p>

     falling suddenly upon the massed ranks of the Macedonians killed many of them. Many of the

Alexander 46.1</bibl>, has been generally taken to mean that the queen of the Amazons visited Alexander north of the Jaxartes, in spite of the considerations that
      this was an odd place for Alexander to linger, and a very long way from the traditional home
      of the Amazons. This is certainly wrong. In sect. 44, Alexander was in Hyrcania, and lost and
      recovered his horse. In sect. 45, Alexander advanced into Parthia, and experimented with
      Median dress. In sect. 46, the Amazons came. Sect. 47 deals again with his Medizing, and sect.
      48 with the conspiracy exposed at Prophthasia in Drangiane. That is to say, Plutarch's
      narrative follows the actual route of Alexander, and the word "here" with which sect. 46
      begins must mean Parthia. The reference to Alexander's flying expedition across the Jaxartes
      at the end of sect. 45, which has misled scholars, is a parenthesis, illustrating Alexander's
      indifference to physical discomfort.</note> there came to him the queen of the Amazons named
     Thallestris, who ruled all the country between the rivers Phasis and Thermodon. She was
     remarkable for beauty and for bodily strength, and was admired by her countrywomen for bravery.
     She had left the bulk of her army on the frontier of Hyrcania<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles" >If we are to accept that Thallestris and her Amazons existed and had heard of Alexander,
      there is no insuperable difficulty in supposing that they proceeded from Thermodon on the
      Black Sea through the valleys of the Phasis and Cyrus Rivers and along the coast of the
      Caspian Sea. They would have passed through the recently subdued country of the Mardi and
      overtaken Alexander in Hyrcania (or Parthia, as Plutarch). Cp. <bibl n="Strab. 11.5.4">Strabo
       11.5.4</bibl>.</note> and had arrived with an escort of three hundred Amazons in full armour.
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>The king marvelled at the unexpected arrival and the dignity
     of the women. When he asked Thallestris why she had come, she replied that it was for the
     purpose of getting a child. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>He had shown himself the greatest
     of all men in his achievements, and she was superior to all women in strength and courage, so
     that presumably the offspring of such outstanding parents would surpass all other mortals in
     excellence. At this the king was delighted and granted her request and consorted with her for
     thirteen days, after which he honoured her with fine gifts and sent her home.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">This Amazon visit was a part of the Alexander tradition which
      Diodorus followed; cp. <bibl n="Curt. 6.5.24">Curtius 6.5.24-32</bibl>, and <bibl n="Just. 12.3.5">Justin 12.3.5-7</bibl>, both of whom give also the length of the queen's
      stay as thirteen days. (Justin explains, "ut est visa uterum implesse.") Arrian mentions
      Amazons only in other contexts (<bibl n="Arr. An. 4.15.4">Arrian. 4.15.4; 7.13.2-6</bibl>) and

      Ctesias (<bibl n="Plut. Art. 27">Plut. Artaxerxes 27</bibl>), but three hundred and sixty-five
      in the Alexander tradition (Curtius, loc. cit.). Modern scholars are not inclined to accept
      this statement as true, but Alexander's army notoriously did not travel light, and if he had
      placed his court under a Persian chamberlain, that official would doubtless have attempted to
      equip it in the proper fashion. Cp. the many anecdotes of Alexander's luxury in <bibl n="Ath. 12.537">Athenaeus 12.537-540</bibl> (and of Dareius, <bibl n="Ath. 13.557b">Athenaeus

       <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 59.3">Plut. Alexander 59.3-4</bibl>) agrees with this rather discreditable

      Alexander's reputation, or was Arrian's whitening it.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>Alexander, nevertheless, nursed an implacable hostility toward
     them; he held his forces in readiness, followed them, and falling upon them suddenly wrought a
     great slaughter. At first they kept shouting that this attack was in contravention of the
     treaty and they called to witness the gods against whom he had transgressed. Alexander shouted
     back that he had granted them the right to leave the city but not that of being friends of the
     Macedonians forever. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not
     daunted at the greatness of their danger, the mercenaries joined ranks and, forming a full
     circle, placed their children and women in the centre so that they might effectively face those
     who were attacking from all directions. Filled with desperate courage and fighting stoutly with
     native toughness and the experience of previous contests, they were opposed by Macedonians
     anxious not to show themselves inferior to barbarians in fighting ability, so that the battle
     was a scene of horror. <milestone unit="section" n="4"/>They fought hand to hand, and as the
     contestants engaged each other every form of death and wounds was to be seen. The Macedonians
     thrust with their long spears through the light shields of the mercenaries and pressed the iron
     points on into their lungs, while they in turn flung their javelins into the close ranks of
     their enemies and could not miss the mark, so near was the target. <milestone unit="section" n="5"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As many were wounded and not a few killed, the women
     caught up the weapons of the fallen and fought beside their men, since the acuteness of the
     danger and the fierceness of the action forced them to be brave beyond their nature. Some of
     them, clad in armour, sheltered behind the same shields as their husbands, while others rushed
     in without armour, grasped the opposing shields, and hindered their use by the enemy.
      <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>Finally, fighting women and all, they were overborne by
     numbers and cut down, winning a glorious death in preference to basely saving their lives at
     any cost. Alexander removed the feeble and unarmed together with the surviving women to another
     place, and put the cavalry in charge of them. </p>

     rock ; since there was no other egress, he had thus enclosed the defenders in a hopeless siege.
     Then he put many hands to work filling up the chasm at the foot of the rock, drew near to it,
     and mounted a vigorous attack, assaulting continuously for seven days and seven nights with

     finished, however, and the dart-throwing catapults and other engines were emplaced, and the
     king also made it evident that he would not break off the siege, the Indians were alarmed, and
     Alexander, craftily anticipating what would happen, removed the guard which had been left in
     the path, allowing those who wished to withdraw from the rock. In fear of the Macedonian

     height and strength. Some of the Macedonians were trodden under foot, armour and all, by the

      of both army and fleet (E. Badian, <title>Classical Quarterly,</title> 52 (<date value="1958" >1958</date>), 152). But both Philip (Book 16.87.1) and Alexander (chap. 72.5) were fond of the comus in general.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>After this celebration was

     spread of his righteous indignation against his offending subordinates, many of the generals
     recalled acts of insolence or illegality which they had performed and became alarmed. Some who
     had mercenary troops revolted against the king's authority, and others got together sums of
     money and fled. <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>As news of this was brought to the king, he
     wrote to all his generals and satraps in Asia, ordering them, as soon as they had read his

     commander the Athenian Leosthenes, who was a man of unusually brilliant mind, and thoroughtly
     opposed to the cause of Alexander. He conferred secretly with the council at Athens and was
     granted fifty talents to pay the troops and a stock of weapons sufficient to meet pressing
     needs. He sent off an embassy to the Aetolians, who were unfriendly to the king, looking to the
     establishment of an alliance with them, and otherwise made every preparation for war.
      <milestone unit="section" n="4"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So Leosthenes was occupied
     with such matters, being in no doubt about the seriousness of the proposed conflict, but

     preparations for the burial of Hephaestion. He showed such zeal about the funeral that it not
     only surpassed all those previously celebrated on earth but also left no possibility for
     anything greater in later ages. He had loved Hephaestion most of the group of Friends who were
     thought to have been high in his affections, and after his death showed him superlative honour.
     In his lifetime, he had preferred him to all, although Craterus had a rival claim to his love;
      <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>so, for example, that when one of the companions said that
     Craterus was loved no less than Hephaestion, Alexander had answered that Craterus was
     king-loving, but Hephaestion was Alexander-loving.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">That is,
      Craterus loved Alexander as the king, Hephaestion loved Alexander for himself. On the

     had bowed to Hephaestion supposing him to be the king and was distressed when this was called

     Hephaestion enjoyed so much power and freedom of speech based on this friendship that when
     Olympias was estranged from him because of jealousy and wrote sharp criticisms and threats
     against him in her letters, he felt strong enough to answer her reproachfully and ended his
     letter as follows: "Stop quarrelling with us and do not be angry or menacing. If you persist,
      we<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Hephaestion's usage here suggests the <emph>pluralis

     he proclaimed to all the peoples of Asia that they should sedulously quench what the Persians
     call the sacred fire, until such time as the funeral should be ended. This was the custom of
     the Persians when their kings died, <milestone unit="section" n="5"/>and people thought that
     the order was an ill omen, and that heaven was foretelling the king's own death. There were

     and an army of workmen and tore down the city wall to a distance of ten furlongs. He collected
     the baked tiles and levelled off the place which was to receive the pyre, and then constructed
     this square in shape, each side being a furlong in length. <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>He
     divided up the area into thirty compartments and laying out the roofs upon the trunks of palm
     trees wrought the whole structure into a square shape.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">The brevity of Diodorus's account leaves the meaning a little obscure. It is possible that the

      section of the pyre.</note> Then he decorated all the exterior walls. Upon the foundation
     course were golden prows of quinqueremes in close order, two hundred and forty in all. Upon the
     catheads each carried two kneeling archers four cubits in height, and (on the deck) armed male

      and he received sacrifice as a <foreign lang="greek">pa/redros kai\ a)leci/kakos

      tradition was various. <bibl n="Just. 12.12.12">Justin 12.12.12</bibl> reports, like Diodorus,
      that Alexander ordered that Hephaestion was to be worshipped "ut deum." <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 72.2" >Plut. Alexander 72.2</bibl> states that Ammon recommended that he should be honoured as a

      first refusing to allow him divine worship (<bibl n="Arr. An. 7.14.7">Arrian. 7.14.7</bibl>).
      The term <foreign lang="greek">pa/redros</foreign> is odd: elsewhere it seems to mean a priest

     Alexander was delighted that the god had ratified his own opinion, was himself the first to
     perform the sacrifice, and entertained everybody handsomely. The sacrifice consisted of ten

      without any 29th, and Alexander died about sundown; this was the 10th of June), and it has
      been argued above that the assassination of Philip and the accession of Alexander must have
      taken place in the same month (Book 16.94.3, note). This would give Alexander thirteen years
      of reign, and this figure is actually given by the Oxyrhynchus Chronologer (<title>P.
      Oxy.</title> 1.12. v. 31-32). Since Daesius was the eighth Macedonian month, the "seven
      months" of Diodorus and the "eight months" of <bibl n="Arr. An. 7.28.1">Arrian. 7.28.1</bibl>

<p><milestone unit="section" n="1"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They say that Antipater, who had been left by Alexander as viceroy in Europe, was at
     variance with the king's mother Olympias. At first he did not take her seriously because
     Alexander did not heed her complaints against him, but later, as their enmity kept growing and
     the king showed an anxiety to gratify his mother in everything out of piety, Antipater gave
     many indications of his disaffection. This was bad enough, but the murder of Parmenion and
     Philotas struck terror into Antipater as into all of Alexander's Friends, so by the hand of his
     own son, who was the king's wine-pourer, he administered poison to the king.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Justin 12.14; <bibl n="Plut. Alex. 77.1">Plut. Alexander
      77.1-3</bibl>; <bibl n="Arr. An. 7.27">Arrian 7.27</bibl>. The son's name was Iollas, but Justin associated with him his brothers Philip and Casander, the later king. Curtius does not
      mention this tradition.</note> 
     <milestone unit="section" n="2"/>After Alexander's death, Antipater held the supreme authority
     in Europe and then his son Casander took over the kingdom, so that many historians did not dare
     write about the drug. Casander, however, is plainly disclosed by his own actions as a bitter
     enemy to Alexander's policies. He murdered Olympias and threw out her body without burial, and
     with great enthusiasm restored Thebes, which had been destroyed by Alexander.<note anchored="yes" resp="Welles">Book 19.49-51; 53.</note>

     Sisyngambris, Dareius's mother, mourned his passing and her own bereavement, and coming to the
