<stage>Enter the Chorus of Trojan guards.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Go to Hector's couch. Which of you squires that tend the prince, or you armor-clad men, is awake? He ought to receive fresh tidings <milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/> from the warriors who were set to guard the assembled army during the fourth watch of the night. <stage>Calls to Hector in the tent.</stage> Lift up your head! Prop your arm beneath it! Unseal that fierce eye from its repose; quit your lowly couch of scattered leaves, <milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/> Hector! It is time to hearken.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>Who is this? Is it a friend who calls? Who are you? Your password? Speak! Who are these who come near my couch in the night? You must tell me.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/> Sentinels of the army.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>Why this tumultuous haste?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Be of good courage.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>I am. Is there some midnight ambush?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>&lsqb;Chorus</speaker>
<p>No</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector.&rsqb;</speaker>
<p>Why do you desert your post and rouse the army, unless you have some tidings of the night? <milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/> Are you not aware how near the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army we take our night's repose clad in all our armor?</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="23">
<milestone unit="strophe"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>To arms! Hector, seek your allies' sleeping camp!<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/> Stir them up to wield the spear! Awake them!</p>
<p>Despatch a friend to your own company, bridle the horses.</p>
<p>Who will go to the son of Panthus? Who to Europa's son, captain of the Lycian band?</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/> Where are they who should inspect the victims?</p>
<p>Where are the leaders of the light-armed troops and the Phrygian archers?</p>
<p>String your horn-tipped bows!</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="34">
<milestone unit="anapests"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>Your tidings inspire now fear, <milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/> now confidence; nothing is plainly set forth. Can it be that you are smitten with wild fear by Pan, the son of Cronion? &lsqb;Leaving your watch you rouse the army.&rsqb; What does your noisy summons mean? What tidings can I say you bring? Your words are many, <milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/> but no plain statement have you made.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="41">
<milestone unit="antistrophe"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>The long night through, Hector, the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army has kindled fires, and bright with torches shines the anchored fleet. To Agamemnon's tent the whole army <milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/> move clamorously by night, eager for fresh orders; for never before has the sea-faring company been so alarmed. And so I was suspicious of what might happen <milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/> and came to tell you, so that you may have no cause to blame me hereafter.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="52">

<milestone unit="episode"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>In good season you come, although your tidings are full of terror; for those men are bent on giving me the slip and stealing away from this land in their ships by night; <milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/> their midnight signalling pleases me. Ah! Fortune, to rob me in my hour of triumph, a lion of his prey, before this spear had made an end of the whole <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army in one line! Yes, if the sun's bright lamp had not withheld <milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/> his light, I would not have stayed my victor's spear, before I had fired their ships and made my way from tent to tent, drenching this hand in Achaean blood. I was eager to make a night attack and take advantage of the stroke of luck sent by heaven; <milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/> but those wise seers of mine, who have heaven's will so pat, persuaded me to wait for dawn, and then leave not one Achaean in the land. But those others do not await the counsels of my soothsayers; darkness turns runaways to heroes. <milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/> But we must now without delay pass this word to the army to take up arms and cease from slumber, so that many an Achaean, as he leaps aboard his ship, shall be smitten through the back and sprinkle the ladders with blood, and others shall be fast bound with cords <milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/> and learn to till our Phrygian fields.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<p>You hasten, Hector, before you know clearly what is happening; for we do not know for certain whether the men are flying.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>What other reason did the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army have to kindle fires?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<p>I do not know; I am very suspicious.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/> If you fear this, be sure there's nothing you would not fear.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<p>Never before did the enemy kindle such a blaze.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>No, nor ever before did they suffer such shameful defeat and rout.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<p>This you have achieved; look now to what remains to do.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>A simple tale, to arm against the enemy.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="85">
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/> Look! Here comes Aeneas, in great haste too, with news to tell his friends.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aeneas</speaker>
<p>Hector, why have the sentinels in terror made their way through the army at night to your couch to hold a midnight conclave and disturb the army?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/> Encase yourself in your armor, Aeneas.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aeneas</speaker>
<p>What is it? Have tidings come of some secret stratagem set on foot during the night by the foe?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>The men are flying, and going aboard their ships.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aeneas</speaker>
<p>What sure proof can you give of this?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/> The whole night they are kindling blazing torches; I think they will not wait for tomorrow, but after lighting brands upon their ships' decks will leave this land and fly to their homes.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aeneas</speaker>
<p>And you, why do you gird on your sword?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/> With my spear I will stop them even as they fly and leap aboard their ships, and my hand shall be heavy upon them; for it is shameful in us, yes, and cowardly as well as shameful, when the god gives them into our hands, to let our foes escape without battle, after all the injuries they have done us.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aeneas</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/> Would you were as sage as you are bold! But, to be sure, among mortals the same man is not dowered by nature with universal knowledge; each has his special gift appointed him, yours is battle, another's is sage counsel. You are excited to hear that the Achaeans are <milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/> lighting blazing torches, and you would lead on our troops across the ditches in the calm still night. Now after crossing the deep yawning trench, supposing you should find the enemy are not flying from the land, but are awaiting your onset, <milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/> beware lest you suffer defeat and so never reach this city again; for how will you pass the palisades in a rout? And how shall your charioteers cross the bridges without dashing the axles of their cars to pieces? And, if victorious, you have next the son of Peleus to engage; <milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/> he will never allow you to cast the firebrand on the fleet or harry the Achaeans, as you believe. No, for that man is fierce as fire, a very tower of might. Let us rather then leave our men to sleep calmly under arms after the weariness of battle, <milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/> while we send, as I advise, whoever will volunteer to spy upon the enemy; and if they really are preparing to fly, let us arise and fall upon the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army, but if this signalling is a trap to catch us, we shall discover from the spy the enemy's designs <milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/> and take counsel; such is my advice, lord.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="131">
<milestone unit="strophe"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>It pleases me well; so change your mind and adopt this counsel. I do not love hazardous commands in generals. What is better than for a swift-footed spy to approach the ships <milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/> and learn why our foes are lighting fires in front of their naval station?</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="137">
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>Since this finds favor with you all, prevail. <stage>To Aeneas.</stage> Go and calm the allies; perhaps the army hearing of our midnight council is disturbed. <milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/> Mine shall it be to send one forth to spy upon the foe. And if I discover any plot among them, you shall fully hear of it and be present to learn the report; but in case they are starting off in flight, with eager ear await the trumpet's call, <milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/> for then I will not stay, but will this very night engage the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army there where their ships are hauled up.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Aeneas</speaker>
<p>Send out the spy at once; there's safety in your counsels now. And you shall find me steadfast at your side, whenever occasion calls.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>What Trojan of those present in council <milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/> volunteers to go and spy on the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> fleet? Who will be that patriot? Who says yes? I myself cannot at every point serve my country and my friends in arms.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p>I for my country will gladly run this risk <milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/> and go to spy on the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> fleet, and when I have learned fully all that the Achaeans plot I will return. I undertake this toil on these conditions.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>True to his name indeed, his country's friend is Dolon. Your father's house was famed before, <milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/> but now you have made it doubly so.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p>So must I toil, but for my pains I should receive fitting wages. For set a reward on any deed, and it breeds a double favor.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="164">
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>Yes, that is fair; I cannot dispute it. <milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/> Name your wage, except for my sovereignty.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p>I do not covet your toilsome sovereignty.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>Well then, marry a daughter of Priam and become my brother-in-law.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p>No, I do not wish to marry among those beyond my station.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>There's gold, if this you'll claim as your prize.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/> I have it in my home; I lack no sustenance.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>What then is your desire of all that <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> stores within her?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p>Promise me my gift when you conquer the Achaeans.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>I will give it to you; ask anything except the captains of the fleet.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p>Slay them; I do not ask you to keep your hand off Menelaus.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/> Is it the son of Oileus you would ask me for?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p>Hands that are well brought up are worthless at farming.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>Whom then of the Achaeans will you have alive to hold to ransom?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p>I told you before, my house is stored with gold.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>Why then, you shall come and with your own hands choose out some spoil.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/> Nail up the spoils for the gods on their temples.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>Then what greater prize than these will you ask me for?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p>Achilles' horses. The prize must be worth the toil when one stakes one's life on Fortune's dice.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hector</speaker>
<p>Ah! but your desires clash with mine about those horses; <milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/> for they are immortal and born from immortals, who bear the son of Peleus on his headlong course. Poseidon, lord of the ocean, broke them and gave them to Peleus, so runs the legend. Yet, for I urged you on, I will not break my word; I will give to you <milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/> Achilles' team, a fair possession for your house.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p>I thank you; in receiving then, I assert that I am taking a fairer gift than any other Phrygian for my bravery. Yet you should not be envious; you have other things to gladden your heart, in your kingship over this land.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="195">
<milestone unit="antistrophe"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/> Great the enterprise, and great the reward you design to receive. Happy, yes, happy will you be, if you succeed; fair the fame your toil shall win. Yet it is a great thing to become the brother-in-law of princes. On the gods' decrees let Justice keep her eye! <milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/> what man can give you have, it seems, in full.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="201">
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p>I will set forth; but going within my house I will clothe myself in fitting attire, and then I will hasten to the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> fleet.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<p>Why, what dress in place of this will you assume?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/> One that fits my task and furtive steps.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<p>One should ever learn wisdom from the wise; tell me, what will be your equipment?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p>I will fasten a wolf-skin about my back, and over my head put the brute's gaping jaws; <milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/> then fitting its fore-feet to ny hands and its hind-feet to my legs, I will go on all-fours in imitation of a wolf's gait to puzzle the enemy, when I approach their trenches and barriers round the ships. Rut whenever I come to a deserted spot, <milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/> I will walk on two feet; such is the ruse I have decided on.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus Leader</speaker>
<p>May Hermes, <placeName key="tgn,1049816">Maia</placeName>'s child, escort you safely there and back, prince of tricksters as he is! You know what you have to do; good luck is all you need now.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Dolon</speaker>
<p>I shall return in safety, and bring to you the head of Odysseus <milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/> when I have slain him, or the son of Tydeus, and with this clear proof before you you shall assert that Dolon went to the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> fleet; for, before the dawn, I will come back home with bloodstained hand.<stage>Exit Dolon.</stage></p></sp></div1>

<p>I cannot say for certain, though I might guess. <milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/> It is no idle task for an army to make an invasion by night, hearing that the plains are packed with foemen's troops. But he frightened us rustic shepherds who dwell along the slopes of Ida, the earliest settlement in the land, as he came by night through the wood full of wild beasts. <milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/> On surged the tide of Thracian warriors with loud shouts; at this in wild amazement we drove our flocks unto the heights, for fear that some Argives were coming to plunder and harry your steading, till we caught the sound of voices <milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/> other than Greek and ceased from our alarm.  Then I went and questioned in the Thracian tongue those who were reconnoitring the road for their lord, who it was that lead them, and whose son he was called, that came to the city to help the sons of Priam.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/> And when I had heard all I wished to learn, I stood still; and I see Rhesus mounted like a god upon his Thracian chariot. Of gold was the yoke that linked the necks of his horses brighter than the snow; <milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/> and on his shoulders flashed his shield with figures welded in gold; while a gorgon of bronze like that on the aegis of the goddess was bound upon the front of his horses, ringing out its note of fear with many a bell. The number of his army you could not reckon <milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/> to an exact sum, for it was beyond one's comprehension; many knights, many ranks of targeteers, many archers, a great crowd of light-armed troops, arrayed in Thracian garb, to bear them company. Such the man who comes to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s assistance, <milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/> whom the son of Peleus will never escape, either if he tries to escape or if he meets him spear to spear.</p></sp>

<p>Son of that tuneful mother, one of the Muses, and of Thracian Strymon's river, I love to speak <milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/> plain truth always; nature did not give me a double tongue. Long, long ago should you have come and shared the labors of this land, and not allowed <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> for any help of yours to fall overthrown by hostile <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> spears. You can not say it was any want of invitation <milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/> that kept you from coming with your help to visit us. What herald or embassy from <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName> did not come to you, urgently requiring your aid for our city? What sumptuous presents did we not send to you? But you, brother barbarian though you were, <milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line"/> pledged away to Hellenes us your barbarian brothers, for all the help you gave. Yet it was I with this arm that raised you from your paltry princedom to high lordship over <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, when I fell upon the Thracian chieftains face to face around Pangaeum in Paeonia's land <milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/> and broke their serried ranks, and gave their people up to you enslaved; but you have trampled on this great favor done you, and come with laggard step to give your aid when friends are in distress. While they, whom no natural tie of kin constrains, have long been here, and some are dead and in their graves <milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/> beneath the heaped-up cairn, no mean proof of loyalty to the city; and others in arms and mounted on their chariots, with steadfast soul endure the icy blast and parching heat of the sun, not pledging one another on couches, as you do, in long deep draughts. <milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line"/> This is the charge I bring against you and utter to your face, that you may know how frank is Hector's tongue.</p></sp></div1>

<p>I too am just the same; straight to the point I cut my way; no shuffling nature is mine. My heart was wrung with sorer anguish than yours <milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/> at my absence from this land; I fumed and chafed, but Scythian people, whose borders march with mine, made war on me on the very eve of my departure for <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>; I had reached the strand of the Euxine sea, there to transport my Thracian army. <milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/> Then my spear poured out over <placeName key="tgn,6005315">Scythia</placeName>'s land great drops of bloody rain, and <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> too shared in the mingled slaughter. This then was what chanced to keep me from coming to the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and joining your standard. But as soon as I had conquered these and taken their children as hostages <milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line"/> and appointed the yearly tribute they should pay my house, I have come, sailing across the sea's mouth, and on foot traversing the other borders of your land&mdash;not as you in your jeers at those carousals of my countrymen hint, nor sleeping soft in gilded palaces, <milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/> but amid the frozen hurricanes that vex the Thracian sea and the Paeonian shores, learning as I lay awake what suffering is, this soldier's cloak my only wrap. True my coming has tarried, but yet I am in time; ten years already have you been at the fray, <milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/> and accomplished nothing yet; day in, day out, you fall, throwing the dice of war with Argives. But the light of one day will be enough for me to sack those towers and fall upon their anchored fleet and slay the Achaeans; and on the next day I will go <milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/> home from <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> , at one stroke ending all your toil.

<p>Aias and the son of Tydeus are, I take it, in no way his inferiors; there is Odysseus, a wheedling rascal, but bold enough indeed, <milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line"/> and of all men he has wrought most outrage on this country. For he came by night to Athena's shrine and stole her image and took it to the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> ships; next he came inside our battlements, clad as a vagrant in a beggar's garb, and loudly did he curse <milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line"/> the Argives, sent as a spy to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>; and then went out again, when he had slain the sentinels and warders at the gate.

<p>A sorry deed it was, and more than that a deed most shameful; yes, it is an evil doubly bad; to die with glory, if die one must, is bitterness enough I think to him who dies&mdash;how not?&mdash; <milestone ed="p" n="760" unit="line"/> though to the living it may add dignity and honor for their house. But we have died foolishly and without glory. No sooner had great Hector given us our quarters and told us the password than we lay down to sleep upon the ground, overcome by weariness. No guard our army set <milestone ed="p" n="765" unit="line"/> to watch by night, nor were our arms set in array, nor were the whips hung ready on the horses' yokes, for our prince was told that you were masters now, and had encamped hard on their ships; so carelessly we threw ourselves down to sleep. <milestone ed="p" n="770" unit="line"/> Now I with thoughtful mind awoke from my slumber, and with ungrudging hand measured out the horses' feed, expecting to harness them at dawn for the fray; through the thick gloom two men I see roaming around our army. But when I roused myself <milestone ed="p" n="775" unit="line"/> they crouched low and were gone once more; and I called out to them to keep away from the army, for I thought they might be thieves from our allies. Nothing from them, so I too said no more, but came back to my couch and slept again.

Up I sprang to defend the horses from the brutes, for the horror of the night scared me. Then as I raised my head I heard the groans of dying men, <milestone ed="p" n="790" unit="line"/> and a warm stream of new-shed blood bespattered me, beside my murdered master as he died. To my feet I start, but all unarmed; and as I peer about and grope to find my sword, a stalwart hand from somewhere near struck me with a sword <milestone ed="p" n="795" unit="line"/> beneath the ribs. I felt the sword-thrust, the deep gaping wound it gave me. Down on my face I fell, while they fled clean away with horses and chariot. Oh, oh! Tortured with pain, too weak to stand, a piteous object! <milestone ed="p" n="800" unit="line"/> I know what happened, for I saw it; but how the victims met their death I cannot say, nor at whose hand.

<p>You who have caused this great calamity, how did the enemy's spies come <milestone ed="p" n="810" unit="line"/> without your knowledge, to your shame, and spread destruction through the army, and you did not drive them away either as they entered or left the camp? Who but you shall pay the penalty for this? You, I say, were here to guard the army. But they are gone without a wound, with many a scoff <milestone ed="p" n="815" unit="line"/> at Phrygian cowardice, and at me their leader.

<p>Why threaten these?

They came, they are dead; Paris found more decent means to shame the rights of hospitality than you, who killed your allies. No, do not tell me some <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> came and slaughtered us. Who could have passed the Trojan lines <milestone ed="p" n="845" unit="line"/> and come against us without detection? You and your Phrygian troops were camped in front of us. Who was wounded, who was slain among your friends, when that foe you speak of came? It was we, far off, were wounded, while some have met a sterner <milestone ed="p" n="850" unit="line"/> fate and said farewell to the sunlight. Briefly, then, I blame no Achaean. For what enemy could have come and found the lowly bed of Rhesus in the dark, unless some god were guiding the murderers' steps?

Never may such longing <milestone ed="p" n="860" unit="line"/> for horses seize me that I should slay my friends! This is the work of Odysseus;  for who of all the Argives but he would have devised or carried out such a deed?

Yes, for it was your pride, your own undoing, and your rivalry with the Muses that made me mother of this poor son of mine. For as I crossed the river's streams <milestone ed="p" n="920" unit="line"/> I came too near to Strymon's fruitful couch, that day we Muses came to the brow of Mount Pangaeus with its soil of gold, furnished forth with all our music for one great trial of minstrel skill with that clever Thracian bard; and we blinded him, <milestone ed="p" n="925" unit="line"/> Thamyris, the man who often reviled our craft.</p>
<p>And then, when I gave birth to you, because I felt shame of my sisters and my virginity, I sent you to the swirling stream of your father, the river; and Strymon did not entrust your nurture to mortal hands, but to the fountain nymphs. <milestone ed="p" n="930" unit="line"/> There you were reared most fairly by the maiden nymphs, and you ruled over <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, a leader among men, my child.

And yet we sister Muses do special honor to your city, your land we chiefly haunt; and those dark mysteries with their torch processions were revealed by Orpheus, cousin of this dead man <milestone ed="p" n="945" unit="line"/> whom you have slain.
