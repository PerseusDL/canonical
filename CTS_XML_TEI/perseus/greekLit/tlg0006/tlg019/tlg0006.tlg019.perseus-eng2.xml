		<head>INTRODUCTION</head>

		<milestone ed="p" unit="card" n="0" />
		<p>THIS short play needs rather a long introduction. It has
		    had the bad fortune to become a literary problem, and
		    almost all its few readers are so much occupied with
		    the question whether it can be the work of Euripides
		    -and if not his, whose?-that they seldom allow themselves to take it on its merits as a stirring and adventurous piece, not particularly profound or subtle,
		    but always full of movement and life and possessing at
		    least one or two scenes of great and penetrating
		    beauty.</p>
		<p>The outlines of the Rhesus Question are these.
		    The Rhesus appears in the MSS. of Euripides; we
		    know from the Athenian Didascaliae, or Records of
		    Performances, that Euripides wrote a play of the
		    name; some passages in it are quoted by early
		    Alexandrian writers as from "the Rhesus of Euripides;" no passage is quoted under any other name.
		    This seems about as strong as external evidence
		    need be. Yet the ancient introduction to the play
		    mentions that "some think the play spurious," and
		    expresses the odd opinion that " it suggests rather the
		    Sophoclean style."  Further, it tells us that, besides
		    the present opening scene, there were extant two different prologues, one of which was "quite prosy and
		    perhaps concocted by the actors." This seems to show
		    that the Alexandrian scholars who tried for the first
		    time to collect the complete works of Euripides, some
		    two centuries after his death, found this play current
		    as " Euripides' Rhesus," but that it was credited with
		    three different openings and that its style was felt to
		    be somehow peculiar.</p>
		<p>The peculiarity of style is incontestable.  It does
		    not to our judgment suggest Sophocles. It suggests a
		    young man imitating Aeschylus, and it has a great
		    number of Euripidean expressions.    Hermann, who
		    collected what he took to be "imitations" of early
		    poets in the Rhesus, noted only 25 of Sophocles, 38
		    of Aeschylus, and 84 of Euripides.</p>
		<p>Is it, then, the work of a somewhat imitative fourth-century poet, naturally influenced by his great forerunners?  Hardly: because, with a few   exceptions,
		    the verse and diction of the Rhesus, are markedly early
		    in character, the verse severe and smooth, the diction
		    direct and rather grandiose, the choral lyrics strictly
		    relevant. In Euripides' later years Drama was moving
		    rapidly away from all these things and, as far as we
		    can judge, continued so moving after his death. If
		    the Rhesus is a post-classical play it can hardly be
		    honest fourth-century work: it must be deliberately
		    archaistic, a product of the Alexandrian spirit if not
		    actually of the Alexandrian age. This is what Hermann believed.   But unfortunately it is not a bit
		    more like our fragments of Alexandrian tragedy than
		    it is like the Medea; and, further, if it is an Alexandrian pseudo-classic tragedy, how did it succeed in
		    deceiving the Alexandrian critics, detectives specially
		    trained for this kind of work?</p>
		<p>Let us try quite a different hypothesis, and begin by
		    accepting the external evidence as true. The famous
		    critic, Crates, of the second century B.C., happens to
		    mention-in excuse of what he took to be a slip in the
		    poet's astronomy-that the Rhesus of Euripides was
		    a youthful work. Now the earliest dated tragedy of
		    Euripides that we possess is the Alcestis, B.C. <date value="-438">438</date>,
		    written when he was about forty-six. His style
		    may well have been considerably different fifteen or
		    twenty years earlier, and must certainly have been
		    much under the influence of Aeschylus.   So far, so
		    good. Then what of the other difficulties, the three
		    different opening scenes and the few passages of late
		    phrasing or technique?    One obvious explanation
		    suits both.   The three different openings pretty
		    clearly imply that the play was reproduced more than
		    once after the poet's death and adapted by the producer
		    for each occasion. This happened to many plays of
		    Euripides, and in one case we even know the name of
		    the producer; he was Euripides the Younger, son of
		    the poet. Among other things we have reason to believe that he wrote some parts of the Iphigenia in
		    <placeName key="tgn,5004252">Aulis</placeName>. And in this connexion we can hardly help
		    noticing that the Iphigenia in <placeName key="tgn,5004252">Aulis</placeName>, like the Rhesus
		    and like no other Greek tragedy, has two alternative
		    openings, one a dull prologue and one a lyrical scene
		    in anapaests under the stars. The general style of the
		    two plays is utterly different; the Iphigenia is most
		    typically late Euripidean; but one would not be surprised to learn that they had both passed at some time
		    through the same revising hand.</p>
		<p>This hypothesis seems to work well. But one
		    difficulty remains.</p>
		<p>We have so far gone on the supposition that
		    Euripides at twenty-five or thirty perhaps wrote very
		    differently from Euripides at forty-six, and that the
		    manner we call Euripidean is only the manner of
		    his later life. There is nothing improbable in this
		    suggestion, but have we any evidence? Yes, a very
		    little, and unfortunately it does not say what we
		    want. We have some fragments-twenty lines altogether-preserved   from  the Peliades, with   which
		    Euripides won his first victory in the year 455, seventeen years before the Alcestis, and as far as they go
		    they are just in his ordinary manner-a good deal
		    more so, in fact, than much of the Alcestis is. Let us
		    face this difficulty.</p>
		<p>The ordinary style of Euripides is full, flexible,
		    lucid, antithetic, studiously simple in vocabulary and
		    charged with philosophic reflection. If we look in his
		    extant remains for any trace of a style, like that of
		    the Rhesus, which is comparatively terse, rich,
		    romantic, not shrinking from rare words and strong
		    colour and generally untinged by philosophy, we shall
		    find the nearest approach to it in the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>. Next to
		    the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> I am not sure what play would come, but the
		    Alcestis would not be far off.        It has especially
		    several Epic forms which cannot be paralleled in
		    tragedy. Now the conjunction of these two plays with
		    the Rhesus is significant. The three seem to be three
		    earliest of the extant plays; they are also- if we
		    count the Heraclidae as mutilated-the three shortest.
		    But, what is more important, the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> is not a
		    tragedy but a satyr-play, and the Alcestis is a tragedy
		    of a special sort, written to take the place of a
		    satyr-play. It is a tragedy with some half grotesque
		    figures and a fantastic atmosphere.</p>
		<p>This is no place for a close analysis of the diction of
		    the various works of Euripides; but taking one rough
		    test, just for what it is worth, we may try to count
		    the number of words in each play which are not found
		    elsewhere in Euripides. The Medea, a central sort of
		    play, has in its <date value="1419">1419</date> lines 103 such words. The
		    Alcestis, with <date value="1163">1163</date> lines, has 122; the Rhesus, with
		    less than 1000 lines, has 177; the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, with only
		    701 lines, has actually 220. This calculation is
		    doubtless slightly inexact: in any case it is worth
		    very little until it is carefully analysed. But on the
		    whole it accords with my general impression that the
		    Rhesus in its variation from the Euripidean norm goes
		    further than the Alcestis, and not so far as the
		    <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, and goes in very much the same direction. I
		    feel in the Rhesus a good deal of that curious
		    atmosphere, not exactly comic, but wild and
		    extravagant, which the Greeks felt to be suited to the
		    Satyr horde; the atmosphere normally breathed by the
		    one-eyed Giant of the cavern on volcanic <placeName key="tgn,7003867">Aetna</placeName>, or the
		    drunken and garlanded Heracles who wrestles with Death
		    and cracks his ribs for him at midnight among the
		    tombs.  The whole scene and setting of the Rhesus; the
		    man-wolf crawling away into the darkness and his two
		    enemies presently crawling in out of the same darkness
		    with his bloody spoils; the divine Thracian king with
		    his round targe that shines by night and his horses
		    whiter than the snow; the panic of the watch, the
		    vaunting of the doomed chieftain, the goddess disguised
		    as another goddess, the thrilling half-farcical scene
		    where the spy Odysseus is actually caught and befools
		    his captors: these things are not of course comic, like
		    some incidents in the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>. They belong to tragedy;
		    but they are near the outside limit of the tragic
		    convention, and would perhaps be most at home in a
		    pro-satyric tragedy like the Alcestis.</p>
		<p>In the upshot I see no adequate reason for rejecting
		    the external evidence which makes this play a work of
		    Euripides, if we suppose it to be an early pro-satyric
		    play which was produced again after the poet's death
		    by Euripides the Younger or some contemporary.
		    Most scholars, however, prefer to think it simply an
		    archaistic work of the fourth century.</p>
		<p>On this theory the Alexandrians when looking for
		    the Rhesus of Euripides found an anonymous play
		    called Rhesus and accepted it for what it was worth.
		    The Prologues mentioned in the argument would
		    perhaps belong to other plays of the same name;
		    one, no doubt, to the real play of Euripides. The
		    rich and severe style may, for all we know-for
		    direct evidence fails us-be the natural work of some
		    reactionary archaistic school about the time of Plato
		    or Aristotle. The same date might well be indicated by the great interest our play takes in the
		    Iliad, and by its almost "Alexandrian" use of
		    the gods as ornamental machinery. I cannot call such
		    a theory improbable; but it really amounts to rejecting the external evidence in order to place the Rhesus
		    in a period of tragic style of which we happen to
		    know  nothing.  It is certainly not confirmed by
		    the scanty fragments we possess of Theodectes or
		    Chairemon.</p>
		<p>And, if one is to venture into more speculative
		    and subjective arguments, I find it rather hard to
		    think of any lyric poet except Euripides who could
		    have written the Adrasteia chorus or the lines about
		    the Nightingale in the Watchers' Song; of any playwright except Euripides who would have ended a
		    play of gallant martial adventure with the vision of a
		    solitary mother clasping her dead son. There are
		    many other passages, too, like the mysterious sobbing
		    in the dark that heralds the entry of the wounded
		    Thracian, and the final passing out of the army to its
		    certain defeat, which seem to me more like undeveloped genius than common imitative mediocrity. If
		    a nameless fourth-century poet wrote this play, I think
		    we should have heard more of him.</p>
		<p>The story of the play is taken straight from the
		    Doloneia, an Epic rhapsody which now takes its place
		    as the Tenth Book of the Iliad, but was very likely
		    independent in the time of Euripides (Rise of the
		    Greek Epic, p. 313 f.). The play seems in one or
		    two points to follow a more archaic model than the
		    version in our Homer. (See notes on l. 150 and 1.
		    175.)</p>
		<p>In Rhesus himself-the name is said to be the
		    Thracian form of rex 1-we seem to have the traditional divine king of the Thracian tribes about Pangaion, seen through the eyes of Greek romance. He
		    is the son of the greatest of Rivers and the Muse of
		    the Mountain: she is simply "The Muse," otherwise nameless, and we are lost if we try to bind her
		    down to the identity of any Greek goddess.   Like
		    many Thracian heroes Rhesus has a dash of the Sun-god in him, the burning targe, the white horses
		    and the splendour. Like them he is a boaster and
		    1Perdrizet, Cultes et Mythes de Pang&eacute;e, p. 17.
		    a deep drinker, a child of battle and of song. Like
		    other divine kings he dies in his youth and strength,
		    and keeps watch over his people from some "feasting presence, full of light," where he lies among
		    the buried silver-veins of Pangaion. If the uttermost need comes, doubtless he will wake again.
		    When the Athenians began making their dangerous
		    settlements on the coast of Thrace-ten thousand
		    settlers were massacred by Rhesus's people about
		    <date value="-465">465</date> B.C.: <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> not fully established till 437-they found the legend of Rhesus in the air, and
		    eventually they thought it prudent to send for his
		    hallowed bones from the <placeName key="tgn,7002331">Troad</placeName>, where they were
		    supposed to be buried, and give them a tomb in
		    the Athenian colony.   Possibly that pacified him.
		    And his legend in the mouth of the poets seemed
		    perhaps like the story of his own mountaineers,
		    multitudes of strong men, stormy and chivalrous, terrible in onset, who somehow in the end melted away
		    before the skill and persistent courage of a civilised
		    Greek city.</p>

		<sp><speaker>DOLON</speaker><note place="foot">  P. 10, l. 150 ff., Dolon.]-The name is derived from dolos, "craft." In our version of Homer Dolon merely wears, over his tunic, the skin of a grey wolf. He has a leather cap and a bow.  In the play he goes, as Red Indian spies used to go, actually disguised as a wolf, on all fours in a complete wolf-skin. The same version is found on the <placeName key="tgn,7004333">Munich</placeName> cylix of the early vase-painter Euphronius (about 500 B.C.), in which Dolon wears a tight-fitting hairy skin with a long tail. The plan can of course only succeed in a country where wild animals are common enough to be thought unimportant. The playwright has evidently chosen a more primitive and romantic version of the story; the Homeric reviser has, as usual, cut out what might seem ridiculous. (See J. A. K. Thomson in Classical Review, xxv. pp. 238 f.).</note>

This is also to a great extent the conception of Apollo in the Iliad, where he fights for Troy and is Hector's special patron. The sudden ferocity towards Helen in the last strophe is quite in the manner of Euripides; cf. Trojan Women, 1107 ff. (p. 65), 766 ff. (p. 49), and often; also Iph. Taur.  438 ff. (p. 21), where her name comes somewhat as a surprise.  The stage directions here are of course conjectural: it does not seem likely that the playwright, having made Dolon describe his wolf's disguise in detail, would waste the opportunity of making him crawl off in it.

			<note place="foot"><p>P. 23, 11. 394-453, Speeches of Hector and Rhesus.] -The scene reads to me like a rather crude and early form of the celebrated psychological controversies of Euripides. It is simple, but spirited and in character. The description of Thracian fighting again suggests personal knowledge, and so does the boasting.  The Thracians apparently bound themselves with heroic boasts before battle much as Irish and Highland chieftains sometimes did, or as the Franks did with their gabs. (See, e.g., Le P&egrave;lerinage de Charlemagne, as described in Gaston Paris, Litt. du Moyen Age, I.  p. 122 ff.) It was a disgrace if you did not fulfil your gab afterwards.</p>
			    <p>Rhesus's defence is apparently true, though in a modern play one would have expected some explanation of the rather different story that his mother tells, l. 933 ff., p. 51. Perhaps he did not realise how she was holding him back. In any case ancient technique prefers to leave such details unsettled: cf., for instance, Helen's speech in the Trojan Women, in which the false is evidently mixed up with the true, and they are never separated afterwards.</p></note>

		    <sp><speaker>CHORUS.<note place="foot"> <p>Pp. 28-30, 11. 527-564, Stars and Nightingale chorus.]-The beauty of these lines in the Greek is quite magical, but the stage management of the scene is difficult. Apparently Hector (1. 523) bids the Guards come forward from where they are and wait nearer the front for Dolon; obeying this they come up from the orchestra, we may suppose, to the stage. Then watching somewhere near Hector's tent they partly express, in the usual song, the lyrical emotion of the night, partly they chat about Dolon and the order of the watches. The scene is technically very interesting with its rather abrupt introduction of realism into the high convention of tragedy. Meantime the Trojans' time of watch is over and the Lycians, who ought to watch next, have not come. In a modern army it would of course be the duty of the new watch to come and relieve the old; in an ancient barbaric army-characteristically-the old watch had to go and wake the new. You could not, one must suppose, trust them to take their turn otherwise. At the end of the first strophe a Guard suggests that they should rouse the Lycians; at the end of the second the Leader definitely gives the word to do so. The Guards go, and so the stage (and orchestra) is left empty.</p>
				<p>This is plain enough; but why were the Guards brought away from their original position-from the orchestra to the stage? Probably to allow the Greek spies to pass on towards the Thracian camp by a different and unoccupied way, not by the way which the Guards had just taken.</p>
				<p>The story of the Nightingale is well known: she was Philom&ecirc;la, or in the older story Procn&ecirc;, an Athenian princess, wedded to the faithless Thracian king, T&ecirc;reus.  In a fury of vengeance on her husband she slew their only son, Itys or Itylus, and now laments him broken-hearted for ever.</p> </note></speaker>

		<stage>The Guards pass out to waken the Lycians.
		    The stage is empty and dark except for
		    the firelight, when a whisper is heard
		    at the back. Presently enter ODYSSEUS
		    and DIOMEDE in dull leather armour,
		    DIOMEDE carrying at his belt DOLON'S
		    wolf-skin and mask.</stage>

		<sp><speaker>ODYSSEUS.</speaker>
		    <l n="tr">Diomede, hist!-A little sound of arms<note place="foot"><p>P. 31, 1. 567 ff., Odysseus and Diomedes.]-Observe how we are left gradually to discover that they have met and killed Dolon. They enter carrying, as far as we can make out, a wolf-skin that looks like his: they had evidently spoken to him, 11. 572, 575: it is his and they have killed him-l. 592 f.</p>
			    <p>All the Odysseus-Diomedes scenes have something unusual about them, something daring, turbulent, and perhaps lacking in dramatic tact. The silent rush on Hector's empty tent is hard to parallel. The cruel Athena is Euripidean; but her appearance in the midst of the action is startling, though it may be paralleled from Sophocles' Ajax. In Euripides Gods are generally kept for the prologue or epilogue, away from the ordinary action. (The vision of Iris and Lyssa in the middle of the Heracles has at least the stage clear of mortals and the Chorus apparently in a kind of dream.) Again the conception of Athena pretending to be Cypris is curious.  The disguised Athena is common in the Odyssey, but she does not disguise herself as another goddess. (It is sometimes held that this scene requires four actors, which would be a decisive mark of lateness; but this is not really so.  The actor who took Odysseus could easily get round in time to take Paris also-especially if he made his exit at 1. 626, before Athena sees Paris. And the Greek stage had no objection to such doubling.) Lastly, the scene of turmoil between the spies and the Guards is extraordinary in a tragedy, though it would suit well in a pro-satyric play.

If they bring it with them they must probably do something with it, and to hang it where it may give Hector a violent start seems the natural proceeding. Also, they can hardly be carrying it in the scene with the Guards, 1. 675 ff., p. 38 f. That would be madness. They must have got rid of it before then, and this seems the obvious place for doing so.</note> </stage>

		<sp><speaker>THRACIAN.<note place="foot"> P. 44, ll. 756-803. This fine vivid speech has something  of the   famous Euripidean    Messenger-Speeches in it; though they are apt to be much longer and also are practically never spoken by a principal in the action, always by a subordinate or an onlooker. Cf. the speech of the Messenger-Shepherd above, p. 17 f. An extreme sharpness of articulation is characteristic of Euripides' later work: each speech, each scene, each effect is isolated and made complete in itself. The Messenger prepares his message, relates his message and goes, not mixing himself up in the further fortunes of the drama. But this extreme pursuit of lucidity and clear outlines is not nearly so marked in the early plays: in the Cyclops the Messenger's speech is actually spoken by Odysseus, 11. 382-436, and the Serving Man and Serving Maid in the Alcestis are not mere abstract Messengers.</note></speaker>

The story in Homer is more terrible, though more civilised: "They in wrath made him a maimed man, they took away his heavenly song and made him forget his harping."</p>

The Trojans evidently go forth under the shadow of disaster, though with firmness and courage. The stage direction is of course purely conjectural.

	    <closer>THE play presupposes a knowledge of the Iliad in
		some form, if not exactly in the form which it now
		wears. We are not only supposed to know that
		Hector, son of Priam, leads the Trojans and their
		allies ("Trojans, and Lycians, and Dardans bold":
		in tragedy they are also called Phrygians) in defence
		against the Greeks-Argives, Achaeans, Hell&ecirc;nes-under Agamemnon, king of men, and his brother
		Menela&uuml;s, husband of Helen.    This sort of supposition is usual in all Greek tragedy. It merely
		means that the poet takes for granted the main outlines of the heroic saga. But in this play we are also
		supposed to take up the story as it stands at the
		opening of the Doloneia or Tenth Book of the Iliad.
		Indeed one might almost say that the Rhesus is
		simply the Doloneia turned into drama and set in
		the Trojan camp. The only other play that is taken
		straight from Homer is the Satyr-play, Cyclops, which
		tells the story of Odyssey IX., but it is likely enough
		that if we possessed more of the earlier epic literature we should find many other plays closely hugging
		their traditional sources.-The Trojans are camping
		out on the field of battle, close to the Greek lines.
		Hector, always ready for danger, seems to have his
		tent or log-hut set up quite in the van, just behind
		the outposts. In Il. X. 415 ff. he is holding counsel
		with the other chieftains "away from the throng";
		the allies are taking their sleep and trusting to the
		Trojans, who keep awake in groups round the camp
		fires; no watchword is mentioned.</closer>
