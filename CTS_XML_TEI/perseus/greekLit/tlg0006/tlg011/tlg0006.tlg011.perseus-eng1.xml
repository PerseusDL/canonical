<speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<p>From the depths of salt <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean</placeName> floods I, Poseidon, have come, where choirs of Nereids dance in a graceful maze; for since the day that Phoebus and I with exact measurement <milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/> set towers of stone about this land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and ringed it round, never from my heart has passed away a kindly feeling for my Phrygian town, which now is smouldering and overthrown, a prey to <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> might. For, from his home beneath <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, <milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/> Phocian Epeus, aided by the craft of Pallas, framed a horse to bear within its womb an armed army, and sent it within the battlements, a deadly statue;&lsqb;from which in days to come men shall tell of the Wooden Horse, with its hidden load of warriors.&rsqb; <milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/> Groves stand forsaken and temples of the gods run down with blood, and at the altar's very base, before the god who watched his home, Priam lies dead. While to Achaean ships great store of gold and Phrygian spoils are being conveyed, <milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/> and they who came against this town, those sons of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, only wait a favoring breeze to follow in their wake, that after ten long years they may with joy behold their wives and children. Vanquished by Hera, <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> goddess, and by Athena, who helped to ruin <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>, <milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/> I am leaving <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>, that famous town, and my altars; for when dreary desolation seizes on a town, the worship of the gods decays and tends to lose respect. Scamander's banks re-echo long and loud the screams of captive maids, as they by lot receive their masters. <milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/> <placeName key="tgn,7002735">Arcadia</placeName> takes some, and some the people of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>; others are assigned to Theseus' sons, the Athenian chiefs. And such of the Trojan women as are not portioned out are in these tents, set apart for the leaders of the army; and with them Spartan Helen, <milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/> daughter of Tyndareus, justly counted among the captives. And if you would see that queen of misery, Hecuba, you can; for there she lies before the gates, weeping many tears for many sorrows; at Achilles' tomb, <milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/> without her knowledge, her daughter Polyxena has died most piteously; Priam is gone, and her children too; Cassandra, whom the lord Apollo left to be a virgin, frenzied maid, has been forced by Agamemnon, in contempt of the god's ordinance and of piety, to a dishonored wedlock. <milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/> Farewell, O city once prosperous! farewell, you ramparts of polished stone! if Pallas, daughter of Zeus, had not decreed your ruin, you would be standing firmly still.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="48">
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>May I address the mighty god whom the gods revere and who to my own father is very near in blood, <milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/> laying aside our former enmity?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<p>You may; for over the soul the ties of kin exert no feeble spell, great queen Athena.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>For your forgiving mood my thanks! I have messages to impart affecting both yourself and me, lord.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/> Do you bring fresh tidings from some god, from Zeus, or from some lesser power?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>From none of these; but on behalf of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, whose soil we tread, I have come to seek your mighty aid, to make it one with mine.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<p>What! have you laid your former hate aside <milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/> to take compassion on the town now that it is burnt to ashes?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>First go back to the former point; will you make common cause with me in the scheme I purpose?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<p>Yes, surely; but I want to learn your wishes, whether you have come to help Achaeans or Phrygians.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/> I wish to give my former foes, the Trojans, joy, and on the Achaean army impose a bitter return.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<p>Why do you leap thus from mood to mood? Your love and hate both go too far, on whomever centred.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Do you not know the insult done to me and to the shrine I love?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/> I do: when Aias dragged away Cassandra by force.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>Yes, and the Achaeans did nothing, said nothing to him.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<p>And yet it was by your mighty aid they sacked <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>For which cause I would join with you to do them harm.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<p>My powers are ready at your will. What is your intent?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/> I will impose on them a return that is no return.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<p>While they stay on shore, or as they cross the salt sea?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>When they have set sail from <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> for their homes. On them will Zeus also send his rain and fearful hail, <milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/> and inky tempests from the sky; and he promises to grant me his thunder-bolts to hurl on the Achaeans and fire their ships. And you, for your part, make the <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean</placeName> strait to roar with mighty billows and whirlpools, and fill <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>'s hollow bay with corpses, <milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/> that Achaeans may learn henceforth to reverence my temples and regard all other deities.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Poseidon</speaker>
<p>So shall it be, for this favor needs only a few words. I will vex the broad <placeName key="tgn,7002675">Aegean</placeName> sea; and the beach of Myconos and the reefs round <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, <milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/> Scyros and <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName> too, and the cliffs of Caphareus shall be strewn with many a corpse. You go to <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, and taking from your father's hand his lightning bolts, keep careful watch against the hour when <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>' army lets slip its cables. <milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/> A fool is he who sacks the towns of men, with shrines and tombs, the dead man's hallowed home, for at the last he makes a desert round himself and dies.</p></sp></div1>

<sp n="Hecuba">
<speaker>Hecuba</speaker>
<p>Lift your head, unhappy one, from the ground; raise up your neck; this is <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> no more, <milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/> no longer am I queen in <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName>. Though fortune change, endure your lot; sail with the stream, and follow fortune's tack, do not steer your ship of life against the tide, since chance must guide your course. <milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/> Ah me! ah me! What else but tears is now my hapless lot, whose country, children, husband, all are lost? Ah! the high-blown pride of ancestors, humbled! how brought to nothing after all! <milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/> What woe must I suppress, or what declare? &lsqb;What plaintive dirge shall I awake?&rsqb; Ah, woe is me! the anguish I suffer lying here stretched upon this hard pallet! <milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/> O my head, my temples, my side! How I long to turn over, and lie now on this, now on that, to rest my back and spine, while ceaselessly my tearful wail ascends. <milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/> For even this is music to the wretched, to chant their cheerless dirge of sorrow.</p>

Oh that I should sit here, over against the tent of Agamemnon! <milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/> As a slave I am led away from my home, an old woman, while from my head the hair is piteously shorn for grief. Ah! unhappy wives of those armored sons of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>! Ah! poor maidens, luckless brides, <milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/> come weep, for <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilium</placeName> is now a smouldering ruin; and I, like some mother-bird that over her fledgelings screams, will begin the strain; not the same as that <milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/> I once sang to the gods, as I leaned on Priam's staff and beat with my foot in Phrygian time to lead the dance!

<p>O Hecuba! why these cries, these piercing shrieks? What do your words mean?

<sp><speaker>First Semi-Chorus</speaker>
<p>O misery! <milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/> woe to us Trojan women, soon to hear of our troubles: &ldquo;Come out of the house, the Argives are preparing to return&rdquo;.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hecuba</speaker>
<p>Oh! please do not bid the <milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/> wild Cassandra leave her chamber, the frantic prophetess, for Argives to insult, nor to my griefs add yet another.

<sp><speaker>Hecuba</speaker>
<p>My child, your wakeful heart!</p></sp>

<speaker>Talthybius</speaker>
<p>Each warrior took his prize in turn; you were not all at once assigned.</p></sp>

<p>To whom has the lot assigned us severally? Which of us Trojan women <milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/> does a happy fortune await?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Talthybius</speaker>
<p>I know, but ask your questions separately, not all at once.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hecuba</speaker>
<p>Then tell me, whose prize is my daughter, hapless Cassandra?</p></sp>

<p>King Agamemnon has chosen her out for himself.</p></sp>

<p>Yes, that one; to whom has the lot assigned her?</p></sp>

<p>O mother, crown my head with victor's wreaths; rejoice in my royal match; lead me <milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/> and if you find me unwilling at all, thrust me there by force; for if Loxias is indeed a prophet, Agamemnon, that famous king of the Achaeans, will find in me a bride more vexatious than Helen. For I will slay him and lay waste his home <milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/> to avenge my father's and my brothers' death. But let that go; I will not tell of that axe which shall sever my neck and the necks of others, or of the conflict ending in a mother's death, which my marriage shall cause, nor of the overthrow of Atreus' house. <milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/> But I, for all my frenzy, will so far rise above my frantic fit, that I will prove this city happier far than those Achaeans, who for the sake of one woman and one passion have lost a countless army in hunting Helen. <milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/> Their captain too, whom men call wise, has lost for what he hated most what most he prized, yielding to his brother for a woman's sake&mdash;and she was willing and not taken by force&mdash;the joy he had of his own children in his home. For from the day that they landed upon Scamander's strand, their doom began, <milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/> not for loss of stolen frontier nor yet for fatherland with high towers; whomever Ares took, those never saw their children again, nor were they shrouded for the tomb by hand of wife, but in a foreign land they lie. At home the case was still the same; <milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/> wives were dying widows, parents were left childless in their homes, having reared their sons for others, and none is left to make libations of blood upon the ground before their tombs. Truly to such praise as this their army can make an ample claim.

<p>Hear, O mother of children! give ear to what I urge so well, <milestone ed="p" n="635" unit="line"/> that I may cheer my drooping spirit. It is all one, I say, never to have been born and to be dead, and better far is death than life with misery.

Now that child of yours is dead as though she never had seen the light, and little she knows of her calamity; whereas I, who aimed at a fair repute, though I won a higher lot than most, yet missed my luck in life. <milestone ed="p" n="645" unit="line"/> For all that stamps the wife a woman chaste, I strove to do in <placeName key="tgn,2069653">Hector</placeName>'s home. In the first place, whether there is a slur upon a woman, or whether there is not, the very fact of her not staying at home brings in its train an evil name; <milestone ed="p" n="650" unit="line"/> therefore I gave up any longing to do so, and stayed within my house; nor would I admit indoors the clever gossip women love, but conscious of a heart that told an honest tale I was content.

<p>Report of this has reached the Achaean army, and proved my ruin; for when I was taken captive, Achilles' son would have me <milestone ed="p" n="660" unit="line"/> as his wife, and I must serve in the house of murderers. And if I set aside my love for <placeName key="tgn,2069653">Hector</placeName>, and open my heart to this new lord, I shall appear a traitress to the dead, while, if I hate him, I shall incur my master's displeasure. <milestone ed="p" n="665" unit="line"/> And yet they say a single night removes a woman's dislike for her husband; I despise the woman who, when she has lost her former husband, transfers her love by marrying another.

This man was to judge the claims of three rival goddesses; <milestone ed="p" n="925" unit="line"/> so Pallas offered him command of all the Phrygians, and the destruction of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>; Hera promised he should spread his dominion over <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and the utmost bounds of <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, if he would decide for her; but Cypris spoke in rapture of my loveliness, <milestone ed="p" n="930" unit="line"/> and promised him this gift, if she should have the preference over those two for beauty. Now mark the inference I deduce from this; Cypris won the day over the goddesses, and thus far has my marriage proved of benefit to <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, that you are not subject to barbarian rule, neither vanquished in the strife, nor yet by tyrants crushed. <milestone ed="p" n="935" unit="line"/> What <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> gained, was ruin to me, sold for my beauty, and now I am reproached for that which should have set a crown upon my head.

Do not seek to impute folly to the goddesses, in the attempt to adorn your own sin; never will you persuade the wise.
