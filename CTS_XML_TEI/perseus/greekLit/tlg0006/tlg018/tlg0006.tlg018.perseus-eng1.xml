<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Leda, the daughter of Thestius, had three children, maidens, <milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/> Phoebe, Clytemnestra my wife, and Helen; the foremost of the favored sons of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> came to woo Helen; but terrible threats of spilling his rival's blood were uttered by each of them, if he should fail to win the girl. <milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/> Now the matter filled Tyndareus, her father, with perplexity, whether to give her or not, how he might best succeed. This thought occurred to him: the suitors should swear to each other and join right hands and pour libations <milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/> with burnt-sacrifice, binding themselves by this curse: whoever wins the child of Tyndareus for wife, they will assist that man, in case a rival takes her from his house and goes his way, robbing her husband of his rights; and march against that man in armed array and raze his city to the ground, <milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/> Hellene no less than barbarian. Now when they had once pledged their word and old Tyndareus with no small cleverness had beguiled them by his shrewd device, he allowed his daughter to choose from among her suitors the one towards whom the sweet breezes of Aphrodite might carry her. <milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/> Her choice fell on Menelaus; would she had never taken him! Then there came to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> from the Phrygians the man who, <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> legend says, judged the goddesses' dispute; in robes of gorgeous hue, ablaze with gold, in true barbaric pomp; <milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/> and he, finding Menelaus gone from home, carried Helen off, in mutual desire, to his steading on Ida. Goaded to frenzy, Menelaus flew through <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, invoking the ancient oath exacted by Tyndareus and declaring the duty of helping the injured husband.
</p>
</sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="80">
<sp><p><milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/> And so the Hellenes, brandishing their spears and donning their harness, came here to the narrow straits of <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName> with armaments of ships and troops, with many horses and chariots, and they chose me to captain them all for the sake of Menelaus, <milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/> since I was his brother. Would that some other had gained that distinction instead of me! But after the army was gathered and come together, we still remained at <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName> weatherbound. In our perplexity, we asked Calchas, the seer, <milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/> and he answered that we should sacrifice my own child Iphigenia to Artemis, whose home is in this land, and we would sail and sack the Phrygians' capital &lsqb;if we sacrificed her, but if we did not, these things would not happen&rsqb;. When I heard this, I commanded Talthybius <milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/> with loud proclamation to disband the whole army, as I could never bear to slay my daughter. Whereupon my brother, bringing every argument to bear, persuaded me at last to face the crime; so I wrote in a folded scroll and sent to my wife, <milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/> bidding her despatch our daughter to me on the pretence of wedding Achilles, at the same time magnifying his exalted rank and saying that he refused to sail with the Achaeans, unless a bride of our lineage should go to <placeName key="perseus,Phthia">Phthia</placeName>. Yes, this was the inducement I offered my wife, <milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/> &lsqb;inventing, as I did, a sham marriage for the maiden. Of all the Achaeans we alone know the real truth, Calchas, Odysseus, Menelaus and myself; but that which I then decided wrongly, I now rightly countermand again in this scroll, which you, old man, have found me <milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/> opening and resealing beneath the shade of night. Up now and away with this missive to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and I will tell you by word of mouth all that is written here, the contents of the folded scroll, for you are loyal to my wife and house.&rsqb;

<div1 type="card" n="1">
<sp><p>Old man, come here and stand before my dwelling.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>I come; what new schemes now, king Agamemnon?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Will you hurry?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>I am hurrying. It is little enough sleep old age allows me <milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/> and keenly it watches over my eyes.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>What can that star be, steering its course there?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>Sirius, still shooting over the zenith on his way near the Pleiads' sevenfold track.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>The birds are still at any rate <milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/> and the sea is calm, hushed are the winds, and silence broods over the Euripus.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>Then why are you outside your tent, why so restless, my lord Agamemnon? All is yet quiet here in <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>, <milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/> the watch on the walls is not yet astir. Let us go in.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>I envy you, old man, yes, and every man who leads a life secure, unknown and unrenowned; but little I envy those in office.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/> And yet it is there that we place the be-all and end-all of existence</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Yes, but that is where the danger comes; and ambition, sweet though it seems, brings sorrow with its near approach. At one time the unsatisfied claims of the gods <milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/> upset our life, at another the numerous peevish fancies of our subjects shatter it.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>I do not like these sentiments in one who is a chief. It was not to enjoy all blessings that <milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/> Atreus begot you, Agamemnon; but you must experience joy and sorrow alike, mortal as you are. Even though you like it not, this is what the gods decree. But you, after letting your taper spread its light abroad, <milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/> write the letter which is still in your hands and then erase the same words again, sealing and reopening the tablet, then flinging it to the ground with floods <milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/> of tears, and leaving nothing undone in your aimless behavior to stamp you mad. What is it that troubles you? what news is there affecting you, king? Come, share with me your story; <milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/> you will be telling it to a loyal and trusty heart ; for Tyndareus sent me that day to form part of your wife's dowry and to wait upon the bride with loyalty.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="115">
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/> &ldquo;Daughter of Leda, in addition to my first letter, I am sending you word &mdash;.&rdquo;</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>Say on and make it plain, that what my tongue utters may accord with what you have written.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>&ldquo;Not to despatch your daughter to <milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/> <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>'s deep-gulfed wing, to the waveless bay of <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>, for after all we will celebrate our child's wedding at another time.&rdquo;</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>And how will Achilles, cheated of his bride, <milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/> curb the fury of his indignation against you and your wife? Here also is a danger. Make clear what you are saying.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>It is his name, not himself that Achilles is lending, knowing nothing of the marriage or of my scheming <milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/> or my professed readiness to betroth my daughter to him for a husband's embrace.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>A dreadful venture yours, king Agamemnon, you that, by promise of your daughter's hand to the son of the goddess, <milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/> were bringing the maid here to be sacrificed for the Danaids.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Ah me! I am utterly distraught; alas! bewilderment comes over me. Away! hurry your steps, <milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/> yielding nothing to old age.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>I will make haste, king.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Do not sit down by woodland fountains; scorn the witcheries of sleep.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>Hush!<note anchored="yes" resp="Coleridge">The old man cuts short Agamemnon's warnings, as being an un-called-for reflection on his own loyalty.</note></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>And when you pass any place where roads diverge, <milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/> cast your eyes all round, taking heed that no mule-wagon eacape you, passing by on rolling wheels, bearing my child to the ships of the Danaids.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>It shall be so.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p>Start then from the bolted gates, <milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/> and if you meet the escort, start them back again, and drive at full speed to the abodes of the Cyclopes.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Old man</speaker>
<p>But tell me, how shall my message find credit with your wife or child?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Agamemnon</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/> Preserve the seal which you bear on this tablet. Away! Already the dawn is growing grey, lighting the lamp of day and the fire of the sun's four steeds; <milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/> help me in my trouble. <stage>Exit Old man.</stage></p>
<p>No mortal is prosperous or happy to the last, for no one was ever born to a painless life.<stage>Exit Agamemnon.</stage>

<milestone unit="choral"/>
<milestone unit="strophe" n="1"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>To the sandy beach <milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/> of sea-coast <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName> I have come after a voyage through the tides of narrow Euripus, leaving <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>, my city which feeds the waters <milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/> of far-famed Arethusa near the sea, so that I might behold the army of the Achaeans and the ships rowed by those godlike heroes; for our husbands tell us <milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/> that fair-haired Menelaus and high-born Agamemnon are leading them to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> on a thousand ships in quest of Helen, whom <placeName key="tgn,7008038">Paris</placeName> the herdsman <milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/> carried off from the banks of reedy Eurotas, his gift from Aphrodite, when that queen of <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> entered beauty's contest with Hera and Pallas at the gushing fountain.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="185">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="1"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/> Through the grove of Artemis, rich with sacrifice, I sped my course, my cheek stained with red from maiden modesty, in my eagerness to see the soldiers' camp, <milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/> the tents of the mail-clad Danaids, and their crowd of horses. I saw two met together in council; one was Aias, son of Oileus; the other Aias, son of Telamon, crown of glory to the men of <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>; <milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/> and I saw Protesilaus and Palamedes, sprung from the son of Poseidon, sitting there amusing themselves with intricate figures at checkers; Diomedes too <milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/> at his favorite sport of hurling quoits; and Meriones, Ares' son, a marvel to mankind, stood at his side; likewise I beheld the son of Laertes, who came from his island hills, and with him Nireus, <milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/> handsomest of the Achaeans.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="206">
<milestone unit="mesode"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Achilles next, that nimble runner, swift on his feet as the wind, whom Thetis bore and Chiron trained, I saw <milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/> upon the beach, racing in full armor along the shingle, and straining every nerve to beat a team of four horses, <milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/> as he sped round the track on foot; and Eumelus, the grandson of Pheres, their driver, was shouting when I saw him, goading on his lovely steeds, <milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/> with their bits of chased gold-work; the center pair, that bore the yoke, had dappled coats picked out with white, while the tracehorses, on the outside, facing the turning-post in the course, <milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/> were bays with spotted fetlocks. Close beside them Peleus' son leapt on his way, in all his harness, keeping abreast <milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/> the rail by the axle-box.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="231">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="2"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Next I sought the countless fleet, a wonder to behold, that I might fill my girlish eyes with gazing, a sweet delight. <milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/> The warlike Myrmidons from <placeName key="perseus,Phthia">Phthia</placeName> held the right wing with fifty swift cruisers, upon whose sterns, right at the ends, stood Nereid goddesses <milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/> in golden effigy, the ensign of Achilles' armament.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="242">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="2"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Near these were moored the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> ships in equal numbers, over which Mecisteus' <milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/> son, whom Talaus his grandfather reared, and Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, were in command; next in order, Theseus' son was stationed at the head of sixty ships from <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, having the goddess <milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/> Pallas set in a winged chariot drawn by steeds with solid hoof, a lucky sight for mariners.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="253">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="3"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Then I saw <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName>'s fleet of fifty sails <milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/> decked with ensigns; these had Cadmus at the stern holding a golden dragon at the beaks of the vessels, and earth-born Leitus <milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/> was their admiral. And there were ships from <placeName key="tgn,4003963">Phocis</placeName>; and from <placeName key="tgn,7010899">Locris</placeName> came the son of Oileus with an equal contingent, leaving famed Thronium's citadel.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="265">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="3"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/> And from <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>, the Cyclopes' town, Atreus' son sent a hundred well-manned galleys, and Adrastos was with him in command, as friend with friend, <milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/> that <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> might exact vengeance on the one who had fled her home to wed a foreigner. Also I saw upon Gerenian Nestor's prows from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> <milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/> the ensign of his neighbour Alpheus, four-footed like a bull.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="277">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="4"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Moreover there was a squadron of twelve Aenianian sail under King Gouneus; and then near them <milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/> the lords of Elis, whom all the people named Epeians; and Eurytus was lord of these; Iikewise he led the Taphian warriors with the white oar-blades, the subjects of Meges, <milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/> son of Phyleus, who had left the isles of the Echinades, where sailors cannot land.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="288">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="4"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Lastly, Aias, reared in <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName>, <milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/> was joining his right wing to the left of those near whom he was posed, closing the line with his outermost ships, twelve barques obedient to the helm, as I heard and then <milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/> saw the crews; the one who brings his barbaric boats to grapple Aias shall obtain no safe return. There I saw <milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/> the naval armament, but some things I heard at home about the gathered army, of which I still have a recollection.</p></sp></div1>

<p>Yes, but a mind unstable is an unjust possession, disloyal to friends. <milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line"/> Now I am anxious to test you, and do not seek from rage to turn aside from the truth, nor will I on my part overstrain the case. Do you remember when you were all eagerness to captain the Danaids against <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, making a pretence of declining, though eager for it in your heart; how humble you were then, taking each man by the hand <milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line"/> and keeping open doors for every fellow-townsman who cared to enter, affording each in turn chance to speak with you, even though some did not wish it, seeking by these methods to purchase popularity from all bidders? Then when you had secured the command, there came a change over your manners; you were no longer so cordial as before to former friends, <milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line"/> but hard of access, seldom to be found at home. But the man of real worth ought not to change his manners in the hour of prosperity, but should then show himself most staunch to friends, when his own good fortune can help them most effectually.

Then the Danaids began demanding that you should send the fleet away instead of vainly toiling on at <placeName key="perseus,Aulis">Aulis</placeName>; what dismay and confusion was then depicted in your looks, to think that you, with a thousand <milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line"/> ships at your command, had not occupied the plains of Priam with your armies! And you would ask my counsel, &ldquo;What am I to do? What scheme can I devise, where find one?&rdquo;&mdash;to save yourself being stripped of your command and losing your fair fame. Next when Calchas bade you offer your daughter in sacrifice to Artemis, declaring that the Danaids should then sail, you were overjoyed, <milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line"/> and gladly undertook to offer the girl, and of your own accord&mdash;never allege compulsion&mdash;you are sending word to your wife to despatch your daughter here on pretence of wedding Achilles. And after all you turn round and have been caught casting your letter to this effect: &ldquo;I will no longer be my daughter's murderer.&rdquo; Exactly so! <milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line"/> This is the same air that heard you say it. Countless others have done the same; they make an effort while in power, and then retire dishonorably, sometimes owing to the senselessness of the citizens, sometimes deservedly, because they are too feeble of themselves to maintain their watch upon the state. <milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/> For my part, I am more sorry for our unhappy <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, whose purpose was to read these worthless foreigners a lesson, while now she will let them escape and mock her, thanks to you and your daughter.

<p>I wish to rebuke you in turn, briefly, not lifting my eyes too high shamelessly, but in more sober fashion, <milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/> as a brother; for it is a good man's way to be considerate. Tell me, why this burst of fury, these bloodshot eyes? who wrongs you? what is it you want? are you longing to have a virtuous wife? <placeName key="tgn,1131671">WeIl</placeName>, I cannot supply you; for she, whom you once had, was ill-controlled by you. Am I then, a man who never went astray, to suffer for your sins? <milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/> or is it my popularity that galls you? No! it is the longing you have to keep a beautiful woman in your embrace, casting reason and honor to the winds. A bad man's pleasures are like himself. Am I mad, if I change to wiser counsels, after previously deciding amiss? Yours is the madness rather in wishing to recover <milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/> a wicked wife, once you had lost her&mdash;a stroke of heaven-sent luck. Those foolish suitors swore that oath to Tyndareus in their longing to wed; but Hope was the goddess that led them on, I think, and she it was that brought it about rather than you and your strength. So take the field with them; they are ready for it in the folly of their hearts; for the deity is not without insight, but is able to discern <milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/> where oaths have been wrongly pledged or forcibly extorted. I will not slay my children, nor shall your interests be prospered by justice in your vengeance for a worthless wife, while I am left wasting, night and day, in sorrow for what I did to one of my own flesh and blood, contrary to all law and justice. <milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/> Here is your answer shortly given, clear and easy to understand; and if you will not come to your senses, I shall do the best for myself.</p></sp></div1>

A god has outwitted me, proving far cleverer <milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/> than any cunning of mine. What an advantage humble birth possesses! for it is easy for her sons to weep and tell out all their sorrows; while to the high-born man come these same sorrows, but we heve dignity <milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/> throned over our life and are the people's slaves. I, for instance, am ashamed to weep, and no less ashamed, poor wretch, to check my tears at the dreadful pass to which I am brought.</p>
<p>Enough; what am I to tell my wife? <milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/> how shall I welcome her? with what face meet her? for she too has undone me by coming uninvited in this my hour of sorrow; yet it was only natural she should come with her daughter to prepare the bride and perform the fondest duties, where she will discover my villainy. <milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/> And for this poor maid&mdash;why maid?

<p>By Pelops our reputed grandsire and Atreus our father, <milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/> I swear to tell you the truth from my heart, without any covert purpose, but only what I think.

If I am set on marriage, could I not find a bride as choice elsewhere? Was I to lose a brother&mdash;the last I should have lost&mdash;to win a Helen, getting bad for good?

<speaker>Clytemnestra</speaker>
<p>Well, now listen; for I will unfold my meaning and no longer employ dark riddles. In the first place&mdash;to reproach you first with this&mdash;it was not of my own free will but by force that you took and wed me, <milestone ed="p" n="1150" unit="line"/> after slaying Tantalus, my former husband, and dashing my baby on the ground when you had torn him from my breast with brutal violence. Then those two sons of Zeus, who were my brothers, came flashing on horseback to war with you;<milestone ed="p" n="1155" unit="line"/> but Tyndareus, my old father, rescued you because of your suppliant prayers, and you in turn had me to wife.</p>
<p>Once I was reconciled to you upon this footing, you will bear me witness I have been a blameless wife to you and your family, chaste in love, <milestone ed="p" n="1160" unit="line"/> an honor to your house, that so your coming in might be with joy and your going out with gladness. And it is seldom a man secures a wife like this, though the getting of a worthless woman Is no rarity. Besides three daughters, of one of whom you are heartlessly depriving me, <milestone ed="p" n="1165" unit="line"/> I am the mother of this son of yours. If anyone asks you your reason for slaying her, tell me, what will you say? or must I say it for you? &ldquo;It is that Menelaus may recover Helen.&rdquo; An honorable exchange, indeed, to pay a wicked woman's price in children's lives! <milestone ed="p" n="1170" unit="line"/> It is buying what we most detest with what we hold most dear. Again, if you go forth with the army, leaving me in your halls and are long absent at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, what will my feelings be at home, do you think? when I behold each vacant chair <milestone ed="p" n="1175" unit="line"/> and her chamber now deserted, and then sit down alone in tears, making ceaseless lamentation for her, &ldquo;Ah! my child, he that begot you has slain you himself, he and no one else, nor are was it by another's hand, leaving behind him such a return to his home.&rdquo; <milestone ed="p" n="1180" unit="line"/> For it needs now only a trifling pretext for me and the daughters remaining to give you the reception it is right you should receive.

As soon as we reached the grove of Artemis, the child of Zeus, and the flowery meadows, <milestone ed="p" n="1545" unit="line"/> where the Achaean troops were gathered, bringing your daughter with us, at once the Argive army began assembling; but when king Agamemnon saw the maiden on her way to the grove to be sacrificed, he gave one groan, and, turning away his face, let the tears burst <milestone ed="p" n="1550" unit="line"/> from his eyes, as he held his robe before them. But the maid, standing close by her father, spoke thus: &ldquo;O my father, here I am; willingly I offer my body for my country and all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, <milestone ed="p" n="1555" unit="line"/> that you may lead me to the altar of the goddess and sacrifice me, since this is Heaven's ordinance.

But in the midst Talthybius stood up, for this was his duty, and bade the army refrain from word or deed; <milestone ed="p" n="1565" unit="line"/> and Calchas, the seer, drawing a sharp sword from its scabbard laid it in a basket of beaten gold, and crowned the maiden's head. Then the son of Peleus, taking the basket and with it lustral water in his hand, ran round the altar of the goddess <milestone ed="p" n="1570" unit="line"/> uttering these words: &ldquo;O Artemis, you child of Zeus, slayer of wild beasts, that wheel your dazzling light amid the gloom, accept this sacrifice which we, the army of the Achaeans and Agamemnon with us, offer to you, pure blood from a beautiful maiden's neck; <milestone ed="p" n="1575" unit="line"/> and grant us safe sailing for our ships and the sack of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s towers by our spears.&rdquo; Meanwhile the sons of Atreus and all the army stood looking on the ground.
