            <p>Clothes are supposed to make a man warm, not of course by warming him
					themselves in the sense of adding their warmth to him, because each garment
					by itself is cold, and for this reason very often persons who feel hot and
					feverish keep changing from one set of clothes to another ; but the warmth
					which a man gives off from his own person the clothing, closely applied to
					the body, confines and enwraps, and does not allow it, when thus imprisoned
					in the body, to be dissipated again. Now the same condition existing in
					human affairs deceives most people, who think that, if they surround
					themselves with vast houses, and get together a mass of slaves and money,
					they shall live pleasantly.<note place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

					if with them goes the gladness which springs from the heart; and so too men
					bear poverty, exile, and old age lightly and gently in proportion to the

            <p>Where, then, is the pleasure in vice, if in no part of it is to be found
					freedom from care and grief, or contentment or tranquillity or calm ? For a
					wellbalanced and healthy condition of the body gives room for engendering
					the pleasures of the flesh; but in the soul lasting joy and gladness cannot
					possibly be engendered, unless it provide itself first with cheerfulness,
					fearlessness, and courageousness as a basis to rest upon, or as a calm
					tranquillity that no billows disturb; otherwise, even though some hope or
					delectation lure us with a smile, anxiety suddenly breaks

					honey to a bilious man, and preparing tid-bits and dainties for sufferers
					from colic or dysentery, who cannot retain them or be strengthened by them,
					but are only brought nearer to death thereby. Does not your observation of
					sick persons teach you that they dislike and reject and decline the finest
					and costliest viands which their attendants offer and try to force upon them
					; and then later, when their whole condition has changed, and good
					breathing, wholesome blood, and normal temperature have returned to their

					will find no less satisfaction in the care-free life of a private citizen
					than in the life connected with high military or civic office. If you become
					a philosopher, you will live not unpleasantly, but you will learn to subsist
					pleasantly anywhere and with any resources. Wealth will give you gladness
					for the good you will do to many, poverty for your freedom from many cares,
					repute for the honours you will enjoy, and obscurity for the certainty that
					you shall not be envied. </p>
