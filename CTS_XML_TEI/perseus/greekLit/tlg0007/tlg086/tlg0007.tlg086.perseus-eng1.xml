            <head>ON THE FORTUNE OF THE
					ROMANS
					(DE FORTUNA ROMANORUM)
					<lb/>INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>
					Plutarch's essay on the <hi rend="italics">Fortune of the Romans</hi>, like
					the following essays, is very plainly an epideictic
					oration. Where and when it was delivered, or
					whether it was ever delivered at all, we have no means
					of ascertaining. Hartman feels very sure that it was
					delivered to a Roman audience in the early days of
					Plutarch's sojourn at Rome, and was intended to
					commend the speaker to other Romans besides his
					personal friends there.
				</p>
            <p>The thesis that Fortune was responsible for the
					great Roman empire would hardly be pleasing to
					Romans, but Plutarch is careful to point out that the
					high character of many individual Romans also contributed to the Roman success. In fact the essay
					might well bear the double title of <hi rend="italics">Fortune or Virtues</hi>,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">This name it actually does bear in seven (out of a total of about twenty-six) mss.</note>
					as does the essay on Alexander. Plutarch was
					thoroughly familiar with the interpretations of
					Roman history then fashionable, and in this essay he
					gives a colourful sketch of as much as will serve his
					purpose. Much that is here may also be found
					elsewhere in Plutarch's writings.
				</p>
            <p>The essay comes to a somewhat abrupt conclusion,
					and many have thought it unfinished ; the same is
					true of the essays immediately following. One may
					
					<pb id="v.4.p.321"/>
					
					wonder whether a time limit was set for these orations,
					as in the courts at Athens where the time allowed
					was measured by the water-clock or clepsydra. We
					may note, however, that these orations are of quite
					unequal length.
				</p>
            <p>The text is fairly good, and the majority of the ms.
					mistakes have been corrected by the various editors
					and commentators. The essay is No. 175 in Lamprias's
					list of Plutarch's works.
				</p>
         </div1>

         <div1 type="section" n="1">
            <p>Virtue and Fortune, who have often engaged in
					many great contests, are now engaging each other in
					the present contest, which is the greatest of all; for
					in this they are striving for a decision regarding
					the hegemony of Rome, to determine whose work it
					is and which of them created such a mighty power.
					For to her who is victorious this will be no slight
					testimonial, but rather a defence against accusation.
					For Virtue is accused of being a fair thing, but
					unprofitable; Fortune of being a thing inconstant,
					but good. Virtue's labours, they say, are fruitless.
					Fortune's gifts untrustworthy. Who, then, will not
					declare, when Rome shall have been added to the
					achievements of one of the contestants, either that
					Virtue is a most profitable thing if she has done such
					good to good men, or that Good Fortune is a thing
					most steadfast if she has already preserved for so
					long a time that which she has bestowed?
				</p>
            <p>The poet Ion<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 717 b.</note> in his prose works observes that
					Fortune is a thing very dissimilar to Wisdom, and yet
					she becomes the creator of things very similar : they
					both bring increase and added honours to men, they
					lead them on to high repute, to power, to dominion.
					What need to be tedious by enumerating the many
					examples? Even Nature herself, who creates and
					
					<pb id="v.4.p.325"/>
					
					produces all things for us, some think to be Fortune,
					others Wisdom. Wherefore our present discourse
					does, in a measure, bestow a fair and enviable dignity
					upon Rome, if we raise the question over her, even
					as we do over earth and sea, heaven and stars, whether
					she has come to her present state by Fortune or by
					Forethought.<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">That is, Wisdom.</note>
				        </p>
         </div1>
         <div1 type="section" n="2">
            <p>I believe myself to be right in suspecting that,
					even if Fortune and Virtue are engaged in a direct
					and continual strife and discord with each other, yet,
					at least for such a welding together of dominion and
					power, it is likely that they suspended hostilities and
					joined forces ; and by joining forces they co-operated
					in completing this most beautiful of human works.
					Even as Plato<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Timaeus</hi>, 28 b, 31 b-32 b.</note> asserts that the entire universe arose
					from fire and earth as the first and necessary elements,
					that it might become visible and tangible, earth contributing to it weight and stability, and fire contributing colour, form, and movement ; but the medial
					elements, water and air, by softening and quenching
					the dissimilarity of both extremes, united them and
					brought about the composite nature of Matter
					through them ; in this way, then, in my opinion, did
					Time lay the foundation for the Roman State and,
					With the help of God, so combine and join together
					Fortune and Virtue that, by taking the peculiar
					qualities of each, he might construct for all mankind
					a Hearth, in truth both holy and beneficent, a steadfast cable, a principle abiding for ever, <q direct="unspecified">an anchorage
						from the swell and drift,</q> as Democritus<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Diels, <hi rend="italics">Frag. der Vorsokratiker</hi>, ii. 88, Frag. b 148: <hi rend="italics">cf. Moralia</hi>, 495 e.</note> says, amid
					the shifting conditions of human affairs. For even as
					
					<pb id="v.4.p.327"/>
					
					the physicists<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Moralia</hi>, 878 c-f; <hi rend="italics">De Anima</hi>, i. 1 (Bernardakis, vol. vii. p. 1).</note> assert that the world was in ancient
					days not a world nor were the atoms willing to coalesce
					and mix together and bestow a universal form upon
					Nature, but, since the atoms, which were yet small
					and were being borne hither and thither, kept eluding
					and escaping incorporation and entanglement, and the
					larger, close-compacted atoms were already engaging
					in terrific struggles and confusion among themselves,
					there was pitching and tossing, and all things were
					full of destruction and drift and wreckage until such
					time as the earth, by acquiring magnitude from the
					union of the wandering atoms, somehow came to be
					permanently abiding herself, and provided a permanent abode in herself and round about herself for
					the other elements ; even so, while the mightiest
					powers and dominions among men were being driven
					about as Fortune willed, and were continuing to
					collide one with another because no one held the
					supreme power, but all wished to hold it, the continuous movement, drift, and change of all peoples
					remained without remedy, until such time as Rome
					acquired strength and growth, and had attached to
					herself not only the nations and peoples within her
					own borders, but also royal dominions of foreign
					peoples beyond the seas, and thus the affairs of this
					vast empire gained stability and security, since the
					supreme government, which never knew reverse, was
					brought within an orderly and single cycle of peace ;
					for though Virtue in every form was inborn in those
					who contrived these things, yet great Good Fortune
					was also joined therewith, as it will be possible to
					demonstrate as the discourse proceeds.

            <p>Later, when the children were born and the despot
					gave orders to do away with them, by the decree
					of Fortune no barbarous or savage servant but a
					compassionate and humane man received them, with
					the result that he did not kill them ; but there was a
					margin of the river, bordering upon a green meadow,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Perhaps Plutarch is attempting to give a version of <hi rend="italics">super ripas Tiberis effusus lenibus stagnis . . . in proxima alluvie</hi> of Livy, i. 4.</note>
					shaded round about with lowly shrubs ; and here the

                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> 278 c, <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>.</note> Then a she-wolf, that had newly

					<pb id="v.4.p.347"/>
					
					herself in great need of relief, circled around<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. cursum flexisse</hi> of Livy, i. 4.</note> the
					infants and then gave them suck, thus ridding herself
					of the pain caused by the milk as if it had been a
					second birth-pang. And a bird sacred to Mars, which
					they call the woodpecker, visited them and, perching
					near on tiptoe, would, with its claw, open the mouth
					of each child in turn and place therein a morsel,
					sharing with them a portion of its own food. Wherefore they named this wild fig-tree Ruminalis, from the
					teat (<hi rend="italics">ruma</hi>) which the wolf offered to the children as
					she crouched beside the tree. And for a long time
					the people who dwelt near this place preserved the
					custom of never exposing any of the new-born infants,
					but they acknowledged and reared them all, in
					honour of Romulus's experience and the similarity of
					the childrens' case with his.
				</p>
            <p>And, in truth, the fact that they were not discovered while they were being reared and educated
					in Gabii, and that it was unknown that they were
					the sons of Silvia and the grandchildren of king
					Numitor surely appears to have been a furtive and
					shrewd device of Fortune, so that they might not,
					because of their lineage, be put to death before
					performing their tasks, but that they might in their
					very successes be discovered, by bringing to notice
					their noble qualities as tokens by which to recognize
					their high birth.
				</p>
            <p>At this point there occurs to me the remark of a
					great and prudent general, Themistocles,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Cf.</hi> 270 b, <hi rend="italics">supra</hi>, and the note.</note> which was
					made to certain of the generals who came into favour
					at Athens after him and felt that they deserved to be
					rated above him. He said that the Day-After contended
					
					<pb id="v.4.p.349"/>
					
					with the Feast-Day, saying that the Feast-Day was full of wearying tasks and labours, but on the
					Day-After men enjoyed in quiet all things that had
					been made ready. Then the Feast-Day said, <q direct="unspecified">What
						you say is true ; but if I had not been, where would
						you be?</q> 
               <q direct="unspecified">And so,</q> said Themistocles, <q direct="unspecified">if I had
							not been at the time of the Persian Wars, what

					methinks, is what Fortune says to the Virtue of
					Romulus : <q direct="unspecified">Brilliant and mighty are your deeds, and
						in very truth you have proved yourself to be divine in
						blood and birth. But do you observe how far you
						fall behind me? For if, at the time of his birth, I had
						not accompanied him in a helpful and humane guise,
						but had deserted and abandoned the infants, how
						could you have come into being and whence had you
						derived such lustre? If on that occasion there had
						not come to them a female beast swollen with the
						abundance and the burden of her milk, and in need of
						some creature to be fed rather than of something to
						yield her sustenance, but if instead there had come
						some utterly savage and ravening creature, would not
						even now these fair palaces and temples, theatres,
						promenades, fora, and public buildings be herdsmen's
						huts and folds of shepherds who paid homage to some
						man of Alba or Etruria or Latium as their lord?</q>
					The beginning, as every one knows, is of supreme
					importance in everything,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

                  <hi rend="italics">Cf. Life of Numa</hi>, chap. iv. (62 a).</note> is perhaps
					somewhat fabulous. For other mortals who are said
					to have attained divine marriages and to have been
					beloved of goddesses, men like Peleus and Anchises,
					Orion and Emathion, by no means lived through their
					lives in a satisfactory, or even painless, manner. On
					the contrary, it appears likely that Numa had Good
					Fortune as his true wife, counsellor, and colleague ;
					and she took the city in charge when it was being
					carried hither and yon amid the enmity and fierceness
					of bordering tribes and neighbours, as in the midst of
					turbulent billows of a troubled sea and was inflamed
					by countless struggles and dissensions; and she calmed
					those opposing passions and jealousies as though they
					had been but gusts of wind. Even as they relate
					that the sea, when it has received the brood of
					halcyons in the stormy season, keeps them safe and
					assists in their nurture, even such a calm in the affairs
					of Rome, free from war or pestilence or danger or
					terror, Fortune caused to overspread and surround
					the city, and thus afforded the opportunity to a newly
					settled and sorely shaken people to take root and to
					establish their city on a firm foundation where it might
					grow in quiet, securely and unhindered. It is as with a
					merchantman or a trireme, which is constructed by
					blows and with great violence, and is buffeted by
					hammers and nails, bolts and saws and axes, and, when
					it is completed, it must remain at rest and grow firm for
					
					<pb id="v.4.p.353"/>
					
					a suitable period of time until its bonds hold tight and
					its fastenings have acquired affinity; but if it be
					launched while its joinings are still damp and slippery,
					these will all be loosened when they are racked by the
					waves, and will admit the sea. Even so the first
					ruler and artificer of Rome, in organizing the city
					from rustics and shepherds, as though building up
					from a stout keel,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Is this a reminiscence of Plato, <hi rend="italics">Timaeus</hi>, 81 b; or of Polybius, i. 38. 5?</note> took upon himself no few labours,

            <p>But he who was the second to take over the State
					gained time by good fortune to consolidate and make

					he secure for her and much quiet. But if at that time
					a Porsenna had pressed hard upon the city and had
					erected an Etruscan stockade and a camp beside the
					new walls which were still moist and unstable, or if
					from the Marsi had come some rebellious chief filled
					with warlike frenzy, or some Lucanian, incited by
					envy and love of strife, a man contentious and warlike, as later was Mutilus or the bold Silo b or Sulla's

					wisdom, while he was sacrificing and praying, the
					early beginnings of the City would not have been
					able to hold out against such a mighty surge and billow,

					like an athlete, having, during a period of forty-three

But even now they have no temple of Wisdom or Prudence or Constancy or Magnanimity. But of Fortune there are very many ancient and splendid temples built with every honour, one might say, and interspersed throughout the most conspicuous districts and localities of the City. The shrine of the Men's Fortune was built by Ancus Marcius, the fourth king, and so named because Fortune has the largest share with Manly Fortitude for winning the victory.

					this, but assert that Ocrisia was a maiden who took
					the first-fruits and the libations on all occasions from
					the royal table and brought them to the hearth ; and
					once on a time when she chanced, as usual, to be
					casting the offerings upon the fire, suddenly, as the
					flames died down, the member of a man rose up out
					of the hearth ; and this the girl, greatly frightened,
					told to Tanaquil only. Now Tanaquil was an intelligent and understanding woman, and she decked the
					maiden in garments such as become a bride, and shut
					her up in the room with the apparition, for she judged
					it to be of a divine nature. Some declare that this love
					was manifested by the Lar of the house, others that
					it was by Vulcan. At any rate, it resulted in the birth
					of Servius, and, while he was still a child, his head
					shone with a radiance very like the gleam of lightning.
					But Antias<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">Peter, <hi rend="italics">Frag. Hist. Rom.</hi> p. 154, Valerius Antias, Frag. 12.</note> and his school say not so, but relate that
					when Servius's wife Gegania lay dying, in the presence
					of his mother he fell into a sleep from dejection and
					grief; and as he slept, his face was seen by the
					women to be surrounded by the gleam of fire. This
					was a token of his birth from fire and an excellent
					sign pointing to his unexpected accession to the kingship, which he gained after the death of Tarquin, by

            <p>Concerning this assault of the Gauls it will perhaps not be unseasonable to give some additional

					he should not, as if he had given up all hope for the
					city, be elected by soldiery in a canvass of the remnants of the army, now scattered and wandering, it
					was necessary that the senators on the Capitolino
					should vote upon the matter after they had been
					informed of the decision of the soldiers. Now there
					was a certain Gaius Pontius,<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="italics">Ibid.</hi> chaps. xxv.-xxvii. (141 d-143 a); Livy v. 46. 47; Dionysius of Halicarnassus, <hi rend="italics">Roman Antiquities</hi>, xiii. 7.</note> a brave man, who, by
					volunteering personally to report these resolutions
					to the Senate on the Capitol, took upon himself great
					danger. For the way led through the midst of the
					enemy, who encompassed the citadel with sentries and
					
					<pb id="v.4.p.371"/>
					
					palisades. When, accordingly, he had come by night
					to the river, he bound broad strips of cork beneath
					his breast and, entrusting his body to the buoyancy
					of this support, committed himself to the stream.
					Encountering a gentle current which bore him slowly
					down stream, he reached the opposite bank in safety,
					and, climbing out of the river, advanced toward the
					section void of lights, inferring from the darkness
					and quiet that no one was there. Clinging to the
					precipitous cliff and entrusting himself to the support
					of sloping and circuitous ways and jagged surfaces of
					the rock which would allow a foothold or afford a
					clutch for his hand, he reached the top of the rock ;
					he was received by the sentries, and made known to
					those within the decision of the army, and having obtained the decree of the Senate, he returned again
					to Camillus.
				</p>
            <p>The next day one of the barbarians was wandering
					idly about this place, when he saw in one spot
					prints of feet and marks of slipping, and in another
					the bruising and tearing off of the grass, which grew
					on the earth of the cliff, and marks of the zigzag
					dragging and pulling up of a body ; and this he told
					to the others. They, thinking that the way was
					pointed out to them by their enemies, attempted to
					rival them ; and waiting till the very dead of night,
					they made the ascent, unnoticed not only by the
					sentinels, but also by the dogs which shared guard
					duty and formed the outpost, but then were overcome
					by sleep.

            <p>Rome's Fortune, however, did not lack a voice capable of revealing and declaring such a great mischance.

					and was made uncomfortable by hunger, with the
					result that they were at once aware of the enemy as
					they showed themselves above the edge of the cliif.
					The geese hissed at them and rushed at them impetuously, and, at the sight of arms, became even more
					excited, and filled the place with piercing and discordant clamour. By this the Romans were aroused,
					and, when they comprehended what had happened,
					they forced back their enemies and hurled them over

					learn and has embraced in his consideration the former
					dejection of the city and her present prosperity, and
					has looked upon the splendour of her temples, the
					richness of her votive offerings, the rivalry of her arts

					crowns of dependent kings, and all things which the
					earth contributes and the sea and islands, continents,
					
					<pb id="v.4.p.375"/>
					
					rivers, trees, living creatures, plains, mountains,
					mines, the first-fruits of everything, vying for beauty
					in the aspect and grace that adorns this place? And
					then comes the thought: how near did all this come to
					not being created and to not existing at all! When
					all things else were overcome by fire and frightful
					darkness and gloom, by foreign swords and murderous
					rage, it was poor, irrational, and timorous creatures
					that contributed the beginning of deliverance ; and
					those great heroes and commanders, the Manlii, the
					Servilii, the Postumii, the Papirii, the founders of future
					illustrious houses, whom naught separated from death,
					geese aroused to make defence for the god of their
					fathers and for their fatherland. But if it be true, as
					Polybius<note resp="ed" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">ii. 18. 3.</note> has recorded in his second book, concerning
					the Gauls who had at this time seized Rome, that,
					when news suddenly came to them that their domains
					at home were in danger of being lost to them at the
					hands of neighbouring barbarians who had invaded
					their land and were masters of it, they concluded a
					treaty of peace with Camillus and withdrew - if this
					be true, then there can be no contention with Fortune
					that she was not the cause of Rome's preservation, by
					distracting the enemy, or rather, by abstracting them
