                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The laws have
                    given you the right, Athenians, to acquit or punish men on trial. A doctor
                    cannot treat his patients skilfully if he has not discerned the cause of the
                    disease, nor can a member of a jury give a fair vote unless he has followed
                    intelligently the rights and wrongs of the case. <milestone n="2" unit="section"
                    />Since I have myself become exposed to the full hatred of the orators, I am
                    asking not only for divine assistance but for your help also. For they are
                    casting aspersions on my personal history, thinking to undermine your confidence
                    in my speech. I am of no consequence whether alive or dead; for what do the
                    Athenians care if Demades is lost to them, too? No soldier will shed tears over
                    my deathâ€”(How could he, when war brings him advancement and
                    peace destroys his livelihood?); but it will be lamented by the farmer,
                    the sailor, and everyone who has enjoyed the peaceful life with which I
                    fortified <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, encircling its
                    boundaries, not with stone, but with the safety of the city. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/>In many cases, gentlemen of the jury, when men are serving
                    as judges they are seriously misled. For, just as a complaint of the eyes, by
                    confusing the vision, prevents a man from seeing what lies before him, so an
                    unjust speech, insinuating itself into the minds of the jury, prevents them in
                    their anger from perceiving the truth. You should therefore exercise more care
                    in dealing with the accused than with the plaintiffs. For the latter, by virtue
                    of speaking first, have the jury in the mood which suits them, while the former
                    are compelled to plead their cause to judges already prejudiced by anger.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>Now, if you hold me liable for the charges,
                    condemn me out of hand; I ask no pardon. But if, on considerations of justice,
                    law, and expediency, I prove to be innocent of these charges, do not leave me to
                    the savagery of my prosecutors. If my death will contribute in the least, as
                    these men say, to the common safety, I am ready to die. For it is a noble thing
                    to win public esteem by the loss of one's own life, so long as it is given in
                    answer to the country's need and not the argument of these accusers. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/>I entreat you by the gods, Athenians, give me free
                    scope to explain to you my claims to fair treatment. I have, I believe, the
                    power even to be of assistance to others, but on this occasion fear restrains my
                    speech. Apart from that I am not afraid that the facts will convict me; all I
                    fear is my opponents' slander which, instead of bringing wrongdoers to justice,
                    attaches to any with a reputation as an orator or statesman. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/>The hopes I place in you are justified; for the sympathy of
                    his hearers, when it is ranged on the side of justice, is no small factor in
                    securing the acquittal of the accused. If I gain this I shall rebut all the
                    calumnies; without it neither speech nor laws, nor the light of facts, can save
                    a man unjustly brought to trial. I need not remind you that numerous prosecutors
                    on many occasions in the past have, on the strength of their pleas, been thought
                    to be urging a just case, but after a comparison with the defence they have been
                    found to be themselves speaking falsely and I am convinced that my accusers now
                    will have the same experience, if you consent to grant me a favorable hearing.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>As they
                    attempted to question the rest of my administration, I wish to make a few points
                    in connexion with it and then to pass on to the remainder of my defence in order
                    to prove their dishonesty to you. I am the son of Demeas, Athenians, as the
                    elder ones among you know, and the early part of my life I lived as best I
                    could, neither doing harm to the community nor troubling any individual in the
                    city. I merely persisted in trying, by my own efforts, to better my humble
                    position. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>Penury may involve inconvenience and
                    hardship but it carries with it no discredit, since poverty is frequently, I
                    imagine, a mark not of weakness of character but of sheer misfortune. When I
                    entered public life I did not concentrate on lawsuits or the perquisites to be
                    derived from writing speeches but on speaking freely from the platform, a
                    practice which makes the lives of orators dangerous but holds out the clearest
                    opportunities of success, if men are careful<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true"
                            ><foreign xml:lang="grc">eu)laboume/nois</foreign>, too, clearly refers to
                        the hearers, not to the orators, an therefore the sense is the same as that
                        given by the words <foreign xml:lang="grc">eu)labw=s a)krowme/nois</foreign>,
                        even if we do not adopt that emendation.</note>; for, though they succumb to
                    the speaker, their country's safety must not also fall a victim. <milestone
                        n="9" unit="section"/>I have, to bear me out, the burial of a thousand
                        Athenians<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">It is said that after <placeName
                            key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName> in date when="-338">338</date>
                        B.C. Philip was insulting his prisoners, until Demades, by his frank speech,
                        won him over to a better attitude towards <placeName key="perseus,Athens"
                            >Athens</placeName>. Cf. <bibl n="Diod. 16.87">Dio. Sic.
                        16.87</bibl>.</note> performed by the hands of our adversaries, hands which
                    I won over from enmity to friendship towards the dead. Then, on coming to the
                    fore in public life, I proposed the peace. I admit it. I proposed honors to
                    Philip. I do not deny it. By making these proposals I gained for you two
                    thousand captives free of ransom, a thousand Athenian dead, for whom no herald
                    had to ask, and Oropus without an embassy. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>The
                    hand that wrote them was constrained, not by Macedonian gifts, as my accusers
                    falsely allege, but by the need of the moment, the interest of my country, and
                    the generosity of the king. For he entered the war as our foe but emerged from
                    the struggle as a friend, awarding to the vanquished the prize of the victors.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>Again, there came a second crisis for the
                    city; for I deliberately ignore the intervening dangers. All other inhabitants
                    of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> were promoting Alexander to
                    the rank of leader, and by remoulding him in their decrees they raised the
                    aspirations of a young and ambitious man to an excessive pitch. We and the
                    Spartans remained, with neither revenues nor armaments nor regiments of infantry
                    to be the bulwark of our safety, yet fortified by a great desire, though our
                    power was small and humble. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>The Spartans had
                    been deprived of their strength by the battle of Leuctra<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="true">Cf. <bibl n=">Din. 1.73">Din. 1.73</bibl>, note.</note>, and
                    the Eurotas, which had never yet heard an enemy trumpet, saw Boeotians camping
                    in <placeName key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>. For the Theban had cut off
                    the bloom of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, enveloping in
                    ashes the flower of her young men, the established boundaries of <placeName
                        key="tgn,7002745">Laconia</placeName>. Our own resources were spent with war
                    and the hopes of the survivors were oppressed by the fate of the dead.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>The Thebans were suffering the closest
                    restriction in the Macedonian garrison<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">i.e. the
                        garrison established in the Cadmea by Philip after <placeName
                            key="tgn,7010731">Chaeronea</placeName>.</note> which bound their hands
                    together and had even deprived them of their freedom of speech. Time buried the
                    power of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> with the body of
                    Epaminonidas. The Macedonians had reached their full strength, and in their
                    aspirations Fortune was already leading them across the sea against the throne
                    and treasuries of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>. <milestone
                        n="14" unit="section"/>Then too Demosthenes decided upon war, offering to
                    his compatriots counsel which, though seemingly prudent, was in reality fraught
                    with danger.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">After the accession of Alexander in
                            date when="-336">336</date> B.C. Demosthenes proposed a decree to
                        honor Philip's murderer, and war was imminent. But in the same year, when
                        Alexander entered <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>,
                            <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> retracted. Demades
                        apparently negotiated the ensuing agreement, but we have no other evidence
                        to confirm the statement made in this passage.</note> When the enemy was
                    encamped near <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName> and the country
                    was being confined in the town, when the city, worthy to be striven for and
                    marvelled at by all, was being filled like a stable with oxen, sheep and flocks
                    and there was no hope of help from any quarter, I proposed the peace. <milestone
                        n="15" unit="section"/>I admit it and I maintain that it is an honorable and
                    expedient course to have taken. For it is better to shun the cloud as it
                    approaches than to be swept away in the rush of the flood. I ask, Athenians,
                    that the grief occasioned by events shall not engender in you any bitterness
                    against me. For I have no mastery over Fortune; it is Fortune which controls
                    life and gives it its danger. The counsellor, like the doctor, must not take
                    blame for the disease; he must be thanked for the cure. <milestone n="16"
                        unit="section"/>Discount, therefore, what happened from extraneous causes
                    and simply examine my policy naked in the light of facts. To resume then: after
                    this the city was exposed to a third and paramount danger, not this time sent by
                    Fortune but brought on us by the politicians of the day.<note resp="Loeb"

                    platform for us to see; when, in the Assembly, they calmed the Theban exiles,
                    who were present, with specious words and spurred on their minds to conceive a
