<p>Hermes of the nether world, you who guard the powers that are your father's,<note anchored="yes" n="1" resp="Smyth">Hermes is invoked &lpar;1&rpar; as a god of the lower world, because he is the &ldquo;conducter of souls&rdquo; and herald between the celestial and infernal gods &lpar;l. 124&rpar;, and can thus convey Orestes' appeal to the rulers of the dead and to the spirit of his father; &lpar;2&rpar; as administrator of the powers committed to him by his father, Zeus the Saviour.  Some prefer to take <foreign lang="greek">patrw=|</foreign> not as <foreign lang="greek">patrw=|a</foreign> but as <foreign lang="greek">patrw=|e</foreign> i.e.&ldquo;god of my  fahters.&rdquo;</note> prove yourself my savior and ally, I entreat you, now that I have come to this land and returned from exile. On this mounded grave I cry out to my father to hearken, to hear me<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/> <gap desc="*"/></p>
<p>&lsqb;Look, I bring&rsqb; a lock to Inachus<note anchored="yes" n="6" resp="Smyth">Orestes offers a lock of his hair to do honour to Inachus, the river-god of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, because rivers were worshipped as givers of life.</note> in requital for his care, and here, a second, in token of my grief.</p>
<p>For I was not present, father, to lament your death, nor did I stretch forth my hand to bear your corpse.</p>
<p>What is this I see?<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/> What is this throng of women that moves in state, marked by their sable cloaks?  To what calamity should I set this down?  Is it some new sorrow that befalls our house?  Or am I right to suppose that for my  father's sake they bear these libations to appease the powers below?<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/> It can only be for this cause: for indeed I think my own sister Electra is approaching, distinguished by her bitter grief.    Oh grant me, Zeus, to avenge my father's death, and may you be my willing ally!</p>
<p>Pylades, let us stand apart,<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/> that I may</p>
<p>know clearly what this band of suppliant women intends.<stage>Exit Orestes and Pylades.  Enter Electra with women carrying libations.</stage></p></sp></div1>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Sent forth from the palace I have come to convey libations to the sound of sharp blows of my hands.  My cheek is marked with bloody gashes where my nails have cut fresh furrows.<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>And yet through all my life my heart is fed with lamentation.  Rips are torn by my griefs through the linen web of my garment, torn in the cloth that covers my breast, the cloth of robes struck for the sake of my mirthless misfortunes.<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/></p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="32">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="1"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>For with a hair-raising shriek, Terror, the diviner of dreams for our house, breathing wrath out of sleep, uttered a cry of terror in the dead of night from the heart of the palace,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>a cry that fell heavily on the women's quarter.<note anchored="yes" n="36" resp="Smyth">The language of the passage is accommodated to a double purpose: &lpar;1&rpar; to indicate an oracular deliverance on the part of the inspired prophetess at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, and &lpar;2&rpar; to show the alarming nature of Clytaemestra's dream:  while certain limiting expressions &lpar;as <foreign lang="greek">a)wpo/nukton, u(/ptou</foreign>&rpar; show the points of difference.  &ldquo;Phoebus&rdquo; is used for a prophetic &ldquo;possession,&rdquo; which assails Clytaemestra as a nightmare &lpar;cp. <foreign lang="greek">baru\s pi/tnwn</foreign>&rpar;; so that her vision is itself called an <foreign lang="greek">o)neiro/mantis.</foreign></note> And the readers of these dreams, bound under pledge, cried out from the god that those beneath the earth cast furious reproaches<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>and rage against their murderers.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="42">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="2"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Intending to ward off evil with such a graceless grace, O mother Earth, she sends me forth, godless woman that she is.<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>But I am afraid to utter the words she charged me to speak.  For what atonement is there for blood fallen to earth?  Ah, hearth of utter grief!  Ah, house laid low in ruin!<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>Sunless darkness, loathed by men, enshrouds our house due to the death of its master.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="55">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="2"/>
<sp><p>The awe of majesty once unconquered, unvanquished, irresistible in war,<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>that penetrated the ears and heart of the people, is now cast off.  But there is still fear.  And prosperity&mdash;this, among mortals, is a god and more than a god.<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>But the balance of Justice keeps watch:  swiftly it descends on those in the light; sometimes pain waits for those who linger on the frontier of twilight; and others are claimed by strengthless night.<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/></p></sp>
</div1>

<div1 type="card" n="66">
<sp>
<milestone unit="strophe" n="3"/>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Because of blood drunk up by the fostering earth, the vengeful gore lies clotted and will not dissolve away.  Soul-racking calamity distracts the guilty man till he is steeped in utter  misery.<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/></p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="71">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="3"/>
<sp><p>But for the violator of a bridal chamber there is no cure.  And though all streams flow in one course to cleanse the blood from a polluted hand, they rush in vain.<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/></p></sp>

<div1 type="card" n="75">
<sp>
<milestone unit="epode"/>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>For since the gods laid constraining doom about my city and led me from my father's house to a slave's lot, it is fitting for me to govern my bitter hate, even against my will, and submit to the wishes of my masters, whether just or unjust.<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>But I weep beneath my veil over the senseless fate of my lord, my heart chilled by secret grief.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="84">

<milestone unit="episode"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>You handmaidens who set our house in order, since you are here as my attendants in this rite of supplication,<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>give me your counsel on this:  what should I say while I pour these offerings of sorrow?  How shall I find gracious words, how shall I entreat my father?  Shall I say that I bring these offerings to a loved husband from a loving wife&mdash;from my own mother?<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>I do not have the assurance for that, nor do I know what I should say as I pour this libation onto my father's tomb.  Or shall I speak the words that men are accustomed to use: &ldquo;To those who send these honors may he return benefits&rdquo;&mdash;a gift, indeed, to match their evil?<note anchored="yes" n="95" resp="Smyth">&ldquo;Their evil&rdquo; is unexpectedly substituted for &ldquo;their good.&rdquo;  The question is ironical, since it was natural for a Greek to return evil for evil &lpar;cp. 123&rpar;.</note></p>
<p>Or, in silence and dishonor, even as my father perished, shall I pour them out for the earth to drink<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>and then retrace my steps, like one who carries refuse away from a rite, hurling the vessel from me with averted eyes?</p>
<p>In this, my friends, be my fellow-counsellors.<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>For we cherish a common hatred within our house.  Do not hide your counsel in your hearts in fear of anyone.  For the portion of fate awaits both the free man and the man enslaved by another's hand.  If you have a better course to urge, speak!<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/></p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="106">

<p>In reverence for your father's tomb, as if it were an altar, I will speak my thoughts from the heart, since you command me.</p></sp>

<p>Speak, even as you revere my father's grave.</p></sp>

<p>While you pour, utter benedictions for loyal hearts.</p></sp>

<p>And to whom of those dear to me should I address them?<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>First to yourself, then to whoever hates Aegisthus.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>Then for myself and for you also shall I make this prayer?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>That is for you, using your judgment, to consider now for yourself.</p></sp>

<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>Then whom else should I add to our company?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Remember Orestes, though he is still away from home.<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>Well said!  You have indeed admonished me thoughtfully.</p></sp>

<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>For the guilty murderers now, mindful of&mdash;</p></sp>

<p>What should I say?  Instruct my inexperience, prescribe the form.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Pray that some divinity or some mortal may come to them&mdash;</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>As judge or as avenger, do you mean?<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Say in plain speech, &ldquo;One who will take life for life.&rdquo;</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>And is it right for me to ask this of the gods?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>How could it not be right to repay an enemy with ills?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>Supreme herald of the realm above and the realm below, O Hermes of the nether world, come to my aid, summon to me the spirits beneath the earth to hear my prayers,<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>spirits that watch over my father's house, and Earth herself, who gives birth to all things, and having nurtured them receives their increase in turn.  And meanwhile, as I pour these lustral offerings to the dead, I invoke my father: &ldquo;Have pity both on me and on dear Orestes!<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>How shall we rule our own house?  For now we are bartered away like vagrants by her who bore us, by her who in exchange got as her mate Aegisthus, who was her accomplice in your murder.  As for me, I am no better than a slave,<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>Orestes is an outcast from his inheritance, while they in their insolence revel openly in the winnings of your toil.  But that Orestes may come home with good fortune I pray to you, father: Oh, hearken to me!  And as for myself, grant that I may prove far more circumspect than my mother and more reverent in deed.<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/></p>
<p>I utter these prayers on our behalf, but I ask that your avenger appear to our foes, father, and that your killers may be killed in just retribution.  So I interrupt my prayer for good<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>to offer them this prayer for evil.  But be a bearer of blessings for us to the upper world, with the help of the gods and Earth and Justice crowned with victory.&rdquo;<stage>She pours out the libations</stage></p>
<p>Such are my prayers, and over them I pour out these libations.  It is right for you to crown them with lamentations,<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>raising your voices in a chant for the dead.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="152">
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Pour forth your tears, splashing as they fall for our fallen lord, to accompany this protection against evil, this charm for the good<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/>against the loathsome pollution.  Hear me, oh hear me, my honored lord, out of the darkness of your spirit.<note anchored="yes" n="157" resp="Smyth">Or <foreign lang="greek">a)maura=s</foreign> may mean &ldquo;feeble,&rdquo; &ldquo;helpless,&rdquo; to contrast the spirit of the dead with that of the living.  But cp. 323.</note></p>
<p>Woe, woe, woe!  Oh for a man mighty with the spear to deliver our house,<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>an Ares, brandishing in the fight the springing Scythian bow and wielding his hilted sword in close combat.<stage>As they conclude, Electra discovers the lock of Orestes' hair</stage></p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="164">
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>My father has by now received the libations, which the earth has drunk.<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>But take your share of this startling news.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Speak&mdash;but my heart is dancing with fear.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>I see here a lock cut as an offering for the tomb.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>A man's, or a deep-girt maid's?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>That is open to conjecture&mdash;anyone may guess.<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>How then?  Let my age be taught by your youth.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>There is no one who could have cut it but myself.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Yes, for those who ought to have mourned with a lock of hair are enemies.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>And further, in appearance it is very much like&mdash;</p></sp>

<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Whose lock?  This is what I would like to know.<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>It is very much like my own in appearance.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Then can this be a secret offering from Orestes?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>It is his curling locks that it most resembles.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>But how did he dare to come here?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>He has merely sent this cut lock to honor his father.<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>What you say is no less a cause of tears for me, if he will never again set foot on this land.</p></sp>
<sp n="Electra">
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>Over my heart, too, there sweeps a surge of bitterness, and I am struck as if a sword had run me through.  From my eyes thirsty drops of a stormy flood fall unchecked at the sight of this tress.<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>For how can I expect to find that someone else, some townsman, owns this lock?  Nor yet in truth did she clip it from her head, the murderess, my own mother,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>who has assumed a godless spirit regarding her children that ill accords with the name of mother.  But as for me, how am I to assent to this outright, that it adorned the head of Orestes, the dearest to me of all mortals?  No, hope is merely flattering me.</p></sp>
</div1>

<div1 type="card" n="195">
<sp>
<p>Ah, woe!  If only, like a messenger, it had a kind voice,<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>so that I would not be tossed by my distracted thoughts. Rather it would plainly bid me to spurn this tress, if it was severed from a hated head.  Or if it were a kinsman's, he would share my grief as an adornment to this tomb and a tribute to my father.<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/></p>
<p>But I invoke the gods, who know by what storms we are tossed like seafarers.  Yet if I am fated to reach safety, a great stock may come from a little seed.</p>
<p>And look!  Another proof!  Footprints<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>matching each other&mdash;and like my own!  Yes, here are the outlines of two sets of feet, his own and some companion's.  The heels and the imprints of the tendons agree in proportion with my own tracks.<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>I am in torment, my brain is in a whirl!</p></sp>
<stage>Enter Orestes</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>Give recognition to the gods that your prayers have been fulfilled, and pray that success may attend you in the future.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>What?  Have I succeeded now by the will of the gods?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>You have come to the sight of what you have long prayed for.<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>And do you know whom among mortals I was invoking?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>I know that you are pining for Orestes.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>Then how have I found an answer to my prayers?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>Here I am.  Search for no other friend than me.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>But surely, stranger, you are weaving some snare about me?<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>Then I am devising plots against myself.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>No, you wish to mock my distress.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>Then my own also, if yours.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>Am I then to address you as Orestes in truth?</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="225">
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>Now, even though you see him in me, you are slow to learn.<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>Yet at the sight of this tress cut in mourning, and when you were scrutinizing the footprints of my tracks, your thought took wings and you knew you had found me.  Put the lock of hair, your own brother's, in the spot it was cut from and observe how it matches the hair on my head.<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>And see this piece of weaving, your handiwork, the strokes of the batten and the beasts in the design.  Control yourself!  Do not go mad with joy!  For I know that our nearest kin are bitter foes to us both.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Electra</speaker>
<p>O best beloved darling of your father's house,<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>its hope of a saving seed longed for with tears, trust in your prowess and you will win back your father's house.  O delightful eyes that have four parts of love for me:  for I must call you father;<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>and to you falls the love I should bear my mother, whom I most rightly hate; and the love I bore my sister, victim of a pitiless sacrifice; and you were my faithful brother, bringing me your reverence.  May Might and Justice, with Zeus, supreme over all, in the third place, lend you their aid!<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>O Zeus, O Zeus, regard our cause!  Behold the orphaned brood of a father eagle that perished in the meshes, in the coils of a fierce viper. They are utterly orphaned, gripped by the famine of hunger:<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>for they are not grown to full strength to bring their father's quarry to the nest.  So you see both me and poor Electra here, children bereft of their father, both outcasts alike from our home.

<p>Surely he will not abandon me, the mighty oracle of Loxias, who urged me to brave this peril to the end<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>and loudly proclaims calamities that chill the warmth of my heart, if I do not take vengeance on my father's murderers.  He said that, enraged by the loss of my possessions,<note anchored="yes" n="273" resp="Smyth">Tucker interprets this passage to mean &ldquo;fiercely stern with penalties not to be paid with money,&rdquo; that is, penalties demanding the death of the guilty, who may not offer money to satisfy the claims of vengeance; and thus an allusion to &ldquo;wer-gild,&rdquo; known in Homeric times.</note> I should kill them in requital just as they killed.  And he declared that otherwise<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>I should pay the debt myself with my own life, after many grievous sufferings.  For he spoke revealing to mortals the wrath of malignant powers from underneath the earth, and telling of plagues:  leprous ulcers that mount with fierce fangs on the flesh<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>and eat away its primal nature; and how a white down<note anchored="yes" n="282" resp="Smyth">The down upon the sore, not the temples turned white &lpar;cp. Leviticus xiii.3&rpar;.</note> should sprout up on the diseased place.  And he spoke of other assaults of the Furies that are destined to be brought to pass from paternal blood.  For the dark bolt of the infernal powers, who are stirred by kindred victims calling for vengeance, and madness, and groundless terrors out of the night, torment and harass a man, and he sees clearly, though he moves his eyebrows in the dark.<note anchored="yes" n="291" resp="Smyth">He cannot sleep through terror of the Erinyes of his murdered kin whom he has not avenged.</note><milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>And with his body marred by the brazen scourge, he is even chased in exile from his country.<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line"/>And the god declared that to such as these it is not allowed to have a part either in the ceremonial cup or in the cordial libation; his father's wrath, though unseen, bars him from the altar; no one receives him or lodges with him; and at last, despised by all, friendless, he perishes,<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line"/>shrivelled pitifully by a death that wastes him utterly away.</p>
<p>Must I not put my trust in oracles such as these? Yet even if I do not trust them, the deed must still be done.  For many impulses conspire to one conclusion.  Besides the god's command, my keen grief for my father,<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>and also the pinch of poverty&mdash;that my countrymen, the most renowned of mortals, who overthrew <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> in the spirit of glory, should not be subjected so to a pair of women.

<p>But if I indeed pass the outermost threshold of the gate and find that man sitting on my father's throne, or if then coming face to face with me he lifts and casts down his eyes, know well: before he can even say &ldquo;Of what land is this stranger?&rdquo; I will skewer him with my swift sword and lay him dead.<milestone ed="p" n="575" unit="line"/>The fury that has no fill of slaughter shall for her third and crowning drink drink unmixed blood!</p>

<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>Behold this pair, oppressors of the land, who murdered my father and ransacked my house!  They were majestic then, when they sat on their thrones,<milestone ed="p" n="975" unit="line"/>and are lovers even now, as one may judge by what has happened to them, and their oath holds true to their pledges.  Together they vowed a league of death against my unhappy father, and together they vowed to die, and they have kept their promise well.</p>
<p>But now regard again, you who hear this account of ills,<milestone ed="p" n="980" unit="line"/>the device for binding my unhappy father, with which his hands were manacled, his feet fettered.  Spread it out!  Stand around in a circle, and display this covering for a man, that the Father may see&mdash;not mine, but he who surveys all this, the Sun&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="985" unit="line"/>that he may see the impious work of my own mother, that he may be my witness in court that I justly pursued this death, my own mother's.  For I do not speak of Aegisthus' death: he has suffered the penalty prescribed for adulterers.<milestone ed="p" n="990" unit="line"/></p>
<p>But she who devised this abhorrent deed against her husband, whose children she bore, a burden under her belt, a burden once dear, but now a hateful ill, as it seems: what do you think of her?  Had she been born a seasnake or a viper, I think her very touch without her bite would have caused anyone else to rot,<milestone ed="p" n="995" unit="line"/>if shamelessness and an immoral disposition could do so.<stage>He  again takes up the bloody robe</stage></p>
<p>What name shall I give it, however tactful I may be?  A trap for a wild beast?  Or a shroud for a corpse in his bier,<note anchored="yes" n="998" resp="Smyth"><foreign lang="greek">droi/ths kataskh/nwma</foreign> also means &ldquo;curtain of a bath.&rdquo;</note> wrapped around his feet?

It was he who declared that, if I did this thing, I would be acquitted of wrongdoing.  But if I refrained&mdash;I will not name the penalty; for no bowshot could reach such a height of anguish.</p>
