<stage>Enter a company of maidens, who have fled from <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and just landed on the shores of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>; with them is their father</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>May Zeus who guards suppliants look graciously upon our company, which boarded a ship and put to sea from the outlets of the fine sand of the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>.  For we have fled Zeus' land<note anchored="yes" n="4" resp="Smyth">Or &ldquo;the land divine&rdquo; &lpar;<foreign lang="greek">di=an</foreign> with M&rpar;.  But see l. 558.</note><milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>whose pastures border <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, and are fugitives, not because of some public decree pronounced against blood crime, but because of our own act to escape the suit of man, since we abhor as impious all marriage with the sons of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Aegyptus</placeName>.<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>It was Danaus, our father, adviser and leader, who, considering well our course, decided, as the best of all possible evils, that we flee with all speed over the waves of the sea<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>and find a haven on <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>' shore.  For from there descends our race , sprung from the caress and breath of Zeus on the gnat-tormented heifer.</p>
<p>To what kinder land than this<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>could we come with these wool-wreathed branches in our hands, sole weapons of the suppliant? O realm, O land, and clear water;  gods on high and earth-bound powers, grievous in your vengeance,<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>which inhabit the tomb; and you, Zeus the Savior, invoked third<note anchored="yes" n="26" resp="Smyth">With reference to the order of invocation in libations: 1. Olympian Zeus; 2. the Heroes, cp. l. 25; 3. Zeus the Saviour.  Cp.

But<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>the thronging swarm of violent men born of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Aegyptus</placeName>, should they set foot upon this marshy land,  drive them seaward&mdash;and with them their swift ship&mdash;and there may they encounter a cruel sea with thunder, lightning, and rain-charged winds,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>and perish by the tempest's buffeting blasts, if they ever lay their hands on us, their cousins, and mount unwilling beds from which Right holds them aloof.</p></sp></div1>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>And now I invoke, as our champion from beyond the sea, the calf born of Zeus, the offspring of the flower-grazing cow, our ancestress,<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>the caress of Zeus' breath. The appointed period confirmed itself in a name suited to the event&mdash;Epaphus<note anchored="yes" n="48" resp="Smyth">Epaphus signifies &ldquo;touch,&rdquo; &ldquo;caress.&rdquo;  See l. 315.</note>, to whom she gave birth.</p></sp></div1>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>To him I cry for help.<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>And now in the region wherein our first mother pastured, by recounting the story of her distress of long ago, I shall now set forth reliable proofs to the inhabitants of the land;<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>and other evidence, though unexpected, will yet appear.  Men will come to know the truth as my tale proceeds.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="58">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="2"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Now if by chance there be some neighbor in the land who knows the song of birds,<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>when our complaint greets his ear, he will fancy that he hears the voice of Metis, Tereus' piteous wife, the hawk-chased nightingale.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="63">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="2"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>For she, constrained to leave her green leaves, laments pitifully her accustomed haunts,<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/> and composes the tale of her own child's doom&mdash;how he perished, destroyed by her own hand, victim of the wrath of an unnatural mother.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="68">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="3"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Even so I, indulging my grief in Ionian strains,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>pain my tender face summered by <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName>'s sun and my heart unexercised in tears; and I gather the flowers of grief, anxious whether there is any friendly kinsman here to champion our band<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>which has fled from the haze-shrouded land.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="77">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="3"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>But, gods of our race, hear, and regard with favor the cause of righteousness; if you refuse youth<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>fulfillment of its arrogant desires, and readily abhor violence, you would be righteous toward marriage. Even for those who flee hard-pressed from war there is an altar,<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>a shelter against harm through respect for the powers of heaven.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="86">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="4"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>But may Zeus grant that it go well with us.  For Zeus' desire is hard to trace:  it shines everywhere, even in gloom, together with fortune<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>obscure to mortal men.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="91">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="4"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Safely it falls, and not upon its back, whatever deed comes to pass at Zeus' nod; for the pathways of his understanding stretch dark and tangled,<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>beyond comprehension.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="96">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="5"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>From their high-towering hopes he hurls mankind to utter destruction; yet he does not marshal any armed violence&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>all that is wrought by the powers divine is free from toil.  Seated on his holy throne, unmoved, in mysterious ways he accomplishes his will.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="104">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="5"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>So let him look upon human outrageousness<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>&mdash;in what way it shoots up men in their wooing of us, sprouted from thoughts of evil intent,<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>having a frenzied purpose as its irresistible spur, and deluded, turning its thoughts to folly.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="112">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="6"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Such piteous strains of woe I utter in my pain, now shrill, now deep, blended with falling tears&mdash;Alas, alas!<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>groans appropriate to funeral wails; though I live, I chant my own dirge.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="117">

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>I invoke  <placeName key="tgn,1099657">Apia</placeName>'s hilly land&mdash;for well, O land, you  understand my barbarous speech&mdash;,<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>and many times I lay my hands upon my Sidonian veil and tear its linen fabric to shreds.</p></sp></div1>

<speaker>Danaus</speaker>
<p>My children, you must be prudent.  A prudent captain of your voyage was your reliable old father here with whom you came.  And now that I have considered with foresight what may befall us here on land, I charge you, record my injunctions on the tablets of your minds and guard them.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>I see dust, the voiceless herald of an army; the axle-driven wheels are not silent in their sockets. I behold a throng, armed with shields and holding spears, with steeds and curved chariots. Perhaps they are the princes of the land<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>come to look on us, informed by messengers.  But whether a harmless man or one driven by savage wrath rouses this expedition, it is better, damsels, in any case, to seat yourselves at that mound sacred to the assembled gods.
<note anchored="yes" n="189" resp="Smyth"><foreign lang="greek">a)gw/n</foreign> has here the force of <foreign lang="greek">a)gora/</foreign>, place of assembly.  Cp. l. 222.</note><milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>Stronger than a castle is an altar&mdash;an impenetrable shield.  As quick as you can, gather in your left hands your white-wreathed suppliant boughs, sacred emblems of Zeus the merciful.<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>Reply to the strangers, as is fitting for aliens, in piteous and plaintive language of necessity, telling them clearly of your flight, how it was unstained by deed of blood. Above all let no arrogance accompany your speech, and reveal nothing impious in your peaceful eyes, from your respectful face.<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>In your  speech neither interrupt, nor hesitate&mdash;for this would offend these people. And remember to be submissive: you are an alien, a fugitive, and in need.  Bold speech does not suit the weak.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Father, your words are prudent, and they fall on prudent ears.<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>I will take heed of your wise words, and hold them in memory.  May Zeus, the author of our race, behold us!</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="207">
<sp>
<speaker>Danaus</speaker>
<p>May he indeed behold you, and with a gracious eye.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>I would like even now to be seated by your side.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Danaus</speaker>
<p>Then do not delay, but put your purpose into action.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>O Zeus, have pity upon our troubles lest we are ruined.</p></sp>

<p>Honor to the mutual altar of all these protecting powers; and seat yourselves on holy ground like a flock of doves in dread of hawks of the same feathered tribe&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>kindred, yet foes, who would defile their race.  If bird prey on bird, how can it be pure?  And how can man be pure who would seize from an unwilling father an unwilling bride?  For such an act, not even in Hades, after death, shall he escape arraignment for outrage.<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>There also among the dead, so men tell, another Zeus holds a last judgment upon misdeeds.  Take heed and reply in this manner, that victory may attend your cause.</p></sp></div1>

<stage>Enter the King of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> with men-at-arms</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>King</speaker>
<p>From where comes this band we address,<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>clothed in foreign attire and luxuriating in closely-woven and barbaric robes?  For your apparel is not that of the women of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, nor yet of any part of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>. How you have gained courage thus fearlessly to come to this land, unheralded and friendless and without guides,<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>this makes me wonder.  And yet, truly, I see that branches usually carried by suppliants are laid by your side before the gods assembled here&mdash;as to this alone can <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>  guess with confidence.<note anchored="yes" n="243" resp="Smyth">The original means &ldquo;agree in forming a conjecture,&rdquo; i.e. be satisfied with a guess.</note>As for the rest, there is still much I should with reason leave to conjecture,<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>if your voice were not here to inform me.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>You have not spoken falsely about our clothing. But, for my part, how am I to address you?  As commoner, as spokesman, bearer of the sacred wand,<note anchored="yes" n="248" resp="Smyth">Apparently a periphrasis for &ldquo;herald&rdquo;; but the Greek text is uncertain.</note>or as ruler of the realm?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>King</speaker>
<p>As for that, answer and speak to me with confidence.<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>For I am Pelasgus, offspring of Palaechthon, whom the earth brought forth, and lord of this land; and after me, their king, is rightly named the race of the Pelasgi, who harvest the land.  Of all the region through which the pure<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>Strymon flows, on the side toward the setting sun, I am the lord.  There lies within the limits of my rule the land of the Perrhaebi, the parts beyond Pindus close to the Paeonians, and the mountain ridge of <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName>; the edge of the watery sea borders my kingdom.  I rule up to these boundaries.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>The ground where we stand is Apian land itself, and has borne that name since antiquity in honor of a healer.  For Apis, seer and healer, the son of Apollo, came from <placeName key="tgn,7011174">Naupactus</placeName> on the farther shore and purified this land of monsters deadly to man, which Earth,<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>defiled by the pollution of bloody deeds of old, caused to spring up&mdash;plagues charged with wrath, an ominous colony of swarming serpents.  Of these plagues Apis worked the cure by sorcery and spells to the content of the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> land,<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>and for reward thereafter earned for himself remembrance in prayers.</p>
<p>Now that you have my testimony, declare your lineage and speak further&mdash;yet our people do not take pleasure in long discourse.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="274">
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Our tale is brief and clear.  Argives<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>we claim to be by birth, offspring of a cow blest in its children.  And the truth of this I shall confirm in full.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>King</speaker>
<p>Foreign maidens, your tale is beyond my belief&mdash;how your race can be from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.

Through their resolve<milestone ed="p" n="945" unit="line"/>the rivet has been driven home, to remain fixed and fast.

As for places inside to lodge, there are plenty of the public sort. For on no modest scale do I myself live, where,<milestone ed="p" n="960" unit="line"/>in company with many others, you may occupy abodes suitably prepared; or, if it is more pleasing to you, it is free for you also to make your home in dwellings of separate sort. Of these select what is best and most to your desires.  A protector you have in me and in all the inhabitants, whose resolve this is that now takes effect.<milestone ed="p" n="965" unit="line"/>Why wait for others of higher authority?</p></sp></div1>

<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>In blessings may you abound, noble Pelasgian, in requital for your blessings!  But, if it pleases you, send our brave father Danaus here to be our adviser<milestone ed="p" n="970" unit="line"/>and leader of our counsels.  For it befits him, rather than ourselves, to advise us where we should establish our home and what neighborhood is friendly.  All the world is ready to cast reproach on those who speak a foreign tongue.  But may all be for the best!<stage>Exit the King.</stage><milestone ed="p" n="975" unit="line"/>And you, dear handmaidens, preserving your fair fame and provoking no angry utterances on the part of the native folk, take up your stations even as Danaus has allotted her duty of attendance unto each.</p></sp></div1>

<speaker>Danaus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="980" unit="line"/>My children, it is right to offer prayers to the Argives and to sacrifice and pour libations to them as to Olympian gods; for they are our saviors in no doubtful manner.  They heard from my lips the conduct of your cousins toward their own kinfolk, and were moved to bitterness against them;<milestone ed="p" n="985" unit="line"/>but to me they assigned this escort of spearmen, that I might have rank and honor, and might not be ambushed and perish by the death of the spear, and so an ever-living burden come upon the land.  Recipients of such favors as these,<milestone ed="p" n="990" unit="line"/>it becomes us to hold gratitude in yet higher honor from the bottom of our hearts.  And in addition to the many other wise injunctions of your father recorded in your memory, inscribe this too&mdash;that an unknown company is proved by time.  For in an alien's case, all the world bears an evil tongue in readiness,<milestone ed="p" n="995" unit="line"/>and it is easy lightly to utter  defiling slander.  Therefore I would have you bring no shame upon me, now when your youthful loveliness attracts men's gaze. The tender ripeness of summer fruit is in no way easy to protect; beasts despoil it&mdash;and men, why not?&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="1000" unit="line"/>and brutes that fly and those that walk the earth.  Love's goddess spreads news abroad of fruit bursting ripe. . . . So all men, as they pass,<milestone ed="p" n="1005" unit="line"/>mastered by desire, shoot an alluring arrow of the eye at the delicate beauty of virgins.  See to it, therefore, that we do not suffer that in fear for which we have endured great toil and ploughed the great waters with our ship; and that we bring no shame to ourselves and exultation to our enemies. Housing of two kinds is at our disposition,<milestone ed="p" n="1010" unit="line"/>the one Pelasgus offers, the other, the city, and to occupy free of cost.  These terms are easy.  Only pay heed to these behests of your father, and count your chastity more precious than your life.</p></sp>

<p>May the Olympian gods grant us good fortune in all the rest!<milestone ed="p" n="1015" unit="line"/>But, concerning the bloom of my virginity, father, be of good cheer, for, unless some evil has been devised of Heaven, I will not swerve from the former pathway of my thoughts.</p></sp></div1>
