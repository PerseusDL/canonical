<stage>A large gathering of citizens of Thebes.  Enter Eteocles with attendants.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<p>Men of Cadmus's city, he who guards from the stern the concerns of the State and guides its helm with eyes untouched by sleep must speak to the point.  For if we succeed, the responsibility is heaven's;<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>but if&mdash;may it not happen&mdash;disaster is our lot, Eteocles would be the one name shouted many times throughout the city in the citizens' resounding uproars and laments.  From these evils may Zeus the Defender, upholding his name, shield the city of the Cadmeans!</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>But now you&mdash;both he who is still short of his youthful prime, and he who, though past his prime, still strengthens the abundant growth of his body, and every man still in his prime, as is fitting&mdash;you must aid the State and<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>the altars of your homeland's gods so that their honors may never be obliterated.  You must aid, too, your children, and Mother Earth, your beloved nurse.  For welcoming all the distress of your childhood, when you were young and crept upon her kind soil, she raised you to inhabit her and bear the shield,<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>and to prove yourselves faithful in this time of need.  And so, until today, God has been favorably inclined, for though we have long been under siege, the war has gone well for the most part through the gods' will.  But now, as the seer, the herdsman of birds, informs us,<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>using his ears and his mind to understand with unerring skill the prophetic birds unaided by sacrificial fire&mdash;he, master of such prophecy, declares that the greatest <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> attack is being planned in night assembly and that they will make plans to capture our city.<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>Hurry each of you to the battlements and the gates of our towered walls! Rush with all your armor! Fill the parapets and take your positions on the platforms of the towers.  Stand your ground bravely where the gates open out,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>and do not be afraid of this crowd of foreigners. God will bring it to a good end.</p>
<p>I myself have dispatched scouts and men to observe their army, and I am confident that their going is not in vain.  Once I have heard their report, I will not be taken by any trickery.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="39">
<stage>Enter a Scout.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Scout</speaker>
<p>Eteocles, mighty prince of the Cadmeans,<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>I have returned with a sure report of the army outside the walls; I myself am an eyewitness of their actions.  Seven warriors, fierce regiment-commanders, slaughtered a bull over a black shield, and then touching the bull's gore with their hands they swore an oath<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>by Ares, by Enyo,<note anchored="yes" n="45" resp="Smyth">Enyo is a personification of war, and hence sometimes called the mother or the daughter of Ares.</note> and by Rout who delights in blood, that either they will level the city and sack the Cadmeans' town by force, or will in death smear this soil with their blood.  And on Adrastus' chariot they were placing remembrances of themselves<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>for their parents at home, and were shedding tears while so doing, but no piteous wailing escaped their lips.  For their iron- hearted spirit heaved, blazing with courage, as of lions with war in their eyes.  Your knowledge of these things was not delayed by fearfulness;<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>for I left them casting lots to decide how each commander, his post assigned by chance, would lead his regiment against the gates.  Therefore, choose the bravest men of the city and station them quickly at the outlets of the gates.  For nearby already the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> army in full armor 
<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>is advancing in a flurry of dust, and glistening foam splatters the plain in drops from the horses' pantings.  So you, like the careful helmsman of a ship, secure the city before Ares' blasts storm down upon it; for the wave of their army now crashes over the dry land.<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>Seize the first opportune moment for doing this.  For all else, I, on my part, will keep a reliable eye on the lookout, and you, by learning from my certain report what happens beyond the gates, shall remain unharmed.<stage>Exit.</stage></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<p>O Zeus and Earth, and gods that guard our city,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>and Curse,<note anchored="yes" n="70" resp="Smyth">The curse pronounced by Oedipus against his two sons (cp. 785 ff.) is a daemonic power, here identified with the vengeance it calls into being.</note> potent agent of my father's vengeance, do not destroy my city, ripping it up from its foundations, captive of the enemy, a city that speaks in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>'s tongue, and do not destroy our hearths and homes.<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>May they never hold the free land and city of Cadmus beneath the yoke of slavery! Be our protection! I am certain that what I ask is in our common interest; for a State that prospers pays honors to its gods.<stage>Exit Eteocles, with citizens.

<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>In terror I wail loud cries of sorrow.  Their army is let loose!  Leaving camp,<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>&mdash;look!&mdash;the mounted throng floods swiftly ahead.  The dust whirling in the air tells me this is so&mdash;its message is speechless, yet clear and true.</p>
<p>And now the plains of my native land under the blows of hooves send a roar to my ears; the sound flies<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>and rumbles like a resistless torrent crashing down a mountainside.</p>
<p>Ah, ah, you gods and goddesses, raise your war cry over our walls to drive away the onrushing evil!</p>
<p>The army of the white shield,<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>ready for battle, rushes at full speed against the city.</p>
<p>Who then will rescue us, which of the gods or goddesses will help?</p>
<p>Or shall I fall in supplication at the feet<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>of our ancestral gods' statues?</p>
<p>Ah, blessed gods, firmly enthroned, the time has come to hold fast to your statues.  Why do we delay, who are much to be lamented?<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>Do you hear the clash of shields, or does it escape you? When, if not now, shall we place sacred robes and wreaths on the statues to accompany our prayers?</p>
<p>I see the clash&mdash;it is not the clatter of a single spear.  What will you do? Will you betray<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>your own land, Ares, where you have dwelt since long ago?  God of the golden helmet, look, look upon the city that you once cherished!</p></sp></div1>

<p>Oh come all you gods who guard our city and its land!<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>See this suppliant band of maidens praying to be saved from slavery.  A torrent of men, their helmet plumes tossing, crashes around the city,<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>sped on by the blasts of Ares.  No! Father Zeus, all-accomplishing, fend from us altogether capture at the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>The Argives encircle the citadel of Cadmus.  Terror of their weapons of war shakes us, as the bridles in the horse's jaws rattle the sound of death.

<p>Ah! Ah! A hail of stones strikes our battlements from afar.  O beloved Apollo!<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>There is the clang of bronze-bound shields at the gates.

<div1 type="card" n="166">

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>All-powerful divinities, you gods and goddesses who wield the power to guard the towers of our land, do not betray our city that now toils under the spear<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>to an alien-tongued army.  Hear us, hear, as is right, the prayers we maidens offer with outstretched hands.</p></sp></div1>

<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Beloved spirits,<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>encompass the city to deliver it from ruin and show that you love it.

<div1 type="card" n="181">

<milestone unit="episode"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<p>You intolerable things! I ask you, is this the best way to save the city? Does it hearten our army here besieged,<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/>when you fall before the images of the gods that guard the city and shout and shriek&mdash;behavior that moderate people despise? May I never share my home with the female race, neither in time of evil nor in pleasant prosperity! When things go well for her, her boldness is unbearable,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/>but when she is afraid, she is an even greater evil for home and city.  So now your cries as you rushed here and there in panicked flight have rattled the citizens into dispirited cowardice.  The cause of the enemy outside our gates is excellently strengthened by your behavior, while we inside are ruined by our own people.<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/>This is the sort of trouble you will have if you dwell with women.  Now if anyone fails to obey my authority&mdash;whether man or woman or something in between&mdash;a sentence of death will be decreed for him and by no means whatsoever will he escape destruction by stoning at the people's hands.<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>It is for the man to take care of business outside the house; let no woman make decrees in those matters.  Keep inside and do no harm! Do you hear me or not? Am I speaking to the deaf?</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="203">

<milestone unit="choral"/>
<milestone unit="strophe" n="1"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Dear son of Oedipus, I grew afraid when I heard the clatter of the crashing chariots,<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>when the hubs screamed as they whirled around the wheel, and when I heard the sound of the steering gear, fire-forged bits, in the horses' mouths.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<p>Well, then, has a helmsman ever found a way to safety by fleeing from stern to prow,<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>when his ship is foundering in high seas?</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="211">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="1"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>But trusting in the gods I came in haste to their ancient statues, when the deadly blizzard of falling stones thundered against the gates.  Just then I set out in fear to pray to the Blessed Ones<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>that they spread their protection over the city.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<p>Pray that the rampart withstand the enemy spear.  Yes, the outcome is in the gods' hands&mdash;but then, it is said that the gods of a captured city abandon it.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="219">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="2"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Never so long as I live may this divine assembly abandon us,<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>nor may I live to see the city overrun and the army seizing it with hostile fire!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<p>When you invoke the gods, do not be ill-advised.  For Obedience is<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>the mother of Success, wife of Salvation&mdash;as the saying goes.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="226">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="2"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>So she is, but the power of god is supreme, and often in bad times it raises the helpless man out of harsh misery even when stormclouds are lowering over his eyes.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>It is the man's duty to offer victims and sacrifices to the gods when they test their enemy; your duty is to be silent and to remain inside the house.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="233">
<milestone unit="strophe" n="3"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>By the will of the gods we inhabit an unconquered city, and the rampart withstands the enemy throng.<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>What indignation makes you resent this?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<p>I do not begrudge your honor of the divine race; but lest you make the citizens cowardly, be calm and do not be overly fearful.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="239">
<milestone unit="antistrophe" n="3"/>
<sp><speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>When I heard the strange and jumbled clashes,<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>I came in trembling fear to this citadel, our seat of worship.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<p>If, then, you hear that men are dying or wounded, do not seize on the news with loud wailing.  For this is the food of Ares, human blood.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="245">

<p>Hear them, then, but not too clearly.</p></sp>

<p>The city groans from deep in the earth, as though we are surrounded.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<p>Surely it is enough that I am making plans for this?</p></sp>

<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>I am terrified&mdash;the crashing at the gates is increasing.</p></sp>

<p>Why are your words ill-omened, when you still grasp the gods' statues?</p></sp>

<p>In my weakness fear controls my tongue.</p></sp>

<p>Please state it as quickly as possible, and I will quickly know what to do.</p></sp>

<p>Be silent, wretched woman; do not terrify your own men.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>I am silent.  I will suffer what is destined together with the others.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<p>I welcome this sentiment of yours over what you said before.<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>And in addition, keep your distance from the gods' images and make a stronger prayer, that the gods fight on our side.  And once you have heard my prayers, then sing the victory song, the sacred cry of joy and goodwill, our Greek ritual of shouting in tribute,<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line"/>that brings courage to our friends and dissolves fear of the enemy.</p>
<p>And now<stage>Here Eteocles makes his vow.</stage> to the gods who guard our city's land, both those who dwell in the plain and those who watch over its meeting-place, to Dirce's springs and the waters of Ismenus, I vow that, if things go well and the city is saved,<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>the citizens shall redden the gods' altars with the blood of sheep and sacrifice bulls to the gods&mdash;this is my vow&mdash;and offer trophies, while I will crown their holy temples with the spoil of the enemy's spear-pierced garments.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line"/>Make this kind of prayer to the gods, without your previous lamentation, nor with wild and useless panting; for you will not escape your destiny any the more.  As for me, I will go station six men, with me as the seventh, as champions to oppose the enemy in proud fashion<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line"/>at the seven exits in the wall, even before speedy messengers or swift-rushing reports arrive and inflame us with urgent need.<stage>Exit.</stage></p></sp></div1>

<p>The scout, I believe,<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line"/>is bringing some fresh news of the army to us, my friends, since the joints of his legs are hastily speeding as they carry him on his mission.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>LEADER OF THE SECOND HALF-CHORUS</speaker>
<p>And, indeed, here is our lord himself, the son of Oedipus, at the right moment to hear the messenger's report.  Haste makes his stride uneven, too.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Scout</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line"/>It is with certain knowledge that I will give my account of the enemy's actions, how each man according to lot has been posted at the gates.  Tydeus is already storming opposite the Proetid gates; but the seer will not allow him to ford the Ismenus because the omens from the sacrifices are not favorable.<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line"/>Yet Tydeus, raging and eager for battle, shouts like a serpent hissing at high noon, and lashes skilled Oecles' son, with the taunt that he cringes in cowardice before death and battle.  With such cries he shakes three overshadowing plumes,<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line"/>his helmet's mane, while from under his shield, bells forged of bronze therein ring out a fearsome clang.  He has this haughty symbol on his shield: a well-crafted sky, ablaze with stars, and the brightness of the full moon shining in the center of the shield,<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line"/>the moon that is the most revered of the stars, the eye of night.  Raving so in his arrogant armor, he shouts beside the river-bank, craving battle, like some charger that fiercely champs at the bit as he waits in eagerness for the trumpet's war-cry.<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line"/>Whom will you send against him? Who will be capable of standing as our champion at the Proetid gate when its bars are loosened?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<p>I would not tremble before any mere ornaments on a man.  Nor can signs and symbols wound and kill&mdash;crests and bell have no bite without the spear.<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line"/>And regarding this "night" which you describe on his shield, sparkling with heaven's stars&mdash;perhaps the folly of it might yield to one some prophetic understanding.  For should night fall on this man's eyes as he dies, then to its bearer this arrogant symbol<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line"/>would prove rightly and justly named; and it is against himself that he will have prophesied this outrageous violence.  Now as for me, against Tydeus I will station the trusty son of Astacus as defender of this gate, since he is full noble and<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line"/>reveres the throne of Honor and detests proud speech.  He is slow to act disgracefully, and he has no cowardly nature.  His race springs from the men sown of the dragon's teeth, from one of those whom Ares spared, and so Melanippus is truly born of our land.  Ares will decide the outcome with a throw of the dice;<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line"/>but Justice, his kin by blood, indeed sends this man forth to keep the enemy spear from the mother that gave him birth.<stage>Exit Melanippus.</stage></p></sp></div1>

<p>Yes, may the gods so grant success to this man.  Capaneus is stationed at the Electran gates, another giant of a man, greater than the one described before.<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line"/>But his boast is too proud for a mere human, and he makes terrifying threats against our battlements&mdash;which, I hope, chance will not fulfil! For he says he will utterly destroy the city with god's will or without it, and that not even conflict with Zeus, though it should fall before him in the plain, will stand in his way.<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line"/>The god's lightning and thunderbolts he compares to midday heat.

<p>Now I will tell you about the man who next drew station at the gates.  The third lot leaped out of the upturned bronze helmet for Eteoclus,<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>to hurl his band against the Neistan gates.  He whirls his horses as they snort through their bridles, eager to fall against the gate.

<p>Another, the fourth, has the gate near Onca Athena and takes his stand with a shout, Hippomedon, tremendous in form and figure.  I shuddered in fear as he spun a huge disk&mdash;the circle of his shield, I mean&mdash;<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line"/>I cannot deny it.  The symbol-maker who put the design on his shield was no lowly craftsman: the symbol is Typhon, spitting out of his fire-breathing mouth a dark, thick smoke, the darting sister of fire.<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line"/>And the rim of the hollow-bellied shield is fastened all around with snaky braids.  The warrior himself has raised the war-cry and, inspired by Ares he raves for battle like a maenad, with a look to inspire fear.  We must put up a good defense against the assault of such a man,<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line"/>for already Rout is boasting of victory at the gate.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Eteocles</speaker>
<p>First Onca Pallas, who dwells near the city, close by the gate, and who loathes outrageousness in a man, will fend him off like a dangerous snake away from nestlings.  Moreover, Hyperbius, Oenops' trusty son,<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line"/>is chosen to match him, man to man, as he is eager to search out his fate in the crisis that chance has wrought&mdash;neither in form, nor spirit nor in the wielding of his arms does he bear reproach.  Hermes<note anchored="yes" n="508" resp="Smyth">Hermes presided over contests and lots.</note> has appropriately pitted them against each other.  For the man is hostile to the man he faces in battle,<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line"/>and the gods on their shields also meet as enemies.  The one has fire-breathing Typhon, while father Zeus stands upright on Hyperbius' shield, his lightening bolt aflame in his hand.  And no one yet has seen Zeus conquered.<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line"/>Such then is the favor of the divine powers: we are with the victors, they with the vanquished, if Zeus in fact proves stronger in battle than Typhon.  And it is likely that the mortal adversaries will fare as do their gods; and so, in accordance with the symbol,<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line"/>Zeus will be a savior for Hyperbius since he resides on his shield.<stage>Exit Hyperbius.</stage></p></sp></div1>

    <p>Let it be so! Next I describe the fifth man who is stationed at the fifth, the Northern gate opposite the tomb of Amphion, Zeus's son.  He swears by his spear which, in his confidence, he holds more to be revered than a god<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line"/>and more precious than his eyes, that he will sack the city of the Cadmeans in spite of Zeus.  He says this, the beautiful child of a mountain-bred mother&mdash;a warrior, half man, half boy, and his beard's first growth is just now advancing on his cheeks,<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line"/> his youth in first bloom, thick, upspringing hair.

As for me, I will enrich this earth, a seer interred beneath enemy soil.  Let us fight! I anticipate no dishonorable death.&rdquo;<milestone ed="p" n="590" unit="line"/>So the seer spoke as untroubled he held his all-bronze shield.  No symbol was fixed to his shield's circle.  For he does not wish to appear the bravest, but to be the bravest, as he harvests the fruit of his mind's deep furrow, where his careful resolutions grow.<milestone ed="p" n="595" unit="line"/>I advise you to send wise and brave opponents against him.  He who reveres the gods is to be feared.</p></sp>

<p> Ah, the pity of fate's omen when it makes a just man associate with the irreverent! In all things, nothing is more evil<milestone ed="p" n="600" unit="line"/>than evil partnership. Its fruit should not be gathered in: the field of recklessness yields a harvest of death.  For it may be that a pious man, embarked shipboard with sailors hot for some crime, perishes along with the sort of men hated by the gods;<milestone ed="p" n="605" unit="line"/>or, a man, though upright himself, when among fellow-citizens who hate all strangers and neglect the gods, may fall undeserving into the same trap as they, and be subdued, struck by the scourge of God that strikes all alike.</p>

<p>It is my duty to announce the will and decrees of the council on behalf of the people of this our Cadmean city.</p>
<p>It is decreed, first, that Eteocles here, on account of his goodwill towards the city, is to be buried in a kindly grave in its soil;<milestone ed="p" n="1015" unit="line"/>for hating the enemy he chose death in the city and driven by piety towards his ancestral shrines, he died without reproach where it is an honor for the young to die.  This is how I was commanded to speak regarding him.  But as for his brother, it is decreed that this corpse of Polyneices<milestone ed="p" n="1020" unit="line"/>is to be cast out of the city unburied to be torn by dogs, since he would have been the destroyer of the land of the Cadmeans, if one of the gods had not used his brother's spear to prevent him.  Even in death he will retain the stain of his guilt against his fathers' gods, whom he dishonored<milestone ed="p" n="1025" unit="line"/>when he launched a foreign army against the city to take it.  For this reason it is decreed that he will receive his reward by being buried without honor beneath the winged birds; and that no labor of the hands shall attend him by building up a burial mound nor shall anyone offer him reverence in shrill-sung laments.  <milestone ed="p" n="1030" unit="line"/>He is to be refused the honor of being carried in funeral procession by his loved ones.

<p>I at least will say something to the rulers of the Cadmeans: even if no one else is willing to share in burying him, I will bury him alone and risk the peril<milestone ed="p" n="1035" unit="line"/>of burying my own brother.  Nor am I ashamed to act in defiant opposition to the rulers of the city.  A thing to be held in awe is the common womb from which we were born, of a wretched mother and unfortunate father.  Therefore, my soul, willingly share his evils, even though they are unwilling,<milestone ed="p" n="1040" unit="line"/>and live in kindred spirit with the dead.  No hollow-bellied wolves will tear his flesh&mdash;let no one &ldquo;decree&rdquo; that!

<p>Let it be harsh! This man will not be unburied.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herald</speaker>
<p>What! Will you honor with burial a man whom the city detests?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>For a long time now the gods have ceased to hold him in honor.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herald</speaker>
<p>No, he was honored until he put this land in jeopardy.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1055" unit="line"/>He suffered evil and gave evil in return.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herald</speaker>
<p>But this act was against all the citizens, not only one man.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Antigone</speaker>
<p>Discord is the last of the gods to close an argument.  I will bury him.  Put an end to your big talk.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Herald</speaker>
<p>Well then, follow your own rash plan, but I forbid it.<stage>Exit.</stage></p></sp>

<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Ah, misery!<milestone ed="p" n="1060" unit="line"/>O Erinyes, far-famed destroyers of families, goddesses of death who have thus laid ruin to the family of Oedipus, digging it up from the roots! What will happen to me? What should I do? What plan shall I devise?  How can I have the heart neither to weep for you<milestone ed="p" n="1065" unit="line"/>nor escort you to your tomb? But I am afraid and turn away in terror of the citizens.  You, at least, Eteocles, will have many mourners, while he, wretched man, departs without lamentation<milestone ed="p" n="1070" unit="line"/>and has a dirge sung only by one sister.  Now who could comply with that?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>First Half-Chorus</speaker>
<p>Let the city take action or not take action against those who lament for Polynices.  We, at all events, will go and<milestone ed="p" n="1075" unit="line"/> bury him with her, following the funeral procession.  For this grief is shared by all our race, and the city approves as just different things at different times.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Second Half-Chorus</speaker>
<p>We will go with this other corpse, as the city and justice, too,  approves.<milestone ed="p" n="1080" unit="line"/>For after the blessed gods and powerful Zeus, he it was who saved the city of the Cadmeans from being capsized and flooded by a wave of foreign men&mdash;he beyond all others.<stage>Exeunt omnes.</stage></p></sp>
