<speaker>The Priestess of Pythian Apollo</speaker>
    <p>First, in this prayer of mine, I give the place of highest honor among the gods to the first prophet, Earth; and after her to Themis, for she was the second to take this oracular seat of her mother, as legend tells. And in the third allotment, with Themis' consent and not by force,<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>another Titan, child of Earth, Phoebe, took her seat here. She gave it as a birthday gift to Phoebus, who has his name from Phoebe. Leaving the lake<note anchored="yes" n="9" resp="Smyth">A circular lake in the island of Apollo's birth.</note>and ridge of <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>, he landed on Pallas' ship-frequented shores,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>and came to this region and the dwelling places on <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>. The children of Hephaistos,<note anchored="yes" n="13" resp="Smyth">The Athenians, because Erichthonius, who was identified with Erechtheus, was the son of Hephaestus, who first fashioned axes.</note>road-builders taming the wildness of the untamed land, escorted him with mighty reverence. And at his arrival, the people<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>and Delphus, helmsman and lord of this land, made a great celebration for him. Zeus inspired his heart with prophetic skill and established him as the fourth prophet on this throne; but Loxias is the spokesman of Zeus, his father.</p>
    <p>These are the gods I place in the beginning of my prayer.<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>And Pallas who stands before the temple<note anchored="yes" n="21" resp="Smyth">The shrine of Pallas &ldquo;before the temple,&rdquo; close to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> on the main road leading to the sanctuary of Apollo.</note> is honored in my words; and I worship the Nymphs where the Corycian<note anchored="yes" n="22" resp="Smyth">The Corycian cave, sacred to the Nymphs and Pan, has been identified with a grotto on the great plateau above <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>.</note>rock is hollow, the delight of birds and haunt of gods. Bromius has held the region &mdash;I do not forget him&mdash; ever since he, as a god, led the Bacchantes in war,<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>and contrived for Pentheus death as of a hunted hare. I call on the streams of Pleistus and the strength of Poseidon, and highest Zeus, the Fulfiller; and then I take my seat as prophetess upon my throne. And may they allow me now to have the best fortune, far better than on my previous entrances.<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>And if there are any from among the Hellenes here, let them enter, in turn, by lot, as is the custom. For I prophesy as the god leads.<stage>She enters the temple and after a brief interval returns terror-stricken</stage></p></sp>

<p>Horrors to tell, horrors for my eyes to see, have sent me back from the house of Loxias,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>so that I have no strength and I cannot walk upright. I am running on hands and knees, with no quickness in my limbs; for an old woman, overcome with fright, is nothing, or rather she is like a child.</p>
    <p>I was on my way to the inner shrine, decked with wreaths; I saw on the center-stone<note anchored="yes" n="40" resp="Smyth"> <foreign lang="greek">o)mfalo/s</foreign>&ldquo;navel&rdquo; was the name given by the Delphians to a white stone &lpar;in Aeschylus' time placed in the inmost sanctuary of Apollo&rpar;, which they regarded as marking the exact center of the earth. Near the great altar of Apollo the French excavators of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> discovered a navel-stone. <foreign lang="greek">o)mfalo/s</foreign>is sometimes used of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> itself.</note>a man defiled in the eyes of the gods,<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>occupying the seat of suppliants. His hands were dripping blood; he held a sword just drawn and an olive-branch, from the top of the tree, decorously crowned with a large tuft of wool, a shining fleece; for as to this I can speak clearly.<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/></p>
<p>Before this man an extraordinary band of women slept, seated on thrones. No! Not women, but rather Gorgons I call them; and yet I cannot compare them to forms of Gorgons either. Once before I saw some creatures in a painting,<note anchored="yes" n="50" resp="Smyth">The Harpies.</note><milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>carrying off the feast of Phineus; but these are wingless in appearance, black, altogether disgusting; they snore with repulsive breaths, they drip from their eyes hateful drops; their attire is not fit to bring either before the statues of the gods or into the homes of men.<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>I have never seen the tribe that produced this company, nor the land that boasts of rearing this brood with impunity and does not grieve for its labor afterwards.</p>
<p>Let what is to come now be the concern of the master of this house,<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>powerful Loxias himself. He is a prophet of healing, a reader of portents, and for others a purifier of homes.<stage>Exit</stage>

<p>No! I will not abandon you. Your guardian to the end, close by your side or far removed,<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>I will not be gentle to your enemies.

<p>Sleep on! Aha! Yet what need is there of sleepers? It is due to you that I am thus dishonored among the other dead;<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>because of those I killed the dead never cease to reproach me, and I wander in disgrace. I tell you that I am most greatly accused by them. And yet, although I have suffered cruelly in this way from my nearest kin,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>no divine power is angry on my behalf, slaughtered as I have been by the hands of a matricide.

<p>Truly, you have lapped up many of my offerings&mdash;wineless libations, a sober appeasement; and I have sacrificed banquets in the solemn night upon a hearth of fire at an hour unshared by any god.

<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>What do you want to say to this, stranger, in turn? After you name your country and family and fortunes, then defend yourself against this charge; if indeed, relying on the justice of your case, you sit clinging to my image near my hearth,<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>as a sacred suppliant, like Ixion.<note anchored="yes" n="441" resp="Smyth">Ixion, king of the Lapiths, murdered the father of his bride, and was given purification by Zeus after having been denied by the other gods.

<sp>
<speaker>Orestes</speaker>
<p>Lady Athena, first of all I will take away a great anxiety from your last words. I am not a suppliant in need of purification, nor did I sit at your image with pollution on my hands.<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>I will give you strong proof of this.

    <p>And so I declare that this concern is out of the way. As to my family, you will soon learn. I am an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName>; my father&mdash;you rightly inquire about him<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>&mdash;was Agamemnon, the commander of the naval forces; along with him, you made <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, the city of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilion</placeName>, to be no city. He did not die nobly, after he came home; but my black-hearted mother killed him after she covered him in a crafty snare that still remains to witness his murder in the bath.<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>And when I came back home, having been an exile in the time before, I killed the woman who gave birth to me, I will not deny it, as the penalty in return for the murder of my dearly-loved father. Together with me Loxias is responsible for this deed,<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line"/>because he threatened me with pains, a goad for my heart, if I should fail to do this deed to those who were responsible. You judge whether I acted justly or not; whatever happens to me at your hands, I will be content.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="470">
<sp>
<speaker>Athena</speaker>
<p>The matter is too great, if any mortal thinks to pass judgment on it;<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line"/>no, it is not lawful even for me to decide on cases of murder that is followed by the quick anger of the Furies, especially since you, by rites fully performed, have come a pure and harmless suppliant to my house; and so I respect you, since you do not bring harm to my city.<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line"/>Yet these women have an office that does not permit them to be dismissed lightly; and if they fail to win their cause, the venom from their resentment will fall upon the ground, an intolerable, perpetual plague afterwards in the land.</p>
<p>So stands the case:<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>either course&mdash;to let them stay, to drive them out&mdash;brings disaster and perplexity to me. But since this matter has fallen here, I will select judges of homicide bound by oath, and I will establish this tribunal for all time.

<p>Zeus, as you say, gave you this oracular command, to tell Orestes here to avenge his father's murder but to take no account at all of the honor due his mother?</p></sp>

<p>Yes, for it is not the same thing&mdash;the murder of a noble man,<milestone ed="p" n="625" unit="line"/>honored by a god-given scepter, and his murder indeed by a woman, not by rushing arrows sped from afar, as if by an Amazon, but as you will hear, Pallas, and those who are sitting to decide by vote in this matter.<milestone ed="p" n="630" unit="line"/></p>

<p>This was his death, as I have told it to you&mdash;the death of a man wholly majestic, commander of the fleet. As for that woman, I have described her in such a way as to whet the indignation of the people who have been appointed to decide this case.</p></sp></div1>

Or. 552</bibl>; Frag. 1064, the Pythagoreans cited by Stobaeus &lpar;Hense ii. 72&rpar;.
