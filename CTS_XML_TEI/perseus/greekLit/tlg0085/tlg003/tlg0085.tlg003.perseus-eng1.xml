<div1 type="card" n="1">
<stage>Enter Power and Force, bringing with them the captive Prometheus; also Hephaestus.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p>To earth's remotest limit we come, to the Scythian land, an untrodden solitude.  And now, Hephaestus, yours is the charge to observe the mandates laid upon you by the Father&mdash;to clamp this miscreant<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>upon the high craggy rocks in shackles of binding adamant that cannot be broken. For your own flower,  flashing fire, source of all arts, he has purloined and bestowed upon mortal creatures.  Such is his offence; for this he is bound to make requital to the gods,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>so that he may learn to bear with the sovereignty of Zeus and cease his man-loving ways.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>Power and Force, for you indeed the behest of Zeus is now fulfilled, and nothing remains to stop you.  But for me&mdash;I do not have the nerve myself<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>to bind with force a kindred god upon this rocky cleft assailed by cruel winter.  Yet, come what may, I am constrained to summon courage to this deed; for it is perilous to disregard the commandments of the Father.</p>
<p>Lofty-minded son of Themis who counsels straight, against my will, no less than yours, I must rivet you with brazen bonds<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>no hand can loose to this desolate crag, where neither voice nor form of mortal man shall you perceive; but, scorched by the sun's bright beams, you shall lose the fair bloom of your flesh.  And glad you shall be when spangled-robed night shall veil his brightness and<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>when the sun shall scatter again the frost of morning.  Evermore the burden of your present ill shall wear you out; for your deliverer is not yet born.</p>
<p>Such is the prize you have gained for your championship of man.  For, god though you are, you did not fear the wrath of the gods, but<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>you bestowed honors upon mortal creatures beyond their due.  Therefore on this joyless rock you must stand sentinel, erect, sleepless, your knee unbent.  And many a groan and unavailing lament you shall utter; for the heart of Zeus is hard,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>and everyone is harsh whose power is new.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="36">
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p>Well, why delay and excite pity in vain?  Why do you not detest a god most hateful to the gods, since he has betrayed your prerogative to mortals?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>A strangely potent tie is kinship, and companionship as well.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>I agree; yet to refuse to obey the commands of the Father; is this possible?  Do you not fear that more?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>Yes, you are ever pitiless and steeped in insolence.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p>Yes, for it does not good to bemoan this fellow.  Stop wasting  your labor at an unprofitable task.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>Oh handicraft that I hate so much!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p>Why hate it?  Since in truth your craft is in no way to blame for these present troubles.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>Nevertheless, i wish it had fallen to another's lot!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p>Every job is troublesome except to be the commander of gods;<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>no one is free except Zeus.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>I know it by this task; I cannot deny it.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p>Hurry then to cast the fetters about him, so that the Father does not see you loitering.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>Well, there then!  The bands are ready, as you may see.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>Cast them about his wrists and with might strike with your hammer; rivet him to the rocks.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>There!  The work is getting done and not improperly.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p>Strike harder, clamp him tight, leave nothing loose; for he is wondrously clever at finding a way even out of desperate straits.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>This arm, at least, is fixed permanently.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="61">
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p>Now rivet this one too and securely, so that he may learn, for all his cleverness, that he is a fool compared to Zeus.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>None but he could justly blame my work.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p>Now drive the adamantine wedge's stubborn edge straight<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>through his chest with your full force.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>Alas, Prometheus, I groan for your sufferings.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p>What! Shrinking again and groaning over the enemies of Zeus?  Take care, so that the day  does not come when  you shall grieve for yourself.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>You see a spectacle grievous for eyes to behold.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>I see this man getting his deserts. Come, cast the girths about his sides.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>I must do this;  spare me your needless ordering.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p>Indeed, I'll order you, yes and more&mdash;I'll hound you on.  Get down below, and ring his legs by force.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>There now!  The work's done and without much labor.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p>Now hammer the piercing fetters with your full force; for the appraiser of our work is severe.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>The utterance of your tongue matches your looks.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
<p>Be softhearted then,<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>but do not attack my stubborn will and my harsh mood.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hephaestus</speaker>
<p>Let us be gone, since he has got the fetters on his limbs.<stage>Exit</stage></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Power</speaker>
    <p>There now, indulge your insolence, keep on wresting from the gods their honors to give them to creatures of a day.  Are mortals able to lighten your load of sorrow?<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>Falsely the gods call you Prometheus,<note anchored="yes" n="85" resp="Smyth">Such etymologizing &ldquo;play&rdquo; &lpar;Pro-metheus, <emph>Fore-thought</emph>&rpar; was a serious matter to the Greeks, who found in the name of a person a significant indication of his nature or his fate.

<milestone unit="episode"/>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Unfold the whole story and tell us upon what charge Zeus has caught you and painfully punishes you with such dishonor.  Instruct us, unless, indeed, there is some harm in telling.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>It is painful to me to tell the tale,<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line"/>painful to keep it silent. My case is unfortunate every way.</p>
<p>When first the heavenly powers were moved to wrath, and mutual dissension was stirred up among them&mdash;some bent on casting Cronus from his seat so Zeus, in truth, might reign; others, eager for<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line"/>the contrary end, that Zeus might never win mastery over the gods&mdash;it was then that I, although advising them for the best, was unable to persuade the Titans, children of Heaven and Earth; but they, disdaining counsels of craft, in the pride of their strength<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line"/>thought to gain the mastery without a struggle and by force.  Often my mother Themis, or Earth &lpar;though one form, she had many names&rpar;, had foretold to me the way in which the future was fated to come to pass. That it was not by brute strength nor through violence,<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line"/>but by guile that those who should gain the upper hand were destined to prevail.  And though I argued all this to them, they did not pay any attention to my words.  With all that before me, it seemed best that, joining with my mother, I should place myself,<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line"/>a welcome volunteer, on the side of Zeus; and it is by reason of my counsel that the cavernous gloom of Tartarus now hides ancient Cronus and his allies within it.  Thus I helped the tyrant of the gods<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line"/>and with this foul payment he has responded; for it is a disease that is somehow inherent in tyranny to have no faith in friends.</p>
<p>However, you ask why he torments me, and this I will now make clear.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line"/>As soon as he had seated himself upon his father's throne, he immediately assigned to the deities their several privileges and apportioned to them their proper powers.  But of wretched mortals he took no notice, desiring to bring<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line"/>the whole race to an end and create a new one in its place.  Against this purpose none dared make stand except me&mdash; I only had the courage; I saved mortals so that they did not descend, blasted utterly, to the house of Hades.  This is why I am bent by such grievous tortures,<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line"/>painful to suffer, piteous to behold.  I who gave mortals first place in my pity, I am deemed unworthy to win this pity for myself, but am in this way mercilessly disciplined, a spectacle that shames the glory of Zeus.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="244">
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Iron-hearted and made of stone, Prometheus,<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line"/>is he who feels no compassion at your miseries. For myself, I would not have desired to see them; and now that I see them, I am pained in my heart.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>Yes, to my friends indeed I am a spectacle of pity.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Did you perhaps transgress even somewhat beyond this offence?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line"/>Yes, I caused mortals to cease foreseeing their doom.<note anchored="yes" n="250" resp="Smyth">&ldquo;Doom&rdquo; here signifies &ldquo;doom of death.&rdquo;</note></p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Of what sort was the cure that you found for this affliction?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>I caused blind hopes to dwell within their breasts.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>A great benefit was this you gave to mortals.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>In addition, I gave them fire.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line"/>What!  Do creatures of a day now have flame-eyed fire?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>Yes, and from it they shall learn many arts.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Then it was on a charge like this that Zeus&mdash;</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>Torments me and in no way gives me respite from pain.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>And is there no end assigned to your ordeal?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line"/>No, none except when it seems good to him.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>But how will it seem good to him?  What hope is there? Do you not see that you have wronged?  And yet it is not pleasant for me to talk about how you have wronged, and for you it is pain.  So, let us quit this theme; and may you seek some release from your ordeal.</p></sp></div1>

<p><milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line"/>It is easy for him who keeps his foot free from harm to counsel and admonish him who is in misery.  I have known this all the while.

And now, bewail no more my present woes; alight on the ground and listen to my<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line"/>oncoming fortunes so that you may be told them from end to end.

<p><milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line"/>Ha!  What have we here?  So then you too have come to stare upon my sufferings?  How did you summon courage to quit the stream that bears your name and the rock-roofed caves you yourself have made and come to this land, the mother of iron? Is it that you have come<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line"/>to gaze upon my state and join your grief to my distress?

<p>I see, Prometheus; and I want to give you<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line"/>the best advice, although you yourself are wily.  Learn to know yourself and adapt  yourself to new ways; for new also is the ruler among the gods. If you hurl forth words so harsh and of such whetted edge, perhaps Zeus may hear you,<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line"/>though throned far off, high in the heavens, and then your present multitude of sorrows shall seem but childish sport.  Oh wretched sufferer!  Put away your wrathful mood and try to find release from these miseries.  Perhaps this advice may seem to you old and dull;<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line"/>but your plight, Prometheus, is only the wages of too boastful speech.  You still have not learned humility, nor do you bend before misfortune, but would rather add even more miseries to those you have.  Therefore take me as your teacher<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line"/>and do not add insult to injury, seeing that a harsh monarch now rules who is accountable to no one.  So now I will depart and see whether I can release you from these sufferings. And may you hold your peace and be not too blustering of speech.<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line"/>Or, can it be that for all your exceeding wisdom, you do not know that chastisement is inflicted on a wagging tongue?</p></sp></div1>

<speaker>Prometheus</speaker>
<p>No, do not think it is from pride or even from wilfulness that I am silent.  Painful thoughts devour my heart as I behold myself maltreated in this way.  And yet who else but I definitely assigned<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line"/>their prerogatives to these upstart gods?  But I do not speak of this; for my tale would tell you nothing except what you know.  Still, listen to the miseries that beset mankind&mdash;how they were witless before and I made them have sense and endowed them with reason.<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line"/>I will not speak to upbraid mankind  but to set forth the friendly purpose that inspired my blessing.</p>
<p>First of all, though they had eyes to see, they saw to no avail; they had ears, but they did not understand ; but, just as shapes in dreams, throughout their length of days,<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line"/>without purpose they wrought all things in confusion. They had neither knowledge of houses built of bricks and turned to face the sun nor yet of work in wood; but dwelt beneath the ground like swarming ants, in sunless caves.  They had no sign either of winter<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line"/>or of flowery spring or of fruitful summer, on which they could depend but managed everything without judgment, until I taught them to discern the risings of the stars and their settings, which are difficult to distinguish.</p>
<p>Yes, and numbers, too, chiefest of sciences,<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line"/>I invented for them, and the combining of letters, creative mother of the Muses' arts, with which to hold all things in memory.  I, too, first brought brute beasts beneath the yoke to be subject to the collar and the pack-saddle, so that they might bear in men's stead their<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line"/>heaviest burdens; and  to the chariot I harnessed horses and made them obedient to the rein, to be an image of wealth and luxury. It was I and no one else who invented the mariner's flaxen-winged car that roams the sea.</p>
<p>Wretched that I am&mdash;such are the arts I devised<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line"/>for mankind, yet have myself no cunning means to rid me of my present suffering.</p></sp></div1>

This first and foremost:  if ever man fell ill, there was no defence&mdash;no healing food,<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>no ointment, nor any drink&mdash;but for lack of medicine they wasted away, until I showed them how to mix soothing remedies with which they now ward off all their disorders.  And I marked out many ways by which they might read the future,<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line"/>and among dreams I first discerned which are destined to come true; and voices baffling interpretation I explained to them, and signs from chance meetings.  The flight of crook-taloned birds I distinguished clearly&mdash; which by nature are auspicious,<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line"/>which sinister&mdash;their various modes of life, their mutual feuds and loves, and their consortings; and the smoothness of their entrails, and what color the gall must have to please<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line"/>the gods, also the speckled symmetry of the liver-lobe; and the thigh-bones, wrapped in fat, and the long chine I burned and initiated mankind into an occult art.  Also I cleared their vision to discern signs from flames,which were obscure before this.<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line"/>Enough about these arts.  Now as to the benefits to men that lay concealed beneath the earth&mdash;bronze, iron, silver, and gold&mdash;who would claim to have discovered them before me?

<p><milestone ed="p" n="655" unit="line"/>By such dreams was I, to my distress, beset night after night, until at last I gained courage to tell my father of the dreams that haunted me.

Do not approach them, but keeping your feet near the rugged shore, where the sea breaks with a roar, pass on beyond their land.

This you must leave with stout heart and pass through the channel of Maeotis; and ever after among mankind there shall be great mention of your passing, and it shall be called after you the <placeName key="tgn,1115068">Bosporus</placeName>.<note anchored="yes" n="733" resp="Smyth"><foreign lang="greek">*Bo/sporos</foreign>, by popular etymology derived from <foreign lang="greek">bou=s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">po/ros</foreign>, &ldquo;passing of the cow,&rdquo;  is, according to Wecklein, a Thracian form of <foreign lang="greek">*fwsfo/ros</foreign>, &ldquo;light-bearing,&rdquo; an epithet of the goddess Hecate.

Never think that, through terror at the will of Zeus, I shall become womanish and, with hands upturned, aping woman's ways,<milestone ed="p" n="1005" unit="line"/>shall importune my greatly hated enemy to release me from these bonds.  I am far, far from that.</p></sp></div1>

<speaker>Hermes</speaker>
<p>I think that by speaking much I will only speak in vain; for you are not soothed nor are you softened by my entreaties.  You take the bit in your teeth like a new-harnessed<milestone ed="p" n="1010" unit="line"/>colt and struggle against the reins.  Yet it is a paltry device that prompts your vehemence, for in the foolish-minded mere self-will of itself avails less than anything at all.  But if you will not be won to belief by my words,<milestone ed="p" n="1015" unit="line"/>think of what a tempest and a towering wave of woe shall break upon you past escape.  First, the Father will shatter this jagged cliff with thunder and lightning-flame, and will entomb your frame, while the rock shall still hold you clasped in its embrace.<milestone ed="p" n="1020" unit="line"/>But when you have completed a long stretch of time, you shall come back again to the light.  Then indeed the winged hound of Zeus, the ravening eagle, coming an unbidden banqueter the whole day long, with savage appetite shall tear your body piecemeal into great rents and feast his fill<milestone ed="p" n="1025" unit="line"/>upon your liver until it is black with gnawing.</p>
<p>Look for no term of this your agony until some god shall appear to take upon himself your woes and of his own free will descend into the sunless realm of Death and the dark deeps of Tartarus.</p>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="1030" unit="line"/>Therefore be advised, since this is no counterfeited vaunting but utter truth; for the mouth of Zeus does not know how to utter falsehood, but will bring to pass every word.  May you consider warily and reflect, and never deem<milestone ed="p" n="1035" unit="line"/>stubbornness better than wise counsel.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>To us, at least, Hermes seems not to speak untimely; for he bids you to  lay aside your stubbornness and seek the good counsel of wisdom.  Be advised! It is shameful for the wise to persist in error.</p></sp></div1>

<p><milestone ed="p" n="1040" unit="line"/>No news to me, in truth, is the message this fellow has proclaimed so noisily.Yet for enemy to suffer ill from enemy is no disgrace.  Therefore let the lightning's forked curl be cast upon my head and let the sky<milestone ed="p" n="1045" unit="line"/>be convulsed with thunder and the wrack of savage winds; let the hurricane shake the earth from its rooted base, and let the waves of the sea mingle with their savage surge the courses<milestone ed="p" n="1050" unit="line"/>of the stars in heaven; and let him lift me on high and hurl me down to black Tartarus with the swirling floods of stern Necessity: do what he will, me he shall never bring to death.</p></sp>

<p>Such indeed are the thoughts and the words<milestone ed="p" n="1055" unit="line"/>one hears from men deranged.  Where does his prayer fall short of raving?  Where does he abate his frenzy?&mdash;But, at all events, may you who sympathize with his anguish,<milestone ed="p" n="1060" unit="line"/>withdraw in haste from this spot so that  the relentless roar of the thunder does not stun your senses.</p></sp>

<speaker>Chorus</speaker>
<p>Use some other strain and urge me to some other course in which you are likely to convince me. This utterance<milestone ed="p" n="1065" unit="line"/>in your flood of speech is, I think, past all endurance.  How do you charge me to practise baseness?  With him I am content to suffer any fate; for I have learned to detest traitors, and there is no pest<milestone ed="p" n="1070" unit="line"/>I abhor more than this.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Hermes</speaker>
<p>Well then, bear my warning in memory and do not blame your fortune when you are caught in the toils of calamity; nor ever say that it was Zeus who cast you<milestone ed="p" n="1075" unit="line"/>into suffering unforeseen.  Not so, but blame yourselves.  For well forewarned, and not suddenly or secretly shall you be entangled in the inextricable net of calamity by reason of your folly.<stage>Exit</stage></p></sp></div1>
