                <p>Pyrrhus had adopted one of his sister's two sons, Endius, who enjoyed the estate
                    for more than twenty years and then died. Xenocles then sued for the property in
                    the name of Phile, his wife, and declared upon oath that she was a legitimate
                    daughter of Pyrrhus, the succession being claimed by Endius's mother. Xenocles
                    was convicted of perjury. Nicodemus had also borne witness that he had given his
                    daughter in legal marriage to Pyrrhus and that Phile was her child. The brother
                    of Endius declares that while Phile is illegitimate, having been the child of
                    Pyrrhus by a mistress, and that she was given as such in marriage to Xenocles.
                    The question at issue is one of fact, and the action a charge of perjury against
                    Nicodemus. </p>

                    not adjudicable to our mother, because Pyrrhus, to whom it originally belonged,
                    had a legitimate daughter. We denounced his protestation and brought before you
                    the man who had the audacity to make it; </p>

                <p>and, having clearly convicted him of having given false evidence, we obtained
                    from you a verdict for perjury against him. At the same time we convicted
                    Nicodemus, the present defendant, before the same judges, of the most shameless
                    lying in the evidence which he then gave, since he had the impudence to bear
                    witness that he had given his sister in marriage to our uncle in the proper
                    legal manner. </p>

            <div n="5" type="section">
                <p>That in the former trial Nicodemus's evidence was recognized as being false, the

                        Xenocles.</note> on that occasion most clearly proves. For if the present
                    defendant had not been recognized as having given false evidence, the other
                    witness would have been acquitted in the suit about the protestation, and the
                    woman whom the protestation affirmed to be my uncle's legitimate daughter would
                    have been established as his heiress instead of our mother. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
                <p>But since the witness was convicted and the woman who claimed to be Pyrrhus's
                    legitimate daughter abandoned her pretensions to the estate, it follows by
                    absolute necessity that Nicodemus's evidence has been also condemned; for,
                    having solemnly sworn to the truth of the same proposition, he was a party to
                    the action for perjury which was to decide whether the woman who claimed my
                    uncle's estate was the issue of a legitimate wife or of a mistress. You, too,
                    will realize that this is so when you have heard our affidavit,<note resp="Loeb"

                    has now been shown that it was immediately apparent to all at the time that
                    Nicodemus committed perjury; but it is proper that the falsity of his evidence
                    should be proved before you also who are about to give your verdict on this very

                <p>But I desire first to ask some questions. He has deposed that he married his
                    sister to a man who possessed a fortune of three talents; what dowry does he
                    allege that he gave with her? Next, did this wedded wife leave her husband
                    during his lifetime or quit his house after his death?<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="true">A widow might either remain in her late husband's house, if
                        there were no children, or return to the house of her legal representative

                        the return of her dowry or the payment of interest upon it for her
                        maintenance.</note> And from whom did the defendant recover his sister's
                    dowry after the death of him to whom he has deposed that he gave her in
                    marriage? </p>
            </div>
            <div n="9" type="section">
                <p>Or, if he did not recover it, what action did he think fit to institute to obtain
                    her maintenance or the restitution of her dowry against the man who was for
                    twenty years the tenant of the estate? Or did he ever, during all that long
                    period, go and make any claim upon the heir regarding his sister's dowry in the
                    presence of any witness? I should be glad to learn what was the reason why none
                    of these steps has been taken in favor of a woman, who, according to the
                    defendant's evidence, was legally married. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="10" type="section">
                <p>Furthermore, has anyone else taken this man's sister in legal marriage, either of
                    those who had dealings with her before she knew our uncle, or of those who
                    associated with her during his acquaintance with her, or of those who did so
                    after his decease? For it is clear that her brother has given her in marriage on
                    the same terms to all those associated with her. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="11" type="section">
                <p>If it were necessary to enumerate all these persons one by one, it would amount
                    to no small a task. If you bid me do so, I would mention some of them; but if it
                    is as unpleasant to some of you to hear as it is to me to mention such matters,
                    I will content myself with producing the actual depositions made at the previous
                    trial, none of which they thought fit to contest. Yet when once they have
                    themselves admitted that the woman was at the disposal of anyone who wished to
                    take her, how can it be reasonably conceived that she was also a wedded wife?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div n="12" type="section">
                <p>And indeed, since they have never impeached the evidence on this very point, they
                    have in fact admitted all this. You, too, when you have heard the actual
                    depositions, will understand that the defendant has obviously borne false
                    witness, and that those who judged the case gave a proper and a legal sentence
                    when they decided that the estate could not pass to a woman of irregular birth.
                    Read the depositions; and you, please stop the water-clock.<quote

                    and by the neighbors of Pyrrhus, who have given evidence of quarrels, serenades,
                    and frequent scenes of disorder which the defendant's sister occasioned whenever

                    fit to make any protest against the evidence of any of those who testified to

                    persons who have given evidence that this woman, whom the defendant has deposed
                    that he gave in marriage to our uncle, was common to all who wished to associate
                    with her, and that she obviously was never married to or lived permanently with
                    anyone else. Let us next consider the circumstances in which it might be
                    conceived that a marriage with such a woman might take place, supposing that
                    such a thing really did happen to our uncle; </p>

                    to control their passion, have been induced by folly to ruin themselves in this
                    way. How then can one obtain a clearer knowledge as to what happened than by a
                    consideration of the evidence submitted in favor of our opponents in the former
                    trial and the probabilities of the case itself? </p>

            <div n="18" type="section">
                <p>Now consider the impudence of their assertions. The man, who was, according to
                    his own account, about to marry his sister to a man with a fortune of three
                    talents, when he was arranging a matter of such importance, represents that only
                    one witness was present on his behalf, namely, Pyretides, whose written
                        deposition<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">When a witness was ill or
                        abroad, his evidence duly attested, might be submitted in writing.</note>
                    was produced by the other side in the previous trial. This deposition Pyretides
                    has disavowed and refuses to admit that he made any deposition or has any
                    knowledge of the truth of any of the facts which it contains. </p>

                <p>We have here a striking indication that this deposition produced by our opponents
                    is certainly forged. You all know that, when we are proceeding to a deliberate
                    act which necessitates the presence of witnesses, we habitually take with us our
                    closest acquaintances and most intimate friends as witnesses of such acts; but
                    of unforeseen acts carried out on the spur of the moment, we always call in the
                    testimony of any chance persons. </p>

                    negligence in the affair was not surprising. How so, when the trial for perjury,
                    in which Xenocles was defendant, turned upon this very point, as to whether his
                    own wife was the child of a concubine or of a legitimate wife? To attest a

                    before two chance witnesses; Nicodemus, however, the present defendant, says
                    that, when he married his sister to a man with a fortune of three talents, he

                    It appears to me, judging from probabilities, that Pyrrhus would have been much
                    more likely to wish to keep the matter secret from all his friends, if he was
                    meditating the making of a contract or the commission of an act discreditable to
                    his family, rather than summon his own uncles as witnesses of so outrageous an

                    hand, if Nicodemus gave a dowry, it would have been only natural that the amount
                    of the dowry should be mentioned in the evidence of those who allege that they
                    were present; on the other hand, if our uncle, under the influence of his
                    passion, contracted a marriage with a woman of this character, clearly he who
                    gave her in marriage would have been all the more careful to procure an
                    agreement from the other party stating that he received money with her, so that
                    it might not be in the latter's power easily to get rid of the woman whenever he

                    such unions are very seldom permanent. The man, then, who alleges that he gave
                    his sister in marriage, declares that he married her to a man with a fortune of
                    three talents without any agreement about a dowry, and the uncles have given

                    the man who gave the money cannot, as far as the law is concerned, demand back

                    all the time that in the past she had produced no offspring, and though the

                    ignoring the long tenancy of the last heir. For Pyrrhus has been dead for more
                    than twenty years, whereas Endius died in the month of Metageitnion<note

                    estate to Phile, whom they allege to have been a legitimate daughter left by
                    Pyrrhus. Yet, as I have already said, when testators leave legitimate issue,
                    their children need not demand the adjudication of their patrimony; but, on the
                    contrary, when testators adopt children by will, such children must obtain an

                    them whether any legitimate child ever thinks of requesting the court to
                    adjudicate to him what is his own. These are the questions with which you should
                    oppose their impudence. That the woman could be legally claimed by her
                    next-of-kin, if she was really a legitimate daughter of the deceased, appears
                    most evidently from the laws. </p>

                    property with his daughters, but he may not either adopt a son or leave any of
                    his possessions to anyone without also disposing of his legitimate daughters.

                    had a single relative nearer than us; for he had no brother or brother's sons,
                    and we were the children of his sister. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="73" type="section">
                <p>But, it may be urged, he might have adopted some other kinsman and given him the
                    possession of his estate and his daughter. Yet what need had he openly to incur
                    the enmity of any one of his relatives, when it was in his power, if he had
                    really married the sister of Nicodemus, to introduce the child, who has been
                    declared to be her offspring, to the members of his ward as his own legitimate
                    child, and leave her sole heiress to all his estate and direct that one of her
                    sons should be introduced as his adopted son? </p>
            </div>
            <div n="74" type="section">
                <p>For it is clear that, if he left her sole heiress, he would have been fully aware
                    that one of two things was likely to happen to her: either one of us, the
                    nearest relatives, would obtain an adjudication and take her as wife; or, if
                    none of us wished to take her, one of these uncles who just now gave evidence,
                    or, failing them, one of the other relatives, would, on the same principle,
                    obtain an adjudication of her together with the whole estate and take her as his
                    wife. </p>

            <div n="75" type="section">
                <p>By presenting, then, his daughter to the members of his ward without adopting my
                    brother as his son, he might have obtained this result; whereas, by adopting my
                    brother without introducing his daughter to the members of his ward, he made her
                    illegitimate, as it was right that he should, and therefore incapable of
                    succession, and left my brother heir to his estate. </p>

                    explain the following points, which I mentioned at the beginning of my speech;

                <p>First, with what dowry does he say that he married his sister to Pyrrhus?
                    Secondly, before what archon did this married woman give notice of having
                    quitted her husband or his domicile? Next, from whom did Nicodemus recover her
                    dowry, when the man had died to whom he says that he gave her in marriage? Or
                    if, though he demanded it back, he was unable to recover in the course of twenty
                    years, what action did he bring for alimony or for her dowry on behalf of this
                    married woman against the tenant of Pyrrhus's estate? </p>

                    These, then, are the questions which you must make him answer, and do not forget
                    to interrogate him also about the marriage-feast to the members of his ward.
                    This is among the proofs which are most damaging to his evidence; for it is
                    obvious that if Pyrrhus was induced to marry this woman, he would also have been
                    induced to give a marriage-feast for her to the members of his ward and to
                    introduce to them the child, who has been declared to be this woman's daughter,
