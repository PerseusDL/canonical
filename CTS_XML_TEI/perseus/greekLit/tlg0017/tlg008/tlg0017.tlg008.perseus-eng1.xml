            <div n="hypothesis" type="section">
                <p><placeName key="tgn,1122880">Ciron</placeName> having died without legitimate
                    offspring, his nephew, the son of his brother, claimed his estate and took over
                    the property from the widow. After this the speaker of the present oration
                    indicts the nephew, alleging that he himself is a son of <placeName
                        key="tgn,1122880">Ciron</placeName>'s daughter and that the wife of the
                    deceased designedly handed over the estate to the nephew with the intention of
                    giving him a part and appropriating the remainder. Such is the subject; the
                    discussion turns on a question of fact, the point at issue being whether the
                    claimant is a legitimate grandson of <placeName key="tgn,1122880"
                        >Ciron</placeName> or not. A further question is also involved, namely, one
                    of qualification: for the nephew argued that, even if we grant that his
                    opponent's mother is a legitimate daughter of <placeName key="tgn,1122880"
                        >Ciron</placeName>, since she is dead and it is her son who now claims, the
                    nephew, the son of a brother, ought to have preference over a daughter's issue
                    under the law which ordains that the descendants of males have precedence over
                    those of females. The speaker with great skill completely ignores this law and
                    bases his case upon the different qualifications of the parents, showing that,
                    in as much as a daughter is nearer in kin to the deceased than a brother, so her
                    son has a stronger claim than a brother's son. It is a strong case in equity but
                    a weak case in law. The working out of the various topics is carried out with
                    Isaeus's usual skill. </p>

                <p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is impossible, gentlemen, not to feel
                    indignation against men who not only have the impudence to claim the property of
                    others but also hope by their arguments to abolish the rights which the laws
                    confer; and this is what our opponents are now trying to do. For, though our
                    grandfather <placeName key="tgn,1122880">Ciron</placeName> did not die childless
                    but has left us behind him, the sons of his legitimate daughter, yet our
                    opponents claim the estate as next-of-kin and insult us by alleging that we are
                    not the issue of his daughter, and indeed that he never had a daughter at
                    all.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
                <p>The reason of their acting thus is their avarice, and the high value of the
                    estate which he has left behind him and which they have taken by force and still
                    hold; and they have the impudence both to assert that he has left nothing and at
                    the same time to lay claim to the estate. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
                <p>Now you must not imagine that my real opponent in this case is the man who has
                    brought the suit claiming the estate; no, it is Diocles of <placeName
                        key="tgn,7012055">Phlya</placeName>, surnamed Orestes.<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="true">An Orestes, son of Timocrates, is said to have been a
                        notorious footpad; hence the name is applied to any violent character. Cf.

                    is who has suborned our opponent to cause us trouble by trying to deprive us of
                    the fortune which our grandfather left us at his death and exposing us to these
                    dangers, in order that he may not have to give back any of it, if you listen to
                    him and are misled by his words. </p>

            <div n="4" type="section">
                <p>Such being their machinations, you must be informed of all the facts, in order
                    that, being well aware of all that has happened, you may give your verdict with
                    perfect knowledge of them. If, therefore, you have ever listened with scrupulous
                    attention to any other case, I beg you to give like attention to this case, as
                    indeed justice demands. Though lawsuits abound in our city, yet it will be shown
                    that no parties have ever claimed the property of others with greater impudence
                    and effrontery than my opponents. </p>

                <p>It is a difficult task therefore, gentlemen, for one who is wholly without
                    experience of litigation, when such important interests are at stake, to contend
                    against fabricated stories and witnesses whose evidence is false; yet I have
                    great hopes that I shall obtain my rights from you, and that I shall myself
                    speak sufficiently well at least to state what those rights are, unless some
                    such chance should befall me as it is now my lot to anticipate.<note resp="Loeb"
                        anchored="true">The allusion is obscure.</note> I beg you, therefore,
                    gentlemen, to listen to me with goodwill, and, if I seem to have been wronged,
                    to aid me to obtain my rights. </p>

                    events which have happened long ago I shall rely on report and statements which
                    have been heard by witnesses, while for events within living memory I shall
                    employ witnesses who know the facts, and proofs which are better than any
                    evidence. When I have established this, I shall then show that we have a better
                    claim to <placeName key="tgn,1122880">Ciron</placeName>'s estate than our
                    opponents. Starting, therefore, from the point at which they began their
                    narrative of the events, I, too, shall try and put my version before you. </p>

                    herself the daughter of his own mother's sister. She did not live long with him;
                    she bore my mother, and died after four years. My grandfather, being left with
                    an only daughter, married the sister of DiocIes as his second wife, who bore him
                    two sons. He brought up his daughter in the house with his wife and her
                    children, </p>

            <div n="8" type="section">
                <p>and while the latter were still alive, he gave her in marriage, when she reached
                    the proper age, to Nausimenes of Cholargus, giving her a dowry of twenty-five
                    minae including raiment and jewelry. Three or four years later Nausimenes fell
                    ill and died without leaving any issue by our mother. My grandfather received
                    her back again—without, however, recovering the dowry which he had given, owing
                    to the embarrassed condition of Nausimenes' affairs—and gave her in a second
                    marriage to my father with a dowry of one thousand drachmae. </p>

                <p>How is one to prove clearly that all these events occurred in face of the
                    imputations which our opponents are now uttering? I sought and discovered a way.
                    Whether my mother was or was not the daughter of <placeName key="tgn,1122880"

                    each of her husbands received with her—all these things must necessarily be
                    known to the male and female slaves who belonged to <placeName key="tgn,1122880"

                    order that the veracity of my witnesses might be tested before, and not after,

                        give was true.</note>—I demanded that our opponents should surrender the
                    male and female slaves to be put to the question on these points and any others

                    they are giving false evidence, since he has refused so decisive a method of
                    testing them? In my opinion no other conclusion is possible. But to prove that

                    and in private matters examination under torture is the most searching test; and
                    so, when you have slaves and free men before you and it is necessary that some
                    contested point should be cleared up, you do not employ the evidence of free men
                    but seek to establish the truth about the facts by putting the slaves to
                    torture. This is a perfectly reasonable course; for you are well aware that
                    before now witnesses have appeared not to be giving true evidence, whereas no
                    one who has been examined under torture has ever been convicted of giving false
                    evidence as the result of being tortured. </p>

                    fictitious stories and lying witnesses, while he thus declines so sure a method
                    of proof? Our conduct has been quite different. Seeing that we first demanded
                    that recourse should be had to examination under torture on the points about
                    which evidence was to be given, and my opponent refuses to allow this, under
                    these conditions we shall consider that you ought to believe our witnesses.

                    necessarily know the facts about the giving of my mother in marriage? Those who
                    betrothed her and those who were present when they betrothed her; the relatives,
                    then, of Nausimenes and of my father have given their evidence. Who know best

                    claimants clearly give evidence of the truth of these facts by their action in
                    declining to put the slaves to torture. Thus, I think, you have much better

                    he personally performed all the rites—we participated in this celebration and
                    laid our hands with his upon the victims and placed our offerings side by side
                    with his, and took part in all the other rites, and he prayed for our health and

                    had all his estate in his grasp. But, although he knew that in accordance with
                    my rights I should seek to be master of this property when my grandfather was
                    dead, yet he did not try to prevent me from visiting him and paying him
                    attentions and conversing with him (for he was afraid that <placeName
                        key="tgn,1122880">Ciron</placeName> might become exasperated and be angry
                    with him); but he was all the time preparing a claimant to dispute my right to
                    the property, promising him a small share, if he were successful, and securing
                    the whole estate for himself, and not admitting even to his accomplice that my
                    grandfather had any money to leave, but pretending that there was nothing. </p>

                <p>Immediately after <placeName key="tgn,1122880">Ciron</placeName>'s death he lost

                    required me to pay, as you have heard the witnesses testifying; but he
                    afterwards pretended that he had received the money from my opponent and refused
                    any longer to accept payment from me, stealthily thrusting me aside, in order
                    that it might appear that my opponent, and not I, was burying my grandfather.
                    And when my opponent claimed this house and everything else that <placeName

                    he had left nothing, I did not think (and my friends agreed with me) that in
                    these painful circumstances I ought to use violence and carry off my
                    grandfather's body, but I took part in the rites and was present at the burial,

                    manner possible, in order that I might confound their sacrilegious tricks, and
                    that it might not seem that they had paid for everything and I for nothing, but

                    difficulty in believing anything in my story. For the fortune which he now
                    possesses, and with which he makes such a brave show, is not really his; for
                    when his three half-sisters, the children of his mother, were left heiresses, he
                    represented himself as the adopted son of their father, though the latter left
