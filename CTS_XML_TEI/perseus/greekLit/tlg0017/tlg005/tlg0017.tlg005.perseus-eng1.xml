                <p>On the death of Dicaeogenes (II.), who had no children but left four sisters
                    behind him, Proxenus came forward and produced a will by which the deceased
                    Dicaeogenes (II.) adopted his (Proxenus's) son Dicaeogenes (III.) and left him a
                    third of his estate. After they had distributed the whole property on this
                    basis, Dicaeogenes (III.), the son of Proxenus, eventually came and alleged that
                    he had been adopted as heir to the whole property; he won his case and took
                    possession, in addition to his own share, of the two-thirds which had been held
                    by the sisters of the deceased. At a still later date the sons of the sisters
                    brought a successful action against Dicaeogenes (III.), and he agreed to hand
                    back to them the two-thirds clear and free of all charges, Leochares acting as
                    surety for the performance of this promise. In the present suit, as Dicaeogenes
                    (III.) and Leochares repudiate their agreement, the sons of the sisters claim
                    the two-thirds from Dicaeogenes (III.), as having agreed to restore the
                    property, and from Leochares as surety. The discussion turns on a question of
                    fact; for the adversaries deny their engagement. </p>

                    dispute with Dicaeogenes (III.) the agreement arrived at in court would be
                    conclusive; for when Dicaeogenes (III.) gave up the two-thirds of the estate and
                    furnished sureties that he would hand over that portion to us without dispute,
                    we reciprocally abandoned our claims. But, gentlemen, since Dicaeogenes (III.)
                    does not perform his agreement, we are bringing an action against Leochares, his
                    surety, in accordance with our affidavit.<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">On

                    not believe that even Leochares himself would declare that their evidence has
                    not been true. He will, however, perhaps have recourse to the argument that
                    Dicaeogenes (III.) has performed all that he agreed to do and that he himself
                    has fulfilled his duties as surety. If he says this, he will be lying and will
                    easily be convicted of doing so; for the clerk shall read you the inventory of
                    all the property which formed the estate left by Dicaeogenes (II.) the son of
                    Menexenus, and of the property received by Dicaeogenes (III.).<quote

                    the two-thirds of the property which the son of Menexenus left, and that
                    Leochares acted as surety for his doing so; for this is the basis of our present

                    what I have already said would suffice; but since they are prepared to treat of
                    the question of the inheritance from the beginning, I should like you to hear
                    the facts from my side also, that, knowing the truth instead of being misled,
                    you may give an unbiased verdict. <milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Our
                    grandfather, Menexenus (I.) had an only son, Dicaeogenes (II.), and four

                    and at another time that he had been adopted as sole heir, and be believed by
                    you to be speaking the truth. However, on coming into court, though we had by
                    far the better case, we were cheated of our rights, not by the judges but by
                        <placeName key="tgn,7002371">Melas</placeName> the Egyptian and his friends,
                    who thought that the misfortunes of the city gave them liberty to possess
                    themselves of other people's property and to bear false witness in support of
                    one another, and by their acting in this manner the judges were misled. </p>

                    which he desired, that very same day forcibly deprived of her share the daughter
                    of Cephisophon of Paeania, the niece of Dicaeogenes (II.) who left the money;
                    robbed the former wife of Democles of what Dicaeogenes (II.) had left her; and
                    robbed the mother of Cephisodotus and Cephisodotus himself of all they

                    unprotected and penniless, they even lacked all the necessities of life. This is
                    how Dicaeogenes here, their nearest kinsman, carried out his duties as their
                    guardian; what their father Theopompus left them he handed over to their
                    enemies, and what their maternal uncle and their grandfather gave them he

                    adjoining his town-house. Also, though he was receiving an income of seventy
                    minae from the property of our uncle Dicaeogenes (II.), he sent the latter's

                    witness that the other, namely that which Dicaeogenes (III.) produced, was our

                        unnecessary. The contention of his opponents was that the will was a
                        forgery; they therefore applied to the court to have the intestate estate

                    Leochares had committed perjury. When this result became evident after the votes

                    was possible for us to have him deprived of civil rights since we had obtained a

                    recover what belonged to us and be quit of him. Having behaved thus towards
                    Leochares and Dicaeogenes (III.) we were deceived by them, gentlemen; for
                    Dicaeogenes (III) did not hand over the two-thirds of the estate, though he had
                    agreed in court to do so, and Leochares refuses to admit that he undertook to be

                    obviously lying, we are producing as witnesses those who were present when
                    Dicaeogenes (III.) gave up two-thirds of the estate and promised to hand it over
                    without further dispute to Dicaeogenes' (II.) sisters, and Leochares undertook
                    to be surety that he would actually perform what he promised. And we beseech
                    you, gentlemen, if any of you were present on that occasion, to recollect

                    it to us to have won our case, and what disadvantage was it to my opponent to be
                    defeated? For if he simply renounced, as he alleges, his claim to the two-thirds
                    of the estate but did not agree to hand it over without further dispute, what
                    did he lose by renouncing property, the value of which he was still holding? For
                    even before he lost his case, the property which we are claiming was not in his
                    possession but in the hands of those who bought it from him or held it on

                <p>That is why we insisted on his providing sureties, because we had no confidence

                    making no attempt to eject them, because we are afraid of losing suits against
                    them; for when we tried to eject Micion from the bath-house at the suggestion of
                    Dicaeogenes (III.), who said that he would not confirm his title,<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Under Athenian law the vendor undertook to

                    before the judges, being willing to run any risk of Dicaeogenes (III.)
                    confirming Micion's title to the bath-house, and never imagining that he would
                    do the very opposite of what he had agreed to do, our sole reason for so acting
                    being that the sureties had been given. </p>

                    nothing from the estate but of having also lost forty minae, and left the court
                    having been fooled by Dicaeogenes (III.). Of these things I will now produce

                    in the document drawn up before the tribunal. We, gentlemen, being hurried at
