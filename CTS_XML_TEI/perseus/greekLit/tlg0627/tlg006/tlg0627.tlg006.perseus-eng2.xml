						<p>I. I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> Thasos during autumn, about the time of the
							equinox to near the setting of the Pleiades,<note><foreign
									xml:lang="grc">U(PD</foreign> in expressions denoting time seems
								in Hippocrates to mean "about" or "during." The period is roughly
								from September 21 to November 8.</note> there were many rains,
							gently continuous, with southerly winds. Winter southerly,<note>That is,
								the winds were generally from the south, and such north winds as
								blew were light.</note> north winds light, droughts ; on the whole,
							the winter was like a spring. Spring southerly and chilly ; slight
							showers. Summer in general cloudy. No rain. Etesian winds few, light and
							irregular.</p>
						<p>The whole weather proved southerly, with droughts, but early in the
							spring, as the previous constitution had proved the opposite and
							northerly, a few patients suffered from ardent fevers, and these very
							mild, causing hemorrhage in few cases and no deaths. Many had swellings
							beside one ear, or both ears, in most cases unattended with
								fever,<note>Or, punctuating after <foreign xml:lang="grc"
									>=(WTA</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc"
									>PLEI/S1TOIS1IN</foreign>, "There were swellings beside the
								ears, in many cases on one side, but in most on both." The epidemio
								was obviously mumps.</note> so that confinement to bed was
							unnecessary. In some cases there was slight heat, but in all the
							swellings subsided without causing harm ; in no case was there
							suppuration such as attends swellings of other origin. This was the
							character of them :--flabby, big, spreading, with neither inflammation
							nor pain ; in every case they</p>
						<pb n="p.149"/>
						<p>disappeared without a sign.<note>That is, with no symptoms indicative of
								a crisis.</note> The sufferers were youths, young men, and men in
							their prime, usually those who frequented the wrestling school and
							gymnasia. Few women were attacked. Many had dry coughs which brought up
							nothing when they coughed, but their voices were hoarse. Soon after,
							though in some cases after some time, painful inflammations occurred
							either in one testicle or in both, sometimes accompanied with fever, in
							other cases not. Usually they caused much suffering. In other respects
							the people had no ailments requiring medical assistance.<note>That is,
								nobody was ill enough to make a visit to the physician's surgery
									(<foreign xml:lang="grc">I(HTREI=ON</foreign>)
							necessary.</note></p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="2">
						<head>PART 2 </head>
						<p>II. Beginning early in the summer, throughout the summer and in winter
							many of those who had been ailing a long time took to their beds in a
							state of consumption, while many also who had hitherto been doubtful
							sufferers at this time showed undoubted symptoms. Some showed the
							symptoms now for the first time ; these were those whose constitution
							inclined to be consumptive. Many, in fact most of these, died ; of those
							who took to their beds I do not know one who survived even for a short
							time. Death came more promptly than is usual in consumption, and yet the
							other complaints, which will be described presently, though longer and
							attended with fever, were easily supported and did not prove fatal. For
							consumption was the worst of the diseases that occurred, and alone was
							responsible for the great mortality.</p>
						<p>In the majority of cases the symptoms were these. Fever with shivering,
							continuous, acute, not completely intermitting, but of the semitertian
							type ; remitting during one day they were exacerbated on the next,
							becoming on the whole more acute. Sweats</p>
						<pb n="p.151"/>
						<p>were continual, but not all over the body. Severe chill in the
							extremities, which with difficulty recovered their warmth. Bowels
							disordered, with bilious, scanty, unmixed, thin, smarting stools,
							causing the patient to get up often. Urine either thin,
								colourless,<note>Throughout <hi rend="ital">Epidemics</hi>
								<foreign xml:lang="grc">A\)XRWS2</foreign> may mean, not merely
								"without colour," but "of bad colour." It certainly has this meaning
								in <hi rend="ital">Airs Waters Places</hi>, VII, l. ii. See p.
								85.</note> unconcocted and scanty, or thick and with a slight
							deposit, not settling favourably, but with a crude and unfavourable
							deposit. The patients frequently coughed up small, concocted sputa,
							brought up little by little with difficulty. Those exhibiting the
							symptoms in their most violent form showed no concoction at all, but
							continued spitting crude sputa. In the majority of these cases the
							throat was throughout painful from the beginning, being red and
							inflamed. Fluxes slight, thin, pungent. Patients quickly wasted away and
							grew worse, being throughout averse to all food and experiencing no
							thirst. Delirium in many cases as death approached. Such were the
							symptoms of the consumption.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="3">
						<head>PART 3 </head>
						<p>III. But when summer came, and during autumn occurred many continuous but
							not violent fevers, which attacked persons who were long ailing without
							suffering distress in any other particular manner ; for the bowels were
							in most cases quite easy, and hurt to no appreciable extent. Urine in
							most cases of good colour and clear, but thin, and after a time near the
							crisis it grew concocted. Coughing was slight, and caused no distress.
							No lack of appetite ; in fact it was quite possible even to give food.
							In general the patients did not sicken, as did the consumptives,</p>
						<pb n="p.153"/>
						<p>with shivering fevers, but with slight sweats, the paroxysms being
							variable and irregular.<note>The words omitted by KÃ©hlewein mean "not
								intermitting altogether, but with exacerbations after the manner of
								tertians."</note> The earliest crisis was about the twentieth day ;
							in most cases the crisis was about the fortieth day, though in many it
							was about the eightieth. In some cases the illness did not end in this
							way, but in an irregular manner without a crisis. In the majority of
							these cases the fevers relapsed after a brief interval, and after the
							relapse a crisis occurred at the end of the same periods as before. The
							disease in many of these instances was so protracted that it even lasted
							during the winter.</p>
						<p>Out of all those described in this constitution only the consumptives
							showed a high mortality-rate ; for all the other patients bore up well,
							and the other fevers did not prove fatal.</p>

						<p>IV. In Thasos early in autumn occurred unseasonable wintry storms,
							suddenly with many north and south winds bursting out into rains. These
							conditions continued until the setting of the Pleiades and during their
							season. Winter was northerly ; many violent and abundant rains ; snows ;
							generally there were fine intervals. With all this, however, the cold
							weather was not exceptionally unseasonable. But immediately after the
							winter solstice, when the west wind usually begins to blow, there was a
							return of severe wintry weather, much north wind, snow and</p>
						<pb n="p.155"/>
						<p>copious rains continuously, sky stormy and clouded. These conditions
							lasted on, and did not remit before the equinox. Spring cold, northerly,
							wet, cloudy. Summer did not turn out excessively hot, the Etesian winds
							blowing continuously. But soon after, near the rising of Arcturus, there
							was much rain again, with northerly winds.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="5">
						<head>PART 5</head>
						<p>V. The whole year having been wet, cold and northerly, in the winter the
							public health in most respects was good, but in early spring many, in
							fact most, suffered illnesses. Now there began at first inflammations of
							the eyes, marked by rheum, pain, and unconcocted discharges. Small gummy
							sores, in many cases causing distress when they broke out ; the great
							majority relapsed, and ceased late on the approach of autumn. In summer
							and autumn dysenteric diseases, tenesmus and lientery ; bilious
							diarrhÅa, with copious, thin, crude, smarting stools ; in some cases it
							was also watery. In many cases there were also painful, bilious
							defluxions, watery, full of thin particles, purulent and causing
							strangury. No kidney trouble, but their various symptoms succeeded in
							various orders. Vomitings of phlegm, bile, and undigested food. Sweats ;
							in all cases much moisture over all the body. These complaints in many
							cases were unattended with fever, and the sufferers were not confined to
							bed ; but in many others there was fever, as I am going to describe.
							Those who showed all the symptoms mentioned above were consumptives who
							suffered pain. When autumn came, and during winter, continuous
							fevers--in some few cases ardent--day fevers, night fevers,
							semitertians, exact tertians, quartans, irregular fevers. Each of the
							fevers mentioned found many victims.</p>
						<pb n="p.157"/>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="6">
						<head>PART 6</head>
						<p>VI. Now the ardent fevers attacked the fewest persons, and these were
							less distressed than any of the other sick. There was no bleeding from
							the nose, except very slight discharges in a few cases, and no delirium.
							All the other symptoms were slight. The crises of these diseases were
							quite regular, generally in seventeen days, counting the days of
							intermission, and I know of no ardent fever proving fatal at this time,
							nor of any phrenitis. The tertians were more numerous than the ardent
							fevers and more painful. But all these had four regular periods from the
							first onset, had complete crises in seven, and in no case relapsed. But
							the quartans, while in many instances they began at first with quartan
							periodicity, yet in not a few they became quartan by an abscession from
							other fevers or illnesses.<note>There are often mixed infections in
								malaria. If the quartan be one of these, being the longest it
								outlasts the others. So the disease appears to have turned into a
								quartan.</note> They were protracted, as quartans usually are, or
							even more protracted than usual. Many fell victims to quotidians, night
							fevers, or irregular fevers, and were ill for a long time, either in bed
							or walking about. In most of these cases the fevers continued during the
							season of the Pleiades or even until winter. In many patients,
							especially children, there were convulsions and slight feverishness from
							the beginning ; sometimes, too, convulsions supervened upon fevers.
							Mostly these illnesses were protracted, but not dangerous, except for
							those who from all other causes were predisposed to die.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="7">
						<head>PART 7</head>
						<p>VII. But those fevers which were altogether continuous and never
							intermitted at all, but in all cases</p>
						<pb n="p.159"/>
						<p>grew worse after the manner of semitertians, with remission during one
							day followed by exacerbation during the next, were the most severe of
							all the fevers which occurred at this time, the longest and the most
							painful. Beginning mildly, and on the whole increasing always, with
							exacerbation, and growing worse, they had slight remissions followed
							quickly after an abatement by more violent exacerbations, generally
							becoming worse on the critical days. All patients had irregular rigors
							that followed no fixed law, most rarely and least in the
								semitertians,<note>I take the pronoun <foreign xml:lang="grc"
									>AU)=TOS2</foreign> throughout this chapter to refer to the
								remittent semitertian, or to sufferers from it.</note> but more
							violent in the other fevers. Copious sweats, least copious in the
							semitertians ; they brought no relief, but on the contrary caused harm.
							These patients suffered great chill in the extremities, which grew warm
							again with difficulty. Generally there was sleeplessness, especially
							with the semitertians, followed afterwards by coma. In all the bowels
							were disordered and in a bad state, but in the semitertians they were
							far the worst. In most of them urine either (<hi rend="ital">a</hi>)
							thin, crude, colourless, after a time becoming slightly concocted with
							signs of crisis, or (<hi rend="ital">b</hi>) thick enough but turbid, in
							no way settling or forming sediment, or (<hi rend="ital">c</hi>) with
							small, bad, crude sediments, these being the worst of all. Coughs
							attended the fevers, but I cannot say that either harm or good resulted
							from the coughing on this occasion.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="8">
						<head>PART 8</head>
						<p>VIII. Now the greatest number of these symptoms continued to be
							protracted, troublesome, very disordered, very irregular, and without
							any critical signs, both in the case of those who came very near
							death</p>
						<pb n="p.161"/>
						<p>and in the case of those who did not. For even if some patients enjoyed
							slight intermissions, there followed a quick relapse. A few of them
							experienced a crisis, the earliest being about the eightieth day, some
							of the latter having a relapse, so that most of them were still ill in
							the winter. The greatest number had no crisis before the disease
							terminated. These symptoms occurred in those who recovered just as much
							as in those who did not. The illnesses showed a marked absence of crisis
							and a great variety ; the most striking and the worst symptom, which
							throughout attended the great majority, was a complete loss of appetite,
							especially in those whose general condition exhibited fatal signs, but
							in these fevers they did not suffer much from unseasonable thirst. After
							long intervals, with many pains and with pernicious wasting, there
							supervened abscessions either too severe to be endured, or too slight to
							be beneficial, so that there was a speedy return of the original
							symptoms, and an aggravation of the mischief.<note>That is, the
								abscessions did not carry off the morbid humours, which spread again
								throughout the system.</note></p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="9">
						<head>PART 9</head>
						<p>IX. The symptoms from which these patients suffered were dysenteries and
							tenesmus, lienteries also and fluxes. Some had dropsies also, either
							with or without these. Whenever any of these attacked violently they
							were quickly fatal, or, if mild, they did no good. Slight eruptions,
							which did not match the extent of the diseases and quickly disappeared
							again, or swellings by the ears that grew smaller<note><foreign
									xml:lang="grc">MWLUO/MENA</foreign> would mean "remained
								crude."</note> and</p>
						<pb n="p.163"/>
						<p>signified nothing, in some cases appearing at the joints, especially the
							hip-joint, in few instances leaving with signs of crisis, when they
							quickly re-established themselves in their original state.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="10">
						<head>PART 10</head>
						<p>X. From all the diseases some died, but the greatest number from these
								fevers,<note>It is not clear to what <foreign xml:lang="grc"
									>PA/NTWN</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">TOU/TWN</foreign>
								refer. Probably <foreign xml:lang="grc">PA/NTWN</foreign> refers to
								all the semitertians, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">TOU/TWN</foreign>
								to the special type of them described in Chapter IX.</note>
							especially children--those just weaned, older children of eight or ten
							years, and those approaching puberty. These victims never suffered from
							the latter symptoms without the first I have described above, but often
							the first without the latter. The only good sign, the most striking that
							occurred, which saved very many of those who were in the greatest
							danger, was when there was a change to strangury, into which abscessions
							took place. The strangury, too, came mostly to patients of the ages
							mentioned, though it did happen to many of the others, either without
							their taking to bed or when they were ill. Rapid and great was the
							complete change that occurred in their case. For the bowels, even if
							they were perniciously loose, quickly recovered ; their appetite for
							everything returned, and hereafter the fever abated. But the strangury,
							even in these cases, was long and painful. Their urine was copious,
							thick, varied, red, mixed with pus, and passed with pain. But they all
							survived, and I know of none of these that died.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="11">
						<head>PART 11</head>
						<p>XI. In all dangerous cases you should be on the watch for all favourable
							coctions of the evacuations from all parts, or for fair and critical
							abscessions. Coctions signify nearness of crisis and sure recovery</p>
						<pb n="p.165"/>
						<p>of health, but crude and unconcocted evacuations, which change into bad
							abscessions, denote absence of crisis, pain, prolonged illness, death,
							or a return of the same symptoms. But it is by a consideration of other
							signs that one must decide which of these results will be most likely.
							Declare the past, diagnose the present, foretell the future ; practise
							these acts. As to diseases, make a habit of two things--to help, or at
							least to do no harm. The art has three factors, the disease, the
							patient, the physician. The physician is the servant of the art. The
							patient must co-operate with the physician in combating the disease.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="12">
						<head>PART 12</head>
						<p>XII. Pains about the head and neck, and heaviness combined with pain,
							occur both without and with fever. Sufferers from phrenitis have
							convulsions, and eject verdigris-coloured vomit ; some die very quickly.
							But in ardent and the other fevers, those with pain in the neck,
							heaviness of the temples, dimness of sight, and painless tension of the
							hypochondrium, bleed from the nose ; those with a general heaviness of
							the head, cardialgia, and nausea, vomit afterwards bile and phlegm.
							Children for the most part in such cases suffer chiefly from the
							convulsions. Women have both these symptoms and pains in the womb. Older
							people, and those whose natural heat is failing, have paralysis or
							raving or blindness.</p>

						<p>XIII. In Thasos a little before and at the season of Arcturus many
							violent rains with northerly winds. About the equinox until the setting
							of the Pleiades</p>
						<pb n="p.167"/>
						<p>slight, southerly rains. Winter northerly, droughts, cold periods,
							violent winds, snow. About the equinox very severe storms. Spring
							northerly, droughts, slight rains, periods of cold. About the summer
							solstice slight showers, periods of great cold until near the Dog Star.
							After the Dog Star, until Arcturus, hot summer. Great heat, not
							intermittent but continuous and severe. No rain fell. The Etesian winds
							blew. About Arcturus southerly rains until the equinox.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="14">
						<head>PART 14</head>
						<p>XIV. In this constitution during winter began paralyses which attacked
							many, a few of whom quickly died. In fact, the disease was generally
							epidemic. In other respects the public health continued good. Early in
							spring began ardent fevers which continued until the equinox and on to
							summer. Now those who began to be ill at once, in spring or the
							beginning of summer, in most cases got well, though a few died ; but
							when autumn and the rains came the cases were dangerous, and more
							died.</p>
						<p>As to the peculiarities of the ardent fevers, the most likely patients to
							survive were those who had a proper and copious bleeding from the nose,
							in fact I do not know of a single case in this constitution that proved
							fatal when a proper bleeding occurred, For Philiscus and Epaminon and
							Silenus, who died, had only a slight epistaxis on the fourth and fifth
							days. Now the majority of the patients had rigors near the</p>
						<pb n="p.169"/>
						<p>crisis, especially such as had no epistaxis, but these had sweats also as
							well as rigors.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="15">
						<head>PART 15</head>
						<p>XV. Some had jaundice on the sixth day, but these were benefited by
							either a purging through the bladder or a disturbance of the bowels or a
							copious hemorrhage, as was the case with Heraclides, who lay sick at the
							house of Aristocydes. This patient, however, who had a crisis on the
							twentieth day, not only bled from the nose, but also experienced
							disturbance of the bowels and a purging through the bladder. Far
							otherwise was it with the servant of Phanagoras, who had none of these
							symptoms, and died. But the great majority had hemorrhage, especially
							youths and those in the prime of life, and of these the great majority
							who had no hemorrhage died. Older people had jaundice or disordered
							bowels, for example Bion, who lay sick at the house of Silenus.
							Dysenteries also were general in summer, and some too of those who had
							fallen ill, and also suffered from hemorrhage, finally had dysentery ;
							for example, the slave of Erato and Myllus, after copious hemorrhage,
							lapsed into dysentery. They recovered.</p>
						<p>This humour,<note>That is, blood.</note> then, especially was in great
							abundance, since even those who had no hemorrhage near the crisis, but
							swellings by the ears which disappeared--and after their disappearance
							there was a heaviness along the left flank up to the extremity of the
							hip--after the crisis had pain and passed thin urine, and then began to
							suffer slight hemorrhage about the twenty-fourth day, and</p>
						<pb n="p.171"/>
						<p>abscessions into hemorrhage occurred. In the case of Antipho, son of
							Critobulus, the illness ceased and came to a complete crisis about the
							fortieth day.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="16">
						<head>PART 16</head>
						<p>XVI. Though many women fell ill, they were fewer than the men and less
							frequently died. But the great majority had difficult childbirth, and
							after giving birth they would fall ill, and these especially died, as
							did the daughter of Telebulus on the sixth day after delivery. Now
							menstruation appeared during the fevers in most cases, and with many
							maidens it occurred then for the first time. Some bled from the nose.
							Sometimes both epistaxis and menstruation appeared together ; for
							example, the maiden daughter of Daitharses had her first menstruation
							during fever and also a violent discharge from the nose. I know of no
							woman who died if any of these symptoms showed themselves properly, but
							all to my knowledge had abortions if they chanced to fall ill when with
							child.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="17">
						<head>PART 17</head>
						<p>XVII. Urine in most cases was of good colour, but thin and with slight
							sediments, and the bowels of most were disordered with thin, bilious
							excretions. Many after a crisis of the other symptoms ended with
							dysentery, as did Xenophanes and Critias. I will mention cases in which
							was passed copious, watery, clear and thin urine, even after a crisis in
							other respects favourable, and a favourable sediment : Bion, who lay
							sick at the house of Silenus, Cratis, who lodged with Xenophanes, the
							slave of Areto, and the wife of Mnesistratus. Afterwards all these
							suffered from dysentery.</p>
						<p>About the season of Arcturus many had crisis on</p>
						<pb n="p.173"/>
						<p>the eleventh day, and these did not suffer even the normal relapses.
							There were also comatose fevers about this time, usually in children,
							and of all patients these showed the lowest mortality.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="18">
						<head>PART 18</head>
						<p>XVIII. About the equinox up to the setting of the Pleiades, and during
							winter, although the ardent fevers continued, yet cases of phrenitis
							were most frequent at this time, and most of them were fatal. In summer,
							too, a few cases had occurred. Now the sufferers from ardent fever, when
							fatal symptoms attended, showed signs at the beginning. For right from
							the beginning there was acute fever with slight rigors, sleeplessness,
							thirst, nausea, slight sweats about the forehead and collar-bones, but
							in no case general, much delirium, fears, depression, very cold
							extremities, toes and hands, especially the latter. The exacerbations on
							the even days ; but in most cases the pains were greatest on the fourth
							day, with sweat for the most part chilly, while the extremities could
							not now be warmed again, remaining livid and cold ; and in these cases
							the thirst ceased. Their urine was scanty, black, thin, with
							constipation of the bowels. Nor was there hemorrhage from the nose in
							any case when these symptoms occurred, but only slight epistaxis. None
							of these cases suffered relapse, but they died on the sixth day, with
							sweating. The cases of phrenitis had all the above symptoms, but the
							crises generally occurred on the eleventh day. Some had their crises on
							the twentieth day, namely those in whom the phrenitis did not begin at
							first, or began about the third or fourth day, but</p>
						<pb n="p.175"/>
						<p>though these fared tolerably at the beginning, yet the disease assumed an
							acute form about the seventh day.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="19">
						<head>PART 19</head>
						<p>XIX. Now the number of illnesses was great. And of the patients there
							died chiefly striplings, young people, people in their prime, the
							smooth, the fair-skinned, the straight-haired, the black-haired, the
							black-eyed, those who had lived recklessly and care-lessly, the
							thin-voiced, the rough-voiced, the lispers, the passionate. Women too
							died in very great numbers who were of this kind. In this constitution
							there were four symptoms especially which denoted recovery :--a proper
							hemorrhage through the nostrils ; copious discharges by the bladder of
							urine with much sediment of a proper character ; disordered bowels with
							bilious evacuations at the right time ; the appearance of dysenteric
							characteristics. The crisis in many cases did not come with one only of
							the symptoms described above, but in most cases all symptoms were
							experienced, and the patients appeared to be more distressed ; but all
							with these symptoms got well. Women and maidens experienced all the
							above symptoms, but besides, whenever any took place properly, and
							whenever copious menstruation supervened, there was a crisis therefrom

						<p>XX. The painful swellings by the ears in fevers in some cases neither
							subsided nor suppurated when the fever ceased with a crisis. They were
							cured by bilious diarrhÅa, or dysentery, or a sediment of thick urine
							such as closed the illness of Hermippus of ClazomenÃ¦. The circumstances
							of the crises, from which too I formed my judgments, were either similar
							or dissimilar ; for example, the two brothers, who fell sick together at
							the same time, and lay ill near the bungalow of Epigenes. The elder of
							these had a crisis on the sixth day, the younger on the seventh. Both
							suffered a relapse together at the same time with an intermission of
							five days. After the relapse both had a complete crisis together on the
							seventeenth day. But the great majority had a crisis on the sixth day,
							with an intermission of six days followed by a crisis on the fifth day
							after the relapse. Those who had a crisis on the seventh day had an
							intermission of seven days, with a crisis on the third day after the
							relapse. Others with a crisis on the seventh had an intermission of
							three days, with a crisis on the seventh day after the relapse. Some who
							had a crisis on the sixth day had an intermission of six and a relapse
							of three, an intermission of one and a relapse of one, followed by a
							crisis ; for example, Euagon the son of Daitharses. Others with a crisis
							on the sixth had an intermission of seven days, and after the relapse a
							crisis on the fourth ; for example, the daughter of Aglai+das. Now most
							of those who fell ill in this constitution went through their illness in
							this manner, and none of</p>
						<pb n="p.179"/>
						<p>those who recovered, so far as I know, failed to suffer the relapses
							which were normal in these cases, but all, so far as I know, recovered
							if their relapses took place after this fashion. Further, I know of none
							who suffered a fresh relapse after going through the illness in the
							manner described above.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="21">
						<head>PART 21</head>
						<p>XXI. In these diseases most died on the sixth day, as did Epaminondas,
							Silenus and Philiscus the son of Antagoras. Those who had the swellings
							by the ears had a crisis on the twentieth day, but these subsided in all
							cases without suppuration, being diverted to the bladder. There were two
							cases of suppuration, both fatal, Cratistonax, who lived near the temple
							of Heracles, and the serving-maid of Scymnus the fuller. When there was
							a crisis on the seventh day, with an intermission of nine days followed
							by a relapse, there was a second crisis on the fourth day after the
							relapse--in the case of Pantacles, for example, who lived by the temple
							of Dionysus. When there was a crisis on the seventh day, with an
							intermission of six days followed by a relapse, there was a second
							crisis on the seventh day after the relapse--in the case of Phanocritus,
							for example, who lay sick at the house of Gnathon the fuller.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="22">
						<head>PART 22</head>
						<p>XXII. During winter, near the time of the winter solstice, and continuing
							until the equinox, the ardent fevers and the phrenitis still caused many
							deaths, but their crises changed. Most cases had a crisis on the fifth
							day from the outset, then intermitted four days, relapsed, had a crisis
							on the fifth day after the relapse, that is, after thirteen days
							altogether. Mostly children experienced crises thus, but older people
							did so too. Some had a crisis</p>
						<pb n="p.181"/>
						<p>on the eleventh day, a relapse on the fourteenth, and a complete crisis
							on the twentieth. But if rigor came on about the twentieth day the
							crisis came on the fortieth. Most had rigors near the first crisis, and
							those who had rigors at first near the crisis, had rigors again in the
							relapses at the time of the crisis. Fewest experienced rigors in the
							spring, more in summer, more still in autumn, but by far the most during
							winter. But the hemorrhages tended to cease.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="23">
						<head>PART 23</head>
						<p>XXIII. The following were the circumstances attending the diseases, from
							which I framed my judgments, learning from the common nature of all and
							the particular nature of the individual, from the disease, the patient,
							the regimen prescribed and the prescriber--for these make a diagnosis
							more favourable or less ; from the constitution, both as a whole and
							with respect to the parts, of the weather and of each region ; from the
							custom, mode of life, practices and ages of each patient ; from talk,
							manner, silence, thoughts, sleep or absence of sleep, the nature and
							time of dreams, pluckings, scratchings, tears ; from the exacerbations,
							stools, urine, sputa, vomit, the antecedents and consequents of each
							member in the successions of diseases, and the abscessions to a fatal
							issue or a crisis, sweat, rigor, chill, cough, sneezes, hiccoughs,
							breathing, belchings, flatulence, silent or noisy, hemorrhages, and
							hemorrhoids. From these things must we consider what their consequents
							also will be.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="24">
						<head>PART 24</head>
						<p>XXIV. Some fevers are continuous, some have an access during the day and
							an intermission during the night, or an access during the night and an
							intermission during the day ; there are semitertians,</p>
						<pb n="p.183"/>
						<p>tertians, quartans, quintans, septans, nonans. The most acute diseases,
							the most severe, difficult and fatal, belong to the continuous fevers.
							The least fatal and least difficult of all, but the longest of all, is
							the quartan. Not only is it such in itself, but it also ends other, and
							serious, diseases. In the fever called semitertian, which is more fatal
							than any other, there occur also acute diseases, while it especially
							precedes the illness of consumptives, and of those who suffer from other
							and longer diseases. The nocturnal is not very fatal, but it is long.
							The diurnal is longer still, and to some it also brings a tendency to
							consumption. The septan is long but not fatal. The nonan is longer still
							but not fatal. The exact tertian has a speedy crisis and is not fatal.
							But the quintan is the worst of all. For if it comes on before
							consumption or during consumption the patient dies.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="25">
						<head>PART 25 </head>
						<p>XXV. Each of these fevers has its modes, its constitutions and its
							exacerbations. For example, a continuous fever in some cases from the
							beginning is high and at its worst, leading up to the most severe stage,
							but about and at the crisis it moderates. In other cases it begins
							gently and in a suppressed manner, but rises and is exacerbated each
							day, bursting out violently near the crisis. In some cases it begins
							mildly, but increases and is exacerbated, reaching its height after a
							time ; then it declines again until the crisis or near the crisis. These
							characteristics may show themselves in any fever and in any disease. It
							is necessary also to consider the patient's mode of life and to take
							it</p>
						<pb n="p.185"/>
						<p>into account when prescribing. Many other important symptoms there are
							which are akin to these, some of which I have described, while others I
							shall describe later. These must be duly weighed when considering and
							deciding who is suffering from one of these diseases in an acute, fatal
							form, or whether the patient may recover ; who has a chronic, fatal
							illness, or one from which he may recover ; who is to be prescribed for
							or not, what the prescription is to be, the quantity to be given and the
							time to give it.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="26">
						<head>PART 26 </head>
						<p>XXVI. When the exacerbations are on even days, the crises are on even
							days. But the diseases exacerbated on odd days have their crises on odd
							days. The first period of diseases with crises on the even days is the
							fourth day, then the sixth, eighth, tenth, fourteenth, twentieth,
							twenty-fourth, thirtieth, fortieth, sixtieth, eightieth, hundred and
							twentieth. Of those with a crisis on the odd days the first period is
							the third, then the fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, seventeenth,
							twenty-first, twenty-seventh, thirty-first. Further, one must know that,
							if the crises be on other days than the above, there will be relapses,
							and there may also be a fatal issue. So one must be attentive and know
							that at these times there will be the crises resulting in recovery, or
							death, or a tendency for better or worse. One must also consider in what
							periods the crises occur of irregular fevers, of quartans, of quintans,
							of septans and of nonans.</p>

				<head>EPIDEMICS III: THE CHARACTERS </head>
				<p>S<hi rend="sc">OME</hi> MSS., the most important being V, have certain characters
					at the end of the medical histories in Book III of the <hi rend="ital"
						>Epidemics.</hi> These characters were known to Galen, who wrote, or
					contemplated writing, a treatise about them. There is no doubt, therefore, that
					they are ancient ; Galen indeed in his commentary tells us that his predecessors
					had been much exercised over them. Zeuxis, he says, had written a history of
					them in which they were traced back to Mnemon, who either added them to a
					manuscript in the Library at Alexandria or else brought to the Library a copy
					with the characters inserted.</p>
				<p>These characters are of no real value for the interpretation of the text, but
					they bear witness to the interest taken in the "medical histories" from very
					early times. Somebody or other invented a shorthand script in order to summarize
					these histories, or rather the main teaching of them. For some reason they were
					only applied to the histories of the third book, and Galen says that the older
					manuscripts of his time had no characters inserted until the seventh case (woman
					with angina).</p>
				<p>Galen gives the following explanation of the characters :--</p>

				<p>Now the first character, as I said, is always the letter II with the intersecting
					line, meaning in all cases "probable." At the end we see written either <foreign
						xml:lang="grc">*U</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">*Q</foreign>, meaning
					"recovery" and "death" respectively. Before them is the number of the days at
					the end of which the patient recovered or died. The characters in the middle are
					in all cases (except the delta with a mark below it) the letters indicating the
					elements of the word.<note>That is, each middle character except one is a letter
						of the alphabet, and that letter is significant, being the initial of a
						word, or of several alternative words.</note> I will now state the meaning
					of each. Remember that the last character was said to signify recovery or death,
					and the last but one the number of the days, and I will now give a list of the
					others written between the number and the beginning. A signifies "miscarriage,"
					"destruction"; <foreign xml:lang="grc">*G</foreign> "urine like semen"; the
					letter with the mark underneath,<note>The text is probably mutilated, but the
						general meaning is clear.</note> written thus <foreign xml:lang="grc"
						>*D</foreign>, means "evacuations by sweats," "diarrhoea" and
						"perspiration,"<note>Surely this is wrong. LittrÃ©'s suggestion ("stools")
						may possibly be correct.</note> and in general any evacuation ; <foreign
						xml:lang="grc">*E</foreign> "retention," "seat"; <foreign xml:lang="grc"
						>*Z</foreign> "object of search"; <foreign xml:lang="grc">*Q</foreign>
					"death," as I said before ; <foreign xml:lang="grc">*I</foreign> "sweat";
						<foreign xml:lang="grc">*K</foreign> "crisis" or "condition of the bowels";
						<foreign xml:lang="grc">*M</foreign> "madness" or "womb"; <foreign
						xml:lang="grc">*N</foreign> "youth" or "mortification"; <foreign
						xml:lang="grc">*C</foreign> "yellow bile," "something strange and rare,"
					"irritation," "dryness"; <foreign xml:lang="grc">*O</foreign> "pains" or
					"urine," though some say it means urine only when it has the <foreign
						xml:lang="grc">*U</foreign> placed above, written as the word <foreign
						xml:lang="grc">OU(/TWS2</foreign> is generally written ; <foreign
						xml:lang="grc">*P</foreign> means "abundance," "sputum," "wheat,"<note>This
						again can surely not be correct. LittrÃ©'s emendation is unconvincing.</note>
					"fever,"</p>
				<pb n="p.216"/>
				<p>"affection of the lung"; with a vertical stroke in the centre it means as
						<foreign xml:lang="grc">*I</foreign> said "probable"; <foreign
						xml:lang="grc">*R</foreign> means "flux," "rigor"; <foreign xml:lang="grc"
						>*F</foreign> "phrenitis" or "consumption"; <foreign xml:lang="grc"
						>*S</foreign> "convulsion" or "morbid condition of oesophagus or mouth";
						<foreign xml:lang="grc">*T</foreign> "delivery"; <foreign xml:lang="grc"
						>*U</foreign> "recovery of health" or "hypochondrium"; <foreign
						xml:lang="grc">*X</foreign> "bile" or "bilious"; <foreign xml:lang="grc"
						>*Y</foreign> "chill"; <foreign xml:lang="grc">*W</foreign> "crudity."</p>
				<p>For more information about the characters see LittrÃ©, III. pp. 28-33, and various
					notes at the end of the cases, and also Ilberg in KÃ©hlewein's edition, p.
					245.</p>
				<p>As might have been expected, there is considerable doubt as to the right readings
					of these characters. Thus in V the characters at the end of Case <hi rend="sc"
						>I</hi> (first series) are :--</p>
				<p><hi rend="center">?? <foreign xml:lang="grc">*Z*S*M*O*N</foreign></hi></p>
				<p>where the first character is obviously another form of Galen's ??. Ilberg emends
					to :--</p>
				<p><hi rend="center">?? <foreign xml:lang="grc">*Z*S*M*O*N</foreign><foreign
							xml:lang="grc">*U</foreign>></hi></p>
				<p>Galen reads :--</p>

				<p><foreign xml:lang="grc">U(GI/EIA</foreign>.</p>
				<p>"It is probable that abundance of urine caused recovery in forty days."</p>
				<p>Galen's reading makes it necessary to take the words of the text, <foreign
						xml:lang="grc">META\ DE\ KRI/S1IN</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="grc"

				<p>It appears certain that there were varieties of this shorthand, and that Galen's
					account deals with one only.</p>

						<p>II. The year was southerly and rainy, with no winds throughout. About the
							rising of Arcturus, while during the immediately preceding period
							droughts had prevailed, there were now heavy rains, with southerly
							winds. Autumn dark and cloudy, with abundance of rain. The winter
							southerly, humid, and mild after the solstice. Long after the solstice,
							near the equinox, wintry weather returned, and at the actual equinoctial
							period there were northerly winds with snow, but not for long. The
							spring southerly again, with no winds ; many rains throughout until the
							Dog Star. The summer was clear and warm, with waves of stifling heat.
							The</p>
						<pb n="p.241"/>
						<p>Etesian winds were faint and intermittent. But, on the other hand, near
							the rising of Arcturus there were heavy rains with northerly winds.</p>
						<p>The year having proved southerly, wet and mild, in the winter the general
							health was good except for the consumptives, who will be described in
							due course.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="3">
						<head>PART 3</head>
						<p>III. Early in the spring, at the same time as the cold snaps which
							occurred, were many malignant cases<note>Or, "forms."</note> of
							erysipelas, some from a known exciting cause and some not. Many died,
							and many suffered pain in the throat. Voices impaired ; ardent fevers ;
							phrenitis ; aphthae in the mouth ; tumours in the private parts ;
							inflammations of the eyes ; carbuncles ; disordered bowels ; loss of
							appetite ; thirst in some cases, though not in all ; urine disordered,
							copious, bad ; long coma alternating with sleeplessness ; absence of
							crisis in many cases, and obscure crises ; dropsies ; many consumptives.
							Such were the diseases epidemic. There were patients suffering from each
							of the above types, and fatal cases were many. The symptoms in each type
							were as follow.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="4">
						<head>PART 4</head>
						<p>IV. Many were attacked by the erysipelas all over the body when the
							exciting cause was a trivial accident or a very small wound ; especially
							when the patients were about sixty years old and the wound was in the
							head, however little the neglect might have been. Many even while
							undergoing treatment suffered from severe inflammations,<note>With
								LittrÃ©'s punctuation the meaning is, "however slight the neglect,
								and even when a patient was actually undergoing treatment. There
								were severe inflammations," etc.</note> and the erysipelas would
							quickly spread widely in all directions. Most of the patients
							experienced abscessions ending in suppurations. Flesh, sinews and
							bones</p>
						<pb n="p.243"/>
						<p>fell away in large quantities. The flux which formed was not like pus,
							but was a different sort of putre-faction with a copious and varied
							flux. If any of these symptoms occurred in the head, there was loss of
							hair from all the head and from the chin ; the bones were bared and fell
							away, and there were copious fluxes. Fever was sometimes present and
							sometimes absent. These symptoms were terrifying rather than dangerous.
							For whenever they resulted in suppuration or some similar coction the
							cases usually recovered. But whenever the inflammation and the
							erysipelas disappeared without producing any such abscession, there were
							many deaths. The course of the disease was the same to whatever part of
							the body it spread. Many lost the arm and the entire forearm. If the
							malady settled in the sides there was rotting either before or behind.
							In some cases the entire thigh was bared, or the shin and the entire
							foot. But the most dangerous of all such cases were when the pubes and
							genital organs were attacked. Such were the sores which sprang from an
							exciting cause. In many cases, however, sores occurred in fevers, before
							a fever, or supervening on fevers. In some of these also, when an
							abscession took place through suppuration, or when a seasonable
							disturbance of the bowels occurred or a passing of favourable urine,
							this gave rise to a solution ; but when none of these events happened,
							and the symptoms disappeared without a sign, death resulted. It was in
							the spring that by far the greater number of cases of erysipelas
							occurred, but they continued throughout the summer and during
							autumn.</p>
						<pb n="p.245"/>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="5">
						<head>PART 5</head>
						<p>V. Much trouble was caused to some patients by the tumours in the throat,
							inflammations of the tongue and the abscesses about the teeth. Many had
							the symptom of impaired and muffled<note>The word so rendered has
								puzzled the commentators from very early times. See the full
								disoussion of LittrÃ© <hi rend="ital">ad loc.</hi> The ancients
								interpreted either "cooped up" or "altered," "faussÃ©e" (LittrÃ©). See
								Erotian <hi rend="ital">sub voce</hi>
								<foreign xml:lang="grc">FWNAI\ KATEI/LLOUS1AI</foreign>. I think
								that H. used a strange word metaphorically on purpose to describe a
								strange alteration in the voice, which was as it were "imprisoned"
								or (to borrow a motoring expression) "silenced."</note> voice, at
							first at the beginning of the cases of consumption, but also in the
							ardent fevers and in phrenitis.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="6">
						<head>PART 6</head>
						<p>VI. Now the ardent fevers and phrenitis began early in the spring after
							the cold snaps which occurred, and very many fell sick at that time.
							These suffered acute and fatal symptoms. The constitution of the ardent
							fevers that occurred was as follows. At the beginning coma, nausea,
							shivering, acute fever, no great thirst, no delirium, slight epistaxis.
							The exacerbations in most cases on even days, and about the time of the
							exacerbations there was loss of memory with prostration and
							speechlessness. The feet and hands of these patients were always colder
							than usual, most especially about the times of exacerbation. Slowly and
							in no healthy manner they recovered their heat, becoming rational again
							and conversing. Either the coma held them continuously without sleep, or
							they were wakeful and in pain. Bowels disordered in the majority of
							these cases, with crude, thin, copious stools. Urine copious, thin, with
							no critical or favourable sign, nor did any other critical sign appear
							in these patients. For there occurred neither favourable hemorrhage</p>
						<pb n="p.247"/>
						<p>nor any other of the usual critical abscessions. The manner of their
							dying varied with the individual ; it was usually irregular, at the
							crises, but in some cases after long loss of speech and in many with
							sweating. These were the symptoms attending the fatal cases of ardent
							fever, and the cases of phrenitis were similar. These suffered from no
							thirst at all, and no case showed the mad delirium that attacked others,
							but they passed away overpowered by a dull oppression of stupor.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="7">
						<head>PART 7</head>
						<p>VII. There were other fevers also, which I shall describe in due course.
							Many had aphthae and sores in the mouth. Fluxes about the genitals were
								copious<note>Possibly "frequent," "common." So LittrÃ©. This is one
								of the most doubtful cases of those difficult words in a medical
								context, <foreign xml:lang="grc">POLU/S</foreign> and <foreign
									xml:lang="grc">O)LI/GOS</foreign> in the plural. See General
								Introduction, p. lxi.</note>; sores, tumours external and internal ;
							the swellings which appear in the groin.<note>A curious phrase. I
								suspect that <foreign xml:lang="grc">TA\</foreign> hides a
								corruption of the text.</note> Watery inflammations of the eyes,
							chronic and painful. Growths on the eyelids, external and internal, in
							many cases destroying the sight, which are called "figs." There were
							also often growths on other sores, particularly in the genitals. Many
							carbuncles in the summer, and other affections called "rot." Large
							pustules. Many had large tetters.</p>
					</div>
					<div type="section" n="8">
						<head>PART 8</head>
						<p>VIII. The bowel troubles in many cases turned out many and harmful. In
							the first place many were attacked by painful tenesmus, mostly
							children--all in fact who were approaching puberty--and most of these
							died. Many lienteries. Cases of dysentery, but they too<note><hi
									rend="ital">I. c.</hi> as Galen suggests in his commentary, they
								were like the lienteries in not causing much pain. Lientery is not
								particularly painful.</note> were not very painful. Stools bilious,
							greasy, thin and watery. In many</p>
						<pb n="p.249"/>
						<p>cases this condition of the bowels constituted the disease itself, fever
							being sometimes absent and sometimes present.<note>LittrÃ© in a long and
								obscure note argues that only <foreign xml:lang="grc">A)/NEU
									PURETW=N</foreign> and not <foreign xml:lang="grc">E)N
									PURETOI=S1I</foreign> can belong to the preceding phrase,
								apparently because it is illogical to say that fever was present
								when the disease consisted merely of unhealthy stools. But the
								writer does not wish to exclude fever ; he merely wishes to exclude
								from this class of patient tenesmus, lientery and dysentery. The
								commentary of Galen, <foreign xml:lang="grc">POLLOI=S U=E/ FHS1IN
									AU)TO\ TOU=TO GENE/S1QAI TO\ NO/S1HMA</foreign>, <foreign
									xml:lang="grc">TOUTE/S1TI TO\ DIAXWREI=N TA\ TOIAU=TA: KAI\ GA\R
									KAI\ XWRI\S PURETW=N E)NI/OIS TOU=TO GENE/S1QAI
								*FHS1I</foreign>, does not, as LittrÃ© supposes, support his
								contention. The phrase <foreign xml:lang="grc">KAI\ XWRI\S PURETW=N
									E)NI/OIS TOU=TO GENE/S1QAI FHS1I\</foreign> implies <foreign
									xml:lang="grc">KAI\ E)N PURETOI=S TOU=TO

							There were evacuations, though the bulk of the contents remained
								behind.<note>It is hard to separate <foreign xml:lang="grc"
									>DIE/CODOI</foreign> from <foreign xml:lang="grc">TW=N
									POLLW=N</foreign>, yet the sense seems to require it. The next
								sentence states that these evacuations caused no relief, evidently
								because they did not clear the trouble from the bowel. Now if
									<foreign xml:lang="grc">DIE/CODOI</foreign> be taken with
									<foreign xml:lang="grc">TW=N POLLW=N</foreign>, the only
								possible translation is " evacuations of the many contents which
								were retained there," implying complete evacuation. Galen's comment
								(KÃ©hn XVII, Part I, p. 708) bears out the former interpretation :
									<foreign xml:lang="grc">TA\S DE\ DIECO/DOUS</foreign>, <foreign

							not take away the pains, and yielded with difficulty to the remedies
							administered. Purgings, in fact, did harm in most cases. Of those in

							chiefly from the bowel complaints. For the bowels carried all off
								together.<note>The writer has not expressed himself clearly in this
								chapter, which seems to be the roughest of rough notes. The last two

						<p>XIII. The severest and most troublesome disease, as well as the most
							fatal, was the consumption. Many cases began in the winter, and of these
							several took to their bed, though some went about ailing without doing
							so. Early in the spring most of those who had gone to bed died, while
							none of the others lost their cough, though it became easier in the
							summer. During autumn all took to bed and many died. Most of these were
							ill for a long time. Now most of these began suddenly to grow worse,
							showing the following symptoms :--frequent shivering ; often continuous
							and acute fever ; unseasonable, copious,<note>I am often doubtful as to
								the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="grc">POLLOI\</foreign> in
								instances like these ; does it refer to quantity or frequency ? In
								these two examples either meaning would give excellent sense. See
								General Introduction, p. lxi.</note> cold sweats throughout ; great
							chill with difficult recovery of heat ; bowels variously constipated,
							then quickly relaxing, and violently relaxing in all cases near the end
							; the humours about the lungs spread downwards ; abundance of
							unfavourable urine ; malignant wasting. The coughs throughout were
							frequent, bringing up copious,<note>I am often doubtful as to the

							much pain ; but even if there was pain, in all cases the purging from
							the lungs took place very mildly. The throat did not smart very much,
							nor did salt humours cause any distress at all. The fluxes, however,
							viscid, white,</p>
						<pb n="p.255"/>
						<p>moist, frothy, which came from the head, were abundant. But by far the
							worst symptom that attended both these cases and the others was the

							Heaviness in the body. Coma. In most of them there was swelling, which

						<p>XV. In all the cases described spring was the worst enemy, and caused the
							most deaths ; summer was the most favourable season, in which fewest
							died. In autumn and during the season of the Pleiades, on the other
							hand, there were again deaths, usually on the fourth day. And it seems
							to me natural that the coming on of summer should have been helpful. For
							the coming on of winter resolves the diseases of summer, and the coming
							on of summer removes those of winter. And yet in</p>
						<pb n="p.257"/>
						<p>itself the summer in question was not healthful ;<note>"Of a good
								constitution."</note> in fact it was suddenly hot, southerly, and
							calm. But nevertheless the change from the other constitution proved

							to be an important part of the art of medicine. The man who has learnt
							these things and uses them will not, I think, make great mistakes in the
							art. And it is necessary to learn accurately each constitution of the
							seasons as well as the disease ; what common element in the constitution
							or in the disease is good, and what common element in the constitution
							or in the disease is bad ; what malady is protracted and fatal, what is
							protracted and likely to end in recovery ; what acute illness is fatal,
							what acute illness is likely to end in recovery. With this knowledge it
							is easy to examine the order of the critical days, and to prognosticate
							therefrom. One who has knowledge of these matters can know whom he ought
							to treat, as well as the time and method of treatment.<note>This chapter

							discomfort. The evacuations showed varying symptoms ; they were either
							black, scanty and verdigris-coloured, or else greasy, crude and smarting
							; at times they seemed actually to be like milk. About the twenty-fourth
							day comfortable ; in other respects the same, but he had lucid

								the most carelessly written. Galen points out that <foreign

								rare and large, seeing that it had these characteristics throughout.
								A similar remark applies to <foreign xml:lang="grc">A)NAIS1QH/TWS
