      <p>
        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> Many people have come to
        me, gentlemen of the jury, in surprise at my accusing the corn-dealers in the Council, and
        telling me that you, however sure you are of their guilt, none the less regard those who
        deliver speeches about them as slander-mongers.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">i.e., men
          who, knowing the dealers were unpopular, brought charges against them hoping to be bought
          off. Cf. <bibl n="Lys. 24.2">Lys. 24.2</bibl>, note.</note> I therefore propose to speak
        first of the grounds on which I have found it necessary to accuse them. <milestone n="2"
          unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>When the Committee<note anchored="true"
          resp="Loeb">Fifty of the five hundred members of the Council appointed for the management
          of the Assembly during a tenth part of the year.</note> of the time brought up their case
        before the Council, the anger felt against them was such that some of the orators said that
        they ought to be handed over without trial to the Eleven, for the penalty of death. But I,
        thinking it monstrous that the Council should get into the way of such practice, rose and
        said that in my opinion we ought to try the corn-dealers in accordance with the law; for I
        thought that if they had committed acts deserving of death you would be no less able than
          we<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">i.e., the Council.</note> to come to a just decision,
        while, if they were not guilty, they ought not to perish without trial. <milestone n="3"
          unit="section"/> After the Council adopted this view, attempts were made to discredit me
        by saying that I hoped to save the corn-dealers by these remarks. Now before the Council,
        when the case came up for their hearing,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">As a preliminary
          to the trial proper.</note> I justified myself in a practical way: while the rest kept
        quiet, I rose and accused these men, and made it evident to all that my remarks were not
        made in their defence, but in support of the established laws. <milestone n="4"
          unit="section"/> Well, these were my reasons for beginning my task, in fear of those
        incriminations; but I consider it would be disgraceful to leave off before you have given
        such verdict upon them as you may prefer. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
          unit="para"/> So, first of all, go up on the dais.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">One of
          the corn-dealers is made to go up on the ”bema“ and is questioned. Cf. <bibl
            n="Lys. 12.25">Lys. 12.25</bibl>; <bibl n="Lys. 13.30">Lys. 13.30</bibl>.</note> Tell
        me, sir, are you a resident alien? Yes. Do you reside as an alien to obey the city's laws,
        or to do just as you please? To obey. Must you not, then, expect to be put to death, if you
        have committed a breach of the laws for which death is the penalty? I must. Then answer me:
        do you acknowledge that you bought up corn in excess of the fifty measures<note
          anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A “basket” or measure was about a bushel and a half.</note>
        which the law sets as the limit? I bought it up on an order from the magistrates. <milestone
          n="6" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> Well now, gentlemen, if he proves
        that there is a law which orders the corn-dealers to buy up the corn on an order from the
        magistrates, acquit him: if not, it is just that you should condemn him. For we have
        produced to you the law which forbids anyone in the city to buy up corn in excess of fifty
        measures. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> This accusation
        of mine should have sufficed, gentlemen of the jury, since this man acknowledges that he
        bought up the corn, while the law clearly forbids him to do so; and you have sworn to decide
        in accordance with the laws. Nevertheless, in order that you may be convinced that they are
        actually traducing the magistrates, it is necessary to speak of them at some greater length.
          <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> For since these men shifted the blame on to them, we
        called the magistrates before us and questioned them. Two of them denied any knowledge of
        the matter; but Anytus stated that in the previous winter, as the corn was dear, and these
        men were outbidding each other and fighting amongst themselves, he had advised them to cease
        their competition, judging it beneficial to you, their customers, that they should purchase
        at as reasonable a price as possible: for they were bound, in selling, to add no more than
        an obol to the price. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Now, that he did not order them to
        buy up the corn for holding in store,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">i.e., until the price
          was raised to their advantage.</note> but only advised them not to buy against each other,
        I will produce to you Anytus himself as witness.<quote type="Testimony"
            ><title>Testimony</title></quote><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>These statements were
        made by him in the time of the former Council, whereas these men evidently bought up the
        corn in the time of the present one. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
          unit="para"/> So now you have heard that it was not on an order from the magistrates that
        they bought up the corn; yet, in my opinion, however true their statements may be on these
        points, they will not be clearing themselves, but only accusing the magistrates. For where
        we have laws expressly drafted for the case, surely punishment should fall alike on those
        who disobey them and on those who order an infringement of them. <milestone n="11"
          unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> But in fact, gentlemen of the jury, I
        believe they will not have recourse to this argument, but will repeat, perhaps, what they
        said before the Council, — that it was in kindness to the city that they bought up the corn,
        so that they might sell it to you at as reasonable a price as possible. But I will give you
        a very strong and signal proof that they are lying. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> If
        they were doing this for your benefit, they ought to have been found selling it at the same
        price for a number of days, until the stock that they had bought up was exhausted. But in
        fact they were selling at a profit of a drachma<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">i.e., six
          times the legal profit on each measure.</note> several times in the same day, as though
        they were buying by the medimnus<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">About the same as the
          phormus in <bibl n="Lys. 22.5">Lys. 22.5</bibl>.</note> at a time. I adduce you as
        witnesses of this. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> And it seems to me a strange thing
        that, when they have to contribute to a special levy of which everyone is to have knowledge,
        they refuse, making poverty their pretext; but illegal acts, for which death is the penalty,
        and in which secrecy was important to them, — these they assert that they committed in
        kindness to you. Yet you are all aware that they are the last persons to whom such
        statements are appropriate. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> For their interests are the
        opposite of other men's: they make most profit when, on some bad news reaching the city,
        they sell their corn at a high price. And they are so delighted to see your disasters that
        they either get news of them in advance of anyone else, or fabricate the rumor themselves;
        now it is the loss of your ships in the <placeName key="tgn,7016619">Black Sea</placeName>,
        now the capture of vessels on their outward voyage by the Lacedaemonians, now the blockade
        of your trading ports, or the impending rupture of the truce; and they have carried their
        enmity to such lengths that they choose the same critical moments as your foes to overreach
        you. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> For, just when you find yourselves worst off for
        corn, these persons snap it up and refuse to sell it, in order to prevent our disputing
        about the price: we are to be glad enough if we come away from them with a purchase made at
        any price, however high. And thus at times, although there is peace, we are besieged by
        these men. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> So long is it now that the city has been
        convinced of their knavery and disaffection that, while for the sale of all other
        commodities you have appointed the market-clerks as controllers, for this trade alone you
        elect special corn-controllers by lot; and often you have been known to inflict the extreme
        penalty on those officials, who were citizens, for having failed to defeat the villainy of
        these men. Now, what should be your treatment of the actual offenders, when you put to death
        even those who are unable to control them? <milestone n="17" unit="section"/><milestone
          ed="P" unit="para"/> You should reflect that it is impossible for you to vote an
        acquittal. For if you reject the charge, when they admit that they are combining against the
        traders, you will be regarded as aiming a blow at the importers. If they were putting up
        some other defence, nobody could censure a verdict for acquittal; for it rests with you to
        choose which side you are to believe. But, as matters stand, your action cannot but be
        thought extraordinary, if you dismiss unpunished those who confess to breaking the law.
          <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> Remember, gentlemen of the jury, that many in the past
        have met this charge with denial, and have produced witnesses; yet you have condemned them
        to death because you gave more credence to the statements of their accusers. But surely it
        would be astounding if, in passing judgement on the same offences, you are more eager to
        punish those who deny! <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> And, moreover, gentlemen, I
        conceive it is obvious to you all that suits of this kind are of the closest concern to the
        people of our city; and hence they will inquire what view you take of such matters, in the
        belief that, if you condemn these men to death, the rest will be brought to better order;
        while if you dismiss them unpunished, you will have voted them full licence to do just as
        they please. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> You must chastise them, gentlemen, not only
        on account of the past, but also to give an example for the future: even so these people
        will be barely tolerable. Consider that great numbers in this business have been tried for
        their lives: so much profit do they make by it that they choose rather to risk death every
        day than to cease making illicit gain out of you. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> Nay,
        more, not even if they implore and beseech you, would you be justified in taking pity on
        them: far rather ought you to pity those of our citizens who perished by their villainy, and
        the traders against whom they have combined. These you will gratify and render more zealous
        by punishing the accused. Otherwise, what do you suppose their feelings will be, when they
        learn that you have acquitted the retailers who confessed to overreaching the importers?
          <milestone n="22" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> I do not see what more
        there is to say when suits against other malefactors are heard, you have to get your
        information from the accusers; whereas the villainy of these men is understood by you all.
        So, you convict them, you will both do justice and buy your corn at a fairer price:
        otherwise, it will be dearer.</p>
