      <p>
        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I find myself greatly
        embarrassed by this trial, gentlemen of the jury, when I consider that if I fail to speak
        with effect today not only I but my father besides will be held to be guilty, and I shall be
        deprived of the whole of my possessions. It is necessary therefore, even if I have no
        natural aptitude for the task, to defend my father and myself as best I can. <milestone
          n="2" unit="section"/>You see, of course, the artifice and the alacrity of my enemies; of
        these there is no need to speak; whereas everyone who knows me is aware of my inexperience.
        I shall therefore beg of you the just and easy favor of hearing us with the same absence of
        anger as when you listened to our accusers. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>For the man who
        speaks in his defence, even if you give him an impartial hearing, must needs be at a
        disadvantage: those people have laid their schemes long before, and without any danger to
        themselves have delivered their accusation; whereas we are contending amid fear and slander
        and the gravest danger. It is reasonable, therefore, that you should feel more kindness for
        those who are making their defence. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>For I think you all
        know that there have been many cases in the past of men bringing forward a number of
        formidable accusations, who have been convicted then and there of lying on such clear
        evidence that they left the court detested by all who had been present; while others again,
        after bearing false witness and causing people to be unjustly put to death, have been
        condemned too late for it to be of any use to their victims. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
        />So, when many cases of this sort have occurred, as I am told, it is reasonable that you,
        gentlemen, should wait till we have had our say before you accept the statements of our.
        accusers as trustworthy. I myself am told, and I think most of you know also, that slander
        is the most dangerous thing on earth. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>This is especially to
        be observed when a number of persons are brought to trial on the same charge. For, as a
        rule, the last to be judged are let off, since your anger has then ceased, and as you listen
        to them you willingly admit their disproofs.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The slanderer
          has the art of raising indignation against his victims: if there is time for this to cool
          down, the falsity of his charges is exposed.</note>
        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Reflect therefore that
        Nicophemus and Aristophanes were put to death without trial,<note anchored="true"
          resp="Loeb">On a summary impeachment allowed in special cases of treason or
          embezzlement.</note> before anyone could come to their aid as the proof of their guilt was
        being made out. For nobody even saw them again after their arrest, since their bodies were
        not even delivered for burial: so awful has their calamity been that, in addition to the
        rest, they have suffered this privation also. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>But from that
        business I will now pass, as I can do no good there. Far more miserable, in my opinion, are
        the children of Aristophanes: for, having done no wrong to anyone in either private or
        public affairs, not only have they been bereft of their patrimony in violation of your laws,
        but their one remaining hope, of being reared with the means of their grandfather, has been
        placed in this serious predicament. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>Moreover we, bereft of
        our kinsfolk, bereft of the dowry,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Of the speaker's sister;
          cf. <bibl n="Lys. 19.32">Lys. 19.32</bibl> below.</note> and compelled to rear three small
        children, are attacked besides by base informers, and are in danger of losing what our
        ancestors bequeathed to us after they had acquired it by honest means. Yet, gentlemen, my
        father in all his life spent more on the State than on himself and his family,—twice the
        amount that we have now, as he often reckoned in my presence. <milestone n="10"
          unit="section"/>So you must not rashly convict of guilt the man who spent little on
        himself, but a great deal on you each year; you ought rather to condemn all those persons
        who have made a habit of squandering both their patrimony and whatever they can get from
        elsewhere on the most disgraceful pleasures. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>It is
        difficult indeed, gentlemen, to defend oneself against an impression which some people have
        received of the property of Nicophemus, and in face of a scarcity of money that is now felt
        in the city, and when our contention is against the Treasury. Nevertheless, even in these
        circumstances, you will easily perceive that the accusations are not true; and I request you
        with all the insistence in my power to give us a kindly hearing to the end, and to deliver
        the verdict that you may esteem best for you and most agreeable to your oaths. <milestone
          n="12" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now I will inform you, in the first
        place, of the way in which they<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The family of
          Aristophanes.</note> became connected with us. Conon, who was in command of operations
        around the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>,<note anchored="true"
          resp="Loeb"><date value="-393">393</date> B.C., when he succeeded in reestablishing some
          strongholds of the Athenians on the coasts of <placeName key="tgn,7002745"
            >Laconia</placeName>.</note> and who had formed a friendship long before with my father
        when he equipped a warship, requested him to bestow my sister on her suitor, the son of
        Nicophemus. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>My father, finding that these people had been
        accredited by <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>, and were of proved
        respectability and—at that time at least<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">So far there were
          no signs of their later disloyalty.</note>—in the good graces of the city, was persuaded
        to bestow her: he did not know the slander that was to follow. It was a time when anyone
        among you would have deemed it desirable to be connected with them; for it was not done for
        the sake of money, as you may readily judge from my father's whole life and conduct.
          <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>When he was of age, he had the chance of marrying
        another woman with a great fortune; but he took my mother without a portion, merely because
        she was a daughter of Xenophon,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">One of the Athenian
          generals to whom the Potidaeans surrendered in <date value="-430">430</date> B.C. He was
          killed in a fight with the Chalcidians in <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>,
            <date value="-429">429</date> B.C. (cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.70">Thuc. 2.70,
          79</bibl>).</note> son of Euripides, a man not only known for his private virtues but also
        deemed worthy by you of holding high command, so I am told. <milestone n="15" unit="section"
        />Again, my sisters he refused to certain very wealthy men who were willing to take them
        without dowries, because he judged them to be of inferior birth: he preferred to bestow one
        upon Philomelus of Paeania,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A township of <placeName
            key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.</note> whom most men regard as an honorable rather
        than a wealthy man, and the other upon a man who was reduced to poverty by no
        misdemeanor,—his nephew, Phaedrus<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The same person who
          appears in Plato's <title>Phaedrus</title> and <title>Symposium</title>.</note> of
          Myrrhinous,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A township of <placeName key="tgn,7002681"
            >Attica</placeName>.</note>—and with her a dowry of forty minae; and he later gave her
        to Aristophanes with the same sum. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>Besides doing this,
        when I could have obtained a great fortune he advised me to take a lesser one, so long as I
        felt sure of allying myself with people of an orderly and self-respecting character. So now
        I am married to the daughter of Critodemus of Alopece,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A
          township of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.</note> who was killed by the
        Lacedaemonians after the sea-fight at the <placeName key="tgn,7002638"
          >Hellespont</placeName>.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">At <placeName key="tgn,6000070"
            >Aegospotami</placeName>, <date value="-405">405</date> B.C. After surprising the
          Athenian fleet (there was practically no “sea-fight”) Lysander executed 3000 Athenians who
          were captured.</note>
        <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>Now I submit, gentlemen of the jury, that a man who has
        himself married a portionless woman, who has bestowed large sums with his two daughters, and
        who has accepted a small dowry for his son, ought surely in reason to be credited with
        allying himself to these people without a thought of money. <milestone n="18" unit="section"
          /><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Nay, more, Aristophanes, although he was now married,
        must have preferred to be intimate with many people rather than my father, as may readily be
        conceived. For there was a great difference both in his age and still more in his nature. It
        was my father's way to mind his own business; whereas Aristophanes sought to concern himself
        not only with private but also with public affairs, and whatever money he had he spent in
        the pursuit of glory. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>You will perceive the truth of what
        I say from his actual conduct. First, when Conon wanted to send someone to <placeName
          key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">In <date
            value="-393">393</date> B.C., to undermine the friendship between Dionysius, despot of
            <placeName key="perseus,Syracuse">Syracuse</placeName>, and the Spartans, who had helped
          him to attain his power in <date value="-406">406</date> B.C.</note> he offered himself
        and went off with Eunomus, who was a friend and guest of Dionysius, and who had rendered a
        great many services to your people, as I have been told by those who were with him at the
        Peiraeus. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>The voyage was undertaken in hopes of persuading
        Dionysius to connect himself by marriage with Evagoras,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
          >Despot of <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> in <placeName
            key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, and steady friend of <placeName
            key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> and to become an enemy of the
        Lacedaemonians and a friend and ally of your city. This they set out to do amid many dangers
        arising from the sea and from the enemy, and they prevailed on Dionysius not to send some
        warships which he had then prepared for the Lacedaemonians. <milestone n="21" unit="section"
        />Next, when the envoys had arrived from <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> to
        procure our assistance,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Against the Persians.</note> his
        ardent energy knew no bounds. You had granted them ten warships, and had voted all the
        material, but they were in need of money for the dispatch of the fleet. They had brought but
        scanty funds with them, and they required a great deal more: for they had to hire not only
        men to work the ships but light infantry also, and to purchase arms. <milestone n="22"
          unit="section"/>Well, it was Aristophanes who personally supplied most of their funds: as
        he had not enough, he persuaded his friends with entreaties and guarantees, and he took
        forty minae which he had in deposit at his house for his brother on the father's side, and
        applied the money to that purpose. The day before he put to sea, he called on my father and
        pressed him for the loan of such money as he had; for some more was required, he said, to
        pay the light infantry. We had seven minae in the house: he took these and applied them
        also. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>What man, think you, who was ambitious of glory, and
        was receiving letters from his father that told him he would lack for nothing in <placeName
          key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, and had been elected ambassador and was about to
        sail to Evagoras, would have left behind anything that he possessed, and not have rather
        gratified that ruler by supplying everything that he could, with a view to a handsome
        return? Now, to show the truth of all this, please call Eunomus.<quote type="Testimony"
            ><title>Testimony</title></quote><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Please call the other
        witnesses also.<quote type="Witnesses"><title>Witnesses</title></quote>
        <milestone n="24" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>You hear them testify, not
        only that they lent the money at his request, but also that they have been repaid; for it
        was conveyed to them in the warship.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Well now, it is easily
        concluded from my argument that in such emergencies he was not likely to spare his own
        resources. But the strongest evidence is this: <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>Demus, son
        of Pyrilampes,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">This Demus has been famous in youth for his
          beauty: cf. <bibl n="Aristoph. Wasps 98">Aristoph. Wasps 98</bibl>, <bibl
            n="Plat. Gorg. 481d">Plat. Gorg. 481d</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 513b">Plat. Gorg.
            513b</bibl>.</note> who was equipping a warship for <placeName key="tgn,1000112"
          >Cyprus</placeName>, requested me to go to Aristophanes; he said he had received a gold
        cup as a credential from the Great King, and would give it to Aristophanes in pledge for
        sixteen minae, so as to have means for equipping his warship; when he got to <placeName
          key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, he would redeem it with a payment of twenty minae,
        since on the strength of that credential he would then obtain plenty of goods and also money
        all over the continent. <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>Then Aristophanes, on hearing this
        proposal from Demus and a request from me,—although he was to have the gold cup in his hands
        and receive four minae as interest,— said that it was impossible, and he swore that he had
        already gone elsewhere to borrow more for these foreigners; since, but for that, nobody
        alive, he declared, would have been more delighted than he to take that credential forthwith
        and to comply with our request. <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>To show the truth of this,
        I will produce to you witnesses.<quote type="Witnesses"
          ><title>Witnesses</title></quote><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>So then, that Aristophanes
        did not leave any silver or gold is easily concluded from what I have stated and from these
        testimonies. Of fine<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Containing an admixture of gold and
          silver.</note> bronze plate he possessed but little: when he was entertaining the envoys
        of Evagoras, he had to use what he could borrow. The list of the pieces that he left shall
        be read to you.<quote type="Inventory of Bronze Plate"><title>Inventory of Bronze
            Plate</title></quote>
        <milestone n="28" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Perhaps to some of you,
        gentlemen of the jury, they appear few: but bear in mind the fact that before <placeName
          key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName> won his victory at sea,<note anchored="true"
          resp="Loeb">At <placeName key="tgn,5003757">Cnidus</placeName>, <date value="-394"
            >394</date> B.C.</note> Aristophanes had no land except a small plot at Rhamnus.<note
          anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A district of <placeName key="tgn,7002681"
          >Attica</placeName>.</note> Now the sea-fight occurred in the archonship of Eubulides;
          <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>and in four or five years it was a difficult thing,
        gentlemen, when he had no wealth to start with, to be twice a producer of tragedies, on his
        father's account as well as his own; to equip a warship for three years in succession; to
        have been a contributor to special levies on many occasions; to purchase a house for fifty
        minae; and to acquire more than three hundred plethra<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
          >Amounting to about 80 acres.</note> of land. Do you suppose that, besides doing all this,
        he must have left many personal effects? <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>Why, even people
        credited with long-established wealth may fail to produce any that are of value: for at
        times, however much one may desire it, one cannot buy things of the sort that, once
        acquired, will be a permanent source of pleasure. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/>Again,
        consider this: in all other cases where you have confiscated the property, not merely have
        you had no sale of furniture, but even the doors were torn away from the apartments; whereas
        we, as soon as the confiscation was declared and my sister had left the place, posted a
        guard in the deserted house, in order that neither door-timber nor utensils nor anything
        else might be lost. Personal effects were realized to the value of over a thousand drachmae,
          <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>—more than you had received in any previous instance.
        Moreover, we now repeat our former offer to pledge ourselves to the Commissioners, in the
        most binding terms available to man, that we hold no part of Aristophanes' estate, but are
        owed from it the dowry of my sister and seven minae which he got from my father at his
        departure. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>Could human beings have a more miserable fate
        than to lose their own property, and then to be supposed to hold that of the mulcted party?
        And the greatest hardship of all for us will be that, having taken charge of my sister and
        her many children, we must rear them with no means available even for ourselves, if you
        deprive us of what we now have. <milestone n="34" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P"
          unit="para"/>I adjure you, by the Olympian gods, gentlemen, just consider it in this way:
        suppose that one of you had happened to bestow his daughter or his sister on Timotheus,<note
          anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A friend of Isocrates, and an important Athenian commander and
          statesman, c. <dateRange from="-380" to="-352">380</dateRange>-352 B.C. His father
            <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>, like Aristophanes' father Nicophemus,
          resided and died in <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>.</note> son of
          <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>, and during his absence abroad <placeName
          key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName> was involved in some slander and his estate was
        confiscated, and the city received from the sale of the whole something less than four
        talents of silver. Would you think it right that his children and relatives should be ruined
        merely because the property had turned out to be but a trifling fraction of the amount at
        which it stood in your estimation? <milestone n="35" unit="section"/>But of course you are
        all aware that <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName> held the command, and
        Nicophemus carried out his instructions. Now it is probable that <placeName
          key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName> allotted to others but a small proportion of his
        prizes; so that if it be thought that Nicophemus's gains were great, it must be allowed that
          <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>'s were more than ten times greater.
          <milestone n="36" unit="section"/>Furthermore, there is no evidence of any dispute having
        occurred between them; so probably in regard to money they agreed in deciding that each
        should leave his son with a competence here,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">In <placeName
            key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> while keeping the rest in his own

        daughter, and they also felt that their property there was just as safe as their property
        here. <milestone n="37" unit="section"/>Besides, you have to consider that, even if a man
        had distributed among his sons what he had not acquired but inherited from his father, he
        would have reserved a goodly share for himself<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Still more
          would this be the case if, like <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>'s, his
          wealth had been acquired by his public services.</note>; for everyone would rather be
        courted by his children as a man of means than beg of them as a needy person. <milestone
          n="38" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>So, in this case, if you should
        confiscate the property of Timotheus,—which Heaven forbid, unless some great benefit is to
        accrue to the State,—and you should receive a less amount from it than has been derived from
        that of Aristophanes, would this give you any good reason for thinking that his relatives
        should lose what belongs to them? No, it is not reasonable, gentlemen of the jury:
          <milestone n="39" unit="section"/>for <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>'s
        death and the dispositions made under his will in <placeName key="tgn,1000112"
          >Cyprus</placeName> have clearly shown that his fortune was but a small fraction of what
        you were expecting. He dedicated five thousand staters<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">The
          Attic stater was a gold coin equal to 20 drachmae.</note> in offerings to Athene and to
        Apollo at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>; <milestone n="40"
          unit="section"/>to his nephew, who acted as guardian and manager of all his property in
          <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, he gave about ten thousand drachmae; to
        his brother three talents; and to his son he left the rest,—seventeen talents. The round
        total of these sums amounts to about forty talents. <milestone n="41" unit="section"/>And
        nobody can say that there was malversation, or that the accounts were not fairly rendered:
        for he made his dispositions himself in his illness, while his mind was sound. Please call
        witnesses to this.<quote type="Witnesses"><title>Witnesses</title></quote>
        <milestone n="42" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Why, surely anyone,
        gentlemen, before the amounts of the two had been revealed, would have thought that the
        property of Nicophemus was a mere fraction of that of <placeName key="tgn,1123029"
          >Conon</placeName>. Now, Aristophanes had acquired a house with land for more than five
        talents, had produced dramas on his own account and on his father's at a cost of five
        thousand drachmae,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">50 minae.</note> and had spent eighty
          minae<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1 talent and 20 minae.</note> on equipping
        warships; <milestone n="43" unit="section"/>on account of the two, no less than forty minae
        have been contributed to special levies; for the Sicilian expedition he spent a hundred
          minae,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">1 talent and 40 minae.</note> and for
        commissioning the warships, when the Cypriots came and you gave them the ten vessels, he
        supplied thirty thousand drachmae<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">5 talents.</note> to pay
        the light infantry and purchase their arms. The total of all these sums amounts to little
        short of fifteen talents. <milestone n="44" unit="section"/>Hence you can have no reason to
        lay blame on us, since the property of <placeName key="tgn,1123029">Conon</placeName>, which
        is admitted to have been fairly accounted for by the owner himself, and was thought to be
        many times more than that of Aristophanes, is found to be less than thrice the amount of
        his. And we are omitting from the calculation all that Nicophemus held himself in <placeName
          key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, where he had a wife and a daughter. <milestone
          n="45" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I claim, therefore, gentlemen of the
        jury, that after having produced such an abundance of weighty proofs we ought not to be
        unjustly ruined. I have been told by my father and other elderly people that you have had
        similar experiences in the past of being deceived in the fortunes of many men who were
        supposed to be wealthy while they lived, but whose death showed your supposition to be wide
        of the mark. <milestone n="46" unit="section"/>For example, Ischomachus during his life was
        considered by everyone to own more than seventy talents, as I am told: his two sons, on his
        death, had less than ten talents to divide between them. Stephanus, son of Thallus, was
        reported to own more than fifty talents; but when he died his fortune was found to be about
        eleven talents. <milestone n="47" unit="section"/>Again, the estate of Nicias was expected
        to be not less than a hundred talents,— most of it in his house; but when Niceratus<note
          anchored="true" resp="Loeb">Son of Nicias; cf. <bibl n="Lys. 18">Lys. 18</bibl>, <title>On
            the Confession of the Property of the brother of Nicias</title>.</note> was dying, he
        said that he in his turn was not leaving any silver or gold, and the property that he left
        to his son is worth no more than fourteen talents. <milestone n="48" unit="section"/>Then
          Callias,<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb">A wealthy patron of Sophists; cf. Plato,
            <title>Protagoras</title>.</note> son of Hipponicus, just after his father's death, was
        thought to have more in his possession than any other Greek, and the story goes that his
        grandfather valued his own property at two hundred talents; yet his ratable property stands
        today at less than two talents. And you all know how Cleophon<note anchored="true"
          resp="Loeb">Cf. <bibl n="Lys. 13.7">Lys. 13.7</bibl>, note.</note> for many years had all
        the affairs of the State in his hands, and was expected to have got a great deal by his
        office; but when he died this money was nowhere to be found, <milestone n="49"
          unit="section"/>and moreover his relatives both by blood and by marriage, in whose hands
        he would have left it, are admittedly poor people. So it is evident that we have been
        greatly deceived both in men of hereditary riches and in those who have recently gained a
        name for wealth. The cause of this, in my opinion, is that people make light of stating that
        such an one has got many talents by his office. As to the common statements about dead
        people, I am not so much surprised, since there is no disproof to fear from them; but what
        of the lies with which they assail the living? <milestone n="50" unit="section"/>Why, you
        yourselves were told of late in the Assembly that Diotimus<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
          >An Athenian general, <dateRange from="-388" to="-387">388</dateRange>-387 B.C.</note> had
        got forty talents more from the ship-masters and merchants<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
          >In return for the protection given them in their business by the general.</note> than he
        himself admitted; and when he rendered an account on his return, and was indignant at being
        slandered in his absence, nobody put that matter to the proof, although the State was in
        need of money, <milestone n="51" unit="section"/>and he was ready to show his accounts. Just
        imagine what the position would have been if, after all the Athenians had been told that
        Diotimus had forty talents, something had then happened to him before he reached our shores.
        His relatives would then have been in the gravest danger, if they had been obliged to defend
        themselves against that monstrous slander without any knowledge of the facts of the case.
        So, for your being deceived in many people even now, and indeed for the ruin that some have
        unjustly incurred, you have to thank those who make light of telling lies and are bent on
        bringing malicious charges against their fellows. <milestone n="52" unit="section"/>For I
        suppose you know that Alcibiades held command for four or five years<note anchored="true"
          resp="Loeb"><dateRange from="-411" to="-407">411</dateRange>-407 B.C.</note> in
        succession, keeping the upper hand and winning victories over the Lacedaemonians: the cities
        thought well to give him twice as much as any other commander, so that some people supposed
        that he had more than a hundred talents. But when he died<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"
          >He was murdered in <placeName key="tgn,7002613">Phrygia</placeName>, <date value="-404"
            >404</date> B.C.</note> he left evidence that this was not true: for he bequeathed a
        smaller fortune to his children than he had inherited himself from his guardians. <milestone
          n="53" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Well now, that such things were
        common in former times is easily judged. But they say that it is the best and wisest men who
        are most willing to change their minds. If, therefore, our statements are deemed to be
        reasonable and the proofs that we have adduced satisfactory, gentlemen of the jury, show
        your pity by all manner of means. For, grievous as was the weight of this slander, we always
        expected to conquer with the help of truth: but if you should altogether refuse to entertain
        our plea, we felt ourselves without a single hope of deliverance. <milestone n="54"
          unit="section"/>Ah, by the Olympian gods, gentlemen, choose rather to deliver us with
        justice than to ruin us with injustice; and believe that those men speak the truth who,
        though keeping silent, show themselves throughout their lives self-respecting and just.
          <milestone n="55" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>In regard to the charge
        itself, and the manner in which they became our kinsmen, and the fact that Aristophanes'
        means were not sufficient for the expedition, but were supplemented by loans from others,
        you have heard our statements and testimonies: I propose next to tell you briefly about
        myself. I am now thirty years old, and never yet have I either had a dispute with my father
        or been the subject of a complaint from any citizen; and although I live near the
        market-place, I have never once been seen in either law-court or council-chamber until I met
        with this misfortune. <milestone n="56" unit="section"/>So much let me say regarding myself:
        as to my father, since he has been treated as guilty in these accusations, forgive me if I
        mention what he has spent on the city and on his friends; I do this, not for mere vainglory,
        but to bring in as evidence the fact that the same man cannot both spend a great deal
        without compulsion and covet some of the public property at the gravest risk. <milestone
          n="57" unit="section"/>There are, indeed, persons who spend money in advance, not with
        that sole object, but to obtain a return of twice the amount from the appointments which you
        consider them to have earned.<note anchored="true" resp="Loeb"> Some men spend money to earn
          a good name for public spirit: it is spent, not for that end alone, but as a speculation
          on the prospect of gaining twice as much in gifts during their tenure of the office which
          they hope to obtain.</note> Now, not once did my father seek office, but he has discharged
        every duty in the production of dramas, has equipped a warship seven times, and has made
        numerous large contributions to special levies. That you on your part may be apprised of
        this, the record shall be read in detail.<quote type="Public Services"><title>Public
            Services</title></quote>
        <milestone n="58" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>You hear, gentlemen of the
        jury, the whole series. For as many as fifty years my father performed services to the
        State, both with his purse and with his person. In all that time, with his reputation for
        ancestral wealth, he is not likely to have shunned any expense. However, I will strengthen
        the case for you with witnesses.<quote type="Witnesses"><title>Witnesses</title></quote>
        <milestone n="59" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The sum total of them all
        is nine talents and two thousand drachmae. In addition, he also joined privately in
        portioning daughters and sisters of certain needy citizens: there were men whom he ransomed
        from the enemy, and others for whose funerals he provided money. He acted in this way
        because he conceived it to be the part of a good man to assist his friends, even if nobody
        was to know: but at this moment it is fitting that you should hear of it from me. Please
        call this and that person.<quote type="Witnesses"><title>Witnesses</title></quote>
        <milestone n="60" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Well then, you have heard
        the witnesses; and now reflect that, although one might be able to adopt a feigned character
        for a short time, nobody in the world could keep his baseness secret for seventy years. Now,
        there are things for which it might perhaps be possible to reproach my father; but on the
        score of money there is no one, even among his enemies, who has ever dared to do so.
          <milestone n="61" unit="section"/>It is not fair, then, to credit our accusers' words
        rather than the deeds that marked his whole life, or than time, which you are to regard as
        the clearest test of truth. If he had been of another stamp, he would not have left but a
        small remnant of his estate; for if you should now be utterly deceived by these people, and
        should confiscate our property, you would receive less than two talents. So not only with a
        view to repute, but also in respect of money, it is more to your advantage to acquit us; for
        you will get far more benefit if we keep it. <milestone n="62" unit="section"/>Consider, as
        you survey the time that is past, all that is found to have been spent on the city: at this
        moment, too, I am equipping a warship from the residue; my father was equipping one when he
        died, and I will try to do what I saw him doing, and raise, by degrees, some little sums for
        the public services. Thus in reality it continues to be the property of the State, and while
        I shall not be feeling the wrong of having been deprived of it, you will have in this way
        more benefits than you would get by its confiscation. <milestone n="63" unit="section"
        />Moreover, you would do well to reflect on the kind of nature that my father possessed. In
        every single case where he desired to spend beyond what was necessary, it will be found that
        it was something designed to bring honor to the city also. For instance, when he was in the
        cavalry, he not only procured handsome mounts, but also won victories with race-horses at
        the Isthmus and <placeName key="perseus,Nemea">Nemea</placeName>, so that the city was
        proclaimed, and he himself was crowned. <milestone n="64" unit="section"/>I therefore beg
        you, gentlemen of the jury, to remember these things, and also everything else that has been
        stated, and to support us, and not to suffer us to be annihilated by our enemies. In taking
        this course you will be voting what is just and also advantageous to yourselves.</p>
