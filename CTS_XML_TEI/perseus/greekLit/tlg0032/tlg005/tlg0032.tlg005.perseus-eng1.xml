            <div n="1" type="section">
                <p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It seems to me fitting to hand down to memory,
                    furthermore, how <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, on being
                    indicted, deliberated on his defence and on his end. It is true that others have
                    written about this, and that all of them have reproduced the loftiness of his
                    words,—a fact which proves that his utterance really was of the character
                    intimated;—but they have not shown clearly that he had now come to the
                    conclusion that for him death was more to be desired than life; and hence his
                    lofty utterance appears rather ill-considered. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
                <p>Hermogenes, the son of Hipponicus, however, was a companion of his and has given
                    us reports of such a nature as to show that the sublimity of his speech was
                    appropriate to the resolve he had made. For he stated that on seeing
                            <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> discussing any and
                    every subject rather than the trial, he had said: </p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
                <p>“<persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>, ought you not to be giving
                    some thought to what defence you are going to make?” That
                            <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> had at first replied,
                    “Why, do I not seem to you to have spent my whole life in preparing to defend
                    myself?” Then when he asked, “How so?” he had said, “Because all my life I have
                    been guiltless of wrong-doing; and that I consider the finest preparation for a
                    defence.” Then when Hermogenes again asked, </p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
                <p>“Do you not observe that the Athenian courts have often been carried away by an
                    eloquent speech and have condemned innocent men to death, and often on the other
                    hand the guilty have been acquitted either because their plea aroused compassion
                    or because their speech was witty?” “Yes, indeed!” he had answered; “and I have
                    tried twice already to meditate on my defence, but my divine sign interposes.”
                </p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="section">
                <p>And when Hermogenes observed, “That is a surprising statement,” he had replied,
                    “Do you think it surprising that even God holds it better for me to die now? Do
                    you not know that I would refuse to concede that any man has lived a better life
                    than I have up to now? For I have realized that my whole life has been spent in
                    righteousness toward God and man,—a fact that affords the greatest satisfaction;
                    and so I have felt a deep self-respect and have discovered that my associates
                    hold corresponding sentiments toward me. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
                <p>But now, if my years are prolonged, I know that the frailties of old age will
                    inevitably be realized,—that my vision must be less perfect and my hearing less
                    keen, that I shall be slower to learn and more forgetful of what I have learned.
                    If I perceive my decay and take to complaining, how,” he had continued, “could I
                    any longer take pleasure in life? </p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="section">
                <p>Perhaps,” he added, “God in his kindness is taking my part and securing me the
                    opportunity of ending my life not only in season but also in the way that is
                    easiest. For if I am condemned now, it will clearly be my privilege to suffer a
                    death that is adjudged by those who have superintended this matter to be not
                    only the easiest but also the least irksome to one's friends and one that
                    implants in them the deepest feeling of loss for the dead. For when a person
                    leaves behind in the hearts of his companions no remembrance to cause a blush or
                    a pang, but dissolution comes while he still possesses a sound body and a spirit
                    capable of showing kindliness, how could such a one fail to be sorely missed?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="section">
                <p>It was with good reason,” Socrates had continued, “that the gods opposed<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="true">See note on p. 494.</note> my studying up my
                    speech at the time when we held that by fair means or foul we must find some
                    plea that would effect my acquittal. For if I had achieved this end, it is clear
                    that instead of now passing out of life, I should merely have provided for dying
                    in the throes of illness or vexed by old age, the sink into which all distresses
                    flow, unrelieved by any joy. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="9" type="section">
                <p>As Heaven is my witness, Hermogenes,” he had gone on, “I shall never court that
                    fate; but if I am going to offend the jury by declaring all the blessings that I
                    feel gods and men have bestowed on me, as well as my personal opinion of myself,
                    I shall prefer death to begging meanly for longer life and thus gaining a life
                    far less worthy in exchange for death.” </p>
            </div>
            <div n="10" type="section">
                <p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Hermogenes stated that with this resolve Socrates
                    came before the jury after his adversaries had charged him with not believing in
                    the gods worshipped by the state and with the introduction of new deities in
                    their stead and with corruption of the young, and replied: </p>
            </div>
            <div n="11" type="section">
                <p>“One thing that I marvel at in Meletus, gentlemen, is what may be the basis of
                    his assertion that I do not believe in the gods worshipped by the state; for all
                    who have happened to be near at the time, as well as Meletus himself,—if he so
                    desired, — have seen me sacrificing at the communal festivals and on the public
                    altars. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="12" type="section">
                <p>As for introducing ‘new divinities,’ how could I be guilty of that merely in
                    asserting that a voice of God is made manifest to me indicating my duty? Surely
                    those who take their omens from the cries of birds and the utterances of men
                    form their judgments on ‘voices.’ Will any one dispute either that thunder
                    utters its ‘voice,’ or that it is an omen of the greatest moment? Does not the
                    very priestess who sits on the tripod at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi"
                        >Delphi</placeName> divulge the god's will through a ‘voice’? </p>
            </div>
            <div n="13" type="section">
                <p>But more than that, in regard to God's foreknowledge of the future and his
                    forewarning thereof to whomsoever he will, these are the same terms, I assert,
                    that all men use, and this is their belief. The only difference between them and
                    me is that whereas they call the sources of their forewarning ‘birds,’
                    ‘utterances,’ ‘chance meetings,’ ‘prophets,’ I call mine a ‘divine’ thing;<note
                        resp="Loeb" anchored="true">Or “divine sign.” Here, as earlier, the mere
                        adjective is used; but in <persName><surname>Plato</surname></persName>'s

                            >Plat. Apol. 31 D</bibl>) this admonitory something is described as a
                        voice sent by heavenly dispensation, and is called variously “the sign”
                            (<bibl n="Plat. Apol. 41d">Plat. Apol. 41 D</bibl>), “the usual sign”

                        reports <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>' description of
                        this as a voice not directing his actions but serving only as a deterrent
                        when he or his friends were contemplating doing something
                        inadvisable.</note> and I think that in using such a term I am speaking with
                    more truth and deeper religious feeling than do those who ascribe the gods'
                    power to birds. Now that I do not lie against God I have the following proof: I
                    have revealed to many of my friends the counsels which God has given me, and in
                    no instance has the event shown that I was mistaken.” </p>

            <div n="14" type="section">
                <p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Hermogenes further reported that when the jurors
                    raised a clamour at hearing these words, some of them disbelieving his
                    statements, others showing jealousy at his receiving greater favours even from
                    the gods than they, <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> resumed:
                    “Hark ye; let me tell you something more, so that those of you who feel so
                    inclined may have still greater disbelief in my being honoured of Heaven. Once
                    on a time when Chaerephon<note resp="Loeb" anchored="true">A very enthusiastic
                        follower of <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>.</note> made
                    inquiry at the Delphic oracle concerning me, in the presence of many people
                    Apollo answered that no man was more free than I, or more just, or more
                    prudent.” </p>

            <div n="15" type="section">
                <p><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>When the jurors, naturally enough, made a still
                    greater tumult on hearing this statement, he said that
                            <persName><surname>Socrates</surname></persName> again went on: “And
                    yet, gentlemen, the god uttered in oracles greater things of Lycurgus, the
                    Lacedaemonian law-giver, than he did of me. For there is a legend that, as
                    Lycurgus entered the temple, the god thus addressed him: ‘I am pondering whether
                    to call you god or man.’ Now Apollo did not compare me to a god; he did,
                    however, judge that I far excelled the rest of mankind. However, do not believe
                    the god even in this without due grounds, but examine the god's utterance in
                    detail. </p>
            </div>
            <div n="16" type="section">
                <p>First, who is there in your knowledge that is less a slave to his bodily
                    appetites than I am? Who in the world more free,—for I accept neither gifts nor
                    pay from any one? Whom would you with reason regard as more just than the one so
                    reconciled to his present possessions as to want nothing beside that belongs to
                    another? And would not a person with good reason call me a wise man, who from
                    the time when I began to understand spoken words have never left off seeking
                    after and learning every good thing that I could? </p>

                <p>And that my labour has not been in vain do you not think is attested by this
                    fact, that many of my fellow-citizens who strive for virtue and many from abroad
                    choose to associate with me above all other men? And what shall we say is
                    accountable for this fact, that although everybody knows that it is quite
                    impossible for me to repay with money, many people are eager to make me some
                    gift? Or for this, that no demands are made on me by a single person for the
                    repayment of benefits, while many confess that they owe me a debt of gratitude?

                    keep free from any act of impiety toward the gods or any appearance of
                    wrong-doing toward man, he did not think it meet to beseech the jury to let him

                    personally and forbade his friends to name one, but said that naming the penalty
                    in itself implied an acknowledgment of guilt. Then, when his companions wished
                    to remove him clandestinely from prison, he would not accompany them, but seemed

                    those who were won over to do this must feel in their hearts a guilty
                    consciousness of great impiety and iniquity; but as for me, why should my spirit
                    be any less exalted now than before my condemnation, since I have not been
                    proved guilty of having done any of the acts mentioned in the indictment? For it
                    has not been shown that I have sacrificed to new deities in the stead of Zeus
                    and Hera and the gods of their company, or that I have invoked ill oaths or
                    mentioned other gods. </p>

                    even my adversaries themselves charge me with having committed any of these. And
