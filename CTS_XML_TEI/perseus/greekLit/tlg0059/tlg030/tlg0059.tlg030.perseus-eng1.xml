                            infallible, which Socrates meets by the fair retort that the ruler qua

                            understand what is meant by saying that the art (=the artist qua artist)
                            has no interest save the perfection of its (his) own function. Socrates
                            explains that the body by its very nature needs art to remedy its
                            defects (Herodotus i. 32, <title>Lysis</title> 217 B). But the nature of
                            art is fulfilled in its service, and it has no other ends to be
                            accomplished by another art and so on ad infinitum. It is idle to cavil
                            and emend the text, because of the shift from the statement (341 D) that
                            art has no interest save its perfection, to the statement that it needs
                            nothing except to be itself (342 A-B). The art and the artist qua artist
                            are ideals whose being by hypothesis is their
                        perfection.</note>?&rdquo; <milestone n="341e" unit="section"

                        that dwells in any art. Nor does it befit an art to seek the advantage of
                        anything else than that of its object. But the art itself is free from all
                        harm and admixture of evil, and is right so long as each art is precisely

                        rules those who are simple in every sense of the word and just, and they
                        being thus ruled do what is for his advantage who is the stronger and make

                        Socrates, in this way: that the just man always comes out at a disadvantage
                        in his relation with the unjust. To begin with, in their business dealings
                        in any joint undertaking of the two you will never find that the just man
                        has the advantage over the unjust at the dissolution of the partnership but
                        that he always has the worst of it. Then again, in their relations with the
                        state, if there are direct taxes or contributions to be paid, the just man
                        contributes more from an equal estate and the other less, and when there is
                        a distribution <milestone n="343e" unit="section"/>the one gains much and
                        the other nothing. And so when each holds office, apart from any other loss

                        unjust than to be just. And the easiest way of all to understand this matter
                        will be to turn to the most consummate form of injustice which makes the man
                        who has done the wrong most happy and those who are wronged and who would

                            unjust man is wise and good and is like the wise and good. Jevons says
                            in &ldquo;Substitution of Similars&rdquo;; &ldquo;Whatever

                            like the good craftsman in not overreaching, and the good craftsman is
                            good, therefore the just man is good. The conclusion is sound, and the
                            analogy may have a basis of psychological truth; but the argument is a

                        visible. On noting this he experimented with the ring to see if it possessed
                        this virtue, and he found the result to be that when he turned the collet

                        starting-point of this entire plea of my friend here and of myself to you,

                        whose discourses survive to the men of the present day, not one has ever
                        censured injustice or commended justice otherwise than in respect of the
                        repute, the honors, and the gifts that accrue from each. But what each one
                        of them is in itself, by its own inherent force, when it is within the soul
                        of the possessor and escapes the eyes of both gods and men, no one has ever
                        adequately set forth in poetry or prose&mdash;the proof that the one is

                        us by argument that justice is superior to injustice, but make clear to us
                        what each in and of itself does to its possessor, whereby the one is evil
                        and the other good. But do away with the repute of both, as Glaucon urged.
                        For, unless you take away from either the true repute and attach to each the
                        false, we shall say that it is not justice that you are praising but the

                        rewards and the honors that depend on opinion, leave to others to praise.
                        For while I would listen to others who thus commended justice and disparaged
                        injustice, bestowing their praise and their blame on the reputation and the

                        I am at a loss what to make of the matter. I do not know how I can come to

                        better than injustice. Nor yet again do I know how I can refuse to come to
                        the rescue. For I fear lest <milestone n="368c" unit="section"/>it be
                        actually impious to stand idly by when justice is reviled and be

                        Glaucon, then, and the rest besought me by all means to come to the rescue

                        to the nature of each and the truth about their respective advantages. I
                        said then as I thought: &ldquo;The inquiry we are undertaking is no easy

                        were bidden to read small letters from a distance, and then someone had
                        observed that these same letters exist elsewhere larger and on a larger
                        surface. We should have accounted it a godsend, I fancy, to be allowed to
                        read those letters first, and examine the smaller, if they are the

                            <milestone n="370b" unit="section"/>all alike but different. One man is
                        naturally fitted for one task, and another for another. Don't you think
                        so?&rdquo; &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; &ldquo;Again, would one man
                        do better working at many tasks or one at one?&rdquo; &ldquo;One at
                        one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And, furthermore, this, I fancy, is
                        obvious&mdash;that if one lets slip the right season, the favorable
                        moment in any task, the work is spoiled.&rdquo;
                        &ldquo;Obvious.&rdquo; &ldquo;That, I take it, is because the
                        business will not wait upon the leisure of the workman, but the workman must
                            <milestone n="370c" unit="section"/>attend to it as his main affair, and
                        not as a by-work.&rdquo; &ldquo;He must indeed.&rdquo;
                        &ldquo;The result, then, is that more things are produced, and better
                        and more easily when one man performs one task according to his nature, at
                        the right moment, and at leisure from other occupations.&rdquo;
                        &ldquo;By all means.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then, Adeimantus, we need
                        more than four citizens for the provision of the things we have mentioned.

                        &ldquo;There will.&rdquo; &ldquo;And again, if our servitor goes
                        forth empty-handed, not taking with him any of the things needed by those

                            view Plato eloquently argues (465 B-C) that duty fulfilled will yield

                            usage are given in 389 D-E: subordination to due authority, and control
                            of appetite, both raised to higher significance in Plato's definition.
                            As in the case of bravery, Plato distinguishes the temperamental, the
                            bourgeois, the disciplined, and the philosophical virtue. But he affects
                            to feel something paradoxical in the very idea of self-control, as
                            perhaps there is. Cf. <title>Laws</title> 626 E ff., 863 D, A.J.P. vol.

                            the three classes in the state and the tripartite soul is an important
                            point in Plato's ethical theory and an essential feature in the
                            structure of the <title>Republic</title>. Very nice distinctions are
                            involved in the attempt to prove the validity of the analogy for the
                            present argument without too flagrant contradiction of the faith
                            elsewhere expressed in the essential unity of the soul. Cf. <title>Unity
                                of Plato's Thought</title>, p. 42. These distinctions in the infancy
                            of logic Plato is obliged to set forth and explain as he proceeds.
                            Moreover, he is interested in logical method for its own sake (cf..
                            Introduction p. xiv), and is here stating for the first time important
                            principles of logic afterwards codified in the treatises of

                            ideas. But Plato is not now thinking primarily of that. He is merely
                            repeating in precise logical form the point already made (434 D-E), that
                            the definition of justice in the individual must correspond point for

                            but the reference to this passage in 504 B shows that it includes the
                            whole question of the definition of the virtues, and so ultimately the
                            whole of ethical and political philosophy. We are there told again that
                            the definitions of the fourth book are sufficient for the purpose, but
                            that complete insight can be attained only by relating them to the idea
                            of the good. That required a longer and more circuitous way of
                            discipline and training. Plato then does not propose the
                            &ldquo;longer way&rdquo; as a method of reasoning which he
                            himself employs to correct the approximations of the present discussion.
                            He merely describes it as the higher education which will enable his
                            philosophical rulers to do that. We may then disregard all idle guesses
                            about a &ldquo;new logic&rdquo; hinted at in the longer way, and
                            all fantastic hypotheses about the evolution of Plato's thought and the
                            composition of the <title>Republic</title> based on supposed
                            contradictions between this passage and the later books. Cf.
                            Introduction p. xvi, &ldquo;Idea of Good,&rdquo; p. 190,
                                <title>Unity of Plato's Thought</title>, p. 16, n. 90; followed by
                            Professor Wilamowitz, ii. p. 218, who, however, does not understand the
                            connection of it all with the idea of good. Plato the logician never
                            commits himself to more than is required by the problem under discussion
                            (cf. on 353 c), and Plato the moralist never admits that the ideal has
                            been adequately expressed, but always points to heights beyond. Cf. 506
                            E, 533 A, <title>Phaedo</title> 85 C, <title>Ti.</title> 29 B-C,

                            might seem to belong to the irrational part of the soul, and so, as

                            731 B-C Plato tells us again that the soul cannot combat injustice
                            without the capacity for righteous indignation. The Stoics affected to
                            deprecate anger always, and the difference remained a theme of
                            controversy between them and the Platonists. Cf. Schmidt, <title>Ethik

                            follows of the value of ideals as ideals is Plato's warning hint that he
                            does not expect the literal realization of his Utopia, though it would

                        in regard to injustice and the completely unjust man. We wished to fix our

                            comparision with the unchanging multitude of each, so the many opinions

                            the unalterable ideas of justice and beauty, which the philosopher more
                            nearly apprehends. Thus, for the purposes of this contrast, notions,
                            opinions, and what English usage would call ideas, fall into the same

                            ordinary citizens to do the right from habit and training, but to
                            understand the reasons for it. The outcome of such an education is
                            described as the vision of the idea of good, which for ethics and
                            politics means a restatement of the provisional psychological definition
                            of the cardinal virtues in terms of the ultimate elements of human
                            welfare. For metaphysics and cosmogony the vision of the idea of good
                            may means teleological interpretation of the universe and the
                            interpretation of all things in terms of benevolent design. That is

                        resp="Loeb">The image of the cave illustrates by another proportion the
                        contrast between the world of sense-perception and the world of thought.
                        Instead of going above the plane of ordinary experience for the other two
                        members of the proportion, Plato here goes below and invents a fire and
                        shadows cast from it on the walls of a cave to correspond to the sun and the
                        &ldquo;real&rdquo; objects of sense. In such a proportion our
                        &ldquo;real&rdquo; world becomes the symbol of Plato's ideal world.
                        Modern fancy may read what meanings it pleases into the Platonic antithesis
                        of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; and the &ldquo;ideal.&rdquo; It
                        has even been treated as an anticipation of the fourth dimension. But Plato
                        never leaves an attentive and critical reader in doubt as to his own
                        intended meaning. there may be at the most a little uncertainty as to which
                        are merely indispensable parts of the picture. The source and first
                        suggestion of Plato's imagery is an interesting speculation, but it is of no
                        significance for the interpretation of the thought. Cf. John Henry Wright,

                        we need to remember that Plato's main and explicitly reiterated purpose is

                        Urwick, <title>The Message of Plato,</title> pp. 66-67, is mistaken when he
                        says &ldquo; . . . Plato expressly tells us that his education is

                        is the most recent) that Plato, if he could not anticipate in detail the
                        modern reduction of mathematics to logic, did postulate something like it as
                        an ideal, the realization of which would abolish his own sharp distinction
                        between mathematics and dialectic. The argument rests on a remote and
                        strained interpretation of two or three texts of the
                        <title>Republic</title>(cf. e.g. 511 and 533 B-D) which, naturally
                        interpreted, merely affirm the general inferiority of the mathematical
                        method and the intermediate position for education of mathematics as a
                        propaedeutic to dialectics. Plato's purpose throughout is not to exhort
                        mathematicians as such to question their initiatory postulates, but to mark
                        definitely the boundaries between the mathematical and other sciences and
                        pure dialectics or philosophy. The distinction is a true and useful one
                        today. Aristotle often refers to it with no hint that it could not be
                        abolished by a new and different kind of mathematics. And it is uncritical
                        to read that intention into Plato's words. He may have contributed, and
                        doubtless did contribute, in other ways to the improvement and precision of
                        mathematical logic. But he had no idea of doing away with the fundamental
                        difference that made dialectics and not mathematics the coping-stone of the
                        higher education&mdash;science as such does not question its first

                        the reader. Cf. on 523 B. The misapprehension is typical of modern
                        misunderstandings. Glaucon is here the prototype of all sentimental
                        Platonists or anti-Platonists. The meaning of &ldquo;higher&rdquo;
                        things in Plato's allegory is obvious. But Glaucon takes it literally.
                        Similarly, modern critics, taking Plato's imagery literally and pressing
                        single expressions apart from the total context, have inferred that Plato
                        would be hostile to all the applications of modern science to experience.

                        of speaking Plato, it is true, disregards the apparent difficulty that the

                        this interpretation is, I think, more probable for Plato than Adam's attempt

                        for the movement of the heavenly bodies and &ldquo;saving the

                        misapprehension. That the stars in their movements do not perfectly express
                        the exactness of mathematical conceptions is no more than modern astronomers
                        say. In the <title>Laws</title> passage Plato protests against the idea that
                        there is no law and order governing the movement of the planets, but that
                        they are &ldquo;wandering stars,&rdquo; as irregular in their
                        movements as they seem. In the <title>Timaeus</title> he is saying that
                        astronomy or science took its beginning from the sight and observation of
                        the heavenly bodies and the changing seasons. In the

                        mathematical astronomy and the indicate its place in the type of education
                        which he wishes to give his guardians. There is not the slightest
                        contradiction or change of opinion in the three passages if interpreted

                        (Cf. <title>Unity of Plato's Thought,</title> p. 45). But Plato, like some
                        lesser writers, loves to emphasize his thought by paradox and surprise, and
                        his postulation and of a mathematical astronomy required emphasis. Cf. my
                            <title>Platonism and the History of Science,</title> pp. 171-174. This
                        and similar passages cannot be used to prove that Plato was unscientific, as
                        many hostile or thoughtless critics have attempted to do. Cf. e.g. the

                        scientific impulse, or at least diverted it into unprofitable

                        statements disregard the entire context of the Platonic passages they
                        exploit, and take no account of Plato's purpose or of other passages which
                        counteract his seemingly unscientific remarks. Equally unfair is the
                        practice of comparing Plato unfavorably with Aristotle in this respect, as
                        Grote e.g. frequently does (Cf. <title>Aristotle,</title> p. 233). Plato was
                        an artist and Aristotle an encyclopaedist; but Plato as a whole is far

                        by representing Socrates as discoursing with ingenuous youth in a more
