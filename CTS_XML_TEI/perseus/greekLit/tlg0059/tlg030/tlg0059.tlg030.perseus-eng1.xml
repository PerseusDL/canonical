                            makes a speech. He abandons the abstract (ideal) ruler, whom he assumed

                            that injustice will then fall in the category of virtue and wisdom.
                            Thrasymachus affirms the paradox and is brought to self-contradiction by
                            a subtle argument (349-350 C) which may pass as a dramatic illustration

                            His statement is more systematic than theirs, but the principle is the
                            same; for, though Callicles does not explicitly speak of a social
                            contract, he implies that conventional justice is an agreement of the

                            which Leslie Stephen is thinking. But from a higher point of view Plato
                            eloquently argues (465 B-C) that duty fulfilled will yield truer
                            happinress to the guardians than seeking their own advantage in the

                            higher significance in Plato's definition. As in the case of bravery,
                            Plato distinguishes the temperamental, the bourgeois, the disciplined,
                            and the philosophical virtue. But he affects to feel something
                            paradoxical in the very idea of self-control, as perhaps there is. Cf.

                        expressions that as it were point us to the same trail. Is that not
                        so?” “Most certainly.” “Now the phrase ‘master
                        of himself’ is an absurdity, is it not? For he who is master of
                        himself would also be subject to himself, <milestone unit="page" n="431"/><milestone n="431a" unit="section"/>and he who is subject to himself
                        would be master. For the same person is spoken of in all these

                            point in Plato's ethical theory and an essential feature in the
                            structure of the <title>Republic</title>. Very nice distinctions are
                            involved in the attempt to prove the validity of the analogy for the
                            present argument without too flagrant contradiction of the faith
                            elsewhere expressed in the essential unity of the soul. Cf. <title>Unity
                                of Plato's Thought</title>, p. 42. These distinctions in the infancy
                            of logic Plato is obliged to set forth and explain as he proceeds.
                            Moreover, he is interested in logical method for its own sake (cf..
                            Introduction p. xiv), and is here stating for the first time important
                            principles of logic afterwards codified in the treatises of

                            ideas. But Plato is not now thinking primarily of that. He is merely
                            repeating in precise logical form the point already made (434 D-E), that

                            but the reference to this passage in 504 B shows that it includes the
                            whole question of the definition of the virtues, and so ultimately the
                            whole of ethical and political philosophy. We are there told again that
                            the definitions of the fourth book are sufficient for the purpose, but
                            that complete insight can be attained only by relating them to the idea
                            of the good. That required a longer and more circuitous way of
                            discipline and training. Plato then does not propose the “longer
                            way” as a method of reasoning which he himself employs to correct
                            the approximations of the present discussion. He merely describes it as
                            the higher education which will enable his philosophical rulers to do
                            that. We may then disregard all idle guesses about a “new
                            logic” hinted at in the longer way, and all fantastic hypotheses
                            about the evolution of Plato's thought and the composition of the
                                <title>Republic</title> based on supposed contradictions between
                            this passage and the later books. Cf. Introduction p. xvi, “Idea
                            of Good,” p. 190, <title>Unity of Plato's Thought</title>, p. 16,
                            n. 90; followed by Professor Wilamowitz, ii. p. 218, who, however, does
                            not understand the connection of it all with the idea of good. Plato the
                            logician never commits himself to more than is required by the problem
                            under discussion (cf. on 353 c), and Plato the moralist never admits
                            that the ideal has been adequately expressed, but always points to
                            heights beyond. Cf. 506 E, 533 A, <title>Phaedo</title> 85 C,

                        on the level of previous statements and inquiries.” “May we
                        acquiesce in that?” he said. “I for my part should be quite
                        satisfied with that for the present.” “And I surely should be

                            though as mere angry passion it might seem to belong to the irrational
                            part of the soul, and so, as Glaucon suggets, be akin to appetite, with
                            which it is associated in the mortal soul of the <title>Timaeus</title>
                            69 D. In <title>Laws</title> 731 B-C Plato tells us again that the soul
                            cannot combat injustice without the capacity for righteous indignation.
                            The Stoics affected to deprecate anger always, and the difference
                            remained a theme of controversy between them and the Platonists. Cf.
                            Schmidt, <title>Ethik der Griechen</title>, ii. pp. 321 ff., <placeName key="tgn,1002882">Seneca</placeName>, <title>De ira</title>, i. 9,
                            and <title>passim</title>. Moralists are still divided on the point. Cf.
                            Bagehot, <title>Lord Brougham</title>: “Another faculty of
                            Brougham . . . is the faculty of easy anger. The supine placidity of
                            civilization is not favorable to animosity [Bacon's word for <foreign lang="greek">QUMO/S</foreign>].” Leslie Stephen,
                                <title>Science of Ethics</title>, pp. 60 ff. and p. 62, seems to
                            contradict Plato: “The supposed conflict between reason and
                            passion is, as I hold, meaningless if it is taken to imply that the
                            reason is a faculty separate from the emotions,” etc. But this is
                            only his metaphysics. On the practical ethical issue he is with

                            temperaments. The description of the orderly temperament begins with

                            the higher education, which will enable the philosopher not only like
                            ordinary citizens to do the right from habit and training, but to
                            understand the reasons for it. The outcome of such an education is
                            described as the vision of the idea of good, which for ethics and
                            politics means a restatement of the provisional psychological definition
                            of the cardinal virtues in terms of the ultimate elements of human
                            welfare. For metaphysics and cosmogony the vision of the idea of good
                            may means teleological interpretation of the universe and the
                            interpretation of all things in terms of benevolent design. That is

                            experience for the other two members of the proportion, Plato here goes
                            below and invents a fire and shadows cast from it on the walls of a cave
                            to correspond to the sun and the “real” objects of sense. In
                            such a proportion our “real” world becomes the symbol of

                            fourth dimension. But Plato never leaves an attentive and critical
                            reader in doubt as to his own intended meaning. there may be at the most
                            a little uncertainty as to which are merely indispensable parts of the
                            picture. The source and first suggestion of Plato's imagery is an
                            interesting speculation, but it is of no significance for the
                            interpretation of the thought. Cf. John Henry Wright, “The Origin

                            abstraction. Cf. on 523 A, p. 152, note b; and Titchener, <title>A

                            stands for the word in text-books of geometry.” There have been
                            some attempts to prove (that of Mr. F. M. Cornford in

                            most recent) that Plato, if he could not anticipate in detail the modern
                            reduction of mathematics to logic, did postulate something like it as an
                            ideal, the realization of which would abolish his own sharp distinction
                            between mathematics and dialectic. The argument rests on a remote and
                            strained interpretation of two or three texts of the
                                <title>Republic</title>(cf. e.g. 511 and 533 B-D) which, naturally
                            interpreted, merely affirm the general inferiority of the mathematical
                            method and the intermediate position for education of mathematics as a
                            propaedeutic to dialectics. Plato's purpose throughout is not to exhort
                            mathematicians as such to question their initiatory postulates, but to
                            mark definitely the boundaries between the mathematical and other
                            sciences and pure dialectics or philosophy. The distinction is a true
                            and useful one today. Aristotle often refers to it with no hint that it
                            could not be abolished by a new and different kind of mathematics. And
                            it is uncritical to read that intention into Plato's words. He may have
                            contributed, and doubtless did contribute, in other ways to the
                            improvement and precision of mathematical logic. But he had no idea of
                            doing away with the fundamental difference that made dialectics and not
                            mathematics the coping-stone of the higher education—science as
                            such does not question its first principles and dialectic does. Cf. 533

                            reference here to the “Delian problem” of the duplication of

                            Theaetetus for whom a Platonic dialogue is named, and that Plato makes
                            use of the discovery of the five regular solids in his theory of the

                            forestalls a possible understanding by the reader. Cf. on 523 B. The
                            misapprehension is typical of modern misunderstandings. Glaucon is here
                            the prototype of all sentimental Platonists or anti-Platonists. The
                            meaning of “higher” things in Plato's allegory is obvious.
                            But Glaucon takes it literally. Similarly, modern critics, taking
                            Plato's imagery literally and pressing single expressions apart from the
                            total context, have inferred that Plato would be hostile to all the
                            applications of modern science to experience. They refuse to make
                            allowance for his special and avowed educational purpose, and overlook
                            the fact that he is prophesying the mathematical astronomy and science
                            of the future. The half-serious exaggeration of his rhetoric can easily
                            be matched by similar utterances of modern thinkers of the most various
                            schools, from Rousseau's “écarter tous les faits” to
                            Judd's “Once we acquire the power to neglect all the concrete

                            to contain or convey the concrete. The visible stars are in and are
                            carried by their invisible mathematical orbits. By this way of speaking
                            Plato, it is true, disregards the apparent difficulty that the movement
                            of the visible stars then ought to be mathematically perfect. But this
                            interpretation is, I think, more probable for Plato than Adam's attempt

                            the view that Aristotle imposed on the world for centuries. We should
                            not therefore say with Adam that he would have attached little
                            significance to the perturbations of Neptune and the consequent
                            discovery of Uranus. It is to Plato that tradition attributes the
                            problem of accounting by the simplest hypothesis for the movement of the
                            heavenly bodies and “saving the phenomena.” The alleged
                            contradiction between this and <title>Laws</title> 821 B ff. and
                                <title>Tim.</title> 41 A is due to a misapprehension. That the stars
                            in their movements do not perfectly express the exactness of
                            mathematical conceptions is no more than modern astronomers say. In the
                                <title>Laws</title> passage Plato protests against the idea that
                            there is no law and order governing the movement of the planets, but
                            that they are “wandering stars,” as irregular in their
                            movements as they seem. In the <title>Timaeus</title> he is saying that
                            astronomy or science took its beginning from the sight and observation
                            of the heavenly bodies and the changing seasons. In the
                                <title>Republic</title>Plato's purpose is to predict and encourage a
                            purely mathematical astronomy and the indicate its place in the type of
                            education which he wishes to give his guardians. There is not the
                            slightest contradiction or change of opinion in the three passages if

                            being that the Philosophic astronomer will think it strange to look for

                            using the stars only as “diagrams” or patterns (529 D),
                            seeks to learn a higher exacter mathematical truth than mere observation
                            could yield. Madvig's <foreign lang="greek">ZHTH/SEI</foreign> implies a
                            like view of the meaning but smooths out the construction. But my
                            interpretation of the passage as a whole does not depend on this
                            construction. If we make <foreign lang="greek">ZHTEI=N</foreign> depend
                            on <foreign lang="greek">A)/TOPON</foreign>(neuter)<foreign lang="greek">H(GH/SETAI</foreign>, the meaning will be that he thinks it absurd
                            to expect to get that higher truth from mere observation. At all events
                            Plato is not here objecting to observation as a suggestion for
                            mathematical studies but to its substitution for them, as the next

                            and foremost a metaphysician with a sort of religious system would not

                            p. 47: “ . . . Plato...was largely responsible for turning back
                            the clock of scientific progress. To explain the wonders of the world he

                            pp. 27-28: “Plato was a great philosopher but in the history of
                            experimental science he must be counted a disaster.” Such
                            statements disregard the entire context of the Platonic passages they
                            exploit, and take no account of Plato's purpose or of other passages
                            which counteract his seemingly unscientific remarks. Equally unfair is
                            the practice of comparing Plato unfavorably with Aristotle in this
                            respect, as Grote e.g. frequently does (Cf. <title>Aristotle,</title> p.
                            233). Plato was an artist and Aristotle an encyclopaedist; but Plato as
                            a whole is far nearer the point of view of recent science than
                            Aristotle. Cf. my <title>Platonism and the History of Science,</title>

                            dialectic is the checking of the stream of thought by the necessity of

                            every step, and the habit of noting all relevant distinctions,
                            divisions, and ambiguities, in ideas and terms. When the interlocutor is

                            attention, as in some of the later dialogues, dialectic becomes merely a

                            portrayed in the following pages, it is too often forgotten that Plato

                            historical process. Cf. Rehm, <title>Der Untergang Roms im

                            was a widely spread belief in an earlier ‘golden age’ of
                            simplicity, which had been followed by a degeneration and decay of the
                            human race. Plato's theory of degradation set forth a gradual
                            deterioration through the successive stages of timocracy, oligarchy,
                            democracy and despotism. The Greek theory of ‘cycles,’ with
                            its endless, monotonous iteration, excluded the possibility of permanent
                            advance or ‘progress.'” Kurt Singer, <title>Platon der
                                Gründer,</title> p. 141, says that the timocratic state reminds
                            one of late Sparta, the democratic of Athens after Pericles, the
                            oligarchic is related to Corinth, and the tyrannical has some Syracusan
                            features. Cicero, <title>De div.</title> ii., uses this book of the

                            barriers are down.” The Freudians have at last discovered Plato's
                            anticipation of their main thesis. Cf. Trotter, <title>Instincts of the
                                Herd in Peace and War.</title> p. 74: “It has been perhaps
                            Freud's most remarkable thesis that dreams are manifestations of this
                            emergence of desires and memories from the unconscious into the
                            conscious field.” “The barriers of the Freudian unconscious
                            are less tightly closed during sleep” sententiously observes an
                            eminent modern psychologist. Cf. Valentine, <title>The New Psychology of
                                the Unconscious,</title> p. xiii. and <title>ibid.</title> p. 93:
                            “Freud refers to Plato's view that the virtuous man does in actual
                            life, but I believe he nowhere shows a knowledge of the following

                                <title>ibid.</title> p. 95: “The germ of several aspects of
                            the Freudian view of dreams, including the characteristic doctrine of
                            the censor, was to be found in Plato. The Freudian view becomes at once
                            distinctly more respectable.” Many of the ancients, like some
                            superstitious moderns, exalted the unconscious which reveals itself in
                            dreams, and made it the source of prophecy. Cf. commentators on

                            expresses itself in the paradox that “not even health,”
