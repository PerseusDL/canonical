So one cannot but envy all this.</said>

In the same manner also the Muse inspires men herself, and then by means of these inspired persons the inspiration spreads to others, and holds them in a connected chain.

               <said who="#Socrates">Yes, since I daresay you are good at generalship also, Ion.  For in fact, if you happened to have skill in horsemanship as well as in the lyre, you would know when horses were well or ill managed:

               <said who="#Ion">I should say, by my skill as a horseman.</said>
               <said who="#Socrates">And if again you were distinguishing the good lyre-players, you would admit that you distinguished by your skill in the lyre, and not by your skill as a horseman.</said>

               <said who="#Socrates">And when you judge of military matters, do you judge as having skill in generalship, or as a good rhapsode?</said>
