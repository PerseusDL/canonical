                              the house of their father Zeus the loud-thunderer is glad at the
                              lily-like voice of the goddesses as it spreads abroad, and the peaks
                              of snowy <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> resound, and
                              the homes of the immortals. And they, uttering their immortal voice,
                              celebrate in song first of all the revered race of the gods<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />from the beginning, those whom Earth
                              and wide Heaven begot, and the gods sprung of these, givers of good
                              things. Then next, the goddesses sing of Zeus, the father of gods and
                              men, as they begin and end their strain, how much he is the most
                              excellent among the gods and supreme in power.<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />And again, they chant the race of men and strong

                              his tongue, and from his lips flow gracious words. All the

                              while he settles causes with true judgements: and he, speaking surely,
                              would soon make wise end even of a great quarrel; for therefore are
                              there princes wise in heart, because when the people are being
                              misguided in their assembly, they set right the matter again<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />with ease, persuading them with gentle

                              with gentle reverence, and he is conspicuous amongst the assembled:
                              such is the holy gift of the Muses to men. For it is through the Muses
                              and far-shooting Apollo that<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />there are singers and harpers upon the earth; but princes are of
                              Zeus, and happy is he whom the Muses love: sweet flows speech from his
                              mouth. For although a man has sorrow and grief in his newly-troubled
                              soul and lives in dread because his heart is distressed, yet, when a
                                   singer,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />the servant of the

                              he forgets his heaviness and remembers not his sorrows at all; but the
                              gifts of the goddesses soon turn him away from these.</p>

                              poverty, but only in wealth. And as in thatched hives bees<milestone ed="p" n="595" unit="line" />feed the drones whose nature is to do
                              mischief—by day and throughout the day until the sun goes down
                              the bees are busy and lay the white combs, while the drones stay at
                              home in the covered hives and reap the toil of others into their own
                                   bellies—<milestone ed="p" n="600" unit="line" />even so Zeus
                              who thunders on high made women to be an evil to mortal men, with a
                              nature to do evil. And he gave them a second evil to be the price for
                              the good they had: whoever avoids marriage and the sorrows that women
                              cause, and will not wed, reaches deadly old age<milestone ed="p" n="605" unit="line" />without anyone to tend his years, and though he
                              at least has no lack of livelihood while he lives, yet, when he is
                              dead, his kinsfolk divide his possessions amongst them. And as for the
                              man who chooses the lot of marriage and takes a good wife suited to
                              his mind, evil continually contends with good;<milestone ed="p" n="610" unit="line" />for whoever happens to have mischievous children,
                              lives always with unceasing grief in his spirit and heart within him;
                              and this evil cannot be healed. So it is not possible to deceive or go
                              beyond the will of Zeus: for not even the son of Iapetus, kindly
                                   Prometheus,<milestone ed="p" n="615" unit="line" />escaped his
                              heavy anger, but of necessity strong bands confined him, although he

                              and the hard strife had no close or end for either side, and the issue
                              of the war hung evenly balanced. But when he had provided those three

                              war even more than before, and they all, both male and female, stirred
                              up hated battle that day, the Titan gods, and all that were born of

                              up to the light from Erebus beneath the earth. A hundred arms sprang
                              from the shoulders of all alike, and each had fifty heads growing from
                              his shoulders upon stout limbs. These, then, stood against the Titans

                              strengthened their ranks, and both sides at one time showed the work
                              of their hands and their might. The boundless sea rang terribly
                              around, and the earth crashed loudly: wide Heaven was shaken
