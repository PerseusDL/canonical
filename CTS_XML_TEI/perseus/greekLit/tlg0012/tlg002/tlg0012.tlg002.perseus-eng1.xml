                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />Tell me, O Muse, of the man of many devices, who wandered full many ways after he had sacked the sacred citadel of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Troy</placeName>. Many were the men whose cities he saw and whose mind he learned, aye, and many the woes he suffered in his heart upon the sea,<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />seeking to win his own life and the return of his comrades. Yet even so he saved not his comrades, though he desired it sore, for through their own blind folly they perished—fools, who devoured the kine of Helios Hyperion; but he took from them the day of their returning.<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />Of these things, goddess, daughter of Zeus, beginning where thou wilt, tell thou even unto us.
Now all the rest, as many as had escaped sheer destruction, were at home, safe from both war and sea, but Odysseus alone, filled with longing for his return and for his wife, did the queenly nymph Calypso, that bright goddess,<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />keep back in her hollow caves, yearning that he should be her husband. But when, as the seasons revolved, the year came in which the gods had ordained that he should return home to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, not even there was he free from toils, even among his own folk. And all the gods pitied him<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />save Poseidon; but he continued to rage unceasingly against godlike Odysseus until at length he reached his own land.
Howbeit Poseidon had gone among the far-off Ethiopians—the Ethiopians who dwell sundered in twain, the farthermost of men, some where Hyperion sets and some where he rises,<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />there to receive a hecatomb of bulls and rams, and there he was taking his joy, sitting at the feast; but the other gods were gathered together in the halls of Olympian Zeus. Among them the father of gods and men was first to speak, for in his heart he thought of noble Aegisthus,<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />whom far-famed Orestes, Agamemnon's son, had slain. Thinking on him he spoke among the immortals, and said:
“Look you now, how ready mortals are to blame the gods. It is from us, they say, that evils come, but they even of themselves, through their own blind folly, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained.<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />Even as now Aegisthus, beyond that which was ordained, took to himself the wedded wife of the son of Atreus, and slew him on his return, though well he knew of sheer destruction, seeing that we spake to him before, sending Hermes, the keen-sighted Argeiphontes,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> that he should neither slay the man nor woo his wife;<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />for from Orestes shall come vengeance for the son of Atreus when once he has come to manhood and longs for his own land. So Hermes spoke, but for all his good intent he prevailed not upon the heart of Aegisthus; and now he has paid the full price of all.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="44" type="card">
                    <p>
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> Athena, answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />“Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high above all lords, aye, verily that man lies low in a destruction that is his due; so, too, may any other also be destroyed who does such deeds. But my heart is torn for wise Odysseus, hapless man, who far from his friends has long been suffering woes<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />in a sea-girt isle, where is the navel of the sea. 'Tis a wooded isle, and therein dwells a goddess, daughter of Atlas of baneful mind, who knows the depths of every sea, and himself holds the tall pillars which keep earth and heaven apart.<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />His daughter it is that keeps back that wretched, sorrowing man; and ever with soft and wheedling words she beguiles him that he may forget <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. But Odysseus, in his longing to see were it but the smoke leaping up from his own land, yearns to die. Yet thy<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />heart doth not regard it, Olympian. Did not Odysseus beside the ships of the Argives offer thee sacrifice without stint in the broad land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>? Wherefore then didst thou conceive such wrath<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> against him, O Zeus?”
Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her and said: “My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth?<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />How should I, then, forget godlike Odysseus, who is beyond all mortals in wisdom, and beyond all has paid sacrifice to the immortal gods, who hold broad heaven? Nay, it is Poseidon, the earth-enfolder, who is ever filled with stubborn wrath because of the Cyclops, whom Odysseus blinded of his eye—<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />even the godlike Polyphemus, whose might is greatest among all the Cyclopes; and the nymph Thoosa bore him, daughter of Phorcys who rules over the unresting<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> sea; for in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon. From that time forth Poseidon, the earth-shaker,<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />does not indeed slay Odysseus, but makes him a wanderer from his native land. But come, let us who are here all take thought of his return, that he may come home; and Poseidon will let go his anger, for he will in no wise be able, against all the immortal gods and in their despite, to contend alone.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="80" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high above all lords, if indeed this is now well pleasing to the blessed gods, that the wise Odysseus should return to his own home, let us send forth Hermes, the messenger, Argeiphontes,<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />to the isle Ogygia, that with all speed he may declare to the fair-tressed nymph our fixed resolve, even the return of Odysseus of the steadfast heart, that he may come home. But, as for me, I will go to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, that I may the more arouse his son, and set courage in his heart<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />to call to an assembly the long-haired Achaeans, and speak out his word to all the wooers, who are ever slaying his thronging sheep and his sleek<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> kine of shambling gait. And I will guide him to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and to sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, to seek tidings of the return of his dear father, if haply he may hear of it,<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />that good report may be his among men.”
So she spoke, and bound beneath her feet her beautiful sandals, immortal,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> golden, which were wont to bear her both over the waters of the sea and over the boundless land swift as the blasts of the wind. And she took her mighty spear, tipped with sharp bronze,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />heavy and huge and strong, wherewith she vanquishes the ranks of men—of warriors, with whom she is wroth, she, the daughter of the mighty sire. Then she went darting down from the heights of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, and took her stand in the land of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> at the outer gate of Odysseus, on the threshold of the court. In her hand she held the spear of bronze,<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />and she was in the likeness of a stranger, Mentes, the leader of the Taphians. There she found the proud wooers. They were taking their pleasure at draughts in front of the doors, sitting on the hides of oxen which they themselves had slain; and of the heralds<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> and busy squires,<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />some were mixing wine and water for them in bowls, others again were washing the tables with porous sponges and setting them forth, while still others were portioning out meats in abundance.
Her the godlike Telemachus was far the first to see, for he was sitting among the wooers, sad at heart,<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />seeing in thought his noble father, should he perchance come from somewhere and make a scattering of the wooers in the palace, and himself win honor and rule over his own house. As he thought of these things, sitting among the wooers, he beheld Athena, and he went straight to the outer door; for in his heart he counted it shame<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />that a stranger should stand long at the gates. So, drawing near, he clasped her right hand, and took from her the spear of bronze; and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words:<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
“Hail, stranger; in our house thou shalt find entertainment and then, when thou hast tasted food, thou shalt tell of what thou hast need.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="125" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />So saying, he led the way, and Pallas Athena followed. And when they were within the lofty house, he bore the spear and set it against a tall pillar in a polished spear-rack, where were set many spears besides, even those of Odysseus of the steadfast heart.<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />Athena herself he led and seated on a chair, spreading a linen cloth beneath—a beautiful chair, richly-wrought,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> and below was a footstool for the feet. Beside it he placed for himself an inlaid seat, apart from the others, the wooers, lest the stranger, vexed by their din, should loathe the meal, seeing that he was in the company of overweening men;<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />and also that he might ask him about his father that was gone. Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin for them to wash, and beside them drew up a polished table. And the grave housewife brought and set before them bread,<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />and therewith dainties in abundance, giving freely of her store. And a carver lifted up and placed before them platters of all manner of meats, and set by them golden goblets, while a herald ever walked to and fro pouring them wine.
Then in came the proud wooers, and thereafter<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />sat them down in rows on chairs and high seats. Heralds poured water over their hands, and maid-servants heaped by them bread in baskets, and youths filled the bowls brim full of drink; and they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them.<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />Now after the wooers had put from them the desire of food and drink, their hearts turned to other things, to song and to dance; for these things are the crown of a feast. And a herald put the beautiful lyre in the hands of Phemius, who sang perforce among the wooers;<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />and he struck the chords in prelude<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> to his sweet lay.
But Telemachus spoke to flashing-eyed Athena, holding his head close, that the others might not hear: “Dear stranger, wilt thou be wroth with me for the word that I shall say? These men care for things like these, the lyre and song,<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />full easily, seeing that without atonement they devour the livelihood of another, of a man whose white bones, it may be, rot in the rain as they lie upon the mainland, or the wave rolls them in the sea. Were they to see him returned to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, they would all pray to be swifter of foot,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />rather than richer in gold and in raiment. But now he has thus perished by an evil doom, nor for us is there any comfort, no, not though any one of men upon the earth should say that he will come; gone is the day of his returning. But come, tell me this, and declare it truly.<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />Who art thou among men, and from whence? Where is thy city and where thy parents? On what manner of ship didst thou come, and how did sailors bring thee to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>? Who did they declare themselves to be? For nowise, methinks, didst thou come hither on foot. And tell me this also truly, that I may know full well,<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />whether this is thy first coming hither, or whether thou art indeed a friend of my father's house. For many were the men who came to our house as strangers, since he, too, had gone to and fro<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> among men.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="178" type="card">
                    <p>
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Therefore of a truth will I frankly tell thee all.<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />I declare that I am Mentes, the son of wise Anchialus, and I am lord over the oar-loving Taphians. And now have I put in here, as thou seest, with ship and crew, while sailing over the wine-dark sea to men of strange speech, on my way to Temese for copper; and I bear with me shining iron.<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />My ship lies yonder beside the fields away from the city, in the harbor of Rheithron, under woody Neion. Friends of one another do we declare ourselves to be, even as our fathers were, friends from of old. Nay, if thou wilt, go and ask the old warrior Laertes, who, they say,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />comes no more to the city, but afar in the fields suffers woes attended by an aged woman as his handmaid, who sets before him food and drink, after weariness has laid hold of his limbs, as he creeps along the slope of his vineyard plot. And now am I come, for of a truth men said that he,<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />thy father, was among his people; but lo, the gods are thwarting him of his return. For not yet has goodly Odysseus perished on the earth, but still, I ween, he lives and is held back on the broad sea in a sea-girt isle, and cruel men keep him, a savage folk, that constrain him, haply sore against his will.<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />Nay, I will now prophesy to thee, as the immortals put it in my heart, and as I think it shall be brought to pass, though I am in no wise a soothsayer, nor one versed in the signs of birds. Not much longer shall he be absent from his dear native land, no, not though bonds of iron hold him.<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />He will contrive a way to return, for he is a man of many devices. But come, tell me this and declare it truly, whether indeed, tall as thou art, thou art the son of Odysseus himself. Wondrously like his are thy head and beautiful eyes; for full often did we consort with one another<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />before he embarked for the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, whither others, too, the bravest of the Argives, went in their hollow ships. But since that day neither have I seen Odysseus, nor he me.”
Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Therefore of a truth, stranger, will I frankly tell thee all.<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />My mother says that I am his child; but I know not, for never yet did any man of himself know his own parentage. Ah, would that I had been the son of some blest man, whom old age overtook among his own possessions. But now of him who was the most ill-fated of mortal men<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />they say that I am sprung, since thou askest me of this.”
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Surely, then, no nameless lineage have the gods appointed for thee in time to come, seeing that Penelope bore thee such as thou art. But come, tell me this and declare it truly.<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />What feast, what throng is this? What need hast thou of it? Is it a drinking bout, or a wedding feast? For this plainly is no meal to which each brings his portion, with such outrage and overweening do they seem to me to be feasting in thy halls. Angered would a man be at seeing all these shameful acts, any man of sense who should come among them.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="230" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Stranger, since indeed thou dost ask and question me of this, our house once bade fair to be rich and honorable, so long as that man was still among his people. But now the gods have willed otherwise in their evil devising,<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />seeing that they have caused him to pass from sight as they have no other man. For I should not so grieve for his death, if he had been slain among his comrades in the land of the Trojans, or had died in the arms of his friends, when he had wound up the skein of war. Then would the whole host of the Achaeans have made him a tomb,<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />and for his son, too, he would have won great glory in days to come. But as it is, the spirits of the storm<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> have swept him away and left no tidings: he is gone out of sight, out of hearing, and for me he has left anguish and weeping; nor do I in any wise mourn and wail for him alone, seeing that the gods have brought upon me other sore troubles.<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />For all the princes who hold sway over the islands—Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus—and those who lord it over rocky <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, all these woo my mother and lay waste my house. And she neither refuses the hateful marriage,<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />nor is she able to make an end; but they with feasting consume my substance: ere long they will bring me, too, to ruin.”
Then, stirred to anger, Pallas Athena spoke to him:“Out on it! Thou hast of a truth sore need of Odysseus that is gone, that he might put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers.<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />Would that he might come now and take his stand at the outer gate of the house, with helmet and shield and two spears, such a man as he was when I first saw him in our house drinking and making merry, on his way back from Ephyre, from the house of Ilus, son of Mermerus.<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />For thither, too, went Odysseus in his swift ship in search of a deadly drug, that he might have wherewith to smear his bronze-tipped arrows; yet Ilus gave it not to him, for he stood in awe of the gods that are forever; but my father gave it, for he held him strangely dear.<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />Would, I say, that in such strength Odysseus might come amongst the wooers; then should they all find swift destruction and bitterness in their wooing. Yet these things verily lie on the knees of the gods, whether he shall return and wreak vengeance in his halls, or whether he shall not; but for thyself, I bid thee take thought<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />how thou mayest thrust forth the wooers from the hall. Come now, give ear, and hearken to my words. On the morrow call to an assembly the Achaean lords, and speak out thy word to all, and let the gods be thy witnesses. As for the wooers, bid them scatter, each to his own;<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />and for thy mother, if her heart bids her marry, let her go back to the hall of her mighty father, and there they will prepare a wedding feast, and make ready the gifts<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> full many—aye, all that should follow after a well-loved daughter. And to thyself will I give wise counsel, if thou wilt hearken.</p>

First go to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> and question goodly Nestor,<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />and from thence to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> to fair-haired Menelaus; for he was the last to reach home of the brazen-coated Achaeans.

But if thou shalt hear that he is dead and gone,<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />then return to thy dear native land and heap up a mound for him, and over it pay funeral rites, full many as is due, and give thy mother to a husband. Then when thou hast done all this and brought it to an end, thereafter take thought in mind and heart<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />how thou mayest slay the wooers in thy halls whether by guile or openly; for it beseems thee not to practise childish ways, since thou art no longer of such an age. Or hast thou not heard what fame the goodly Orestes won among all mankind when he slew his father's murderer,<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />the guileful Aegisthus, for that he slew his glorious father? Thou too, my friend, for I see that thou art comely and tall, be thou valiant, that many an one of men yet to be born may praise thee. But now I will go down to my swift ship and my comrades, who, methinks, are chafing much at waiting for me.<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />For thyself, give heed and have regard to my words.”
Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Stranger, in truth thou speakest these things with kindly thought, as a father to his son, and never will I forget them. But come now, tarry, eager though thou art to be gone,<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />in order that when thou hast bathed and satisfied thy heart to the full, thou mayest go to thy ship glad in spirit, and bearing a gift costly and very beautiful, which shall be to thee an heirloom from me, even such a gift as dear friends give to friends.”
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />“Stay me now no longer, when I am eager to be gone, and whatsoever gift thy heart bids thee give me, give it when I come back, to bear to my home, choosing a right beautiful one; it shall bring thee its worth in return.”
So spoke the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, and departed,<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />flying upward<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> as a bird; and in his heart she put strength and courage, and made him think of his father even more than aforetime. And in his mind he marked her and marvelled, for he deemed that she was a god; and straightway he went among the wooers, a godlike man.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />For them the famous minstrel was singing, and they sat in silence listening; and he sang of the return of the Achaeans—the woeful return from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> which Pallas Athena laid upon them. And from her upper chamber the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, heard his wondrous song,<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />and she went down the high stairway from her chamber, not alone, for two handmaids attended her. Now when the fair lady had come to the wooers, she stood by the door-post of the well-built hall, holding before her face her shining veil;<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />and a faithful handmaid stood on either side of her. Then she burst into tears, and spoke to the divine minstrel:
“Phemius, many other things thou knowest to charm mortals, deeds of men and gods which minstrels make famous. Sing them one of these, as thou sittest here,<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />and let them drink their wine in silence. But cease from this woeful song which ever harrows the heart in my breast, for upon me above all women has come a sorrow not to be forgotten. So dear a head do I ever remember with longing, even my husband, whose fame is wide through <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> and mid-<placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.”<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />Then wise Telemachus answered her: “My mother, why dost thou begrudge the good minstrel to give pleasure in whatever way his heart is moved? It is not minstrels that are to blame, but Zeus, I ween, is to blame, who gives to men that live by toil,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> to each one as he will.<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />With this man no one can be wroth if he sings of the evil doom of the Danaans; for men praise that song the most which comes the newest to their ears. For thyself, let thy heart and soul endure to listen; for not Odysseus alone lost<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />in <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> the day of his return, but many others likewise perished. Nay, go to thy chamber, and busy thyself with thine own tasks, the loom and the distaff, and bid thy handmaids ply their tasks; but speech shall be for men, for all, but most of all for me; since mine is the authority in the house.”
<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />She then, seized with wonder, went back to her chamber, for she laid to heart the wise saying of her son. Up to her upper chamber she went with her handmaids, and then bewailed Odysseus, her dear husband until flashing-eyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />But the wooers broke into uproar throughout the shadowy halls, and all prayed, each that he might lie by her side. And among them wise Telemachus was the first to speak:
“Wooers of my mother, overweening in your insolence, for the present let us make merry with feasting,<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />but let there be no brawling; for this is a goodly thing, to listen to a minstrel such as this man is, like to the gods in voice. But in the morning let us go to the assembly and take our seats, one and all, that I may declare my word to you outright that you depart from these halls. Prepare you other feasts,<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />eating your own substance and changing from house to house. But if this seems in your eyes to be a better and more profitable thing, that one man's livelihood should be ruined without atonement, waste ye it. But I will call upon the gods that are forever, if haply Zeus may grant that deeds of requital may be wrought.<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />Without atonement, then, should ye perish within my halls.”
So he spoke, and they all bit their lips and marvelled at Telemachus, for that he spoke boldly.
Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him:“Telemachus, verily the gods themselves are teaching thee<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />to be a man of vaunting tongue, and to speak with boldness. May the son of Cronos never make thee king in sea-girt <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, which thing is by birth thy heritage.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Antinous, wilt thou be wroth with me for the word that I shall say?<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />Even this should I be glad to accept from the hand of Zeus. Thinkest thou indeed that this is the worst fate among men? Nay, it is no bad thing to be a king. Straightway one's house grows rich and oneself is held in greater honor. However, there are other kings of the Achaeans<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />full many in seagirt <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, both young and old. One of these haply may have this place, since goodly Odysseus is dead. But I will be lord of our own house and of the slaves that goodly Odysseus won for me.”
Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />“Telemachus, this matter verily lies on the knees of the gods, who of the Achaeans shall be king in sea-girt <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>; but as for thy possessions, thou mayest keep them thyself, and be lord in thine own house. Never may that man come who by violence and against thy will shall wrest thy possessions from thee, while men yet live in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>.<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />But I am fain, good sir, to ask thee of the stranger, whence this man comes. Of what land does he declare himself to be? Where are his kinsmen and his native fields? Does he bring some tidings of thy father's coming, or came he hither in furtherance of some matter of his own?<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />How he started up, and was straightway gone! Nor did he wait to be known; and yet he seemed no base man to look upon.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Eurymachus, surely my father's home-coming is lost and gone. No longer do I put trust in tidings, whencesoever they may come,<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />nor reck I of any prophecy which my mother haply may learn of a seer, when she has called him to the hall. But this stranger is a friend of my father's house from Taphos. He declares that he is Mentes, son of wise Anchialus, and he is lord over the oar-loving Taphians.”
<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />So spoke Telemachus, but in his heart he knew the immortal goddess.</p>

                    <p>
Now the wooers turned to the dance and to gladsome song, and made them merry, and waited till evening should come; and as they made merry dark evening came upon them. Then they went, each man to his house, to take their rest.<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />But Telemachus, where his chamber was built in the beautiful court, high, in a place of wide outlook, thither went to his bed, pondering many things in mind; and with him, bearing blazing torches, went true-hearted Eurycleia, daughter of Ops, son of Peisenor.<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />Her long ago <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> had bought with his wealth, when she was in her first youth, and gave for her the price of twenty oxen; and he honored her even as he honored his faithful wife in his halls, but he never lay with her in love, for he shunned the wrath of his wife. She it was who bore for Telemachus the blazing torches;<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />for she of all the handmaids loved him most, and had nursed him when he was a child. He opened the doors of the well-built chamber, sat down on the bed, and took off his soft tunic and laid it in the wise old woman's hands. And she folded and smoothed the tunic<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />and hung it on a peg beside the corded<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> bedstead, and then went forth from the chamber, drawing the door to by its silver handle, and driving the bolt home with the thong. So there, the night through, wrapped in a fleece of wool, he pondered in his mind upon the journey which Athena had shewn him.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />Soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, up from his bed arose the dear son of Odysseus and put on his clothing. About his shoulder he slung his sharp sword, and beneath his shining feet bound his fair sandals,<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />and went forth from his chamber like a god to look upon. Straightway he bade the clear-voiced heralds to summon to the assembly the long-haired Achaeans. And the heralds made the summons, and the Achaeans assembled full quickly. Now when they were assembled and met together,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />Telemachus went his way to the place of assembly, holding in his hand a spear of bronze—not alone, for along with him two swift hounds followed; and wondrous was the grace that Athena shed upon him, and all the people marvelled at him as he came. But he sat down in his father's seat, and the elders gave place.
<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />Then among them the lord Aegyptius was the first to speak, a man bowed with age and wise with wisdom untold. Now he spoke, because his dear son had gone in the hollow ships to Ilius, famed for its horses, in the company of godlike Odysseus, even the warrior Antiphus. But him the savage <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> had slain<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />in his hollow cave, and made of him his latest meal. Three others there were; one, Eurynomus, consorted with the wooers, and two ever kept their father's farm. Yet, even so, he could not forget that other, mourning and sorrowing; and weeping for him he addressed the assembly, and spoke among them:
<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />“Hearken now to me, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, to the word that I shall say. Never have we held assembly or session since the day when goodly Odysseus departed in the hollow ships. And now who has called us together? On whom has such need come either of the young men or of those who are older?<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />Has he heard some tidings of the army's return,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> which he might tell us plainly, seeing that he has first learned of it himself? Or is there some other public matter on which he is to speak and address us? A good man he seems in my eyes, a blessed man. May Zeus fulfil unto him himself some good, even whatsoever he desires in his heart.”
<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />So he spoke, and the dear son of Odysseus rejoiced at the word of omen; nor did he thereafter remain seated, but was fain to speak. So he took his stand in the midst of the assembly, and the staff was placed in his hands by the herald Peisenor, wise in counsel.</p>

                <div2 n="39" type="card">
                    <p>Then he spoke, addressing first the old man:
<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />“Old man, not far off, as thou shalt soon learn thyself, is that man who has called the host together—even I; for on me above all others has sorrow come. I have neither heard any tidings of the army's return, which I might tell you plainly, seeing that I had first learned of it myself, nor is there any other public matter on which I am to speak and address you.<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />Nay, it is mine own need, for that evil has fallen upon my house in two-fold wise. First, I have lost my noble sire who was once king among you here, and was gentle as a father; and now there is come an evil yet greater far, which will presently altogether destroy my house and ruin all my livelihood.<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />My mother have wooers beset against her will, the sons of those men who are here the noblest. They shrink from going to the house of her father, Icarius, that he may himself exact the bride-gifts for his daughter, and give her to whom he will, even to him who meets his favour,<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />but thronging our house day after day they slay our oxen and sheep and fat goats, and keep revel, and drink the sparkling wine recklessly; and havoc is made of all this wealth. For there is no man here, such as Odysseus was, to ward off ruin from the house.<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />As for me, I am no-wise such as he to ward it off. Nay verily, even if I try I shall be found a weakling and one knowing naught of valor. Yet truly I would defend myself, if I had but the power; for now deeds past all enduring have been wrought, and past all that is seemly has my house been destroyed. Take shame upon yourselves,<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />and have regard to your neighbors who dwell roundabout, and fear the wrath of the gods, lest haply they turn against you in anger at your evil deeds.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> I pray you by Olympian Zeus, and by Themis who looses and gathers the assemblies of men,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />forbear, my friends,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> and leave me alone to pine in bitter grief—unless indeed my father, goodly Odysseus, despitefully wrought the well-greaved Achaeans woe, in requital whereof ye work me woe despitefully by urging these men on. For me it were better<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />that ye should yourselves eat up my treasures and my flocks. If ye were to devour them, recompense would haply be made some day; for just so long should we go up and down the city, pressing our suit and asking back our goods, until all was given back. But now past cure are the woes ye put upon my heart.”
<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />Thus he spoke in wrath, and dashed the staff down upon the ground, bursting into tears; and pity fell upon all the people. Then all the others kept silent, and no man had the heart to answer Telemachus with angry words.</p>

                <div2 n="84" type="card">
                    <p>Antinous alone answered him, and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />“Telemachus, thou braggart, unrestrained in daring, what a thing hast thou said, putting us to shame, and wouldest fain fasten reproach upon us! Nay, I tell thee, it is not the Achaean wooers who are anywise at fault, but thine own mother, for she is crafty above all women. For it is now the third year and the fourth will soon pass,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />since she has been deceiving the hearts of the Achaeans in their breasts. To all she offers hopes, and has promises for each man, sending them messages, but her mind is set on other things. And she devised in her heart this guileful thing also: she set up in her halls a great web, and fell to weaving—<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />fine of thread was the web and very wide; and straightway she spoke among us:
“‘Young men, my wooers, since goodly Odysseus is dead, be patient, though eager for my marriage, until I finish this robe—I would not that my spinning should come to naught—a shroud for the lord Laertes, against the time when<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />the fell fate of grievous<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> death shall strike him down; lest any of the Achaean women in the land should be wroth with me, if he, who had won great possessions, were to lie without a shroud.’
“So she spoke, and our proud hearts consented. Then day by day she would weave at the great web,<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />but by night would unravel it, when she had let place torches by her. Thus for three years she by her craft kept the Achaeans from knowing, and beguiled them; but when the fourth year came as the seasons rolled on, even then one of her women who knew all told us, and we caught her unravelling the splendid web.<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />So she finished it against her will, perforce. Therefore to thee the wooers make answer thus, that thou mayest thyself know it in thine heart, and that all the Achaeans may know. Send away thy mother, and command her to wed whomsoever her father bids, and whoso is pleasing to her.<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />But if she shall continue long time to vex the sons of the Achaeans, mindful in her heart of this, that Athena has endowed her above other women with knowledge of fair handiwork and an understanding heart, and wiles, such as we have never yet heard that any even of the women of old knew, of those who long ago were fair-tressed Achaean women—<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />Tyro and Alcmene and Mycene of the fair crown—of whom not one was like Penelope in shrewd device; yet this at least she devised not aright. For so long shall men devour thy livelihood and thy possessions, even as long as she shall keep the counsel which<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />the gods now put in her heart. Great fame she brings on herself, but on thee regret for thy much substance. For us, we will go neither to our lands nor else whither, until she marries that one of the Achaeans whom she will.”</p>

                <div2 n="129" type="card">
                    <p>
Then wise Telemachus answered him, and said:<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />“Antinous, in no wise may I thrust forth from the house against her will her that bore me and reared me; and, as for my father, he is in some other land, whether he be alive or dead. An evil thing it were for me to pay back a great price to Icarius, as I must, if of my own will I send my mother away. For from her father's hand shall I suffer evil, and heaven<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />will send other ills besides, for my mother as she leaves the house will invoke the dread Avengers; and I shall have blame, too, from men. Therefore will I never speak this word. And for you, if your own heart is wroth here at, get you forth from my halls and prepare you other feasts,<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />eating your own substance and changing from house to house. But if this seems in your eyes to be a better and more profitable thing, that one man's livelihood should be ruined without atonement, waste ye it. But I will call upon the gods that are forever, if haply Zeus may grant that deeds of requital may be wrought.<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />Without atonement then should ye perish within my halls.”
So spoke Telemachus, and in answer Zeus, whose voice is borne afar,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> sent forth two eagles, flying from on high, from a mountain peak. For a time they flew swift as the blasts of the wind side by side with wings outspread;<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />but when they reached the middle of the many-voiced assembly, then they wheeled about, flapping their wings rapidly, and down on the heads of all they looked, and death was in their glare. Then they tore with their talons one another's cheeks and necks on either side, and darted away to the right across the houses and the city of the men.<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />But they were seized with wonder at the birds when their eyes beheld them, and pondered in their hearts on what was to come to pass. Then among them spoke the old lord Halitherses, son of Mastor, for he surpassed all men of his day in knowledge of birds and in uttering words of fate.<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />He with good intent addressed their assembly, and spoke among them:
“Hearken now to me, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, to the word that I shall say; and to the wooers especially do I declare and announce these things, since on them a great woe is rolling. For Odysseus shall not long be away from his friends, but even now, methinks,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />he is near, and is sowing death and fate for these men, one and all. Aye, and to many others of us also who dwell in clear-seen <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> will he be a bane. But long ere that let us take thought how we may make an end of this—or rather let them of themselves make an end, for this is straightway the better course for them.<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />Not as one untried do I prophesy, but with sure knowledge. For unto Odysseus I declare that all things are fulfilled even as I told him, when the Argives embarked for <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName> and with them went Odysseus of many wiles. I declared that after suffering many ills and losing all his comrades he would come home in the twentieth year<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />unknown to all; and lo, all this is now being brought to pass.”</p>

                <div2 n="177" type="card">
                    <p>
Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him, and said: “Old man, up now, get thee home and prophesy to thy children, lest haply in days to come they suffer ill.<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />In this matter I am better far than thou to prophesy. Many birds there are that fare to and fro under the rays of the sun, and not all are fateful. As for Odysseus, he has perished far away, as I would that thou hadst likewise perished with him. Then wouldst thou not prate so much in thy reading of signs,<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />or be urging Telemachus on in his wrath, hoping for some gift for thy house, if haply he shall give it. But I will speak out to thee, and this word shall verily be brought to pass. If thou, wise in the wisdom of old, shalt beguile with thy talk a younger man, and set him on to be wroth,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />for him in the first place it shall be the more grievous, and he will in no case be able to do aught because of these men here, and on thee, old man, will we lay a fine which it will grieve thy soul to pay, and bitter shall be thy sorrow. And to Telemachus I myself, here among all, will offer this counsel.<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />His mother let him bid to go back to the house of her father, and they will prepare a wedding feast and make ready the gifts full many,—aye, all that should follow after a well-loved daughter. For ere that, methinks, the sons of the Achaeans will not cease from their grievous wooing, since in any case we fear no man,—<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />no, not Telemachus for all his many words,—nor do we reck of any soothsaying which thou, old man, mayest declare; it will fail of fulfillment, and thou shalt be hated the more. Aye, and his possessions shall be devoured in evil wise, nor shall requital ever be made, so long as she shall put off the Achaeans<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />in the matter of her marriage. And we on our part waiting here day after day are rivals by reason of her excellence, and go not after other women, whom each one might fitly wed.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Eurymachus and all ye other lordly wooers,<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />in this matter I entreat you no longer nor speak thereof, for now the gods know it, and all the Achaeans. But come, give me a swift ship and twenty comrades who will accomplish my journey for me to and fro. For I shall go to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and to sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />to seek tidings of the return of my father that has long been gone, if haply any mortal man may tell me, or I may hear a voice from Zeus, which oftenest brings tidings to men.<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />If so be I shall hear that my father is alive and coming home, then verily, though I am sore afflicted, I could endure for yet a year. But if I shall hear that he is dead and gone, then I will return to my dear native land and heap up a mound for him, and over it pay funeral rites, full many, as is due, and give my mother to a husband.”</p>

So saying he sat down, and among them rose<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />Mentor, who was a comrade of noble Odysseus. To him, on departing with his ships, Odysseus had given all his house in charge, that it should obey the old man and that he should keep all things safe. He with good intent addressed their assembly, and spoke among them:
“Hearken now to me, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, to the word that I shall say.<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />Never henceforth let sceptred king with a ready heart be kind and gentle, nor let him heed righteousness in his heart, but let him ever be harsh and work unrighteousness, seeing that no one remembers divine Odysseus of the people whose lord he was; yet gentle was he as a father.<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />But of a truth I begrudge not the proud wooers that they work deeds of violence in the evil contrivings of their minds, for it is at the hazard of their own lives that they violently devour the house of Odysseus, who, they say, will no more return. Nay, rather it is with the rest of the folk that I am wroth, that ye all<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />sit thus in silence, and utter no word of rebuke to make the wooers cease, though ye are many and they but few.”
Then Leocritus, son of Euenor, answered him:“Mentor, thou mischief-maker,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> thou wanderer in thy wits, what hast thou said, bidding men make us cease? Nay, it were a hard thing<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />to fight about a feast with men that moreover outnumber you. For if Ithacan Odysseus himself were to come and be eager at heart to drive out from his hall the lordly wooers who are feasting in his house, then should his wife have no joy<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />at his coming, though sorely she longed for him, but right here would he meet a shameful death, if he fought with men that outnumbered him.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> Thou hast not spoken aright. But come now, ye people, scatter, each one of you to his own lands. As for this fellow, Mentor and Halitherses will speed his journey, for they are friends of his father's house from of old.<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />But methinks he will long abide here and get his tidings in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and never accomplish this journey.”
So he spoke, and hastily broke up the assembly. They then scattered, each one to his own house; and the wooers went to the house of divine Odysseus.
<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />But Telemachus went apart to the shore of the sea, and having washed his hands in the grey seawater, prayed to Athena: “Hear me, thou who didst come yesterday as a god to our house, and didst bid me go in a ship over the misty deep to seek tidings of the return of my father, that has long been gone.<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />Lo, all this the Achaeans hinder, but the wooers most of all in their evil insolence.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="267" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke in prayer, and Athena drew near to him in the likeness of Mentor, both in form and invoice; and she spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />“Telemachus, neither hereafter shalt thou be a base man or a witless, if aught of thy father's goodly spirit has been instilled into thee, such a man was he to fulfil both deed and word. So then shall this journey of thine be neither vain nor unfulfilled. But if thou art not the son of him and of Penelope,<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />then I have no hope that thou wilt accomplish thy desire. Few sons indeed are like their fathers; most are worse, few better than their fathers. But since neither hereafter shalt thou be a base man or a witless, nor has the wisdom of Odysseus wholly failed thee,<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />there is therefore hope that thou wilt accomplish this work. Now then let be the will and counsel of the wooers—fools, for they are in no wise either prudent or just, nor do they know aught of death or black fate, which verily is near at hand for them, that they shall all perish in a day.<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />But for thyself, the journey on which thy heart is set shall not be long delayed, so true a friend of thy father's house am I, who will equip for thee a swift ship, and myself go with thee. But go thou now to the house and join the company of the wooers; make ready stores, and bestow all in vessels—<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />wine in jars, and barley meal, the marrow of men, in stout skins;—but I, going through the town, will quickly gather comrades that go willingly. And ships there are full many in sea-girt <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, both new and old; of these will I choose out for thee the one that is best,<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />and quickly will we make her ready and launch her on the broad deep.”
So spoke Athena, daughter of Zeus, nor did Telemachus tarry long after he had heard the voice of the goddess, but went his way to the house, his heart heavy within him. He found there the proud wooers in the halls,<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />flaying goats and singeing swine in the court. And Antinous with a laugh came straight to Telemachus, and clasped his hand, and spoke, and addressed<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> him:
“Telemachus, thou braggart, unrestrained in daring, let no more any evil deed or word be in thy heart.<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />Nay, I bid thee, eat and drink even as before. All these things the Achaeans will surely provide for thee—the ship and chosen oarsmen—that with speed thou mayest go to sacred <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> to seek for tidings of thy noble father.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="309" type="card">
                    <p>
Then wise Telemachus answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />“Antinous, in no wise is it possible for me in your overweening company to sit at meat quietly and to make merry with an easy mind. Is it not enough, ye wooers, that in time past ye wasted many goodly possessions of mine, while I was still a child? But now that I am grown,<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />and gain knowledge by hearing the words of others, yea and my spirit waxes within me, I will try how I may hurl forth upon your evil fates, either going to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> or here in this land. For go I will, nor shall the journey be in vain whereof I speak, though I voyage in another's ship, since I may not be master of ship or oarsmen.<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />So, I ween, it seemed to you to be more to your profit.”
He spoke, and snatched his hand from the hand of Antinous without more ado, and the wooers were busy with the feast throughout the hall. They mocked and jeered at him in their talk; and thus would one of the proud youths speak:
<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />“Aye, verily Telemachus is planning our murder. He will bring men to aid him from sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> or even from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, so terribly is he set upon it. Or he means to go to Ephyre, that rich land, to bring from thence deadly drugs,<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />that he may cast them in the wine-bowl, and destroy us all.”
And again another of the proud youths would say: “Who knows but he himself as he goes on the hollow ship may perish wandering far from his friends, even as Odysseus did? So would he cause us yet more labour;<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />for we should have to divide all his possessions, and his house we should give to his mother to possess, and to him who should wed her.”
So they spoke, but Telemachus went down to the high-roofed treasure-chamber of his father, a wide room where gold and bronze lay piled, and raiment in chests, and stores of fragrant oil.<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />There, too, stood great jars of wine, old and sweet, holding within them an unmixed divine drink, and ranged in order along the wall, if ever Odysseus should return home even after many grievous toils. Shut were<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />the double doors, close-fitted; and there both night and day a stewardess abode, who guarded all in wisdom of mind, Eurycleia, daughter of Ops, son of Peisenor. To her now Telemachus, when he had called her to the treasure-chamber, spoke, and said:
“Nurse, draw me off wine in jars,<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />sweet wine that is the choicest next to that which thou guardest ever thinking upon that ill-fated one, if haply Zeus-born Odysseus may come I know not whence, having escaped from death and the fates. Fill twelve jars and fit them all with covers, and pour me barley meal into well-sewn skins,<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />and let there be twenty measures of ground barley meal. But keep knowledge hereof to thyself, and have all these things brought together; for at evening I will fetch them, when my mother goes to her upper chamber and bethinks her of her rest. For I am going to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and to sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />to seek tidings of the return of my dear father, if haply I may hear any.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="361" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and the dear nurse, Eurycleia, uttered a shrill cry, and weeping spoke to him winged words:“Ah, dear child, how has this thought come into thy mind? Whither art thou minded to go over the wide earth,<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />thou who art an only son and well-beloved? But he hath perished far from his country, the Zeus-born Odysseus, in a strange land; and these men, so soon as thou art gone, will devise evil for thee hereafter, that thou mayest perish by guile, and themselves divide all these possessions. Nay, abide here in charge of what is thine; thou hast no need<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />to suffer ills and go a wanderer over the unresting sea.”
Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Take heart, nurse, for not without a god's warrant is this my plan. But swear to tell naught of this to my dear mother until the eleventh or twelfth day shall come,<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />or until she shall herself miss me and hear that I am gone, that she may not mar her fair flesh with weeping.”
So he spoke, and the old woman swore a great oath by the gods to say naught. But when she had sworn and made an end of the oath, straightway she drew for him wine in jars,<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />and poured barley meal into well-sewn skins; and Telemachus went to the hall and joined the company of the wooers.
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. In the likeness of Telemachus she went everywhere throughout the city, and to each of the men she drew near and spoke her word,<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />bidding them gather at even beside the swift ship. Furthermore, of Noemon, the glorious son of Phronius, she asked a swift ship, and he promised it to her with a ready heart.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="388" type="card">
                    <p>
Now the sun set and all the ways grew dark. Then she drew the swift ship to the sea and<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />put in it all the gear that well-benched ships carry. And she moored it at the mouth of the harbor, and round about it the goodly company was gathered together, and the goddess heartened each man.
Then again the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. She went her way to the house of divine Odysseus,<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />and there began to shed sweet sleep upon the wooers and made them to wander in their drinking, and from their hands she cast the cups. But they rose to go to their rest throughout the city, and remained no long time seated, for sleep was falling upon their eyelids. But to Telemachus spoke flashing-eyed Athena,<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />calling him forth before the stately hall, having likened herself to Mentor both in form and in voice:
“Telemachus, already thy well-greaved comrades sit at the oar and await thy setting out. Come, let us go, that we may not long delay their journey.”
<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />So saying, Pallas Athena led the way quickly, and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess. Now when they had come down to the ship and to the sea, they found on the shore their long-haired comrades, and the strong and mighty<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> Telemachus spoke among them:
<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />“Come, friends, let us fetch the stores, for all are now gathered together in the hall. My mother knows naught hereof, nor the handmaids either: one only heard my word.”
Thus saying, he led the way, and they went along with him. So they brought and<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />stowed everything in the well-benched ship, as the dear son of Odysseus bade. Then on board the ship stepped Telemachus, and Athena went before him and sat down in the stern of the ship, and near her sat Telemachus, while the men loosed the stern cables and themselves stepped on board, and sat down upon the benches.<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />And flashing-eyed Athena sent them a favorable wind, a strong-blowing West wind that sang over the wine-dark sea. And Telemachus called to his men, and bade them lay hold of the tackling, and they hearkened to his call. The mast of fir<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />they raised and set in the hollow socket, and made it fast with fore-stays, and hauled up the white sail with twisted thongs of ox-hide. So the wind filled the belly of the sail, and the dark wave sang loudly about the stem of the ship as she went, and she sped over the wave accomplishing her way.<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />Then, when they had made the tackling fast in the swift black ship, they set forth bowls brim full of wine, and poured libations to the immortal gods that are forever, and chiefest of all to the flashing-eyed daughter of Zeus. So all night long and through the dawn the ship cleft her way.</p>

            <div1 n="3" type="Book">

                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />And now the sun, leaving the beauteous mere, sprang up into the brazen heaven to give light to the immortals and to mortal men on the earth, the giver of grain; and they came to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, the well-built citadel of Neleus.<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />Here the townsfolk on the shore of the sea were offering sacrifice of black bulls to the dark-haired Earth-shaker. Nine companies there were, and five hundred men sat in each, and in each they held nine bulls ready for sacrifice. Now when they had tasted the inner parts and were burning the thigh-pieces to the god,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />the others put straight in to the shore, and hauled up and furled the sail of the shapely ship, and moored her, and themselves stepped forth. Forth too from the ship stepped Telemachus, and Athena led the way. And the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, spake first to him, and said:
“Telemachus, no longer hast thou need to feel shame, no, not a whit.<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />For to this end hast thou sailed over the sea, that thou mightest seek tidings of thy father,—where the earth covered him, and what fate he met. But come now, go straightway to Nestor, tamer of horses; let us learn what counsel he keepeth hid in his breast. And do thou beseech him thyself that he may tell thee the very truth.<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />A lie will he not utter, for he is wise indeed.”
Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Mentor, how shall I go, and how shall I greet him? I am as yet all unversed in subtle speech, and moreover a young man has shame to question an elder.”
<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Telemachus, somewhat thou wilt of thyself devise in thy breast, and somewhat heaven too will prompt thee. For, methinks, not without the favour of the gods hast thou been born and reared.”
So spake Pallas Athena, and led the way<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />quickly; but he followed in the footsteps of the goddess; and they came to the gathering and the companies of the men of <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>. There Nestor sat with his sons, and round about his people, making ready the feast, were roasting some of the meat and putting other pieces on spits. But when they saw the strangers they all came thronging about them,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />and clasped their hands in welcome, and bade them sit down. First Nestor's son Peisistratus came near and took both by the hand, and made them to sit down at the feast on soft fleeces upon the sand of the sea, beside his brother Thrasymedes and his father.<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />Thereupon he gave them portions of the inner meat and poured wine in a golden cup, and, pledging her, he spoke to Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis:
“Pray now, stranger, to the lord Poseidon, for his is the feast whereon you have chanced in coming hither.<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />And when thou hast poured libations and hast prayed, as is fitting, then give thy friend also the cup of honey-sweet wine that he may pour, since he too, I ween, prays to the immortals; for all men have need of the gods. Howbeit he is the younger, of like age with myself,<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />wherefore to thee first will I give the golden cup.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="51" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spake, and placed in her hand the cup of sweet wine. But Pallas Athena rejoiced at the man's wisdom and judgment, in that to her first he gave the golden cup; and straightway she prayed earnestly to the lord Poseidon:
<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />“Hear me, Poseidon, thou Earth-enfolder, and grudge not in answer to our prayer to bring these deeds to fulfillment. To Nestor, first of all, and to his sons vouchsafe renown, and then do thou grant to the rest gracious requital for this glorious hecatomb, even to all the men of <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>;<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />and grant furthermore that Telemachus and I may return when we have accomplished all that for which we came hither with our swift black ship.”
Thus she prayed, and was herself fulfilling all. Then she gave Telemachus the fair two-handled<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> cup, and in like manner the dear son of Odysseus prayed.<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />Then when they had roasted the outer flesh and drawn it off the spits, they divided the portions and feasted a glorious feast. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key="perseus,Gerenia">Gerenia</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> spoke first among them:
“Now verily is it seemlier to ask and enquire<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />of the strangers who they are, since now they have had their joy of food. Strangers, who are ye? Whence do ye sail over the watery ways? Is it on some business, or do ye wander at random over the sea, even as pirates, who wander hazarding their lives and bringing evil to men of other lands?”
<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />Then wise Telemachus took courage, and made answer, for Athena herself put courage in his heart, that he might ask about his father that was gone, and that good report might be his among men:
“Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaeans,<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />thou askest whence we are, and I will surely tell thee. We have come from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> that is below Neion; but this business whereof I speak is mine own, and concerns not the people. I come after the wide-spread rumor of my father, if haply I may hear of it, even of goodly Odysseus of the steadfast heart, who once, men say,<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />fought by thy side and sacked the city of the Trojans. For of all men else, as many as warred with the Trojans, we learn where each man died a woeful death, but of him the son of Cronos has made even the death to be past learning; for no man can tell surely where he hath died,—<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />whether he was overcome by foes on the mainland, or on the deep among the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore am I now come to thy knees, if perchance thou wilt be willing to tell me of his woeful death, whether thou sawest it haply with thine own eyes, or didst hear from some other the story<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />of his wanderings;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> for beyond all men did his mother bear him to sorrow. And do thou nowise out of ruth or pity for me speak soothing words, but tell me truly how thou didst come to behold him. I beseech thee, if ever my father, noble Odysseus, promised aught to thee of word or deed and fulfilled it<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />in the land of the Trojans, where you Achaeans suffered woes, be mindful of it now, I pray thee, and tell me the very truth.”</p>

                <div2 n="102" type="card">
                    <p>
Then the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key="perseus,Gerenia">Gerenia</placeName>, answered him: “My friend, since thou hast recalled to my mind the sorrow which we endured in that land, we sons of the Achaeans, unrestrained in daring,—<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />all that we endured on shipboard, as we roamed after booty over the misty deep whithersoever Achilles led; and all our fightings around the great city of king Priam;—lo, there all our best were slain. There lies warlike Aias, there Achilles,<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />there Patroclus, the peer of the gods in counsel; and there my own dear son, strong alike and peerless, Antilochus, pre-eminent in speed of foot and as a warrior. Aye, and many other ills we suffered besides these; who of mortal men could tell them all?<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />Nay, if for five years' space or six years' space thou wert to abide here, and ask of all the woes which the goodly Achaeans endured there, thou wouldest grow weary ere the end and get thee back to thy native land. For nine years' space were we busied plotting their ruin with all manner of wiles; and hardly did the son of Cronos bring it to pass.<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />There no man ventured to vie with him in counsel, since goodly Odysseus far excelled in all manner of wiles,—thy father, if indeed thou art his son. Amazement holds me as I look on thee, for verily thy speech is like his; nor would one think<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />that a younger man would speak so like him. Now all the time that we were there goodly Odysseus and I never spoke at variance either in the assembly or in the council, but being of one mind advised the Argives with wisdom and shrewd counsel how all might be for the best.<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />But when we had sacked the lofty city of Priam, and had gone away in our ships, and a god had scattered the Achaeans, then, even then, Zeus planned in his heart a woeful return for the Argives, for in no wise prudent or just were all. Wherefore many of them met an evil fate<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />through the fell wrath of the flashing-eyed goddess, the daughter of the mighty sire, for she caused strife between the two sons of Atreus. Now these two called to an assembly all the Achaeans, recklessly and in no due order, at set of sun—and they came heavy with wine, the sons of the Achaeans,—<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />and they spoke their word, and told wherefore they had gathered the host together.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="141" type="card">
                    <p>
Then in truth Menelaus bade all the Achaeans think of their return over the broad back of the sea, but in no wise did he please Agamemnon, for he was fain to hold back the host and to offer holy hecatombs,<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />that he might appease the dread wrath of Athena,—fool! nor knew he this, that with her was to be no hearkening; for the mind of the gods that are forever is not quickly turned. So these two stood bandying harsh words; but the well-greaved Achaeans sprang up<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />with a wondrous din, and two-fold plans found favour with them. That night we rested, each side pondering hard thoughts against the other, for Zeus was bringing upon us an evil doom, but in the morning some of us launched our ships upon the bright sea, and put on board our goods and the low-girdled women.<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />Half, indeed, of the host held back and remained there with Agamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the host, but half of us embarked and rowed away; and swiftly the ships sailed, for a god made smooth the cavernous sea. But when we came to <placeName key="perseus,Tenedos">Tenedos</placeName>, we offered sacrifice to the gods,<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />being eager to reach our homes, howbeit Zeus did not yet purpose our return, stubborn god, who roused evil strife again a second time. Then some turned back their curved ships and departed, even the lord Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded, with his company, once more showing favour to Agamemnon, son of Atreus;<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />but I with the full company of ships that followed me fled on, for I knew that the god was devising evil. And the warlike son of Tydeus fled and urged on his men; and late upon our track came fair-haired Menelaus, and overtook us in <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName>, as we were debating the long voyage,<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />whether we should sail to sea-ward of rugged <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>, toward the isle Psyria, keeping <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName> itself<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> on our left, or to land-ward of <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName> past windy Mimas. So we asked the god to shew us a sign, and he shewed it us, and bade us cleave through the midst of the sea to <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />that we might the soonest escape from misery. And a shrill wind sprang up to blow, and the ships ran swiftly over the teeming ways, and at night put in to Geraestus. There on the altar of Poseidon we laid many thighs of bulls, thankful to have traversed the great sea.<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />It was the fourth day when in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> the company of Diomedes, son of Tydeus, tamer of horses, stayed their shapely ships; but I held on toward <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, and the wind was not once quenched from the time when the god first sent it forth to blow.</p>

“Thus I came, dear child, without tidings, nor know I aught<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />of those others, who of the Achaeans were saved, and who were lost. But what tidings I have heard as I abide in our halls thou shalt hear, as is right, nor will I hide it from thee. Safely, they say, came the Myrmidons that rage with the spear, whom the famous son of great-hearted Achilles led;<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />and safely Philoctetes, the glorious son of Poias. All his company, too, did Idomeneus bring to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, all who escaped the war, and the sea robbed him of none. But of the son of Atreus you have yourselves heard, far off though you are, how he came, and how Aegisthus devised for him a woeful doom.<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />Yet verily he paid the reckoning therefor in terrible wise, so good a thing is it that a son be left behind a man at his death, since that son took vengeance on his father's slayer, the guileful Aegisthus, for that he slew his glorious father. Thou, too, friend, for I see thou art a comely man and tall,<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />be thou valiant, that many an one among men yet to be born may praise thee.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaeans, yea verily that son took vengeance, and the Achaeans shall spread his fame abroad, that men who are yet to be may hear thereof.<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />O that the gods would clothe me with such strength, that I might take vengeance on the wooers for their grievous sin, who in wantonness devise mischief against me. But lo, the gods have spun for me no such happiness, for me or for my father; and now I must in any case endure.”
<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />Then the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key="perseus,Gerenia">Gerenia</placeName>, answered him: “Friend, since thou calledst this to my mind and didst speak of it, they say that many wooers for the hand of thy mother devise evils in thy halls in thy despite. Tell me, art thou willingly thus oppressed, or do the people<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />throughout the land hate thee, following the voice of a god? Who knows but Odysseus may some day come and take vengeance on them for their violent deeds,—he alone, it may be, or even all the host of the Achaeans? Ah, would that flashing-eyed Athena might choose to love thee even as then she cared exceedingly for glorious Odysseus<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />in the land of the Trojans, where we Achaeans suffered woes. For never yet have I seen the gods so manifestly shewing love, as Pallas Athena did to him, standing manifest by his side. If she would be pleased to love thee in such wise and would care for thee at heart, then would many a one of them utterly forget marriage.”
<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Old man, in no wise do I deem that this word will be brought to pass. Too great is what thou sayest; amazement holds me. No hope have I that this will come to pass, no, not though the gods should so will it.”</p>

                <div2 n="229" type="card">
                    <p>
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, spoke to him, and said:<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />“Telemachus, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth! Easily might a god who willed it bring a man safe home, even from afar. But for myself, I had rather endure many grievous toils ere I reached home and saw the day of my returning, than after my return be slain at my hearth, as Agamemnon<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />was slain by the guile of Aegisthus and of his own wife. But of a truth death that is common to all<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> the gods themselves cannot ward from a man they love, when the fell fate of grievous death shall strike him down.”
Then wise Telemachus answered her:<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />“Mentor, no longer let us tell of these things despite our grief. For him no return can ever more be brought to pass; nay, ere this the immortals have devised for him death and black fate. But now I would make enquiry and ask Nestor regarding another matter, since beyond all others he knows judgments and wisdom;<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />for thrice, men say, has he been king for a generation of men, and like unto an immortal he seems to me to look upon. Nestor, son of Neleus, do thou tell me truly: how was the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, slain? Where was Menelaus? What death did<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />guileful Aegisthus plan for the king, since he slew a man mightier far than himself? Was Menelaus not in Achaean Argos, but wandering elsewhere among men, so that Aegisthus took heart and did the murderous deed?”
Then the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key="perseus,Gerenia">Gerenia</placeName>, answered him: “Then verily, my child, will I tell thee all the truth.<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />Lo, of thine own self thou dost guess how this matter would have fallen out, if the son of Atreus, fair-haired Menelaus, on his return from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> had found Aegisthus in his halls alive. Then for him not even in death would they have piled the up-piled earth, but the dogs and birds would have torn him<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />as he lay on the plain far from the city, nor would any of the Achaean women have bewailed him; for monstrous was the deed he devised. We on our part abode there in <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> fulfilling our many toils; but he, at ease in a nook of horse-pasturing <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, ever sought to beguile with words the wife of Agamemnon.<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />Now at the first she put from her the unseemly deed, the beautiful Clytemnestra, for she had an understanding heart; and with her was furthermore a minstrel whom the son of Atreus straitly charged, when he set forth for the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, to guard his wife. But when at length the doom of the gods bound her that she should be overcome,<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />then verily Aegisthus took the minstrel to a desert isle and left him to be the prey and spoil of birds; and her, willing as he was willing, he led to his own house. And many thigh-pieces he burned upon the holy altars of the gods, and many offerings he hung up, woven stuffs and gold,<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />since he had accomplished a mighty deed beyond all his heart had hoped.</p>

“Now we were sailing together on our way from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, the son of Atreus and I, in all friendship; but when we came to holy Sunium, the cape of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, there Phoebus Apollo<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />assailed with his gentle<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> shafts and slew the helmsman of Menelaus, as he held in his hands the steering-oar of the speeding ship, even Phrontis, son of Onetor, who excelled the tribes of men in piloting a ship when the storm winds blow strong. So Menelaus tarried there, though eager for his journey,<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />that he might bury his comrade and over him pay funeral rites. But when he in his turn, as he passed over the wine-dark sea in the hollow ships, reached in swift course the steep height of Malea, then verily Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, planned for him a hateful path and poured upon him the blasts of shrill winds,<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />and the waves were swollen to huge size, like unto mountains. Then, parting his ships in twain, he brought some to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, where the Cydonians dwelt about the streams of Iardanus. Now there is a smooth cliff, sheer towards the sea, on the border of <placeName key="perseus,Gortyn">Gortyn</placeName> in the misty deep,<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />where the Southwest Wind drives the great wave against the headland on the left toward <placeName key="tgn,7010788">Phaestus</placeName>, and a little rock holds back a great wave. Thither came some of his ships, and the men with much ado escaped destruction, howbeit the ships the waves dashed to pieces against the reef. But the five other dark-prowed ships<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />the wind, as it bore them, and the wave brought to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>. So he was wandering there with his ships among men of strange speech, gathering much livelihood and gold; but meanwhile Aegisthus devised this woeful work at home.<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />Seven years he reigned over <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>, rich in gold, after slaying the son of Atreus, and the people were subdued under him; but in the eighth came as his bane the goodly Orestes back from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and slew his father's murderer,<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />the guileful Aegisthus, for that he had slain his glorious father. Now when he had slain him, he made a funeral feast for the Argives over his hateful mother and the craven Aegisthus; and on the self-same day there came to him Menelaus, good at the war-cry, bringing much treasure, even all the burden that his ships could bear.
“So do not thou, my friend, wander long far from home, leaving thy wealth behind thee and men in thy house<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />so insolent, lest they divide and devour all thy wealth, and thou shalt have gone on a fruitless journey. But to Menelaus I bid and command thee to go, for he has but lately come from a strange land, from a folk whence no one would hope in his heart<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />to return, whom the storms had once driven astray into a sea so great, whence the very birds do not fare in the space of a year, so great is it and terrible.

So he spoke, and the sun set, and darkness came on.<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />Then among them spoke the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena: “Old man, of a truth thou hast told this tale aright. But come, cut out the tongues of the victims and mix the wine, that when we have poured libations to Poseidon and the other immortals, we may bethink us of sleep; for it is the time thereto.<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />Even now has the light gone down beneath the darkness, and it is not fitting to sit long at the feast of the gods, but to go our way.”
So spoke the daughter of Zeus, and they hearkenened to her voice. Heralds poured water over their hands, and youths filled the bowls brim full of drink,<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />and served out to all, pouring first drops for libation into the cups. Then they cast the tongues upon the fire, and, rising up, poured libations upon them. But when they had poured libations and had drunk to their heart's content, then verily Athena and godlike Telemachus were both fain to return to the hollow ship;<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />but Nestor on his part sought to stay them, and he spoke to them, saying:
“This may Zeus forbid, and the other immortal gods, that ye should go from my house to your swift ship as from one utterly without raiment and poor, who has not cloaks and blankets in plenty in his house,<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />whereon both he and his guests may sleep softly. Nay, in my house there are cloaks and fair blankets. Never surely shall the dear son of this man Odysseus lie down upon the deck of a ship, while I yet live and children after me are left in my halls<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />to entertain strangers, even whosoever shall come to my house.”
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Well indeed hast thou spoken in this, old friend, and it were fitting for Telemachus to hearken to thee, since it is far better thus. But while he shall now follow with thee, that he may sleep<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />in thy halls, I for my part will go to the black ship, that I may hearten my comrades and tell them all. For alone among them I declare that I am an older man; the others are younger who follow in friendship, all of them of like age with great-hearted Telemachus.<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />There will I lay me down by the hollow black ship this night, but in the morning I will go to the great-hearted Cauconians, where a debt is owing to me, in no wise new or small.

So spoke the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, and she departed in the likeness of a sea-eagle; and amazement fell upon all at the sight, and the old man marvelled, when his eyes beheld it. And he grasped the hand of Telemachus, and spoke, and addressed him:
<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />“Friend, in no wise do I think that thou wilt prove a base man or a craven, if verily when thou art so young the gods follow thee to be thy guides. For truly this is none other of those that have their dwellings on <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> but the daughter of Zeus, Tritogeneia,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> the maid most glorious, she that honored also thy noble father among the Argives.<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />Nay, O Queen, be gracious, and grant to me fair renown, to me and to my sons and to my revered wife; and to thee in return will I sacrifice a sleek<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> heifer, broad of brow, unbroken, which no man hath yet led beneath the yoke. Her will I sacrifice, and I will overlay her horns with gold.”
<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athena heard him. Then the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key="perseus,Gerenia">Gerenia</placeName>, led them, his sons and the husbands of his daughters, to his beautiful palace. And when they reached the glorious palace of the king, they sat down in rows on the chairs and high seats;<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />and on their coming the old man mixed for them a bowl of sweet wine, which now in the eleventh year the housewife opened, when she had loosed the string that held the lid. Thereof the old man bade mix a bowl, and earnestly he prayed, as he poured libations, to Athena, the daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis.
<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />But when they had poured libations, and had drunk to their heart's content, they went, each to his home, to take their rest. But the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key="perseus,Gerenia">Gerenia</placeName>, bade Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, to sleep there on a corded bedstead under the echoing portico,<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />and by him Peisistratus, of the good ashen spear, a leader of men, who among his sons was still unwed in the palace. But he himself slept in the inmost chamber of the lofty house, and beside him lay the lady his wife, who had strewn the couch.</p>

Soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />up from his bed rose the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key="perseus,Gerenia">Gerenia</placeName>, and went forth and sat down on the polished stones which were before his lofty doors, white and glistening as with oil.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> On these of old was wont to sit Neleus, the peer of the gods in counsel;<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />but he ere this had been stricken by fate and had gone to the house of Hades, and now there sat upon them in his turn Nestor of <placeName key="perseus,Gerenia">Gerenia</placeName>, the warder of the Achaeans, holding a sceptre in his hands. About him his sons gathered in a throng as they came forth from their chambers, Echephron and Stratius and Perseus and Aretus and godlike Thrasymedes;<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />and to these thereafter came as the sixth the lord Peisistratus. And they led godlike Telemachus and made him sit beside them; and the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key="perseus,Gerenia">Gerenia</placeName>, was first to speak among them:
“Quickly, my dear children, fulfil my desire, that first of all the gods I may propitiate Athena,<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />who came to me in manifest presence to the rich feast of the god. Come now, let one go to the plain for a heifer, that she may come speedily, and that the neatherd may drive her; and let one go to the black ship of great-hearted Telemachus and bring all his comrades, and let him leave two men only;<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />and let one again bid the goldsmith Laerces come hither, that he may overlay the heifer's horns with gold. And do ye others abide here together; and bid the handmaids within to make ready a feast throughout our glorious halls, to fetch seats, and logs to set on either side of the altar, and to bring clear water.”
<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />So he spoke, and they all set busily to work. The heifer came from the plain and from the swift, shapely ship came the comrades of great-hearted Telemachus; the smith came, bearing in his hands his tools of bronze, the implements of his craft, anvil and hammer and well-made tongs,<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />wherewith he wrought the gold; and Athena came to accept the sacrifice. Then the old man, Nestor, the driver of chariots, gave gold, and the smith prepared it, and overlaid therewith the horns of the heifer, that the goddess might rejoice when she beheld the offering. And Stratius and goodly Echephron led the heifer by the horns,<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />and Aretus came from the chamber, bringing them water for the hands in a basin embossed with flowers, and in the other hand he held barley grains in a basket; and Thrasymedes, steadfast in fight, stood by, holding in his hands a sharp axe, to fell the heifer; and Perseus held the bowl for the blood. Then the old man, Nestor, driver of chariots,<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line" />began the opening rite of hand-washing and sprinkling with barley grains, and earnestly he prayed to Athena, cutting off as first offering the hair from the head, and casting it into the fire.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="447" type="card">
                    <p>
Now when they had prayed, and had strewn the barley grains, straightway the son of Nestor, Thrasymedes, high of heart, came near and dealt the blow; and the axe cut through the sinews<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line" />of the neck, and loosened the strength of the heifer. Then the women raised the sacred cry, the daughters and the sons' wives and the revered wife of Nestor, Eurydice, the eldest of the daughters of Clymenus, and the men raised the heifer's head from the broad-wayed earth and held it, and Peisistratus, leader of men, cut the throat.<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line" />And when the black blood had flowed from her and the life had left the bones, at once they cut up the body and straightway cut out the thigh-pieces all in due order, and covered them with a double layer of fat, and laid raw flesh upon them. Then the old man burned them on billets of wood, and poured over them sparkling wine,<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line" />and beside him the young men held in their hands the five-pronged forks. But when the thigh-pieces were wholly burned, and they had tasted the inner parts, they cut up the rest and spitted and roasted it, holding the pointed spits in their hands.
Meanwhile the fair Polycaste,<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line" />the youngest daughter of Nestor, son of Neleus, bathed Telemachus. And when she had bathed him and anointed him richly<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> with oil, and had cast about him a fair cloak and a tunic, forth from the bath he came in form like unto the immortals; and he went and sat down by Nestor, the shepherd of the people.
<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line" />Now when they had roasted the outer flesh and had drawn it off the spits, they sat down and feasted, and worthy men waited on them, pouring wine<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> into golden cups. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key="perseus,Gerenia">Gerenia</placeName>, was first to speak, saying:
<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line" />“My sons, up, yoke for Telemachus horses with beautiful mane beneath the car, that he may get forward on his journey.”
So he spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed; and quickly they yoked beneath the car the swift horses. And the housewife placed in the car bread and wine<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line" />and dainties, such as kings, fostered of Zeus, are wont to eat. Then Telemachus mounted the beautiful car, and Peisistratus, son of Nestor, a leader of men, mounted beside him, and took the reins in his hands. He touched the horses with the whip to start them, and nothing loath the pair sped on<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line" />to the plain, and left the steep citadel of <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>. So all day long they shook the yoke which they bore about their necks.
Now the sun set and all the ways grew dark. And they came to Pherae, to the house of Diocles, son of Ortilochus, whom Alpheus begot.<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line" /> There they spent the night, and before them he set the entertainment due to strangers.
So soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, they yoked the horses and mounted the inlaid car, and drove forth from the gateway and the echoing portico. Then Peisistratus touched the horses with the whip to start them, and nothing loath the pair sped onward.<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line" />So they came to the wheat-bearing plain, and thereafter pressed on toward their journey's end, so well did their swift horses bear them on. And the sun set and all the ways grew dark.</p>

Him they found giving a marriage feast to his many kinsfolk for his noble son and daughter within his house.<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />His daughter he was sending to the son of Achilles, breaker of the ranks of men, for in the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> he first had promised and pledged that he would give her, and now the gods were bringing their marriage to pass.

<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />Then the two, the prince Telemachus and the glorious son of Nestor, halted at the gateway of the palace, they and their two horses. And the lord Eteoneus came forth and saw them, the busy squire of glorious Menelaus; and he went through the hall to bear the tidings to the shepherd of the people.<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />So he came near and spoke to him winged words:
“Here are two strangers, Menelaus, fostered of Zeus, two men that are like the seed of great Zeus. But tell me, shall we unyoke for them their swift horses, or send them on their way to some other host, who will give them entertainment?”
<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />Then, stirred to sore displeasure, fair-haired Menelaus spoke to him: “Aforetime thou was not wont to be a fool, Eteoneus, son of Boethous, but now like a child thou talkest folly. Surely we two ate full often hospitable cheer of other men, ere we came hither in the hope that Zeus<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />would hereafter grant us respite from sorrow. Nay, unyoke the strangers' horses, and lead the men forward into the house, that they may feast.”
So he spoke, and the other hastened through the hall, and called to the other busy squires to follow along with him. They loosed the sweating horses from beneath the yoke<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />and tied them at the stalls of the horses, and flung before them spelt, and mixed therewith white barley. Then they tilted the chariot against the bright entrance walls, and led the men into the divine palace. But at the sight they marvelled as they passed through the palace of the king, fostered of Zeus;<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />for there was a gleam as of sun or moon over the high-roofed house of glorious Menelaus. But when they had satisfied their eyes with gazing they went into the polished baths and bathed.</p>

                <div2 n="49" type="card">
                    <p>And when the maids had bathed them and anointed them with oil,<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />and had cast about them fleecy cloaks and tunics, they sat down on chairs beside Menelaus, son of Atreus. Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin for them to wash, and beside them drew up a polished table.<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />And the grave housewife brought and set before them bread, and therewith dainties in abundance, giving freely of her store. And a carver lifted up and placed before them platters of all manner of meats, and set by them golden goblets. Then fair-haired Menelaus greeted the two and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />“Take of the food, and be glad, and then when you have supped, we will ask you who among men you are; for in you two the breed of your sires is not lost, but ye are of the breed of men that are sceptred kings, fostered of Zeus; for base churls could not beget such sons as you.”
<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />So saying he took in his hands roast meat and set it before them, even the fat ox-chine which they had set before himself as a mess of honor. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, lo, then Telemachus spoke to the son of Nestor,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />holding his head close to him, that the others might not hear:
“Son of Nestor, dear to this heart of mine, mark the flashing of bronze throughout the echoing halls, and the flashing of gold, of electrum,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> of silver, and of ivory. Of such sort, methinks, is the court of Olympian Zeus within,<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />such untold wealth is here; amazement holds me as I look.”
Now as he spoke fair-haired Menelaus heard him, and he spoke and addressed them with winged words:
“Dear children, with Zeus verily no mortal man could vie, for everlasting are his halls and his possessions;<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />but of men another might vie with me in wealth or haply might not. For of a truth after many woes and wide wanderings I brought my wealth home in my ships and came in the eighth year. Over <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName> I wandered, and <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, and I came to the Ethiopians and the Sidonians and the Erembi,<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />and to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, where the lambs are horned from their birth.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> For there the ewes bear their young thrice within the full course of the year; there neither master nor shepherd has any lack of cheese or of meat or of sweet milk, but the flocks ever yield milk to the milking the year through.<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />While I wandered in those lands gathering much livelihood, meanwhile another slew my brother by stealth and at unawares, by the guile of his accursed wife. Thus, thou mayest see, I have no joy in being lord of this wealth; and you may well have heard of this from your fathers, whosoever they<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />may be, for full much did I suffer, and let fall into ruin a stately house and one stored with much goodly treasure. Would that I dwelt in my halls with but a third part of this wealth, and that those men were safe who then perished in the broad land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> far from horse-pasturing <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />And yet, though I often sit in my halls weeping and sorrowing for them all—one moment indeed I ease my heart with weeping, and then again I cease, for men soon have surfeit of chill lament—yet for them all I mourn not so much, despite my grief,<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />as for one only, who makes me to loathe both sleep and food, when I think of him; for no one of the Achaeans toiled so much as Odysseus toiled and endured. But to himself, as it seems, his portion was to be but woe, and for me there is sorrow never to be forgotten for him, in that he is gone so long, nor do we know aught<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />whether he be alive or dead. Mourned is he, I ween, by the old man Laertes, and by constant Penelope, and by Telemachus, whom he left a new-born child in his house.”
So he spoke, and in Telemachus he roused the desire to weep for his father. Tears from his eyelids he let fall upon the ground, when he heard his father's name,<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />and with both hands held up his purple cloak before his eyes. And Menelaus noted him, and debated in mind and heart whether he should leave him to speak of his father himself, or whether he should first question him and prove him in each thing.
<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />While he pondered thus in mind and heart, forth then from her fragrant high-roofed chamber came Helen, like Artemis of the golden arrows;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and with her came Adraste, and placed for her a chair, beautifully wrought, and Alcippe brought a rug of soft wool<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />and Phylo a silver basket, which Alcandre had given her, the wife of Polybus, who dwelt in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, where greatest store of wealth is laid up in men's houses. He gave to Menelaus two silver baths and two tripods and ten talents of gold.<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />And besides these, his wife gave to Helen also beautiful gifts,—a golden distaff and a basket with wheels beneath did she give, a basket of silver, and with gold were the rims thereof gilded.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> This then the handmaid, Phylo, brought and placed beside her, filled with finely-spun yarn, and across it<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />was laid the distaff laden with violet-dark wool. So Helen sat down upon the chair, and below was a footstool for the feet; and at once she questioned her husband on each matter, and said:
“Do we know, Menelaus, fostered of Zeus, who these men declare themselves to be who have come to our house?<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />Shall I disguise my thought, or speak the truth? Nay, my heart bids me speak. For never yet, I declare, saw I one so like another, whether man or woman—amazement holds me, as I look—as this man is like the son of great-hearted Odysseus, even Telemachus, whom that warrior left a new-born child in his house, when for the sake of shameless me ye Achaeans came up under the walls of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, pondering in your hearts fierce war.”</p>

                <div2 n="147" type="card">
                    <p>
Then fair-haired Menelaus answered her: “Even so do I myself now note it, wife, as thou markest the likeness. Such were his feet, such his hands,<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />and the glances of his eyes, and his head and hair above. And verily but now, as I made mention of Odysseus and was telling of all the woe and toil he endured for my sake, this youth let fall a bitter tear from beneath his brows, holding up his purple cloak before his eyes.”
<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />Then Peisistratus, son of Nestor, answered him:“Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts, his son indeed this youth is, as thou sayest. But he is of prudent mind and feels shame at heart thus on his first coming to make a show of forward words<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />in the presence of thee, in whose voice we both take delight as in a god's. But the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key="perseus,Gerenia">Gerenia</placeName>, sent me forth to go with him as his guide, for he was eager to see thee, that thou mightest put in his heart some word or some deed. For many sorrows has a son<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />in his halls when his father is gone, when there are none other to be his helpers, even as it is now with Telemachus; his father is gone, and there are no others among the people who might ward off ruin.”
Then fair-haired Menelaus answered him and said: “Lo now, verily is there come to my house the son of a man well-beloved,<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />who for my sake endured many toils. And I thought that if he came back I should give him welcome beyond all the other Argives, if Olympian Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, had granted to us two a return in our swift ships over the sea. And in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> I would have given him a city to dwell in, and would have built him a house,<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />when I had brought him from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> with his goods and his son and all his people, driving out the dwellers of some one city among those that lie round about and obey me myself as their lord. Then, living here, should we ofttimes have met together, nor would aught have parted us, loving and joying in one another,<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />until the black cloud of death enfolded us. Howbeit of this, methinks, the god himself must have been jealous, who to that hapless man alone vouchsafed no return.”</p>

                <div2 n="183" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and in them all aroused the desire of lament. Argive Helen wept, the daughter of Zeus,<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />Telemachus wept, and Menelaus, son of Atreus, nor could the son of Nestor keep his eyes tearless. For he thought in his heart of peerless Antilochus, whom the glorious son of the bright Dawn<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> had slain. Thinking of him, he spoke winged words:
<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />“Son of Atreus, old Nestor used ever to say that thou wast wise above all men, whenever we made mention of thee in his halls and questioned one another. And now, if it may in any wise be, hearken to me, for I take no joy in weeping at supper time,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note>—and moreover<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />early dawn will soon be here.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">3</note> I count it indeed no blame to weep for any mortal who has died and met his fate. Yea, this is the only due we pay to miserable mortals, to cut the hair and let a tear fall from the cheeks. For a brother of mine, too, is dead, nowise the meanest<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />of the Argives, and thou mayest well have known him. As for me, I never met him nor saw him; but men say that Antilochus was above all others pre-eminent in speed of foot and as a warrior.”
Then fair-haired Menelaus answered him and said: “My friend, truly thou hast said all that a wise man<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />might say or do, even one that was older than thou; for from such a father art thou sprung, wherefore thou dost even speak wisely. Easily known is the seed of that man for whom the son of Cronos spins the thread of good fortune at marriage and at birth, even as now he has granted to Nestor throughout all his days continually that<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />he should himself reach a sleek old age in his halls, and that his sons in their turn should be wise and most valiant with the spear. But we will cease the weeping which but now was made, and let us once more think of our supper, and let them pour water over our hands. Tales there will be in the morning also<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />for Telemachus and me to tell to one another to the full.”
So he spoke, and Asphalion poured water over their hands, the busy squire of glorious Menelaus. And they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them.</p>

                <div2 n="219" type="card">

Then Helen, daughter of Zeus, took other counsel.<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />Straightway she cast into the wine of which they were drinking a drug to quiet all pain and strife, and bring forgetfulness of every ill. Whoso should drink this down, when it is mingled in the bowl, would not in the course of that day let a tear fall down over his cheeks,<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />no, not though his mother and father should lie there dead, or though before his face men should slay with the sword his brother or dear son, and his own eyes beheld it. Such cunning drugs had the daughter of Zeus, drugs of healing, which Polydamna, the wife of <placeName key="tgn,1130814">Thon</placeName>, had given her, a woman of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, for there the earth, the giver of grain, bears greatest store<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />of drugs, many that are healing when mixed, and many that are baneful; there every man is a physician, wise above human kind; for they are of the race of Paeeon. Now when she had cast in the drug, and had bidden pour forth the wine, again she made answer, and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />“Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, and ye that are here, sons of noble men—though now to one and now to another Zeus gives good and ill, for he can do all things,—now verily sit ye in the halls and feast, and take ye joy in telling tales, for I will tell what fitteth the time.<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />All things I cannot tell or recount, even all the labours of Odysseus of the steadfast heart; but what a thing was this which that mighty man wrought and endured in the land of the Trojans, where you Achaens suffered woes! Marring his own body with cruel blows,<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />and flinging a wretched garment about his shoulders, in the fashion of a slave he entered the broad-wayed city of the foe, and he hid himself under the likeness of another, a beggar, he who was in no wise such an one at the ships of the Achaeans. In this likeness he entered the city of the Trojans, and all of them were but as babes.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />I alone recognized him in this disguise, and questioned him, but he in his cunning sought to avoid me. Howbeit when I was bathing him and anointing him with oil, and had put on him raiment, and sworn a mighty oath not to make him known among the Trojans as Odysseus<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />before that he reached the swift ships and the huts, then at length he told me all the purpose of the Achaeans. And when he had slain many of the Trojans with the long sword, he returned to the company of the Argives and brought back plentiful tidings. Then the other Trojan women wailed aloud, but my soul<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />was glad, for already my heart was turned to go back to my home, and I groaned for the blindness that Aphrodite gave me, when she led me thither from my dear native land, forsaking my child and my bridal chamber, and my husband, a man who lacked nothing, whether in wisdom or in comeliness.”</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />Then fair-haired Menelaus answered her and said:“Aye verily, all this, wife, hast thou spoken aright. Ere now have I come to know the counsel and the mind of many warriors, and have travelled over the wide earth, but never yet have mine eyes beheld such an one<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />as was Odysseus of the steadfast heart. What a thing was this, too, which that mighty man wrought and endured in the carven horse, wherein all we chiefs of the Argives were sitting, bearing to the Trojans death and fate! Then thou camest thither, and it must be that thou wast bidden<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />by some god, who wished to grant glory to the Trojans, and godlike Deiphobus followed thee on thy way. Thrice didst thou go about the hollow ambush, trying it with thy touch, and thou didst name aloud the chieftains of the Danaans by their names, likening thy voice to the voices of the wives of all the Argives.<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />Now I and the son of Tydeus and goodly Odysseus sat there in the midst and heard how thou didst call, and we two were eager to rise up and come forth, or else to answer straightway from within, but Odysseus held us back and stayed us, despite our eagerness.<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />Then all the other sons of the Achaeans held their peace, but Anticlus alone was fain to speak and answer thee; but Odysseus firmly closed his mouth with strong hands, and saved all the Achaeans, and held him thus until Pallas Athena led thee away.”
<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts, all the more grievous is it; for in no wise did this ward off from him woeful destruction, nay, not though the heart within him had been of iron. But come, send us to bed, that lulled now<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />by sweet sleep we may rest and take our joy.”
Thus he spoke, and Argive Helen bade her handmaids place bedsteads beneath the portico, and to lay on them fair purple blankets, and to spread there over coverlets, and on these to put fleecy cloaks for clothing.<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />But the maids went forth from the hall with torches in their hands and strewed the couch, and a herald led forth the guests. So they slept there in the fore-hall of the palace, the prince Telemachus and the glorious son of Nestor; but the son of Atreus slept in the inmost chamber of the lofty house,<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />and beside him lay long-robed Helen, peerless among women.
So soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, up from his bed arose Menelaus, good at the war-cry, and put on his clothing. About his shoulders he slung his sharp sword, and beneath his shining feet bound his fair sandals,<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />and went forth from his chamber like unto a god to look upon. Then he sat down beside Telemachus, and spoke, and addressed him:
“What need has brought thee hither, prince Telemachus, to goodly <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> over the broad back of the sea? Is it a public matter, or thine own? Tell me the truth of this.”</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts, I came if haply thou mightest tell me some tidings of my father. My home is being devoured and my rich lands are ruined; with men that are foes my house is filled, who are ever<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />slaying my thronging sheep and my sleek kine of shambling gait, even the wooers of my mother, overweening in their insolence. Therefore am I now come to thy knees, if perchance thou wilt be willing to tell me of his woeful death, whether thou sawest it haply with thine own eyes, or didst hear from some other the story<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />of his wanderings; for beyond all men did his mother bear him to sorrow. And do thou no wise out of ruth or pity for me speak soothing words, but tell me truly how thou didst come to behold him. I beseech thee, if ever my father, noble Odysseus, promised aught to thee of word or deed and fulfilled it<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />in the land of the Trojans, where you Achaeans suffered woes, be mindful of it now, I pray thee, and tell me the truth.”
Then, stirred to sore displeasure, fair-haired Menelaus spoke to him: “Out upon them, for verily in the bed of a man of valiant heart were they fain to lie, who are themselves cravens.<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />Even as when in the thicket-lair of a mighty lion a hind has laid to sleep her new-born suckling fawns, and roams over the mountain slopes and grassy vales seeking pasture, and then the lion comes to his lair and upon the two<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> lets loose a cruel doom,<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />so will Odysseus let loose a cruel doom upon these men. I would, O father Zeus and Athena and Apollo, that in such strength as when once in fair-stablished <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName> he rose up and wrestled a match with Philomeleides and threw him mightily, and all the Achaeans rejoiced,<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />even in such strength Odysseus might come among the wooers; then should they all find swift destruction and bitterness in their wooing. But in this matter of which thou dost ask and beseech me, verily I will not swerve aside to speak of other things, nor will I deceive thee; but of all that the unerring old man of the sea told me<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" /> not one thing will I hide from thee or conceal.</p>

And when he is come forth, he lies down to sleep in the hollow caves; and around him the seals, the brood of the fair daughter of the sea,<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />sleep in a herd, coming forth from the gray water, and bitter is the smell they breathe of the depths of the sea.

“So I spoke, and he straightway made answer, and said: ‘Nay, surely thou oughtest to have made fair offerings to Zeus and the other gods before embarking, that with greatest speed thou mightest have come to thy country, sailing over the wine-dark sea.<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line" />For it is not thy fate to see thy friends, and reach thy well-built house and thy native land, before that thou hast once more gone to the waters of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Aegyptus</placeName>, the heaven-fed river, and hast offered holy hecatombs to the immortal gods who hold broad heaven.<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line" />Then at length shall the gods grant thee the journey thou desirest.’</p>

“So he spoke, and my spirit was broken within me, for that he bade me go again over the misty deep to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Aegyptus</placeName>, a long and weary way. Yet even so I made answer, and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line" />“‘All this will I perform, old man, even as thou dost bid. But come now, tell me this, and declare it truly. Did all the Achaeans return unscathed in their ships, all those whom Nestor and I left, as we set out from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>? Or did any perish by a cruel death on board his ship,<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line" />or in the arms of his friends, when he had wound up the skein of war?’
“So I spoke, and he straightway made answer, and said: ‘Son of Atreus, why dost thou question me of this? In no wise does it behove thee to know, or to learn my mind; nor, methinks, wilt thou long be free from tears, when thou hast heard all aright.<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line" />For many of them were slain, and many were left; but two chieftains alone of the brazen-coated Achaeans perished on their homeward way ( as for the fighting, thou thyself wast there), and one, I ween, still lives, and is held back on the broad deep.
“‘Aias truly was lost amid his long-oared ships.<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line" />Upon the great rocks of Gyrae Poseidon at first drove him, but saved him from the sea; and he would have escaped his doom, hated of Athena though he was, had he not uttered a boastful word in great blindness of heart. He declared that it was in spite of the gods that he had escaped the great gulf of the sea;<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line" />and Poseidon heard his boastful speech, and straightway took his trident in his mighty hands, and smote the rock of Gyrae and clove it in sunder. And one part abode in its place, but the sundered part fell into the sea, even that on which Aias sat at the first when his heart was greatly blinded,<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line" />and it bore him down into the boundless surging deep. So there he perished, when he had drunk the salt water.</p>

“‘But thy brother escaped, indeed, the fates and shunned them with his hollow ships, for queenly Hera saved him. But when he was now about<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line" />to reach the steep height of Malea, then the storm-wind caught him up and bore him over the teeming deep, groaning heavily, to the border of the land,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> where aforetime Thyestes dwelt, but where now dwelt Thyestes' son Aegisthus. But when from hence too a safe return was shewed him,<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line" />and the gods changed the course of the wind that it blew fair, and they reached home, then verily with rejoicing did Agamemnon set foot on his native land, and he clasped his land and kissed it, and many were the hot tears that streamed from his eyes, for welcome to him was the sight of his land. Now from his place of watch a watchman saw him, whom<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line" />guileful Aegisthus took and set there, promising him as a reward two talents of gold; and he had been keeping guard for a year, lest Agamemnon should pass by him unseen, and be mindful of his furious might. So he went to the palace to bear the tidings to the shepherd of the people, and Aegisthus straightway planned a treacherous device.<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line" />He chose out twenty men, the best in the land, and set them to lie in wait, but on the further side of the hall he bade prepare a feast. Then he went with chariot and horses to summon Agamemnon, shepherd of the people, his mind pondering a dastardly deed. So he brought him up all unaware of his doom,<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line" />and when he had feasted him he slew him, as one slays an ox at the stall. And not one of the comrades of the son of Atreus was left, of all that followed him, nor one of the men of Aegisthus, but they were all slain in the halls.’
“So he spoke, and my spirit was broken within me, and I wept, as I sat on the sands, nor had my heart<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line" />any longer desire to live and to behold the light of the sun. But when I had had my fill of weeping and writhing, then the unerring old man of the sea said to me:
“‘No more, son of Atreus, do thou weep long time thus without ceasing, for in it we shall find no help. Nay, rather, with all the speed thou canst,<milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line" />strive that thou mayest come to thy native land, for either thou wilt find Aegisthus alive, or haply Orestes may have forestalled thee and slain him, and thou mayest chance upon his funeral feast.’
“So he spoke, and my heart and spirit were again warmed with comfort in my breast despite my grief,<milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line" />and I spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
“‘Of these men now I know, but do thou name the third, who he is that still lives, and is held back upon the broad sea, or is haply dead. Fain would I hear, despite my grief.’</p>

                    <p>
“So I spoke, and he straightway made answer, and said:<milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line" />‘It is the son of Laertes, whose home is in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. Him I saw in an island, shedding big tears, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who keeps him there perforce, and he cannot come to his native land, for he has at hand no ships with oars and no comrades<milestone ed="p" n="560" unit="line" />to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea. But for thyself, Menelaus, fostered of Zeus, it is not ordained that thou shouldst die and meet thy fate in horse-pasturing <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, but to the Elysian plain and the bounds of the earth will the immortals convey thee, where dwells fair-haired Rhadamanthus,<milestone ed="p" n="565" unit="line" />and where life is easiest for men. No snow is there, nor heavy storm, nor ever rain, but ever does Ocean send up blasts of the shrill-blowing West Wind that they may give cooling to men; for thou hast Helen to wife, and art in their eyes the husband of the daughter of Zeus.’
<milestone ed="p" n="570" unit="line" />“So saying he plunged beneath the surging sea, but I went to my ships with my god like comrades, and many things did my heart darkly ponder as I went. But when I had come down to the ship and to the sea, and we had made ready our supper, and immortal night had come on,<milestone ed="p" n="575" unit="line" />then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea. And as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, our ships first of all we drew down to the bright sea, and set the masts and the sails in the shapely ships, and the men, too, went on board and sat down upon the benches,<milestone ed="p" n="580" unit="line" />and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars. So back again to the waters of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Aegyptus</placeName>, the heaven-fed river, I sailed, and there moored my ships and offered hecatombs that bring fulfillment. But when I had stayed the wrath of the gods that are forever, I heaped up a mound to Agamemnon, that his fame might be unquenchable.<milestone ed="p" n="585" unit="line" />Then, when I had made an end of this, I set out for home, and the immortals gave me a fair wind, and brought me swiftly to my dear native land. But come now, tarry in my halls until the eleventh or the twelfth day be come. Then will I send thee forth with honor and give thee splendid gifts,<milestone ed="p" n="590" unit="line" />three horses and a well-polished car; and besides I will give thee a beautiful cup, that thou mayest pour libations to the immortal gods, and remember me all thy days.”</p>

                <div2 n="593" type="card">
                    <p>
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Son of Atreus, keep me no long time here,<milestone ed="p" n="595" unit="line" />for verily for a year would I be content to sit in thy house, nor would desire for home or parents come upon me; for wondrous is the pleasure I take in listening to thy tales and thy speech. But even now my comrades are chafing in sacred <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, and thou art keeping me long time here.<milestone ed="p" n="600" unit="line" />And whatsoever gift thou wouldest give me, let it be some treasure; but horses will I not take to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, but will leave them here for thyself to delight in, for thou art lord of a wide plain, wherein is lotus in abundance, and galingale and wheat and spelt, and broad-eared white barley.<milestone ed="p" n="605" unit="line" />But in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> there are no widespread courses nor aught of meadow-land. It is a pasture-land of goats and pleasanter than one that pastures horses. For not one of the islands that lean upon the sea is fit for driving horses, or rich in meadows, and <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> least of all.”
So he spoke, and Menelaus, good at the war-cry, smiled,<milestone ed="p" n="610" unit="line" />and stroked him with his hand, and spoke, and addressed him:
“Thou art of noble blood, dear child, that thou speakest thus. Therefore will I change these gifts, for well I may. Of all the gifts that lie stored as treasures in my house, I will give thee that one which is fairest and costliest.<milestone ed="p" n="615" unit="line" />I will give thee a well-wrought mixing bowl. All of silver it is, and with gold are the rims thereof gilded, the work of Hephaestus; and the warrior Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me, when his house sheltered me as I came thither, and now I am minded to give it to thee.”
<milestone ed="p" n="620" unit="line" />Thus they spoke to one another, and meanwhile the banqueters came to the palace of the divine king. They drove up sheep, and brought strengthening wine, and their wives with beautiful veils sent them bread. Thus they were busied about the feast in the halls.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="625" unit="line" />But the wooers in front of the palace of Odysseus were making merry, throwing the discus and the javelin in a levelled place, as their wont was, in insolence of heart; and Antinous and godlike Eurymachus were sitting there, the leaders of the wooers, who in valiance were far the best of all.<milestone ed="p" n="630" unit="line" />To them Noemon, son of Phronius, drew near, and he questioned Antinous, and spoke, and said:
“Antinous, know we at all in our hearts, or know we not, when Telemachus will return from sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>? He is gone, taking a ship of mine, and I have need of her<milestone ed="p" n="635" unit="line" />to cross over to spacious <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, where I have twelve brood mares, and at the teat sturdy mules as yet unbroken. Of these I would fain drive one off and break him in.”
So he spoke, and they marvelled at heart, for they did not deem that Telemachus had gone to Neleian Pylos, but that he was somewhere there<milestone ed="p" n="640" unit="line" />on his lands, among the flocks or with the swineherd.
Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke to him, saying: “Tell me the truth; when did he go, and what youths went with him? Were they chosen youths of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, or hirelings and slaves of his own? Able would he be to accomplish even that.<milestone ed="p" n="645" unit="line" />And tell me this truly, that I may know full well. Was it perforce and against thy will that he took from thee the black ship? or didst thou give it him freely of thine own will, because he besought thee?”
Then Noemon, son of Phronius, answered him:“I myself freely gave it him. What else could any man do,<milestone ed="p" n="650" unit="line" />when a man like him, his heart laden with care, makes entreaty? Hard it were to deny the gift. The youths that are the noblest in the land after ourselves, even these have gone with him; and among them I noted one going on board as their leader, Mentor, or a god, who was in all things like unto Mentor.<milestone ed="p" n="655" unit="line" />But at this I marvel. I saw goodly Mentor here yesterday at early dawn; but at that time he embarked for <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>.”
So saying he departed to his father's house, but of those two the proud hearts were angered. The wooers they straightway made to sit down and cease from their games;<milestone ed="p" n="660" unit="line" />and among them spoke Antinous, son of Eupeithes, in displeasure; and with rage was his black heart wholly filled, and his eyes were like blazing fire.
“Out upon him, verily a proud deed has been insolently brought to pass by Telemachus, even this journey, and we deemed that he would never see it accomplished.<milestone ed="p" n="665" unit="line" />Forth in despite of all of us here the lad is gone without more ado, launching a ship, and choosing the best men in the land. He will begin by and by to be our bane; but to his own undoing may Zeus destroy his might before ever he reaches the measure of manhood. But come, give me a swift ship and twenty men,<milestone ed="p" n="670" unit="line" />that I may watch in ambush for him as he passes in the strait between <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> and rugged <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>. Thus shall his voyaging in search of his father come to a sorry end.”
So he spoke, and they all praised his words, and bade him act. And straightway they rose up and went to the house of Odysseus.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="675" unit="line" />Now Penelope was no long time without knowledge of the plans which the wooers were plotting in the deep of their hearts; for the herald Medon told her, who heard their counsel as he stood without the court and they within were weaving their plot. So he went through the hall to bear the tidings to Penelope;<milestone ed="p" n="680" unit="line" />and as he stepped across the threshold Penelope spoke to him and said:
“Herald, why have the lordly wooers sent thee forth? Was it to tell the handmaids of divine Odysseus to cease from their tasks, and make ready a feast for them? Never wooing<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> any more, nor consorting together elsewhere,<milestone ed="p" n="685" unit="line" />may they now feast here their latest and their last—even ye who are ever thronging here and wasting much livelihood, the wealth of wise Telemachus. Surely ye hearkened not at all in olden days, when ye were children, when your fathers told what manner of man Odysseus was among them that begat you,<milestone ed="p" n="690" unit="line" />in that he wrought no wrong in deed or word to any man in the land, as the wont is of divine kings—one man they hate and another they love. Yet he never wrought iniquity at all to any man. But your mind and your unseemly deeds<milestone ed="p" n="695" unit="line" />are plain to see, nor is there in after days any gratitude for good deeds done.”
Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: “I would, O queen, that this were the greatest evil. But another greater far and more grievous are the wooers planning, which I pray that the son of Cronos may never bring to pass.<milestone ed="p" n="700" unit="line" />They are minded to slay Telemachus with the sharp sword on his homeward way; for he went in quest of tidings of his father to sacred <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> and to goodly <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>.”
So he spoke, and her knees were loosened where she sat, and her heart melted. Long time she was speechless, and both her eyes<milestone ed="p" n="705" unit="line" />were filled with tears, and the flow of her voice was checked. But at last she made answer, and said to him:
“Herald, why is my son gone? He had no need to go on board swift-faring ships, which serve men as horses of the deep, and cross over the wide waters of the sea.<milestone ed="p" n="710" unit="line" />Was it that not even his name should be left among men?”
Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: “I know not whether some god impelled him, or whether his own heart was moved to go to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, that he might learn either of his father's return or what fate he had met.”</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="715" unit="line" />So he spoke, and departed through the house of Odysseus, and on her fell a cloud of soul-consuming grief, and she had no more the heart to sit upon one of the many seats that were in the room, but down upon the threshold of her fair-wrought chamber she sank, moaning piteously, and round about her wailed her handmaids,<milestone ed="p" n="720" unit="line" />even all that were in the house, both young and old. Among these with sobs of lamentation spoke Penelope:
“Hear me, my friends, for to me the Olympian has given sorrow above all the women who were bred and born with me. For long since I lost my noble husband of the lion heart,<milestone ed="p" n="725" unit="line" />pre-eminent in all manner of worth among the Danaans, my noble husband, whose fame is wide through <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> and mid-<placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>. And now again my well-loved son have the storm-winds swept away from our halls without tidings, nor did I hear of his setting forth. Cruel, that ye are! Not even you took thought, any one of you,<milestone ed="p" n="730" unit="line" />to rouse me from my couch, though in your hearts ye knew full well when he went on board the hollow black ship. For had I learned that he was pondering this journey, he should verily have stayed here, how eager soever to be gone, or he should have left me dead in the halls.<milestone ed="p" n="735" unit="line" />But now let one hasten to call hither the aged Dolius, my servant, whom my father gave me or ever I came hither, and who keeps my garden of many trees, that he may straightway go and sit by Laertes, and tell him of all these things. So haply may Laertes weave some plan in his heart,<milestone ed="p" n="740" unit="line" />and go forth and with weeping make his plea to the people, who are minded to destroy his race and that of godlike Odysseus.”
Then the good nurse Eurycleia answered her:“Dear lady, thou mayest verily slay me with the pitiless sword or let me abide in the house, yet will I not hide my word from thee.<milestone ed="p" n="745" unit="line" />I knew all this, and gave him whatever he bade me, bread and sweet wine. But he took from me a mighty oath not to tell thee until at least the twelfth day should come, or thou shouldst thyself miss him and hear that he was gone, that thou mightest not mar thy fair flesh with weeping.<milestone ed="p" n="750" unit="line" />But now bathe thyself, and take clean raiment for thy body, and then go up to thy upper chamber with thy handmaids and pray to Athena, the daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis; for she may then save him even from death. And trouble not a troubled old man; for<milestone ed="p" n="755" unit="line" />the race of the son of Arceisius is not, methinks, utterly hated by the blessed gods, but there shall still be one, I ween, to hold the high-roofed halls and the rich fields far away.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="758" type="card">
                    <p>
So she spoke, and lulled Penelope's laments, and made her eyes to cease from weeping. She then bathed, and took clean raiment for her body,<milestone ed="p" n="760" unit="line" />and went up to her upper chamber with her handmaids, and placing barley grains in a basket prayed to Athena:
“Hear me, child of Zeus who bears the aegis, unwearied one. If ever Odysseus, of many wiles, burnt to thee in his halls fat thigh-pieces of heifer or ewe,<milestone ed="p" n="765" unit="line" />remember these things now, I pray thee, and save my dear son, and ward off from him the wooers in their evil insolence.”
So saying she raised the sacred cry, and the goddess heard her prayer. But the wooers broke into uproar throughout the shadowy halls, and thus would one of the proud youths speak:
<milestone ed="p" n="770" unit="line" />“Aye, verily the queen, wooed of many, is preparing our marriage, nor does she know at all that death has been made ready for her son.”
So would one of them speak; but they knew not how these things were to be. And Antinous addressed their company, and said:
“Good sirs,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> shun haughty speech<milestone ed="p" n="775" unit="line" />of every kind alike, lest someone report your speech even within the house. Nay come, in silence thus let us arise and put into effect our plan which pleased us one and all at heart.”
So he spoke, and chose twenty men that were best, and they went their way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea.<milestone ed="p" n="780" unit="line" />The ship first of all they drew down to the deep water, and set the mast and sail in the black ship, and fitted the oars in the leathern thole-straps, all in due order, and spread the white sail. And proud squires brought them their weapons.<milestone ed="p" n="785" unit="line" />Well out in the roadstead they moored the ship, and themselves disembarked. There then they took supper, and waited till evening should come.
But she, the wise Penelope, lay there in her upper chamber, touching no food, tasting neither meat nor drink, pondering whether her peerless son would escape death,<milestone ed="p" n="790" unit="line" />or be slain by the insolent wooers. And even as a lion is seized with fear and broods amid a throng of men, when they draw their crafty ring about him, so was she pondering when sweet<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> sleep came upon her. And she sank back and slept, and all her joints relaxed.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="795" unit="line" />Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. She made a phantom, and likened it in form to a woman, Iphthime, daughter of great-hearted Icarius, whom Eumelus wedded, whose home was in Pherae. And she sent it to the house of divine Odysseus,<milestone ed="p" n="800" unit="line" />to Penelope in the midst of her wailing and lamenting, to bid her cease from weeping and tearful lamentation. So into the chamber it passed by the thong of the bolt, and stood above her head, and spoke to her, and said:
“Sleepest thou, Penelope, thy heart sore stricken?<milestone ed="p" n="805" unit="line" />Nay, the gods that live at ease suffer thee not to weep or be distressed, seeing that thy son is yet to return; for in no wise is he a sinner in the eyes of the gods.”
Then wise Penelope answered her, as she slumbered very sweetly at the gates of dreams:<milestone ed="p" n="810" unit="line" />“Why, sister, art thou come hither? Thou hast not heretofore been wont to come, for thou dwellest in a home far away. And thou biddest me cease from my grief and the many pains that distress me in mind and heart. Long since I lost my noble husband of the lion heart,<milestone ed="p" n="815" unit="line" />pre-eminent in all manner of worth among the Danaans, my noble husband whose fame is wide in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> and mid-<placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>. And now again my well-loved son is gone forth in a hollow ship, a mere child, knowing naught of toils and the gatherings of men. For him I sorrow even more than for that other,<milestone ed="p" n="820" unit="line" />and tremble for him, and fear lest aught befall him, whether it be in the land of the men to whom he is gone, or on the sea. For many foes are plotting against him, eager to slay him before he comes back to his native land.”
Then the dim phantom answered her, and said:<milestone ed="p" n="825" unit="line" />“Take heart, and be not in thy mind too sore afraid; since such a guide goes with him as men have full often besought to stand by their side, for she has power,—even Pallas Athena. And she pities thee in thy sorrow, for she it is that has sent me forth to tell thee this.”
<milestone ed="p" n="830" unit="line" />Then again wise Penelope answered her: “If thou art indeed a god, and hast listened to the voice of a god, come, tell me, I pray thee, also of that hapless one, whether he still lives and beholds the light of the sun, or whether he is already dead and in the house of Hades.”
<milestone ed="p" n="835" unit="line" />And the dim phantom answered her, and said:“Nay, of him I may not speak at length, whether he be alive or dead; it is an ill thing to speak words vain as wind.”
So saying the phantom glided away by the bolt of the door into the breath of the winds. And<milestone ed="p" n="840" unit="line" />the daughter of Icarius started up from sleep, and her heart was warmed with comfort, that so clear a vision had sped to her in the darkness<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> of night.
But the wooers embarked, and sailed over the watery ways, pondering in their hearts utter murder for Telemachus.

                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />Now Dawn arose from her couch from beside lordly Tithonus, to bear light to the immortals and to mortal men. And the gods were sitting down to council, and among them Zeus, who thunders on high, whose might is supreme.<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />To them Athena was recounting the many woes of Odysseus, as she called them to mind; for it troubled her that he abode in the dwelling of the nymph:
“Father Zeus, and ye other blessed gods that are forever, never henceforward let sceptred king with a ready heart be kind and gentle, nor let him heed righteousness in his mind;<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />but let him ever be harsh, and work unrighteousness, seeing that no one remembers divine Odysseus of the people whose lord he was; yet gentle was he as a father. He verily abides in an island suffering grievous pains, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />keeps him perforce; and he cannot return to his own land, for he has at hand no ships with oars and no comrades to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea. And now again they are minded to slay his well-loved son on his homeward way; for he went in quest of tidings of his father<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />to sacred <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> and to goodly <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>.”
Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her, and said: “My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth! Didst thou not thyself devise this plan, that verily Odysseus might take vengeance on these men at his coming?<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />But concerning Telemachus, do thou guide him in thy wisdom, for thou canst, that all unscathed he may reach his native land, and the wooers may come back in their ship baffled in their purpose.”
He spoke, and said to Hermes, his dear son:“Hermes, do thou now, seeing that thou art at other times our messenger,<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />declare to the fair-tressed nymph our fixed resolve, even the return of Odysseus of the steadfast heart, that he may return with guidance neither of gods nor of mortal men, but that on a stoutly-bound raft, suffering woes, he may come on the twentieth day to deep-soiled <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Scheria</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the gods. These shall heartily shew him all honor, as if he were a god, and shall send him in a ship to his dear native land, after giving him stores of bronze and gold and raiment, more than Odysseus would ever have won for himself from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />if he had returned unscathed with his due share of the spoil. For in this wise it is his fate to see his friends, and reach his high-roofed house and his native land.”
So he spoke, and the messenger, Argeiphontes, failed not to hearken. Straightway he bound beneath his feet his beautiful sandals,<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />immortal, golden, which were wont to bear him over the waters of the sea and over the boundless land swift as the blasts of the wind. And he took the wand wherewith he lulls to sleep the eyes of whom he will, while others again he awakens even out of slumber. With this in his hand the strong Argeiphontes flew.</p>

                <div2 n="50" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />On to <placeName key="tgn,7002729">Pieria</placeName> he stepped from the upper air, and swooped down upon the sea, and then sped over the wave like a bird, the cormorant, which in quest of fish over the dread gulfs of the unresting sea wets its thick plumage in the brine. In such wise did Hermes ride upon the multitudinous waves.<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />But when he had reached the island which lay afar, then forth from the violet sea he came to land, and went his way until he came to a great cave, wherein dwelt the fair-tressed nymph; and he found her within. A great fire was burning on the hearth, and from afar over the isle there was a fragrance<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />of cleft cedar and juniper, as they burned; but she within was singing with a sweet voice as she went to and fro before the loom, weaving with a golden shuttle. Round about the cave grew a luxuriant wood, alder and poplar and sweet-smelling cypress,<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />wherein birds long of wing were wont to nest, owls and falcons and sea-crows with chattering tongues, who ply their business on the sea. And right there about the hollow cave ran trailing a garden vine, in pride of its prime, richly laden with clusters.<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />And fountains four in a row were flowing with bright water hard by one another, turned one this way, one that. And round about soft meadows of violets and parsley were blooming. There even an immortal, who chanced to come, might gaze and marvel, and delight his soul;<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />and there the messenger Argeiphontes stood and marvelled. But when he had marvelled in his heart at all things, straightway he went into the wide cave; nor did Calypso, the beautiful goddess, fail to know him, when she saw him face to face; for not unknown are<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />the immortal gods to one another, even though one dwells in a home far away. But the great-hearted Odysseus he found not within; for he sat weeping on the shore, as his wont had been, racking his soul with tears and groans and griefs, and he would look over the unresting sea, shedding tears.<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />And Calypso, the beautiful goddess, questioned Hermes, when she had made him sit on a bright shining chair:
“Why, pray, Hermes of the golden wand, hast thou come, an honorable guest and welcome? heretofore thou hast not been wont to come. Speak what is in thy mind; my heart bids me fulfil it,<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />if fulfil it I can, and it is a thing that hath fulfillment. But follow me further, that I may set before thee entertainment.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="92" type="card">
                    <p>
So saying, the goddess set before him a table laden with ambrosia, and mixed the ruddy nectar. So he drank and ate, the messenger Argeiphontes.<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />But when he had dined and satisfied his soul with food, then he made answer, and addressed her, saying:
“Thou, a goddess, dost question me, a god, upon my coming, and I will speak my word truly, since thou biddest me. It was Zeus who bade me come hither against my will.<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />Who of his own will would speed over so great space of salt sea-water, great past telling? Nor is there at hand any city of mortals who offer to the gods sacrifice and choice hecatombs. But it is in no wise possible for any other god to evade or make void the will of Zeus, who bears the aegis.<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />He says that there is here with thee a man most wretched above all those warriors who around the city of Priam fought for nine years, and in the tenth year sacked the city and departed homeward. But on the way they sinned against Athena, and she sent upon them an evil wind and long waves.<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />There all the rest of his goodly comrades perished, but as for him, the wind and the wave, as they bore him, brought him hither. Him now Zeus bids thee to send on his way with all speed, for it is not his fate to perish here far from his friends, but it is still his lot to see his friends and reach<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />his high-roofed house and his native land.”
So he spoke, and Calypso, the beautiful goddess, shuddered, and she spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “Cruel are ye, O ye gods, and quick to envy above all others, seeing that ye begrudge goddesses that they should mate with men<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />openly, if any takes a mortal as her dear bed-fellow. Thus, when rosy-fingered Dawn took to herself Orion, ye gods that live at ease begrudged her, till in Ortygia chaste Artemis of the golden throne assailed him with her gentle<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> shafts and slew him.<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />Thus too, when fair-tressed Demeter, yielding to her passion, lay in love with Iasion in the thrice-ploughed fallow land, Zeus was not long without knowledge thereof, but smote him with his bright thunder-bolt and slew him. And even so again do ye now begrudge me, O ye gods, that a mortal man should abide with me.<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />Him I saved when he was bestriding the keel and all alone, for Zeus had smitten his swift ship with his bright thunder-bolt, and had shattered<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> it in the midst of the wine-dark sea. There all the rest of his goodly comrades perished, but as for him, the wind and the wave, as they bore him, brought him hither.<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />Him I welcomed kindly and gave him food, and said that I would make him immortal and ageless all his days. But since it is in no wise possible for any other god to evade or make void the will of Zeus who bears the aegis, let him go his way, if Zeus thus orders and commands,<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />over the unresting sea. But it is not I that shall give him convoy, for I have at hand no ships with oars and no men to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea. But with a ready heart will I give him counsel, and will hide naught, that all unscathed he may return to his native land.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="145" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />Then again the messenger Argeiphontes answered her: “Even so send him forth now, and beware of the wrath of Zeus, lest haply he wax wroth and visit his anger upon thee hereafter.”
So saying, the strong Argeiphontes departed, and the queenly nymph went to the great-hearted Odysseus,<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />when she had heard the message of Zeus. Him she found sitting on the shore, and his eyes were never dry of tears, and his sweet life was ebbing away, as he longed mournfully for his return, for the nymph was no longer pleasing in his sight. By night indeed he would sleep by her side perforce<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />in the hollow caves, unwilling beside the willing nymph, but by day he would sit on the rocks and the sands, racking his soul with tears and groans and griefs, and he would look over the unresting sea, shedding tears. Then coming close to him, the beautiful goddess addressed him:
<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />“Unhappy man, sorrow no longer here, I pray thee, nor let thy life pine away; for even now with a ready heart will I send thee on thy way. Nay, come, hew with the axe long beams, and make a broad raft, and fasten upon it cross-planks for a deck well above it, that it may bear thee over the misty deep.<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />And I will place therein bread and water and red wine to satisfy thy heart, to keep hunger from thee. And I will clothe thee with raiment, and will send a fair wind behind thee, that all unscathed thou mayest return to thy native land, if it be the will of the gods who hold broad heaven;<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />for they are mightier than I both to purpose and to fulfil.”
So she spoke, and much-enduring goodly Odysseus shuddered, and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words: “Some other thing, goddess, art thou planning in this, and not my sending, seeing that thou biddest me cross on a raft the great gulf of the sea,<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />dread and grievous, over which not even the shapely, swift-faring ships pass, rejoicing in the wind of Zeus. But I will not set foot on a raft in thy despite, unless thou, goddess, wilt bring thyself to swear a mighty oath that thou wilt not plot against me any fresh mischief to my hurt.”
<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />So he spoke, but Calypso, the beautiful goddess, smiled, and stroked him with her hand, and spoke, and addressed him: “Verily thou art a knave, and not stunted in wit, that thou hast bethought thee to utter such a word. Now therefore let earth be witness to this, and the broad heaven above,<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />and the down-flowing water of the Styx, which is the greatest and most dread oath for the blessed gods, that I will not plot against thee any fresh mischief to thy hurt. Nay, I have such thoughts in mind, and will give such counsel, as I should devise for mine own self, if such need should come on me.<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />For I too have a mind that is righteous, and the heart in this breast of mine is not of iron, but hath compassion.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="192" type="card">
                    <p>
So saying, the beautiful goddess led the way quickly, and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess. And they came to the hollow cave, the goddess and the man,<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />and he sat down upon the chair from which Hermes had arisen, and the nymph set before him all manner of food to eat and drink, of such sort as mortal men eat. But she herself sat over against divine Odysseus, and before her the handmaids set ambrosia and nectar.<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But when they had their fill of food and drink, Calypso, the beautiful goddess, was the first to speak, and said:
“Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices,<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />would'st thou then fare now forthwith home to thy dear native land! Yet, even so fare thee well. Howbeit if in thy heart thou knewest all the measure of woe it is thy fate to fulfil before thou comest to thy native land thou wouldest abide here and keep this house with me, and wouldest be immortal, for all thy desire to see<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />thy wife for whom thou longest day by day. Surely not inferior to her do I declare myself to be either in form or stature, for in no wise is it seemly that mortal women should vie with immortals in form or comeliness.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said:<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />“Mighty goddess, be not wroth with me for this. I know full well of myself that wise Penelope is meaner to look upon than thou in comeliness and in stature, for she is a mortal, while thou art immortal and ageless. But even so I wish and long day by day<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />to reach my home, and to see the day of my return. And if again some god shall smite me on the wine-dark sea, I will endure it, having in my breast a heart that endures affliction. For ere this I have suffered much and toiled much amid the waves and in war; let this also be added unto that.”
<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />So he spoke, and the sun set and darkness came on. And the two went into the innermost recess of the hollow cave, and took their joy of love, abiding each by the other's side.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="228" type="card">
                    <p>
As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, straightway Odysseus put on a cloak and a tunic,<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />and the nymph clothed herself in a long white robe, finely woven and beautiful, and about her waist she cast a fair girdle of gold, and on her head a veil above. Then she set herself to plan the sending of the great-hearted Odysseus. She gave him a great axe, well fitted to his hands,<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />an axe of bronze, sharpened on both sides; and in it was a beautiful handle of olive wood, securely fastened; and thereafter she gave him a polished adze. Then she led the way to the borders of the island where tall trees were standing, alder and popular and fir, reaching to the skies,<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />long dry and well-seasoned, which would float for him lightly. But when she had shewn him where the tall trees grew, Calypso, the beautiful goddess, returned homewards, but he fell to cutting timbers, and his work went forward apace. Twenty trees in all did he fell, and trimmed them with the axe;<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />then he cunningly smoothed them all and made them straight to the line. Meanwhile Calypso, the beautiful goddess, brought him augers; and he bored all the pieces and fitted them to one another, and with pegs and morticings did he hammer it together. Wide as a man well-skilled in carpentry marks out the curve of the hull of a freight-ship,<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />broad of beam, even so wide did Odysseus make his raft. And he set up the deck-beams, bolting them to the close-set ribs, and laboured on; and he finished the raft with long gunwales. In it he set a mast and a yard-arm, fitted to it,<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />and furthermore made him a steering-oar, wherewith to steer. Then he fenced in the whole from stem to stern with willow withes to be a defence against the wave, and strewed much brush thereon.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> Meanwhile Calypso, the beautiful goddess, brought him cloth to make him a sail, and he fashioned that too with skill.<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />And he made fast in the raft braces and halyards and sheets, and then with levers<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> forced it down into the bright sea.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="262" type="card">
                    <p>
Now the fourth day came and all his work was done. And on the fifth the beautiful Calypso sent him on his way from the island after she had bathed him and clothed him in fragrant raiment.<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />On the raft the goddess put a skin of dark wine, and another, a great one, of water, and provisions, too, in a wallet. Therein she put abundance of dainties to satisfy his heart, and she sent forth a gentle wind and warm. Gladly then did goodly Odysseus spread his sail to the breeze;<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />and he sat and guided his raft skilfully with the steering-oar, nor did sleep fall upon his eyelids, as he watched the Pleiads, and late-setting Bootes, and the Bear, which men also call the Wain, which ever circles where it is and watches Orion,<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />and alone has no part in the baths of Ocean. For this star Calypso, the beautiful goddess, had bidden him to keep on the left hand as he sailed over the sea. For seventeen days then he sailed over the sea, and on the eighteenth appeared the shadowy mountains<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />of the land of the Phaeacians, where it lay nearest to him; and it shewed like unto a shield in the misty deep.
But the glorious Earth-shaker, as he came back from the Ethiopians,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> beheld him from afar, from the mountains of the Solymi: for Odysseus was seen of him sailing over the sea; and he waxed the more wroth in spirit,<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />and shook his head, and thus he spoke to his own heart:
“Out on it! Surely the gods have changed their purpose regarding Odysseus, while I was among the Ethiopians. And lo, he is near to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is his fate to escape from the great bonds of the woe which has come upon him.<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />Aye, but even yet, methinks, I shall drive him to surfeit of evil.”
So saying, he gathered the clouds, and seizing his trident in his hands troubled the sea, and roused all blasts of all manner of winds, and hid with clouds land and sea alike; and night rushed down from heaven.<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />Together the East Wind and the South Wind dashed, and the fierce-blowing West Wind and the <placeName key="tgn,2550011">North Wind</placeName>, born in the bright heaven, rolling before him a mighty wave. Then were the knees of Odysseus loosened and his heart melted, and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit:
“Ah me, wretched that I am! What is to befall me at the last?<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />I fear me that verily all that the goddess said was true, when she declared that on the sea, before ever I came to my native land, I should fill up my measure of woes; and lo, all this now is being brought to pass. In such wise does Zeus overcast the broad heaven with clouds, and has stirred up the sea, and the blasts<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />of all manner of winds sweep upon me; now is my utter destruction sure. Thrice blessed those Danaans, aye, four times blessed, who of old perished in the wide land of <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>, doing the pleasure of the sons of Atreus. Even so would that I had died and met my fate on that day when the throngs<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />of the Trojans hurled upon me bronze-tipped spears, fighting around the body of the dead son of Peleus. Then should I have got funeral rites, and the Achaeans would have spread my fame, but now by a miserable death was it appointed me to be cut off.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="313" type="card">
                    <p>
Even as thus he spoke the great wave smote him from on high, rushing upon him with terrible might, and around it whirled his raft.<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />Far from the raft he fell, and let fall the steering-oar from his hand; but his mast was broken in the midst by the fierce blast of tumultuous winds that came upon it, and far in the sea sail and yardarm fell. As for him, long time did the wave hold him in the depths, nor could he<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />rise at once from beneath the onrush of the mighty wave, for the garments which beautiful Calypso had given him weighed him down. At length, however, he came up, and spat forth from his mouth the bitter brine which flowed in streams from his head. Yet even so he did not forget his raft, in evil case though he was,<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />but sprang after it amid the waves, and laid hold of it, and sat down in the midst of it, seeking to escape the doom of death; and a great wave ever bore him this way and that along its course. As when in autumn the <placeName key="tgn,2550011">North Wind</placeName> bears the thistle-tufts over the plain, and close they cling to one another,<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />so did the winds bear the raft this way and that over the sea. Now the South Wind would fling it to the <placeName key="tgn,2550011">North Wind</placeName> to be driven on, and now again the East Wind would yield it to the <placeName key="tgn,2081336">West Wind</placeName> to drive.
But the daughter of <placeName key="tgn,2078692">Cadmus</placeName>, Ino of the fair ankles, saw him, even Leucothea, who of old was a mortal of human speech,<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />but now in the deeps of the sea has won a share of honor from the gods. She was touched with pity for Odysseus, as he wandered and was in sore travail, and she rose up from the deep like a sea-mew on the wing, and sat on the stoutly-bound raft, and spoke, saying:
“Unhappy man, how is it that Poseidon, the earth-shaker,<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />has conceived such furious wrath against thee, that he is sowing for thee the seeds of many evils? Yet verily he shall not utterly destroy thee for all his rage. Nay, do thou thus; and methinks thou dost not lack understanding. Strip off these garments, and leave thy raft to be driven by the winds, but do thou swim with thy hands and so strive to reach<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />the land of the Phaeacians, where it is thy fate to escape. Come, take this veil, and stretch it beneath thy breast. It is immortal; there is no fear that thou shalt suffer aught or perish. But when with thy hands thou hast laid hold of the land, loose it from thee, and cast it into the wine-dark sea<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />far from the land, and thyself turn away.”
So saying, the goddess gave him the veil, and herself plunged again into the surging deep, like a sea-mew; and the dark wave hid her. Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus pondered,<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit:
“Woe is me! Let it not be that some one of the immortals is again weaving a snare for me, that she bids me leave my raft. Nay, but verily I will not yet obey, for afar off mine eyes beheld the land, where she said I was to escape.<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />But this will I do, and meseems that this is best: as long as the timbers hold firm in their fastenings, so long will I remain here and endure to suffer affliction; but when the wave shall have shattered the raft to pieces, I will swim, seeing that there is naught better to devise.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="365" type="card">

                        <milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />While he pondered thus in mind and heart, Poseidon, the earth-shaker, made to rise up a great wave, dread and grievous, arching over from above, and drove it upon him. And as when a strong wind tosses a heap of straw that is dry, and some it scatters here, some there,<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />even so the wave scattered the long timbers of the raft. But Odysseus bestrode one plank, as though he were riding a horse, and stripped off the garments which beautiful Calypso had given him. Then straightway he stretched the veil beneath his breast, and flung himself headlong into the sea with hands outstretched,<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />ready to swim. And the lord, the earth-shaker, saw him, and he shook his head, and thus he spoke to his own heart:
“So now, after thou hast suffered many ills, go wandering over the deep, till thou comest among the folk fostered of Zeus. Yet even so, methinks, thou shalt not make any mock at thy suffering.”
<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />So saying, he lashed his fair-maned horses, and came to <placeName key="tgn,1041944">Aegae</placeName>, where is his glorious palace.
But Athena, daughter of Zeus, took other counsel. She stayed the paths of the other winds, and bade them all cease and be lulled to rest;<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />but she roused the swift <placeName key="tgn,2550011">North Wind</placeName>, and broke the waves before him, to the end that Zeus-born Odysseus might come among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar, escaping from death and the fates.
Then for two nights and two days he was driven about over the swollen waves, and full often his heart forboded destruction.<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />But when fair-tressed Dawn brought to its birth the third day, then the wind ceased and there was a windless calm, and he caught sight of the shore close at hand, casting a quick glance forward, as he was raised up by a great wave. And even as when most welcome to his children appears the life<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />of a father who lies in sickness, bearing grievous pains, long while wasting away, and some cruel god assails him, but then to their joy the gods free him from his woe, so to Odysseus did the land and the wood seem welcome; and he swam on, eager to set foot on the land.<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />But when he was as far away as a man's voice carries when he shouts, and heard the boom of the sea upon the reefs—for the great wave thundered against the dry land, belching upon it in terrible fashion, and all things were wrapped in the foam of the sea; for there were neither harbors where ships might ride, nor road-steads,<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />but projecting headlands, and reefs, and cliffs—then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and his heart melted, and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit:</p>

“Ah me, when Zeus has at length granted me to see the land beyond my hopes, and lo, I have prevailed to cleave my way and to cross this gulf,<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />nowhere doth there appear a way to come forth from the grey sea. For without are sharp crags, and around them the wave roars foaming, and the rock runs up sheer, and the water is deep close in shore, so that in no wise is it possible to plant both feet firmly and escape ruin.<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />Haply were I to seek to land, a great wave may seize me and dash me against the jagged rock, and so shall my striving be in vain. But if I swim on yet further in hope to find shelving beaches<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and harbors of the sea, I fear me lest the storm-wind may catch me up again,<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />and bear me, groaning heavily, over the teeming deep; or lest some god may even send forth upon me some great monster from out the sea—and many such does glorious Amphitrite breed. For I know that the glorious Earth-shaker is filled with wrath against me.”
While he pondered thus in mind and heart,<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />a great wave bore him against the rugged shore. There would his skin have been stripped off and his bones broken, had not the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, put a thought in his mind. On he rushed and seized the rock with both hands, and clung to it, groaning, until the great wave went by.<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />Thus then did he escape this wave, but in its backward flow it once more rushed upon him and smote him, and flung him far out in the sea. And just as, when a cuttlefish is dragged from its hole, many pebbles cling to its suckers, even so from his strong hands<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />were bits of skin stripped off against the rocks; and the great wave covered him. Then verily would hapless Odysseus have perished beyond his fate, had not flashing-eyed Athena given him prudence. Making his way forth from the surge where it belched upon the shore, he swam outside, looking ever toward the land in hope to find<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />shelving beaches and harbors of the sea. But when, as he swam, he came to the mouth of a fair-flowing river, where seemed to him the best place, since it was smooth of stones, and besides there was shelter from the wind, he knew the river as he flowed forth, and prayed to him in his heart:
<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line" />“Hear me, O king, whosoever thou art. As to one greatly longed-for<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> do I come to thee, seeking to escape from out the sea from the threats of Poseidon. Reverend even in the eyes of the immortal gods is that man who comes as a wanderer, even as I have now come to thy stream and to thy knees, after many toils.<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line" />Nay, pity me, O king, for I declare that I am thy suppliant.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="451" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and the god straightway stayed his stream, and checked the waves, and made a calm before him, and brought him safely to the mouth of the river. And he let his two knees bend and his strong hands fall, for his spirit was crushed by the sea.<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line" />And all his flesh was swollen, and sea water flowed in streams up through his mouth and nostrils. So he lay breathless and speechless, with scarce strength to move; for terrible weariness had come upon him. But when he revived, and his spirit returned again into his breast, then he loosed from him the veil of the goddess and let it fall into the river that murmured seaward;<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line" />and the great wave bore it back down the stream, and straightway Ino received it in her hands. But Odysseus, going back from the river, sank down in the reeds and kissed the earth, the giver of grain; and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit:
<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line" />“Ah, woe is me! what is to befall me? What will happen to me at the last? If here in the river bed I keep watch throughout the weary night, I fear that together the bitter frost and the fresh dew may overcome me, when from feebleness I have breathed forth my spirit; and the breeze from the river blows cold in the early morning.<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line" />But if I climb up the slope to the shady wood and lie down to rest in the thick brushwood, in the hope that the cold and weariness might leave me, and if sweet sleep comes over me, I fear me lest I become a prey and spoil to wild beasts.”
Then, as he pondered, this thing seemed to him the better:<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line" />he went his way to the wood and found it near the water in a clear space; and he crept beneath two bushes that grew from the same spot, one of thorn and one of olive. Through these the strength of the wet winds could never blow, nor the rays of the bright sun beat,<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line" />nor could the rain pierce through them, so closely did they grow, intertwining one with the other. Beneath these Odysseus crept and straightway gathered with his hands a broad bed, for fallen leaves were there in plenty, enough to shelter two men or three<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line" />in winter-time, however bitter the weather. And the much-enduring goodly Odysseus saw it, and was glad, and he lay down in the midst, and heaped over him the fallen leaves. And as a man hides a brand beneath the dark embers in an outlying farm, a man who has no neighbors,<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line" />and so saves a seed of fire, that he may not have to kindle it from some other source, so Odysseus covered himself with leaves. And Athena shed sleep upon his eyes, that it might enfold his lids and speedily free him from toilsome weariness.</p>
                </div2>
            </div1>
            <div1 n="6" type="Book">
                <div2 n="1" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />So he lay there asleep, the much-enduring goodly Odysseus, overcome with sleep and weariness; but Athena went to the land and city of the Phaeacians. These dwelt of old in spacious Hypereia<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />hard by the Cyclopes, men overweening in pride who plundered them continually and were mightier than they. From thence Nausithous, the godlike, had removed them, and led and settled them in <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Scheria</placeName> far from men that live by toil. About the city he had drawn a wall, he had built houses<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />and made temples for the gods, and divided the ploughlands; but he, ere now, had been stricken by fate and had gone to the house of Hades, and Alcinous was now king, made wise in counsel by the gods. To his house went the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, to contrive the return of great-hearted Odysseus.<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />She went to a chamber, richly wrought, wherein slept a maiden like the immortal goddesses in form and comeliness, Nausicaa, the daughter of great-hearted Alcinous; hard by slept two hand-maidens, gifted with beauty by the Graces, one on either side of the door-posts, and the bright doors were shut.
<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />But like a breath of air the goddess sped to the couch of the maiden, and stood above her head, and spoke to her, taking the form of the daughter of Dymas, famed for his ships, a girl who was of like age with Nausicaa, and was dear to her heart. Likening herself to her, the flashing-eyed Athena spoke and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />“Nausicaa, how comes it that thy mother bore thee so heedless? Thy bright raiment is lying uncared for; yet thy marriage is near at hand, when thou must needs thyself be clad in fair garments, and give other such to those who escort thee. It is from things like these, thou knowest, that good report goeth up among men,<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />and the father and honored mother rejoice. Nay, come, let us go to wash them at break of day, for I will follow with thee to aid thee, that thou mayest with speed make thee ready; for thou shalt not long remain a maiden. Even now thou hast suitors in the land, the noblest<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />of all the Phaeacians, from whom is thine own lineage. Nay, come, bestir thy noble father early this morning that he make ready mules and a wagon for thee, to bear the girdles and robes and bright coverlets. And for thyself, too, it is far more seemly<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />to go thus than on foot, for the washing tanks are far from the city.”
So saying, the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, departed to <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, where, they say, is the abode of the gods that stands fast forever. Neither is it shaken by winds nor ever wet with rain, nor does snow fall upon it, but the air<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />is outspread clear and cloudless, and over it hovers a radiant whiteness. Therein the blessed gods are glad all their days, and thither went the flashing-eyed one, when she had spoken all her word to the maiden.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="48" type="card">
                    <p>
At once then came fair-throned Dawn and awakened Nausicaa of the beautiful robes, and straightway she marvelled at her dream,<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />and went through the house to tell her parents, her father dear and her mother; and she found them both within. The mother sat at the hearth with her handmaidens, spinning the yarn of purple dye, and her father she met as he was going forth to join the glorious kings<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />in the place of council, to which the lordly Phaeacians called him. But she came up close to her dear father, and said:
“Papa dear, wilt thou not make ready for me a wagon, high and stout of wheel, that I may take to the river for washing the goodly raiment of mine which is lying here soiled?<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />Moreover for thyself it is seemly that when thou art at council with the princes thou shouldst have clean raiment upon thee; and thou hast five sons living in thy halls—two are wedded, but three are sturdy bachelors—and these ever wish to put on them freshly-washed raiment,<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />when they go to the dance. Of all this must I take thought.”
So she spoke, for she was ashamed to name gladsome<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> marriage to her father; but he understood all, and answered, saying: “Neither the mules do I begrudge thee, my child, nor aught beside. Go thy way; the slaves shall make ready for thee the wagon,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />high and stout of wheel and fitted with a box above.”<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note>
With this he called to the slaves, and they hearkened. Outside the palace they made ready the light-running mule wagon, and led up the mules and yoked them to it; and the maiden brought from her chamber the bright raiment,<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />and placed it upon the polished car, while her mother put in a chest food of all sorts to satisfy the heart. Therein she put dainties, and poured wine in a goat-skin flask; and the maiden mounted upon the wagon. Her mother gave her also soft olive oil in a flask of gold,<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />that she and her maidens might have it for the bath. Then Nausicaa took the whip and the bright reins, and smote the mules to start them; and there was a clatter of the mules as they sped on a main, bearing the raiment and the maiden; neither went she alone, for with her went her handmaids as well.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="85" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />Now when they came to the beautiful streams of the river, where were the washing tanks that never failed—for abundant clear water welled up from beneath and flowed over, to cleanse garments however soiled—there they loosed the mules from under the wagon and drove them along the eddying river<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />to graze on the honey-sweet water-grass, and themselves took in their arms the raiment from the wagon, and bore it into the dark water, and trampled it in the trenches, busily vying each with each. Now when they had washed the garments, and had cleansed them of all the stains, they spread them out in rows on the shore of the sea where<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />the waves dashing against the land washed the pebbles cleanest; and they, after they had bathed and anointed themselves richly with oil, took their meal on the river's banks, and waited for the clothing to dry in the bright sunshine. Then when they had had their joy of food, she and her handmaids,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />they threw off their head-gear and fell to playing at ball, and white-armed Nausicaa was leader in the song.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> And even as Artemis, the archer, roves over the mountains, along the ridges of lofty Taygetus or Erymanthus, joying in the pursuit of boars and swift deer,<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />and with her sport the wood-nymphs, the daughters of Zeus who bears the aegis, and Leto is glad at heart—high above them all Artemis holds her head and brows, and easily may she be known, though all are fair—so amid her handmaidens shone the maid unwed.
<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />But when she was about to yoke the mules, and fold the fair raiment, in order to return homeward, then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel, that Odysseus might awake and see the fair-faced maid, who should lead him to the city of the Phaeacians.<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />So then the princess tossed the ball to one of her maidens; the maiden indeed she missed, but cast it into a deep eddy, and thereat they cried aloud, and goodly Odysseus awoke, and sat up, and thus he pondered in mind and heart:
“Woe is me! to the land of what mortals am I now come?<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />Are they cruel, and wild, and unjust? or do they love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts? There rang in my ears a cry as of maidens, of nymphs who haunt the towering peaks of the mountains, the springs that feed the rivers, and the grassy meadows!<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />Can it be that I am somewhere near men of human speech? Nay, I will myself make trial and see.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="127" type="card">
                    <p>
So saying the goodly Odysseus came forth from beneath the bushes, and with his stout hand he broke from the thick wood a leafy branch, that he might hold it about him and hide therewith his nakedness.<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />Forth he came like a mountain-nurtured lion trusting in his might, who goes forth, beaten with rain and wind, but his two eyes are ablaze: into the midst of the kine he goes, or of the sheep, or on the track of the wild deer, and his belly bids him go even into the close-built fold, to make an attack upon the flocks.<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />Even so Odysseus was about to enter the company of the fair-tressed maidens, naked though he was, for need had come upon him. But terrible did he seem to them, all befouled with brine, and they shrank in fear, one here, one there, along the jutting sand-spits. Alone the daughter of Alcinous kept her place, for<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />in her heart Athena put courage, and took fear from her limbs. She fled not, but stood and faced him; and Odysseus pondered whether he should clasp the knees of the fair-faced maid, and make his prayer, or whether, standing apart as he was, he should beseech her with gentle words, in hope that she might show him the city and give him raiment.<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />And, as he pondered, it seemed to him better to stand apart and beseech her with gentle words, lest the maiden's heart should be wroth with him if he clasped her knees; so straightway he spoke a gentle word and crafty:
“I beseech thee, O queen,—a goddess art thou, or art thou mortal?<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />If thou art a goddess, one of those who hold broad heaven, to Artemis, the daughter of great Zeus, do I liken thee most nearly in comeliness and in stature and in form. But if thou art one of mortals who dwell upon the earth, thrice-blessed then are thy father and thy honored mother,<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />and thrice-blessed thy brethren. Full well, I ween, are their hearts ever warmed with joy because of thee, as they see thee entering the dance, a plant<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> so fair. But he again is blessed in heart above all others, who shall prevail with his gifts of wooing and lead thee to his home.<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />For never yet have mine eyes looked upon a mortal such as thou, whether man or woman; amazement holds me as I look on thee.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="162" type="card">
                    <p>Of a truth in <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> once I saw such a thing, a young shoot of a palm springing up beside the altar of Apollo—for thither, too, I went, and much people followed with me,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />on that journey on which evil woes were to be my portion;—even so, when I saw that, I marvelled long at heart, for never yet did such a tree spring up from the earth. And in like manner, lady, do I marvel at thee, and am amazed, and fear greatly to touch thy knees; but sore grief has come upon me.<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />Yesterday, on the twentieth day, I escaped from the wine-dark sea, but ever until then the wave and the swift winds bore me from the island of Ogygia; and now fate has cast me ashore here, that here too, haply, I may suffer some ill. For not yet, methinks, will my troubles cease, but the gods ere that will bring many to pass.<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />Nay, O queen, have pity; for it is to thee first that I am come after many grievous toils, and of the others who possess this city and land I know not one. Shew me the city, and give me some rag to throw about me, if thou hadst any wrapping for the clothes when thou camest hither.<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />And for thyself, may the gods grant thee all that thy heart desires; a husband and a home may they grant thee, and oneness of heart—a goodly gift. For nothing is greater or better than this, when man and wife dwell in a home in one accord, a great grief to their foes<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />and a joy to their friends; but they know it<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> best themselves.”
Then white-armed Nausicaa answered him:“Stranger, since thou seemest to be neither an evil man nor a witless, and it is Zeus himself, the Olympian, that gives happy fortune to men, both to the good and the evil, to each man as he will;<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />so to thee, I ween, he has given this lot, and thou must in any case endure it. But now, since thou hast come to our city and land, thou shalt not lack clothing or aught else of those things which befit a sore-tried suppliant when he cometh in the way. The city will I shew thee, and will tell thee the name of the people.<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />The Phaeacians possess this city and land, and I am the daughter of great-hearted Alcinous, upon whom depend the might and power of the Phaeacians.”
She spoke, and called to her fair-tressed handmaids:“Stand, my maidens. Whither do ye flee at the sight of a man?<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />Ye do not think, surely, that he is an enemy? That mortal man lives not, or exists<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> nor shall ever be born who shall come to the land of the Phaeacians as a foeman, for we are very dear to the immortals. Far off we dwell in the surging sea,<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />the furthermost of men, and no other mortals have dealings with us. Nay, this is some hapless wanderer that has come hither. Him must we now tend; for from Zeus are all strangers and beggars, and a gift, though small, is welcome. Come, then, my maidens, give to the stranger food and drink,<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />and bathe him in the river in a spot where there is shelter from the wind.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="211" type="card">
                    <p>
So she spoke, and they halted and called to each other. Then they set Odysseus in a sheltered place, as Nausicaa, the daughter of great-hearted Alcinous, bade, and beside him they put a cloak and a tunic for raiment,<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />and gave him soft olive oil in the flask of gold, and bade him bathe in the streams of the river. Then among the maidens spoke goodly Odysseus: “Maidens, stand yonder apart, that by myself I may wash the brine from my shoulders, and<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />anoint myself with olive oil; for of a truth it is long since oil came near my skin. But in your presence will I not bathe, for I am ashamed to make me naked in the midst of fair-tressed maidens.”
So he said, and they went apart and told the princess. But with water from the river goodly Odysseus washed from his skin<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />the brine which clothed his back and broad shoulders, and from his head he wiped the scurf of the unresting sea. But when he had washed his whole body and anointed himself with oil, and had put on him the raiment which the unwedded maid had given him, then Athena, the daughter of Zeus, made him<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />taller to look upon and mightier, and from his head she made the locks to flow in curls like unto the hyacinth flower. And as when a man overlays silver with gold, a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athena have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is the work he produces,<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />even so the goddess shed grace upon his head and shoulders. Then he went apart and sat down on the shore of the sea, gleaming with beauty and grace; and the damsel marvelled at him, and spoke to her fair-tressed handmaids, saying:
“Listen, white-armed maidens, that I may say somewhat.<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />Not without the will of all the gods who hold <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> does this man come among the godlike Phaeacians. Before he seemed to me uncouth, but now he is like the gods, who hold broad heaven. Would that a man such as he might be called my husband,<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />dwelling here, and that it might please him here to remain. But come, my maidens; give to the stranger food and drink.”
So she spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed, and set before Odysseus food and drink. Then verily did the much-enduring goodly Odysseus drink and eat,<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />ravenously; for long had he been without taste of food.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="251" type="card">
                    <p>
But the white-armed Nausicaa took other counsel. She folded the raiment and put it in the fair wagon, and yoked the stout-hoofed mules, and mounted the car herself. Then she hailed Odysseus, and spoke and addressed him:<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />“Rouse thee now, stranger, to go to the city, that I may escort thee to the house of my wise father, where, I tell thee, thou shalt come to know all the noblest of the Phaeacians. Only do thou thus, and, methinks, thou dost not lack understanding: so long as we are passing through the country and the tilled fields of men go thou quickly<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />with the handmaids behind the mules and the wagon, and I will lead the way. But when we are about to enter the city, around which runs a lofty wall,—a fair harbor lies on either side of the city and the entrance is narrow, and curved ships<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />are drawn up along the road, for they all have stations for their ships, each man one for himself. There, too, is their place of assembly about the fair temple of Poseidon, fitted with huge<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> stones set deep in the earth. Here the men are busied with the tackle of their black ships, with cables and sails, and here they shape the thin oar-blades.<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" /> For the Phaeacians care not for bow or quiver, but for masts and oars of ships, and for the shapely ships, rejoicing in which they cross over the grey sea. It is their ungentle speech that I shun, lest hereafter some man should taunt me, for indeed there are insolent folk in the land,<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />and thus might some baser fellow say, shall he meet us: ‘Who is this that follows Nausicaa, a comely man and tall, a stranger? Where did she find him? He will doubtless be a husband for her. Haply she has brought from his ship some wanderer of a folk that dwell afar—for none are near us—<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />or some god, long prayed-for, has come down from heaven in answer to her prayers, and she will have him as her husband all her days. Better so, even if she has herself gone forth and found a husband from another people; for of a truth she scorns the Phaeacians here in the land, where she has wooers many and noble!’<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />So will they say, and this would become a reproach to me. Yea, I would myself blame another maiden who should do such thing, and in despite of her dear father and mother, while yet they live, should consort with men before the day of open marriage.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="288" type="card">
                    <p>Nay, stranger, do thou quickly hearken to my words, that with all speed<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />thou mayest win from my father an escort and a return to thy land. Thou wilt find a goodly grove of Athena hard by the road, a grove of poplar trees. In it a spring wells up, and round about is a meadow. There is my father's park and fruitful vineyard, as far from the city as a man's voice carries when he shouts.<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />Sit thou down there, and wait for a time, until we come to the city and reach the house of my father. But when thou thinkest that we have reached the house, then do thou go to the city of the Phaeacians and ask for the house of my father, great-hearted Alcinous.<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />Easily may it be known, and a child could guide thee, a mere babe; for the houses of the Phaeacians are no wise built of such sort as is the palace of the lord Alcinous. But when the house and the court enclose thee, pass quickly through the great hall, till thou comest<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />to my mother, who sits at the hearth in the light of the fire, spinning the purple yarn, a wonder to behold, leaning against a pillar, and her handmaids sit behind her. There, too, leaning against the selfsame pillar, is set the throne of my father, whereon he sits and quaffs his wine, like unto an immortal.<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />Him pass thou by, and cast thy hands about my mother's knees, that thou mayest quickly see with rejoicing the day of thy return, though thou art come from never so far. If in her sight thou dost win favour, then there is hope that thou wilt see thy friends, and return<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />to thy well-built house and unto thy native land.”
So saying, she smote the mules with the shining whip, and they quickly left the streams of the river. Well did they trot, well did they ply their ambling feet,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and she drove with care that<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />the maidens and Odysseus might follow on foot, and with judgment did she ply the lash. Then the sun set, and they came to the glorious grove, sacred to Athena. There Odysseus sat him down, and straightway prayed to the daughter of great Zeus: “Hear me, child of aegis-bearing Zeus, unwearied one.<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />Hearken now to my prayer, since aforetime thou didst not hearken when I was smitten, what time the glorious Earth-shaker smote me. Grant that I may come to the Phaeacians as one to be welcomed and to be pitied.”
So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athena heard him; but she did not yet appear to him face to face, for she feared<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />her father's brother; but he furiously raged against godlike Odysseus, until at length he reached his own land.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />So he prayed there, the much-enduring goodly Odysseus, while the two strong mules bore the maiden to the city. But when she had come to the glorious palace of her father, she halted the mules at the outer gate, and her brothers<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />thronged about her, men like the immortals, and loosed the mules from the wagon, and bore the raiment within; and she herself went to her chamber. There a fire was kindled for her by her waiting-woman, Eurymedusa, an aged dame from Apeire. Long ago the curved ships had brought her from Apeire,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />and men had chosen her from the spoil as a gift of honor for Alcinous, for that he was king over all the Phaeacians, and the people hearkened to him as to a god. She it was who had reared the white-armed Nausicaa in the palace, and she it was who kindled the fire for her, and made ready her supper in the chamber.
Then Odysseus roused himself to go to the city, and Athena,<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />with kindly purpose, cast about him a thick mist, that no one of the great-hearted Phaeacians, meeting him, should speak mockingly to him, and ask him who he was. But when he was about to enter the lovely city, then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, met him<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />in the guise of a young maiden carrying a pitcher, and she stood before him; and goodly Odysseus questioned her, saying:
“My child, couldst thou not guide me to the house of him they call Alcinous, who is lord among the people here? For I am come hither a stranger sore-tried<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />from afar, from a distant country; wherefore I know no one of the people who possess this city and land.”
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Then verily, Sir stranger, I will shew thee the palace as thou dost bid me, for it lies hard by the house of my own noble father.<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />Only go thou quietly, and I will lead the way. But turn not thine eyes upon any man nor question any, for the men here endure not stranger-folk, nor do they give kindly welcome to him who comes from another land. They, indeed, trusting in the speed of their swift ships,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />cross over the great gulf of the sea, for this the Earth-shaker has granted them; and their ships are swift as a bird on the wing or as a thought.”</p>

                <div2 n="37" type="card">
                    <p>
So speaking, Pallas Athena led the way quickly, and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess.<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />And as he went through the city in the midst of them, the Phaeacians, famed for their ships, took no heed of him, for fair-tressed Athena, the dread goddess, would not suffer it, but shed about him a wondrous mist, for her heart was kind toward him. And Odysseus marvelled at the harbors and the stately ships, at the meeting-places where the heroes themselves gathered, and the walls, long and<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />high and crowned with palisades, a wonder to behold. But when they had come to the glorious palace of the king, the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, was the first to speak, saying:
“Here, Sir stranger, is the house which thou didst bid me shew to thee, and thou wilt find the kings, fostered of Zeus,<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />feasting at the banquet. Go thou within, and let thy heart fear nothing; for a bold man is better in all things, though he be a stranger from another land. The queen shalt thou approach first in the palace; Arete is the name by which she is called,<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />and she is sprung from the same line as is the king Alcinous. Nausithous at the first was born from the earth-shaker Poseidon and Periboea, the comeliest of women, youngest daughter of great-hearted Eurymedon, who once was king over the insolent Giants.<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />But he brought destruction on his froward people, and was himself destroyed. But with Periboea lay Poseidon and begat a son, great-hearted Nausithous, who ruled over the Phaeacians; and Nausithous begat Rhexenor and Alcinous. Rhexenor, when as yet he had no son, Apollo of the silver bow smote<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />in his hall, a bridegroom though he was, and he left only one daughter, Arete. Her Alcinous made his wife, and honored her as no other woman on earth is honored, of all those who in these days direct their households in subjection to their husbands; so heartily is she honored,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />and has ever been, by her children and by Alcinous himself and by the people, who look upon her as upon a goddess, and greet her as she goes through the city. For she of herself is no wise lacking in good understanding, and for the women<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> to whom she has good will she makes an end of strife even among their husbands.<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />If in her sight thou dost win favour, then there is hope that thou wilt see thy friends, and return to thy high-roofed house and unto thy native land.”</p>

So saying, flashing-eyed Athena departed over the unresting sea, and left lovely <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Scheria</placeName>.<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />She came to Marathon and broad-wayed <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and entered the well-built house of Erectheus; but Odysseus went to the glorious palace of Alcinous. There he stood, and his heart pondered much before he reached the threshold of bronze; for there was a gleam as of sun or moon<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />over the high-roofed house of great-hearted Alcinous. Of bronze were the walls that stretched this way and that from the threshold to the innermost chamber, and around was a cornice of cyanus.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> Golden were the doors that shut in the well-built house, and doorposts of silver were set in a threshold of bronze.<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />Of silver was the lintel above, and of gold the handle. On either side of the door there stood gold and silver dogs, which Hephaestus had fashioned with cunning skill to guard the palace of great-hearted Alcinous; immortal were they and ageless all their days.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">3</note>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />Within, seats were fixed along the wall on either hand, from the threshold to the innermost chamber, and on them were thrown robes of soft fabric, cunningly woven, the handiwork of women. On these the leaders of the Phaeacians were wont to sit drinking and eating, for they had unfailing store.<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />And golden youths stood on well-built pedestals, holding lighted torches in their hands to give light by night to the banqueters in the hall. And fifty slave-women he had in the house, of whom some grind the yellow grain on the millstone,<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />and others weave webs, or, as they sit, twirl the yarn, like unto the leaves<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> of a tall poplar tree; and from the closely-woven linen the soft olive oil drips down.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note>

                <div2 n="107" type="card">
                    <p>For as the Phaeacian men are skilled above all others in speeding a swift ship upon the sea, so are the women<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />cunning workers at the loom, for Athena has given to them above all others skill in fair handiwork, and an understanding heart. But without the courtyard, hard by the door, is a great orchard of four acres,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">3</note> and a hedge runs about it on either side. Therein grow trees, tall and luxuriant,<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />pears and pomegranates and apple-trees with their bright fruit, and sweet figs, and luxuriant olives. Of these the fruit perishes not nor fails in winter or in summer, but lasts throughout the year; and ever does the west wind, as it blows, quicken to life some fruits, and ripen others;<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />pear upon pear waxes ripe, apple upon apple, cluster upon cluster, and fig upon fig. There, too, is his fruitful vineyard planted, one part of which, a warm spot on level ground, is being dried in the sun, while other grapes men are gathering,<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />and others, too, they are treading; but in front are unripe grapes that are shedding the blossom, and others that are turning purple. There again, by the last row of the vines, grow trim garden beds of every sort, blooming the year through, and therein are two springs, one of which sends its water throughout all the garden,<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />while the other, over against it, flows beneath the threshold of the court toward the high house; from this the townsfolk drew their water. Such were the glorious gifts of the gods in the palace of Alcinous.
There the much-enduring goodly Odysseus stood and gazed. But when he had marvelled in his heart at all things,<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />he passed quickly over the threshold into the house. There he found the leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians pouring libations from their cups to the keen-sighted Argeiphontes, to whom they were wont to pour the wine last of all, when they were minded to go to their rest. But the much-enduring goodly Odysseus went through the hall,<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />wrapped in the thick mist which Athena had shed about him, till he came to Arete and to Alcinous the king. About the knees of Arete Odysseus cast his hands, and straightway the wondrous mist melted from him, and a hush fell upon all that were in the room at sight of the man,<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />and they marvelled as they looked upon him. But Odysseus made his prayer:
“Arete, daughter of godlike Rhexenor, to thy husband and to thy knees am I come after many toils,—aye and to these banqueters, to whom may the gods grant happiness in life, and may each of them hand down to his children<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />the wealth in his halls, and the dues of honor which the people have given him. But for me do ye speed my sending, that I may come to my native land, and that quickly; for long time have I been suffering woes far from my friends.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="152" type="card">
                    <p>
So saying he sat down on the hearth in the ashes by the fire, and they were all hushed in silence.<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />But at length there spoke among them the old lord Echeneus, who was an elder among the Phaeacians, well skilled in speech, and understanding all the wisdom of old. He with good intent addressed the assembly, and said: “Alcinous, lo, this is not the better way, nor is it seemly,<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />that a stranger should sit upon the ground on the hearth in the ashes; but these others hold back waiting for thy word. Come, make the stranger to arise, and set him upon a silver-studded chair, and bid the heralds mix wine,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />that we may pour libations also to Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt; for he ever attends upon reverend suppliants. And let the housewife give supper to the stranger of the store that is in the house.”
When the strong and mighty Alcinous heard this, he took by the hand Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded, and raised him from the hearth, and set him upon a bright chair<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />from which he bade his son, the kindly<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> Laodamas, to rise; for he sat next to him, and was his best beloved. Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin, for him to wash, and beside him drew up a polished table.<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />And the grave housewife brought and set before him bread, and therewith dainties in abundance, giving freely of her store. So the much-enduring goodly Odysseus drank and ate; and then the mighty Alcinous spoke to the herald, and said:
“Pontonous, mix the bowl, and serve wine<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />to all in the hall, that we may pour libations also to Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt; for he ever attends upon reverend suppliants.”
He spoke, and Pontonous mixed the honey-hearted wine, and served out to all, pouring first drops for libation into the cups. But when they had poured libations, and had drunk to their heart's content,<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />Alcinous addressed the assembly, and spoke among them:
“Hearken to me, leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me. Now that ye have finished your feast, go each of you to his house to rest. But in the morning we will call more of the elders together,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />and will entertain the stranger in our halls and offer goodly victims to the gods. After that we will take thought also of his sending, that without toil or pain yon stranger may under our sending, come to his native land speedily and with rejoicing, though he come from never so far.<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />Nor shall he meanwhile suffer any evil or harm, until he sets foot upon his own land; but thereafter he shall suffer whatever Fate and the dread Spinners spun with their thread for him at his birth, when his mother bore him.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="198" type="card">
                    <p>But if he is one of the immortals come down from heaven,<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />then is this some new thing which the gods are planning; for ever heretofore have they been wont to appear to us in manifest form, when we sacrifice to them glorious hecatombs, and they feast among us, sitting even where we sit. Aye, and if one of us as a lone wayfarer meets them,<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />they use no concealment, for we are of near kin to them, as are the Cyclopes and the wild tribes of the Giants.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Alcinous, far from thee be that thought; for I am not like the immortals, who hold broad heaven,<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />either in stature or in form, but like mortal men. Whomsoever ye know among men who bear greatest burden of woe, to them might I liken myself in my sorrows. Yea, and I could tell a yet longer tale of all the evils which I have endured by the will of the gods.<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />But as for me, suffer me now to eat, despite my grief; for there is nothing more shameless than a hateful belly, which bids a man perforce take thought thereof, be he never so sore distressed and laden with grief at heart, even as I, too, am laden with grief at heart, yet ever does my belly<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />bid me eat and drink, and makes me forget all that I have suffered, and commands me to eat my fill. But do ye make haste at break of day, that ye may set me, hapless one, on the soil of my native land, even after my many woes. Yea, let life leave me, when I have seen once more<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />my possessions, my slaves, and my great high-roofed house.”
So he spoke, and they all praised his words, and bade send the stranger on his way, since he had spoken fittingly. Then when they had poured libations, and had drunk to their heart's content, they went each man to his home, to take their rest,<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />and goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall, and beside him sat Arete and godlike Alcinous; and the handmaids cleared away the dishes of the feast. Then white-armed Arete was the first to speak; for, as she saw it, she knew his<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />fair raiment, the mantle and tunic, which she herself had wrought with her handmaids. And she spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
“Stranger, this question will I myself ask thee first. Who art thou among men, and from whence? Who gave thee this raiment? Didst thou not say that thou camest hither wandering over the sea?”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="240" type="card">

                        <milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Hard were it, O queen, to tell to the end the tale of my woes, since full many have the heavenly gods given me. But this will I tell thee, of which thou dost ask and enquire. There is an isle, Ogygia, which lies far off in the sea.<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />Therein dwells the fair-tressed daughter of Atlas, guileful Calypso, a dread goddess, and with her no one either of gods or mortals hath aught to do; but me in my wretchedness did fate bring to her hearth alone, for Zeus had smitten my swift ship with his bright thunderbolt,<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />and had shattered it in the midst of the wine-dark sea. There all the rest of my trusty comrades perished, but I clasped in my arms the keel of my curved ship and was borne drifting for nine days, and on the tenth black night the gods brought me to the isle, Ogygia, where<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />the fair-tressed Calypso dwells, a dread goddess. She took me to her home with kindly welcome, and gave me food, and said that she would make me immortal and ageless all my days; but she could never persuade the heart in my breast. There for seven years' space I remained continually, and ever<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />with my tears would I wet the immortal raiment which Calypso gave me. But when the eight year came in circling course, then she roused me and bade me go, either because of some message from Zeus, or because her own mind was turned. And she sent me on my way on a raft, stoutly bound, and gave me abundant store<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />of bread and sweet wine, and clad me in immortal raiment, and sent forth a gentle wind and warm. So for seventeen days I sailed over the sea, and on the eighteenth appeared the shadowy mountains of your land; and my heart was glad,<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />ill-starred that I was; for verily I was yet to have fellowship with great woe, which Poseidon, the earth-shaker, sent upon me. For he stirred up the winds against me and stayed my course, and wondrously roused the sea, nor would the wave suffer me to be borne upon my raft, as I groaned ceaselessly.<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />My raft indeed the storm shattered, but by swimming I clove my way through yon gulf of the sea, until the wind and the waves, as they bore me, brought me to your shores. There, had I sought to land, the waves would have hurled me upon the shore, and dashed me against the great crags and a cheerless place,<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />but I gave way, and swam back until I came to a river, where seemed to me the best place, since it was smooth of rocks, and besides there was shelter from the wind. Forth then I staggered, and sank down, gasping for breath, and immortal night came on. Then I went forth from the heaven-fed river,<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />and lay down to sleep in the bushes, gathering leaves about me; and a god shed over me infinite sleep.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="287" type="card">
                    <p>So there among the leaves I slept, my heart sore stricken, the whole night through, until the morning and until midday; and the sun turned to his setting<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> ere sweet sleep released me.<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />Then I saw the handmaids of thy daughter on the shore at play, and amid them was she, fair as the goddesses. To her I made my prayer; and she in no wise failed in good understanding, to do as thou wouldst not deem that one of younger years would do on meeting thee; for younger folk are ever thoughtless.<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />She gave bread in plenty and sparkling wine, and bathed me in the river, and gave me this raiment. In this, for all my sorrows, have I told thee the truth.”
Then in turn Alcinous answered him, and said:“Stranger, verily my daughter was not minded aright in this,<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />that she did not bring thee to our house with her maidens. Yet it was to her first that thou didst make thy prayer.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Prince, rebuke not for this, I pray thee, thy blameless daughter. She did indeed bid me follow with her maidens,<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />but I would not for fear and shame, lest haply thy heart should darken with wrath as thou sawest it; for we are quick to anger, we tribes of men upon the earth.”
And again Alcinous answered him, and said:“Stranger, not such is the heart in my breast,<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />to be filled with wrath without a cause. Better is due measure in all things. I would, O father Zeus, and Athena and Apollo, that thou, so goodly a man, and like-minded with me, wouldst have my daughter to wife, and be called my son, and abide here; a house and possessions would I give thee,<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />if thou shouldst choose to remain, but against thy will shall no one of the Phaeacians keep thee; let not that be the will of father Zeus.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="317" type="card">
                    <p>But as for thy sending, that thou mayest know it surely, I appoint a time thereto, even the morrow. Then shalt thou lie down, overcome by sleep, and they shall row thee over the calm sea until thou comest<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />to thy country and thy house, or to whatsoever place thou wilt, aye though it be even far beyond <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, which those of our people who saw it, when they carried fair-haired Rhadamanthus to visit Tityus, the son of Gaea, say is the furthest of lands.<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />Thither they went, and without toil accomplished their journey, and on the selfsame day came back home. So shalt thou, too, know for thyself how far my ships are the best, and my youths at tossing the brine with the oar-blade.”
So said he, and the much-enduring goodly Odysseus was glad;<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />and he spoke in prayer, and said: “Father Zeus, grant that Alcinous may bring to pass all that he has said. So shall his fame be unquenchable over the earth, the giver of grain, and I shall reach my native land.”
Thus they spoke to one another,<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />and white-armed Arete bade her maidens place a bedstead under cover of the portico, and to lay on it fair blankets of purple, and to spread there over coverlets, and on these to put fleecy cloaks for clothing. So they went forth from the hall with torches in their hands.<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />But when they had busily spread the stout-built bedstead, they came to Odysseus, and called to him, and said: “Rouse thee now, stranger, to go to thy rest; thy bed is made.”
Thus they spoke, and welcome did it seem to him to lay him down to sleep. So there he slept, the much-enduring goodly Odysseus,<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />on the corded bedstead under the echoing portico. But Alcinous lay down in the inmost chamber of the lofty house, and beside him lay the lady his wife, who had strewn the couch.</p>

And the strong and mighty Alcinous led the way<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />to the place of assembly of the Phaeacians, which was builded for them hard by their ships. Thither they came and sat down on the polished stones close by one another; and Pallas Athena went throughout the city, in the likeness of the herald of wise Alcinous, devising a return for great-hearted Odysseus.<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />To each man's side she came, and spoke and said:
“Hither now, leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians, come to the place of assembly, that you may learn of the stranger who has newly come to the palace of wise Alcinous after his wanderings over the sea, and in form is like unto the immortals.”
<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />So saying she roused the spirit and heart of each man, and speedily the place of assembly and the seats were filled with men that gathered. And many marvelled at the sight of the wise son of Laertes, for wondrous was the grace that Athena shed upon his head and shoulders;<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />and she made him taller and sturdier to behold, that he might be welcomed by all the Phaeacians, and win awe and reverence, and might accomplish the many feats wherein the Phaeacians made trial of Odysseus. Now when they were assembled and met together,<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />Alcinous addressed their assembly and spoke among them:
“Hearken to me, leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians, that I may speak what the heart in my breast bids me.

So saying, he led the way, and the sceptred kings followed him, while a herald went for the divine minstrel. And chosen youths, two and fifty, went, as he bade, to the shore of the unresting sea.<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />And when they had come down to the ship and to the sea, they drew the black ship down to the deep water, and placed the mast and sail in the black ship, and fitted the oars in the leathern thole-straps, all in due order, and spread the white sail.<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />Well out in the roadstead they moored the ship, and then went their way to the great palace of the wise Alcinous. Filled were the porticoes and courts and rooms with the men that gathered, for many there were, both young and old. For them Alcinous slaughtered twelve sheep,<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />and eight white-tusked boars, and two oxen of shambling gait. These they flayed and dressed, and made ready a goodly feast.
Then the herald drew near, leading the good minstrel, whom the Muse loved above all other men, and gave him both good and evil; of his sight she deprived him, but gave him the gift of sweet song.<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />For him Pontonous, the herald, set a silver-studded chair in the midst of the banqueters, leaning it against a tall pillar, and he hung the clear-toned lyre from a peg close above his head, and showed him how to reach it with his hands. And beside him he placed a basket and a beautiful table,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />and a cup of wine, to drink when his heart should bid him. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, the Muse moved the minstrel to sing of the glorious deeds of warriors, from that lay the fame whereof had then reached broad heaven,<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />even the quarrel of Odysseus and Achilles, son of Peleus, how once they strove with furious words at a rich feast of the gods, and Agamemnon, king of men, was glad at heart that the best of the Achaeans were quarrelling; for thus Phoebus Apollo, in giving his response, had told him that it should be,<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />in sacred <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>, when he passed over the threshold of stone to enquire of the oracle. For then the beginning of woe was rolling upon Trojans and Danaans through the will of great Zeus.</p>

                <div2 n="83" type="card">
                    <p>
This song the famous minstrel sang; but Odysseus grasped his great purple cloak with his stout hands,<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />and drew it down over his head, and hid his comely face; for he had shame of the Phaeacians as he let fall tears from beneath his eyebrows. Yea, and as often as the divine minstrel ceased his singing, Odysseus would wipe away his tears and draw the cloak from off his head, and taking the two-handled cup would pour libations to the gods.<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />But as often as he began again, and the nobles of the Phaeacians bade him sing, because they took pleasure in his lay, Odysseus would again cover his head and moan. Now from all the rest he concealed the tears that he shed, but Alcinous alone marked him and took heed,<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />for he sat by him, and heard him groaning heavily. And straightway he spoke among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar:
“Hear me, ye leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians, already have we satisfied our hearts with the equal banquet and with the lyre, which is the companion of the rich feast.<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />But now let us go forth, and make trial of all manner of games, that yon stranger may tell his friends, when he returns home, how far we excel other men in boxing and wrestling and leaping and in speed of foot.”
So saying, he led the way, and they followed him.<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />From the peg the herald hung the clear-toned lyre, and took Demodocus by the hand, and led him forth from the hall, guiding him by the self-same road by which the others, the nobles of the Phaeacians, had gone to gaze upon the games. They went their way to the place of assembly, and with them went a great throng,<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />past counting; and up rose many noble youths. There rose Acroneus, and Ocyalus, and Elatreus, and Nauteus, and Prymneus, and Anchialus, and Eretmeus, and Ponteus, and Proreus, Thoon and Anabesineus,<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />and Amphialus, son of Polyneus, son of Tecton; and up rose also Euryalus, the peer of man-destroying Ares, the son of Naubolus, who in comeliness and form was the best of all the Phaeacians after peerless Laodamas; and up rose the three sons of noble Alcinous, Laodamas, and Halius, and godlike Clytoneus.<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />These then first made trial in the foot-race.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="121" type="card">
                    <p>A course was marked out for them from the turning point,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and they all sped swiftly, raising the dust of the plain; but among them noble Clytoneus was far the best at running, and by as far as is the range<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> of a team of mules in fallow land,<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />by so far he shot to the front and reached the host, and the others were left behind. Then they made trial of toilsome wrestling, and here in turn Euryalus excelled all the princes. And in leaping Amphialus was best of all, and with the discus again far the best of all was Elatreus,<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />and in boxing Laodamas, the good son of Alcinous. But when the hearts of all had taken pleasure in the contests, Laodamas, the son of Alcinous, spoke among them:
“Come, friends, let us ask yon stranger whether he knows and has learned any contests. In build, surely, he is no mean man,<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />in thighs and calves, and in his two arms above, his stout neck, and his great might. In no wise does he lack aught of the strength of youth, but he has been broken by many troubles. For to my mind there is naught worse than the sea to confound a man, be he never so strong.”
<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />And Euryalus in turn answered him, and said:“Laodamas, this word of thine is right fitly spoken. Go now thyself and challenge him, and make known thy word.”
Now when the good son of Alcinous heard this he came and took his stand in the midst and spoke to Odysseus:<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />“Come, Sir stranger, do thou, too, make trial of the contests, if thou knowest any; and it must be that thou knowest contests, for there is no greater glory for a man so long as he lives than that which he achieves by his own hands and his feet. Nay, come, make trial, and cast away care from thy heart.<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />Thy journey shall no more be long delayed, nay, even now thy ship is launched and the crew is ready.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Laodamas, why do ye mock me with this challenge? Sorrow is in my mind far more than contests,<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />seeing that in time past I have suffered much and toiled much, and now I sit in the midst of your assembly, longing for my return home, and making my prayer to the king and to all the people.”
Then again Euryalus made answer and taunted him to his face: “Nay verily, stranger, for I do not liken thee to a man that is skilled<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />in contests, such as abound among men, but to one who, faring to and fro with his benched ship, is a captain of sailors who are merchantmen, one who is mindful of his freight, and has charge of a home-borne cargo, and the gains of his greed. Thou dost not look like an athlete.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="165" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him: “Stranger, thou hast not spoken well; thou art as one blind with folly. So true is it that the gods do not give gracious gifts to all alike, not form nor mind nor eloquence. For one man is inferior in comeliness,<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />but the god sets a crown<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> of beauty upon his words, and men look upon him with delight, and he speaks on unfalteringly with sweet modesty, and is conspicuous among the gathered people, and as he goes through the city men gaze upon him as upon a god. Another again is in comeliness like the immortals,<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />but no crown of grace is set about his words. So, in thy case, thy comeliness is preeminent, nor could a god himself mend it, but in mind thou art stunted. Thou hast stirred the spirit in my breast by speaking thus unmannerly. I am not unskilled in sports<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />as thou pratest, nay, methinks I was among the first so long as I trusted in my youth and in my hands. But now I am bound by suffering and pains; for much have I endured in passing through wars of men and the grievous waves. But even so, though I have suffered much, I will make trial of the contests,<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />for thy word has stung me to the heart, and thou hast provoked me with thy speech.”
He spoke, and, leaping up with his cloak about him as it was, seized a discus larger than the rest and thick, no little heavier than those with which the Phaeacians were wont to contend one with another. This with a whirl he sent from his stout hand,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />and the stone hummed as it flew; and down they crouched to the earth, the Phaeacians of the long oars, men famed for their ships, beneath the rush of the stone. Past the marks of all it flew, speeding lightly from his hand, and Athena, in the likeness of a man, set the mark, and she spoke and addressed him:
<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />“Even a blind man, stranger, could distinguish this mark, groping for it with his hands, for it is in nowise confused with the throng of the others, but is far the first. Be thou of good cheer for this bout at least: no one of the Phaeacians will reach this, or cast beyond it.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="199" type="card">
                    <p>
So she spoke, and the much-enduring goodly Odysseus was glad,<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />rejoicing that he saw a true friend in the lists. Then with a lighter heart he spoke among the Phaeacians:
“Reach this now, young men; and presently, methinks, I will send another after it, as far or even further. Of the rest, if any man's heart and spirit bid him,<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />let him come hither and make trial—for ye have greatly angered me—be it in boxing or in wrestling, aye, or in running, I care not; let any one come of all the Phaeacians, save Laodamas alone. For he is my host, and who would quarrel with one that entertains him? Foolish is that man and worthless,<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />who challenges to a contest the host who receives him in a strange land; he does but mar his own fortunes. But of all the rest I refuse none, and make light of none, but am fain to know them, and make trial of them man to man. For in all things I am no weakling, even in all the contests that are practised among men.<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />Well do I know how to handle the polished bow, and ever would I be the first to shoot and smite my man in the throng of the foe, even though many comrades stood by me and were shooting at the men. Only Philoctetes excelled me with the bow<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />in the land of the Trojans, when we Achaeans shot. But of all others I declare that I am best by far, of all mortals that are now upon the earth and eat bread. Yet with men of former days I will not seek to vie, with Heracles or with Eurytus of <placeName key="perseus,Oechalia">Oechalia</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />who strove even with the immortals in archery. Wherefore great Eurytus died soon, nor did old age come upon him in his halls, for Apollo waxed wroth and slew him, because he had challenged him to a contest with the bow. And with the spear I throw farther than any other man can shoot with an arrow.<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />In the foot race alone I fear that someone of the Phaeacians may out strip me, for cruelly have I been broken amid the many waves, since there was in my ship no lasting store of provisions; therefore my limbs are loosened.”
So he spoke and they were all hushed in silence;<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />but Alcinous alone answered him and said:
“Stranger, since not ungraciously dost thou speak thus in our midst, but art minded to shew forth the prowess which waits upon thee, in anger that yonder man came up to thee in the lists and taunted thee in a way in which no mortal would make light of thy prowess,<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />who knew in his heart how to speak fitly; come, now, hearken to my words, that thou mayest tell to another hero, when in thy halls thou art feasting with thy wife and children, and rememberest our skill, what feats<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />Zeus has vouchsafed to us from our fathers' days even until now. For we are not faultless boxers or wrestlers, but in the foot race we run swiftly, and we are the best seamen; and ever to us is the banquet dear, and the lyre, and the dance, and changes of raiment, and warm baths, and the couch.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="250" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />But come now, all ye that are the best dancers of the Phaeacians, make sport, that the stranger may tell his friends on reaching home how far we surpass others in seamanship and in fleetness of foot, and in the dance and in song. And let one go straightway<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />and fetch for Demodocus the clear-toned lyre which lies somewhere in our halls.”
So spoke Alcinous the godlike, and the herald rose to fetch the hollow lyre from the palace of the king. Then stood up masters of the lists, nine in all, men chosen from out the people, who in their gatherings were wont to order all things aright.<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />They levelled a place for the dance, and marked out a fair wide ring, and the herald came near, bearing the clear-toned lyre for Demodocus. He then moved into the midst, and around him stood boys in the first bloom of youth, well skilled in the dance, and they smote the goodly dancing floor with their feet. And Odysseus<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />gazed at the twinklings of their feet and marvelled in spirit.
But the minstrel struck the chords in prelude to his sweet lay and sang of the love of Ares and Aphrodite of the fair crown, how first they lay together in the house of Hephaestus secretly; and Ares gave her many gifts, and shamed the bed<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />of the lord Hephaestus. But straightway one came to him with tidings, even Helius, who had marked them as they lay together in love. And when Hephaestus heard the grievous tale, he went his way to his smithy, pondering evil in the deep of his heart, and set on the anvil block the great anvil and forged bonds<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />which might not be broken or loosed, that the lovers<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> might bide fast where they were. But when he had fashioned the snare in his wrath against Ares, he went to his chamber where lay his bed, and everywhere round about the bed-posts he spread the bonds, and many too were hung from above, from the roof-beams,<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />fine as spiders' webs, so that no one even of the blessed gods could see them, so exceeding craftily were they fashioned. But when he had spread all his snare about the couch, he made as though he would go to <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, that well-built citadel, which is in his eyes far the dearest of all lands.<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />And no blind watch did Ares of the golden rein keep, when he saw Hephaestus, famed for his handicraft, departing, but he went his way to the house of famous Hephaestus, eager for the love of Cytherea of the fair crown. Now she had but newly come from the presence of her father, the mighty son of Cronos,<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />and had sat her down. And Ares came into the house and clasped her hand and spoke and addressed her:
“Come, love, let us to bed and take our joy, couched together. For Hephaestus is no longer here in the land, but has now gone, I ween, to <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, to visit the Sintians of savage speech.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="295" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />So he spoke, and a welcome thing it seemed to her to lie with him. So they two went to the couch, and lay them down to sleep, and about them clung the cunning bonds of the wise Hephaestus, nor could they in any wise stir their limbs or raise them up. Then at length they learned that there was no more escaping.<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />And near to them came the famous god of the two strong arms,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> having turned back before he reached the land of <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>; for Helius had kept watch for him and had brought him word. So he went to his house with a heavy heart, and stood at the gateway, and fierce anger seized him.<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />And terribly he cried out and called to all the gods:
“Father Zeus, and ye other blessed gods that are forever, come hither that ye may see a laughable matter and a monstrous,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> even how Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, scorns me for that I am lame and loves destructive Ares<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />because he is comely and strong of limb, whereas I was born misshapen. Yet for this is none other to blame but my two parents—would they had never begotten me! But ye shall see where these two have gone up into my bed and sleep together in love; and I am troubled at the sight.<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />Yet, methinks, they will not wish to lie longer thus, no, not for a moment, how loving soever they are. Soon shall both lose their desire to sleep; but the snare and the bonds shall hold them until her father pays back to me all the gifts of wooing that I gave him for the sake of his shameless girl;<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />for his daughter is fair but bridles not her passion.”<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note>
So he spoke and the gods gathered to the house of the brazen floor.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">3</note> Poseidon came, the earth-enfolder, and the helper Hermes came, and the lord Apollo, the archer god.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">4</note> Now the goddesses abode for shame each in her own house,<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />but the gods, the givers of good things, stood in the gateway; and unquenchable laughter arose among the blessed gods as they saw the craft of wise Hephaestus. And thus would one speak, with a glance at his neighbor:
“Ill deeds thrive not. The slow catches the swift;<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />even as now Hephaestus, slow though he is, has out-stripped Ares for all that he is the swiftest of the gods who hold <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>. Lame though he is, he has caught him by craft, wherefore Ares owes the fine of the adulterer.”
Thus they spoke to one another. But to Hermes the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, said:
<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />“Hermes, son of Zeus, messenger, giver of good things, wouldst thou in sooth be willing, even though ensnared with strong bonds, to lie on a couch by the side of golden Aphrodite?”
Then the messenger, Argeiphontes, answered him:“Would that this might befall, lord Apollo, thou archer god—<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />that thrice as many bonds inextricable might clasp me about and ye gods, aye, and all the goddesses too might be looking on, but that I might sleep by the side of golden Aphrodite.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="343" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke and laughter arose among the immortal gods. Yet Poseidon laughed not, but ever besought<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />Hephaestus, the famous craftsman, to set Ares free; and he spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
“Loose him, and I promise, as thou biddest me, that he shall himself pay thee all that is right in the presence of the immortal gods.”
Then the famous god of the two strong arms answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />“Ask not this of me, Poseidon, thou earth-enfolder. A sorry thing to be sure of is the surety for a sorry knave. How could I put thee in bonds among the immortal gods, if Ares should avoid both the debt and the bonds and depart?”
Then again Poseidon, the earth-shaker, answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />“Hephaestus, even if Ares shall avoid the debt and flee away, I will myself pay thee this.”
Then the famous god of the two strong arms answered him: “It may not be that I should say thee nay, nor were it seemly.”
So saying the mighty Hephaestus loosed the bonds<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />and the two, when they were freed from that bond so strong, sprang up straightway. And Ares departed to <placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName>, but she, the laughter-loving Aphrodite, went to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, to <placeName key="tgn,7002373">Paphos</placeName>, where is her demesne and fragrant altar. There the Graces bathed her and anointed her with<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />immortal oil, such as gleams<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> upon the gods that are forever. And they clothed her in lovely raiment, a wonder to behold.
This song the famous minstrel sang; and Odysseus was glad at heart as he listened, and so too were the Phaeacians of the long oars, men famed for their ships.
<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />Then Alcinous bade Halius and Laodamas dance alone, for no one could vie with them. And when they had taken in their hands the beautiful ball of purple, which wise Polybus had made for them, the one<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />would lean backward and toss it toward the shadowy clouds, and the other would leap up from the earth and skilfully catch it before his feet touched the ground again. But when they had tried their skill in throwing the ball straight up, the two fell to dancing on the bounteous earth, ever tossing the ball to and fro, and the other youths<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />stood in the lists and beat time, and thereat a great din arose.
Then to Alcinous spoke goodly Odysseus: “Lord Alcinous, renowned above all men,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> thou didst boast that thy dancers were the best, and lo, thy words are made good; amazement holds me as I look on them.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="385" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />So he spoke, and the strong and mighty Alcinous was glad; and straightway he spoke among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar:
“Hear me, leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians. This stranger verily seems to me a man of understanding. Come then, let us give him a gift of friendship, as is fitting;<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />for twelve glorious kings bear sway in our land as rulers, and I myself am the thirteenth. Now do you, each of the twelve, bring a newly washed cloak and tunic, and a talent of precious gold, and let us straightway bring all together,<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />that the stranger with our gifts in his hands may go to his supper glad at heart. And let Euryalus make amends to the stranger himself with words and with a gift, for the word that he spoke was in no wise seemly.”
So he spoke, and they all praised his words and bade that so it should be, and sent forth every man a herald to fetch the gifts.<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />And Euryalus in turn made answer, and said:
“Lord Alcinous, renowned above all men, I will indeed make amends to the stranger, as thou biddest me. I will give him this sword, all of bronze, whereon is a hilt of silver, and a scabbard of new-sawn ivory<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />is wrought about it; and it shall be to him a thing of great worth.”
So saying, he put into his hands the silver-studded sword, and spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “Hail, Sir stranger; but if any word has been spoken that was harsh, may the storm-winds straightway snatch it and bear it away.<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />And for thyself, may the gods grant thee to see thy wife, and to come to thy native land, for long time hast thou been suffering woes far from thy friends.”
And Odysseus of many wiles answered him: “All hail to thee, too, friend; and may the gods grant thee happiness, and mayest thou never hereafter miss<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />this sword which thou hast given me, making amends with gentle speech.”
He spoke, and about his shoulders hung the silver-studded sword. And the sun set, and the glorious gifts were brought him. These the lordly heralds bore to the palace of Alcinous, and the sons of peerless Alcinous<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />took the beautiful gifts and set them before their honored mother. And the strong and mighty Alcinous led the way, and they came in and sat down on the high seats. Then to Arete spoke the mighty Alcinous:
“Bring hither, wife, a goodly chest, the best thou hast,<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />and thyself place in it a newly-washed cloak and tunic; and do ye heat for the stranger a cauldron on the fire, and warm water, that when he has bathed and has seen well bestowed all the gifts which the noble Phaeacians have brought hither, he may take pleasure in the feast, and in hearing the strains of the song.<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />And I will give him this beautiful cup of mine, wrought of gold, that he may remember me all his days as he pours libations in his halls to Zeus and to the other gods.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="433" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and Arete bade her handmaids to set a great cauldron on the fire with all speed.<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />And they set on the blazing fire the cauldron for filling the bath, and poured in water, and took billets of wood and kindled them beneath it. Then the fire played about the belly of the cauldron, and the water grew warm; but meanwhile Arete brought forth for the stranger a beautiful chest from the treasure chamber, and placed in it the goodly gifts,<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />the raiment and the gold, which the Phaeacians gave. And therein she herself placed a cloak and a fair tunic; and she spoke and addressed Odysseus with winged words:
“Look now thyself to the lid, and quickly cast a cord upon it, lest some one despoil thee of thy goods on the way, when later on<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line" />thou art lying in sweet sleep, as thou farest in the black ship.”
Now when the much-enduring goodly Odysseus heard these words, he straightway fitted on the lid, and quickly cast a cord upon it—a cunning knot, which queenly Circe once had taught him. Then forthwith the housewife bade him<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line" />go to the bath and bathe; and his heart was glad when he saw the warm bath, for he had not been wont to have such tendance from the time that he left the house of faired-haired Calypso, but until then he had tendance continually as a god.
Now when the handmaids had bathed him and anointed him with oil,<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line" />and had cast about him a fair cloak and a tunic, he came forth from the bath, and went to join the men at their wine. And Nausicaa, gifted with beauty by the gods, stood by the door-post of the well-built hall, and she marvelled at Odysseus, as her eyes beheld him,<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line" />and she spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
“Farewell, stranger, and hereafter even in thy own native land mayest thou remember me, for to me first thou owest the price of thy life.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her:“Nausicaa, daughter of great-hearted Alcinous,<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line" />so may Zeus grant, the loud-thundering lord of Here, that I may reach my home and see the day of my returning. Then will I even there pray to thee as to a god all my days, for thou, maiden, hast given me life.”</p>

                <div2 n="469" type="card">
                    <p>
He spoke, and sat down on a chair beside king Alcinous.<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line" />And now they were serving out portions and mixing the wine. Then the herald came near, leading the good minstrel, Demodocus, held in honor by the people, and seated him in the midst of the banqueters, leaning his chair against a high pillar. Then to the herald said Odysseus of many wiles,<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line" />cutting off a portion of the chine of a white-tusked boar, whereof yet more was left, and there was rich fat on either side:
“Herald, take and give this portion to Demodocus, that he may eat, and I will greet him, despite my grief. For among all men that are upon the earth minstrels<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line" />win honor and reverence, for that the Muse has taught them the paths of song, and loves the tribe of minstrels.”
So he spoke, and the herald bore the portion and placed it in the hands of the lord Demodocus, and he took it and was glad at heart. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them.<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line" />But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, then to Demodocus said Odysseus of many wiles:
“Demodocus, verily above all mortal men do I praise thee, whether it was the Muse, the daughter of Zeus, that taught thee, or Apollo; for well and truly dost thou sing of the fate of the Achaeans,<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line" />all that they wrought and suffered, and all the toils they endured, as though haply thou hadst thyself been present, or hadst heard the tale from another. But come now, change thy theme, and sing of the building of the horse of wood, which Epeius made with Athena's help, the horse which once Odysseus led up into the citadel as a thing of guile,<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line" />when he had filled it with the men who sacked <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>. If thou dost indeed tell me this tale aright, I will declare to all mankind that the god has of a ready heart granted thee the gift of divine song.”
So he spoke, and the minstrel, moved by the god, began, and let his song be heard,<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line" />taking up the tale where the Argives had embarked on their benched ships and were sailing away, after casting fire on their huts, while those others led by glorious Odysseus were now sitting in the place of assembly of the Trojans, hidden in the horse; for the Trojans had themselves dragged it to the citadel.<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line" />So there it stood, while the people talked long as they sat about it, and could form no resolve. Nay, in three ways did counsel find favour in their minds: either to cleave the hollow timber with the pitiless bronze, or to drag it to the height and cast it down the rocks, or to let it stand as a great offering to propitiate the gods,<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line" />even as in the end it was to be brought to pass; for it was their fate to perish when their city should enclose the great horse of wood, wherein were sitting all the best of the Argives, bearing to the Trojans death and fate. And he sang how the sons of the Achaeans<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line" />poured forth from the horse and, leaving their hollow ambush, sacked the city. Of the others he sang how in divers ways they wasted the lofty city, but of Odysseus, how he went like Ares to the house of Deiphobus together with godlike Menelaus. There it was, he said, that Odysseus braved the most terrible fight<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line" />and in the end conquered by the aid of great-hearted Athena.</p>

                    <p>
This song the famous minstrel sang. But the heart of Odysseus was melted and tears wet his cheeks beneath his eyelids. And as a woman wails and flings herself about her dear husband, who has fallen in front of his city and his people,<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line" />seeking toward off from his city and his children the pitiless day; and as she beholds him dying and gasping for breath, she clings to him and shrieks aloud, while the foe behind her smite her back and shoulders with their spears, and lead her away to captivity to bear toil and woe,<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line" />while with most pitiful grief her cheeks are wasted: even so did Odysseus let fall pitiful tears from beneath his brows. Now from all the rest he concealed the tears that he shed, but Alcinous alone marked him and took heed,<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line" />for he sat by him and heard him groaning heavily. And straightway he spoke among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar:
“Hear me, leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians, and let Demodocus now check his clear-toned lyre, for in no wise to all alike does he give pleasure with this song. Ever since we began to sup and the divine minstrel was moved to sing,<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line" />from that time yon stranger has never ceased from sorrowful lamentation; surely, methinks, grief has encompassed his heart. Nay, let the minstrel cease, that we may all make merry, hosts and guest alike, since it is better thus. Lo, for the sake of the honored stranger all these things have been made ready,<milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line" />his sending and the gifts of friendship which we give him of our love. Dear as a brother is the stranger and the suppliant to a man whose wits have never so short a range. Therefore do not thou longer hide with crafty thought whatever I shall ask thee;to speak out plainly is the better course.</p>

This seems to my mind the fairest thing there is. But thy heart is turned to ask of my grievous woes, that I may weep and groan the more. What, then, shall I tell thee first, what last?<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />for woes full many have the heavenly gods given me. First now will I tell my name, that ye, too, may know it, and that I hereafter, when I have escaped from the pitiless day of doom, may be your host, though I dwell in a home that is afar. I am Odysseus, son of Laertes, who<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />am known among men for all manner of wiles,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and my fame reaches unto heaven. But I dwell in clear-seen <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, wherein is a mountain, Neriton, covered with waving forests, conspicuous from afar; and round it lie many isles hard by one another, Dulichium, and Same, and wooded <placeName key="tgn,7011374">Zacynthus</placeName>.<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />
                        <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself lies close in to the mainland<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> the furthest toward the gloom,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> but the others lie apart toward the Dawn and the sun—a rugged isle, but a good nurse of young men; and for myself no other thing can I see sweeter than one's own land. Of a truth Calypso, the beautiful goddess, sought to keep me by her<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />in her hollow caves, yearning that I should be her husband; and in like manner Circe would fain have held me back in her halls, the guileful lady of Aeaea, yearning that I should be her husband; but they could never persuade the heart within my breast. So true is it that naught is sweeter than a man's own land and his parents,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />even though it be in a rich house that he dwells afar in a foreign land away from his parents. But come, let me tell thee also of my woeful home-coming, which Zeus laid upon me as I came from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.
“From <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName> the wind bore me and brought me to the Cicones,<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />to Ismarus. There I sacked the city and slew the men; and from the city we took their wives and great store of treasure, and divided them among us, that so far as lay in me no man might go defrauded of an equal share. Then verily I gave command that we should flee with swift foot, but the others in their great folly did not hearken.<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />But there much wine was drunk, and many sheep they slew by the shore, and sleek kine of shambling gait.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile the Cicones went and called to other Cicones who were their neighbors, at once more numerous and braver than they—men that dwelt inland and were skilled<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />at fighting with their foes from chariots, and, if need were, on foot. So they came in the morning, as thick as leaves or flowers spring up in their season; and then it was that an evil fate from Zeus beset us luckless men, that we might suffer woes full many. They set their battle in array and fought by the swift ships,<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" /> and each side hurled at the other with bronze-tipped spears. Now as long as it was morn and the sacred day was waxing, so long we held our ground and beat them off, though they were more than we. But when the sun turned to the time for the unyoking of oxen, then the Cicones prevailed and routed the Achaeans,<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />and six of my well-greaved comrades perished from each ship; but the rest of us escaped death and fate.
“Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, glad to have escaped from death, though we had lost our dear comrades; nor did I let my curved ships pass on<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />till we had called thrice on each of those hapless comrades of ours who died on the plain, cut down by the Cicones. But against our ships Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, roused the North Wind with a wondrous tempest, and hid with clouds the land and the sea alike, and night rushed down from heaven.<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />Then the ships were driven headlong, and their sails were torn to shreds by the violence of the wind. So we lowered the sails and stowed them aboard, in fear of death, and rowed the ships hurriedly toward the land. There for two nights and two days continuously<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />we lay, eating our hearts for weariness and sorrow. But when now fair-tressed Dawn brought to its birth the third day, we set up the masts and hoisted the white sails, and took our seats, and the wind and the helmsmen steered the ships. And now all unscathed should I have reached my native land,<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />but the wave and the current and the North Wind beat me back as I was rounding Malea, and drove me from my course past <placeName key="tgn,7010869">Cythera</placeName>.</p>

“Thence for nine days' space I was borne by direful winds over the teeming deep; but on the tenth we set foot on the land of the Lotus-eaters, who eat a flowery food.<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />There we went on shore and drew water, and straightway my comrades took their meal by the swift ships. But when we had tasted food and drink, I sent forth some of my comrades to go and learn who the men were, who here ate bread upon the earth;<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />two men I chose, sending with them a third as a herald. So they went straightway and mingled with the Lotus-eaters, and the Lotus-eaters did not plan death for my comrades, but gave them of the lotus to taste. And whosoever of them ate of the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus,<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />had no longer any wish to bring back word or to return, but there they were fain to abide among the Lotus-eaters, feeding on the lotus, and forgetful of their homeward way. These men, therefore, I brought back perforce to the ships, weeping, and dragged them beneath the benches and bound them fast in the hollow ships;<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />and I bade the rest of my trusty comrades to embark with speed on the swift ships, lest perchance anyone should eat of the lotus and forget his homeward way. So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches, and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars.
<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />“Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, and we came to the land of the Cyclopes, an overweening and lawless folk, who, trusting in the immortal gods, plant nothing with their hands nor plough; but all these things spring up for them without sowing or ploughing,<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear the rich clusters of wine, and the rain of Zeus gives them increase. Neither assemblies for council have they, nor appointed laws, but they dwell on the peaks of lofty mountains in hollow caves, and each one is lawgiver<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />to his children and his wives, and they reck nothing one of another.</p>

“Now there is a level<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> isle that stretches aslant outside the harbor, neither close to the shore of the land of the Cyclopes, nor yet far off, a wooded isle. Therein live wild goats innumerable, for the tread of men scares them not away,<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />nor are hunters wont to come thither, men who endure toils in the woodland as they course over the peaks of the mountains. Neither with flocks is it held, nor with ploughed lands, but unsown and untilled all the days it knows naught of men, but feeds the bleating goats.<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />For the Cyclopes have at hand no ships with vermilion cheeks,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> nor are there ship-wrights in their land who might build them well-benched ships, which should perform all their wants, passing to the cities of other folk, as men often cross the sea in ships to visit one another—<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />craftsmen, who would have made of this isle also a fair settlement. For the isle is nowise poor, but would bear all things in season. In it are meadows by the shores of the grey sea, well-watered meadows and soft, where vines would never fail, and in it level ploughland, whence<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />they might reap from season to season harvests exceeding deep, so rich is the soil beneath; and in it, too, is a harbor giving safe anchorage, where there is no need of moorings, either to throw out anchor-stones or to make fast stern cables, but one may beach one's ship and wait until the sailors' minds bid them put out, and the breezes blow fair.<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />Now at the head of the harbor a spring of bright water flows forth from beneath a cave, and round about it poplars grow. Thither we sailed in, and some god guided us through the murky night; for there was no light to see, but a mist lay deep about the ships and the moon<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />showed no light from heaven, but was shut in by clouds. Then no man's eyes beheld that island, nor did we see the long waves rolling on the beach, until we ran our well-benched ships on shore. And when we had beached the ships we lowered all the sails<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />and ourselves went forth on the shore of the sea, and there we fell asleep and waited for the bright Dawn.
“As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, we roamed throughout the isle marvelling at it; and the nymphs, the daughters of Zeus who bears the aegis, roused<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />the mountain goats, that my comrades might have whereof to make their meal. Straightway we took from the ships our curved bows and long javelins, and arrayed in three bands we fell to smiting; and the god soon gave us game to satisfy our hearts. The ships that followed me were twelve, and to each<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />nine goats fell by lot, but for me alone they chose out ten.</p>

And we looked across to the land of the Cyclopes, who dwelt close at hand, and marked the smoke, and the voice of men, and of the sheep, and of the goats. But when the sun set and darkness came on, then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea.<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />And as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, I called my men together and spoke among them all:
“‘Remain here now, all the rest of you, my trusty comrades, but I with my own ship and my own company will go and make trial of yonder men, to learn who they are,<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />whether they are cruel, and wild, and unjust, or whether they love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts.’
“So saying, I went on board the ship and bade my comrades themselves to embark, and to loose the stern cables. So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches,<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars. But when we had reached the place, which lay close at hand, there on the land's edge hard by the sea we saw a high cave, roofed over with laurels, and there many flocks, sheep and goats alike, were wont to sleep. Round about it<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />a high court was built with stones set deep in the earth, and with tall pines and high-crested oaks. There a monstrous man was wont to sleep, who shepherded his flocks alone and afar, and mingled not with others, but lived apart, with his heart set on lawlessness.<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />For he was fashioned a wondrous monster, and was not like a man that lives by bread, but like a wooded peak of lofty mountains, which stands out to view alone, apart from the rest.</p>

With me I had a goat-skin of the dark, sweet wine, which Maro, son of Euanthes, had given me, the priest of Apollo, the god who used to watch over Ismarus. And he had given it me because we had protected him with his child and wife<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />out of reverence; for he dwelt in a wooded grove of Phoebus Apollo. And he gave me splendid gifts: of well-wrought gold he gave me seven talents, and he gave me a mixing-bowl all of silver; and besides these, wine, wherewith he filled twelve jars in all,<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />wine sweet and unmixed, a drink divine. Not one of his slaves nor of the maids in his halls knew thereof, but himself and his dear wife, and one house-dame only. And as often as they drank that honey-sweet red wine he would fill one cup and pour it into twenty measures of water,<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />and a smell would rise from the mixing-bowl marvellously sweet; then verily would one not choose to hold back. With this wine I filled and took with me a great skin, and also provision in a scrip; for my proud spirit had a foreboding that presently a man would come to me clothed in great might,<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />a savage man that knew naught of justice or of law.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
“Speedily we came to the cave, nor did we find him within, but he was pasturing his fat flocks in the fields. So we entered the cave and gazed in wonder at all things there. The crates were laden with cheeses, and the pens were crowded<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />with lambs and kids. Each kind was penned separately: by themselves the firstlings, by themselves the later lambs, and by themselves again the newly weaned. And with whey were swimming all the well-wrought vessels, the milk-pails and the bowls into which he milked. Then my comrades spoke and besought me first of all<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />to take of the cheeses and depart, and thereafter speedily to drive to the swift ship the kids and lambs from out the pens, and to sail over the salt water. But I did not listen to them—verily it would have been better far—to the end that I might see the man himself, and whether he would give me gifts of entertainment.<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />Yet, as it fell, his appearing was not to prove a joy to my comrades.</p>

He bore a mighty weight of dry wood to serve him at supper time,<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />and flung it down with a crash inside the cave, but we, seized with terror, shrank back into a recess of the cave. But he drove his fat flocks into the wide cavern—all those that he milked; but the males—the rams and the goats—he left without in the deep court.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />Then he lifted on high and set in place the great door-stone, a mighty rock; two and twenty stout four-wheeled wagons could not lift it from the ground, such a towering mass of rock he set in the doorway. Thereafter he sat down and milked the ewes and bleating goats<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />all in turn, and beneath each dam he placed her young. Then presently he curdled half the white milk, and gathered it in wicker baskets and laid it away, and the other half he set in vessels that he might have it to take and drink, and that it might serve him for supper.<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />But when he had busily performed his tasks, then he rekindled the fire, and caught sight of us, and asked:
“‘Strangers, who are ye? Whence do ye sail over the watery ways? Is it on some business, or do ye wander at random over the sea, even as pirates, who wander,<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />hazarding their lives and bringing evil to men of other lands?’
“So he spoke, and in our breasts our spirit was broken for terror of his deep voice and monstrous self; yet even so I made answer and spoke to him, saying:
“‘We, thou must know, are from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, Achaeans, driven wandering<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />by all manner of winds over the great gulf of the sea. Seeking our home, we have come by another way, by other paths; so, I ween, Zeus was pleased to devise. And we declare that we are the men of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, whose fame is now mightiest under heaven,<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />so great a city did he sack, and slew many people; but we on our part, thus visiting thee, have come as suppliants to thy knees, in the hope that thou wilt give us entertainment, or in other wise make some present, as is the due of strangers. Nay, mightiest one, reverence the gods; we are thy suppliants;<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />and Zeus is the avenger of suppliants and strangers—Zeus, the strangers' god—who ever attends upon reverend strangers.’
“So I spoke, and he straightway made answer with pitiless heart: ‘A fool art thou, stranger, or art come from afar, seeing that thou biddest me either to fear or to shun the gods.<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />For the Cyclopes reck not of Zeus, who bears the aegis, nor of the blessed gods, since verily we are better far than they. Nor would I, to shun the wrath of Zeus, spare either thee or thy comrades, unless my own heart should bid me. But tell me where thou didst moor thy well-wrought ship on thy coming.<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />Was it haply at a remote part of the land, or close by? I fain would know.’</p>

                <div2 n="281" type="card">
                    <p>
“So he spoke, tempting me, but he trapped me not because of my great cunning; and I made answer again in crafty words:
“‘My ship Poseidon, the earth-shaker, dashed to pieces, casting her upon the rocks at the border of your land;<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />for he brought her close to the headland, and the wind drove her in from the sea. But I, with these men here, escaped utter destruction.’
“So I spoke, but from his pitiless heart he made no answer, but sprang up and put forth his hands upon my comrades. Two of them at once he seized and dashed to the earth like puppies,<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />and the brain flowed forth upon the ground and wetted the earth. Then he cut them limb from limb and made ready his supper, and ate them as a mountain-nurtured lion, leaving naught—ate the entrails, and the flesh, and the marrowy bones. And we with wailing held up our hands to Zeus,<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />beholding his cruel deeds; and helplessness possessed our souls. But when the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> had filled his huge maw by eating human flesh and thereafter drinking pure milk, he lay down within the cave, stretched out among the sheep. And I formed a plan in my great heart<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />to steal near him, and draw my sharp sword from beside my thigh and smite him in the breast, where the midriff holds the liver, feeling for the place with my hand. But a second thought checked me, for right there should we, too, have perished in utter ruin. For we should not have been able<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />to thrust back with our hands from the high door the mighty stone which he had set there. So then, with wailing, we waited for the bright Dawn.
“As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, he rekindled the fire and milked his goodly flocks all in turn, and beneath each dam placed her young.<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />Then, when he had busily performed his tasks, again he seized two men at once and made ready his meal. And when he had made his meal he drove his fat flocks forth from the cave, easily moving away the great door-stone; and then he put it in place again, as one might set the lid upon a quiver.<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />Then with loud whistling the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> turned his fat flocks toward the mountain, and I was left there, devising evil in the deep of my heart, if in any way I might take vengeance on him, and Athena grant me glory.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="318" type="card">
                    <p>
“Now this seemed to my mind the best plan. There lay beside a sheep-pen a great club of the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />a staff of green olive-wood, which he had cut to carry with him when dry; and as we looked at it we thought it as large as is the mast of a black ship of twenty oars, a merchantman, broad of beam, which crosses over the great gulf; so huge it was in length and in breadth to look upon.<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />To this I came, and cut off therefrom about a fathom's length and handed it to my comrades, bidding them dress it down; and they made it smooth, and I, standing by, sharpened it at the point, and then straightway took it and hardened it in the blazing fire. Then I laid it carefully away, hiding it beneath the dung,<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />which lay in great heaps throughout the cave. And I bade my comrades cast lots among them, which of them should have the hardihood with me to lift the stake and grind it into his eye when sweet sleep should come upon him. And the lot fell upon those whom I myself would fain have chosen;<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />four they were, and I was numbered with them as the fifth. At even then he came, herding his flocks of goodly fleece, and straightway drove into the wide cave his fat flocks one and all, and left not one without in the deep court, either from some foreboding or because a god so bade him.<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />Then he lifted on high and set in place the great door-stone, and sitting down he milked the ewes and bleating goats all in turn, and beneath each dam he placed her young. But when he had busily performed his tasks, again he seized two men at once and made ready his supper.<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />Then I drew near and spoke to the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, holding in my hands an ivy<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> bowl of the dark wine:
“‘<placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, take and drink wine after thy meal of human flesh, that thou mayest know what manner of drink this is which our ship contained. It was to thee that I was bringing it as a drink offering, in the hope that, touched with pity,<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />thou mightest send me on my way home; but thou ragest in a way that is past all bearing. Cruel man, how shall any one of all the multitudes of men ever come to thee again hereafter, seeing that thou hast wrought lawlessness?’
“So I spoke, and he took the cup and drained it, and was wondrously pleased as he drank the sweet draught, and asked me for it again a second time:
<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />“‘Give it me again with a ready heart, and tell me thy name straightway, that I may give thee a stranger's gift whereat thou mayest be glad. For among the Cyclopes the earth, the giver of grain, bears the rich clusters of wine, and the rain of Zeus gives them increase; but this is a streamlet of ambrosia and nectar.’</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="360" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />“So he spoke, and again I handed him the flaming wine. Thrice I brought and gave it him, and thrice he drained it in his folly. But when the wine had stolen about the wits of the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, then I spoke to him with gentle words:
“‘<placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, thou askest me of my glorious name, and I<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />will tell it thee; and do thou give me a stranger's gift, even as thou didst promise. Noman is my name, Noman do they call me—my mother and my father, and all my comrades as well.’
“So I spoke, and he straightway answered me with pitiless heart: ‘Noman will I eat last among his comrades,<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />and the others before him; this shall be thy gift.’
“He spoke, and reeling fell upon his back, and lay there with his thick neck bent aslant, and sleep, that conquers all, laid hold on him. And from his gullet came forth wine and bits of human flesh, and he vomited in his drunken sleep.<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />Then verily I thrust in the stake under the deep ashes until it should grow hot, and heartened all my comrades with cheering words, that I might see no man flinch through fear. But when presently that stake of olive-wood was about to catch fire, green though it was, and began to glow terribly,<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />then verily I drew nigh, bringing the stake from the fire, and my comrades stood round me and a god breathed into us great courage. They took the stake of olive-wood, sharp at the point, and thrust it into his eye, while I, throwing my weight upon it from above, whirled it round, as when a man bores a ship's timber<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />with a drill, while those below keep it spinning with the thong, which they lay hold of by either end, and the drill runs around unceasingly. Even so we took the fiery-pointed stake and whirled it around in his eye, and the blood flowed around the heated thing. And his eyelids wholly and his brows round about did the flame singe<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />as the eyeball burned, and its roots crackled in the fire. And as when a smith dips a great axe or an adze in cold water amid loud hissing to temper it—for therefrom comes the strength of iron—even so did his eye hiss round the stake of olive-wood.<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />Terribly then did he cry aloud, and the rock rang around; and we, seized with terror, shrank back, while he wrenched from his eye the stake, all befouled with blood, and flung it from him, wildly waving his arms. Then he called aloud to the Cyclopes, who<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />dwelt round about him in caves among the windy heights, and they heard his cry and came thronging from every side, and standing around the cave asked him what ailed him:
“‘What so sore distress is thine, Polyphemus, that thou criest out thus through the immortal night, and makest us sleepless?<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />Can it be that some mortal man is driving off thy flocks against thy will, or slaying thee thyself by guile or by might?’
“‘Then from out the cave the mighty Polyphemus answered them: ‘My friends, it is Noman that is slaying me by guile and not by force.’</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="409" type="card">
                    <p>
“And they made answer and addressed him with winged words:<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />‘If, then, no man does violence to thee in thy loneliness, sickness which comes from great Zeus thou mayest in no wise escape. Nay, do thou pray to our father, the lord Poseidon.’
“So they spoke and went their way; and my heart laughed within me that my name and cunning device had so beguiled.<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />But the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, groaning and travailing in anguish, groped with his hands and took away the stone from the door, and himself sat in the doorway with arms outstretched in the hope of catching anyone who sought to go forth with the sheep—so witless, forsooth, he thought in his heart to find me.<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />But I took counsel how all might be the very best, if I might haply find some way of escape from death for my comrades and for myself. And I wove all manner of wiles and counsel, as a man will in a matter of life and death; for great was the evil that was nigh us. And this seemed to my mind the best plan.<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />Rams there were, well-fed and thick of fleece, fine beasts and large, with wool dark as the violet. These I silently bound together with twisted withes on which the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, that monster with his heart set on lawlessness, was wont to sleep. Three at a time I took. The one in the middle in each case bore a man,<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />and the other two went, one on either side, saving my comrades. Thus every three sheep bore a man. But as for me—there was a ram, far the best of all the flock; him I grasped by the back, and curled beneath his shaggy belly, lay there face upwards<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />with steadfast heart, clinging fast with my hands to his wondrous fleece. So then, with wailing, we waited for the bright dawn.
“As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, then the males of the flock hastened forth to pasture and the females bleated unmilked about the pens,<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />for their udders were bursting. And their master, distressed with grievous pains, felt along the backs of all the sheep as they stood up before him, but in his folly he marked not this, that my men were bound beneath the breasts of his fleecy sheep. Last of all the flock the ram went forth,<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line" />burdened with the weight of his fleece and my cunning self. And mighty Polyphemus, as he felt along his back, spoke to him, saying:
“‘Good ram, why pray is it that thou goest forth thus through the cave the last of the flock? Thou hast not heretofore been wont to lag behind the sheep, but wast ever far the first to feed on the tender bloom of the grass,<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line" />moving with long strides, and ever the first didst reach the streams of the river, and the first didst long to return to the fold at evening. But now thou art last of all. Surely thou art sorrowing for the eye of thy master, which an evil man blinded along with his miserable fellows, when he had overpowered my wits with wine,<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line" />even Noman, who, I tell thee, has not yet escaped destruction. If only thou couldst feel as I do, and couldst get thee power of speech to tell me where he skulks away from my wrath, then should his brains be dashed on the ground here and there throughout the cave, when I had smitten him, and my heart<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line" />should be lightened of the woes which good-for-naught Noman has brought me.’</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="461" type="card">
                    <p>
“So saying, he sent the ram forth from him. And when we had gone a little way from the cave and the court, I first loosed myself from under the ram and set my comrades free. Speedily then we drove off those long-shanked sheep, rich with fat,<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line" />turning full often to look about until we came to the ship. And welcome to our dear comrades was the sight of us who had escaped death, but for the others they wept and wailed; yet I would not suffer them to weep, but with a frown forbade each man. Rather I bade them<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line" />to fling on board with speed the many sheep of goodly fleece, and sail over the salt water. So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches, and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars. But when I was as far away as a man's voice carries when he shouts, then I spoke to the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> with mocking words:
<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line" />“‘<placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, that man, it seems, was no weakling, whose comrades thou wast minded to devour by brutal strength in thy hollow cave. Full surely were thy evil deeds to fall on thine own head, thou cruel wretch, who didst not shrink from eating thy guests in thine own house. Therefore has Zeus taken vengeance on thee, and the other gods.’
<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line" />“So I spoke, and he waxed the more wroth at heart, and broke off the peak of a high mountain and hurled it at us, and cast it in front of the dark-prowed ship.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> And the sea surged beneath the stone as it fell,<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line" />and the backward flow, like a flood from the deep, bore the ship swiftly landwards and drove it upon the shore. But I seized a long pole in my hands and shoved the ship off and along the shore,<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line" />and with a nod of my head I roused my comrades, and bade them fall to their oars that we might escape out of our evil plight. And they bent to their oars and rowed. But when, as we fared over the sea, we were twice as far distant, then was I fain to call to the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, though round about me my comrades, one after another, sought to check me with gentle words:
“‘Reckless one, why wilt thou provoke to wrath a savage man,<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line" />who but now hurled his missile into the deep and drove our ship back to the land, and verily we thought that we had perished there? And had he heard one of us uttering a sound or speaking, he would have hurled a jagged rock and crushed our heads and the timbers of our ship, so mightily does he throw.’</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="500" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line" />“So they spoke, but they could not persuade my great-hearted spirit; and I answered him again with angry heart:
“‘<placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, if any one of mortal men shall ask thee about the shameful blinding of thine eye, say that Odysseus, the sacker of cities, blinded it,<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line" />even the son of Laertes, whose home is in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>.’
“So I spoke, and he groaned and said in answer:‘Lo now, verily a prophecy uttered long ago is come upon me. There lived here a soothsayer, a good man and tall, Telemus, son of Eurymus, who excelled all men in soothsaying,<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line" />and grew old as a seer among the Cyclopes. He told me that all these things should be brought to pass in days to come, that by the hands of Odysseus I should lose my sight. But I ever looked for some tall and comely man to come hither, clothed in great might,<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line" />but now one that is puny, a man of naught and a weakling, has blinded me of my eye when he had overpowered me with wine. Yet come hither, Odysseus, that I may set before thee gifts of entertainment, and may speed thy sending hence, that the glorious Earth-shaker may grant it thee. For I am his son, and he declares himself my father;<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line" /> and he himself will heal me, if it be his good pleasure, but none other either of the blessed gods or of mortal men.’
“So he spoke, and I answered him and said:‘Would that I were able to rob thee of soul and life, and to send thee to the house of Hades,<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line" />as surely as not even the Earth-shaker shall heal thine eye.’
“So I spoke, and he then prayed to the lord Poseidon, stretching out both his hands to the starry heaven: ‘Hear me, Poseidon, earth-enfolder, thou dark-haired god, if indeed I am thy son and thou declarest thyself my father;<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line" />grant that Odysseus, the sacker of cities, may never reach his home, even the son of Laertes, whose home is in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>; but if it is his fate to see his friends and to reach his well-built house and his native land, late may he come and in evil case, after losing all his comrades,<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line" />in a ship that is another's; and may he find woes in his house.’</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="536" type="card">
                    <p>
“So he spoke in prayer, and the dark-haired god heard him. But the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> lifted on high again a far greater stone, and swung and hurled it, putting into the throw measureless strength. He cast it<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line" />a little behind the dark-prowed ship, and barely missed the end of the steering-oar. And the sea surged beneath the stone as it fell, and the wave bore the ship onward and drove it to the shore.
“Now when we had come to the island, where our other well-benched ships lay all together, and round about them our comrades,<milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line" />ever expecting us, sat weeping, then, on coming thither, we beached our ship on the sands, and ourselves went forth upon the shore of the sea. Then we took from out the hollow ship the flocks of the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, and divided them, that so far as in me lay no man might go defrauded of an equal share.<milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line" />But the ram my well-greaved comrades gave to me alone, when the flocks were divided, as a gift apart; and on the shore I sacrificed him to Zeus, son of Cronos, god of the dark clouds, who is lord of all, and burned the thigh-pieces. Howbeit he heeded not my sacrifice, but was planning how all<milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line" />my well-benched ships might perish and my trusty comrades.
“So, then, all day long till set of sun we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine; but when the sun set and darkness came on, then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea.<milestone ed="p" n="560" unit="line" />And as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, I roused my comrades, and bade them themselves to embark and to loose the stern cables. So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches, and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars.
<milestone ed="p" n="565" unit="line" />“Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, glad to have escaped death, though we had lost our dear comrades.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />“Then to the Aeolian isle we came, where dwelt Aeolus, son of Hippotas, dear to the immortal gods, in a floating island, and all around it is a wall of unbreakable bronze, and the cliff runs up sheer.<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />Twelve children of his, too, there are in the halls, six daughters and six sturdy sons, and he gave his daughters to his sons to wife. These, then, feast continually by their dear father and good mother, and before them lies boundless good cheer.<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />And the house, filled with the savour of feasting, resounds all about even in the outer court by day,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and by night again they sleep beside their chaste wives on blankets and on corded bedsteads. To their city, then, and fair palace did we come, and for a full month he made me welcome and questioned me about each thing,<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />about <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>, and the ships of the Argives, and the return of the Achaeans. And I told him all the tale in due order. But when I, on my part, asked him that I might depart and bade him send me on my way, he, too, denied me nothing, but furthered my sending. He gave me a wallet, made of the hide of an ox nine years old,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> which he flayed,<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />and therein he bound the paths of the blustering winds; for the son of Cronos had made him keeper of the winds, both to still and to rouse whatever one he will. And in my hollow ship he bound it fast with a bright cord of silver, that not a breath might escape, were it never so slight.<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />But for my furtherance he sent forth the breath of the West Wind to blow, that it might bear on their way both ships and men. Yet this he was not to bring to pass, for we were lost through our own folly.
“For nine days we sailed, night and day alike, and now on the tenth our native land came in sight,<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />and lo, we were so near that we saw men tending the beacon fires.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> Then upon me came sweet sleep in my weariness, for I had ever kept in hand the sheet of the ship, and had yielded it to none other of my comrades, that we might the sooner come to our native land. But my comrades meanwhile began to speak one to another,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />and said that I was bringing home for myself gold and silver as gifts from Aeolus, the great-hearted son of Hippotas. And thus would one speak, with a glance at his neighbor:
“‘Out on it, how beloved and honored this man is by all men, to whose city and land soever he comes!<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />Much goodly treasure is he carrying with him from the land of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Troy</placeName> from out the spoil, while we, who have accomplished the same journey as he, are returning, bearing with us empty hands. And now Aeolus has given him these gifts, granting them freely of his love. Nay, come, let us quickly see what is here,<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />what store of gold and silver is in the wallet.’</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="46" type="card">
                    <p>
“So they spoke, and the evil counsel of my comrades prevailed. They loosed the wallet, and all the winds leapt forth, and swiftly the storm-wind seized them and bore them weeping out to sea away from their native land; but as for me,<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />I awoke, and pondered in my goodly heart whether I should fling myself from the ship and perish in the sea, or endure in silence and still remain among the living. However, I endured and abode, and covering my head lay down in the ship. But the ships were borne by an evil blast of wind<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />back to the Aeolian isle; and my comrades groaned.
“There we went ashore and drew water, and straightway my comrades took their meal by the swift ships. But when we had tasted of food and drink, I took with me a herald and one companion<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />and went to the glorious palace of Aeolus, and I found him feasting beside his wife and his children. So we entered the house and sat down by the doorposts on the threshold, and they were amazed at heart, and questioned us:
“‘How hast thou come hither, Odysseus? What cruel god assailed thee?<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />Surely we sent thee forth with kindly care, that thou mightest reach thy native land and thy home, and whatever place thou wouldest.’
“So said they, but I with a sorrowing heart spoke among them and said: ‘Bane did my evil comrades work me, and therewith sleep accursed; but bring ye healing, my friends, for with you is the power.’
<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />“So I spoke and addressed them with gentle words, but they were silent. Then their father answered and said:

“So saying, he sent me forth from the house, groaning heavily. Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart. And worn was the spirit of the men by the grievous rowing, because of our own folly, for no longer appeared any breeze to bear us on our way.<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />So for six days we sailed, night and day alike, and on the seventh we came to the lofty citadel of Lamus, even to Telepylus of the Laestrygonians, where herdsman calls to herdsman as he drives in his flock, and the other answers as he drives his forth. There a man who never slept could have earned a double wage,<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />one by herding cattle, and one by pasturing white sheep; for the out goings of the night and of the day are close together.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>

When we had come thither into the goodly harbor, about which on both sides a sheer cliff runs continuously, and projecting headlands opposite to one another<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />stretch out at the mouth, and the entrance is narrow, then all the rest steered their curved ships in, and the ships were moored within the hollow harbor close together; for therein no wave ever swelled, great or small, but all about was a bright calm.<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />But I alone moored my black ship outside, there on the border of the land, making the cables fast to the rock. Then I climbed to a rugged height, a point of outlook, and there took my stand; from thence no works of oxen or of men appeared; smoke alone we saw springing up from the land.<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />So then I sent forth some of my comrades to go and learn who the men were, who here ate bread upon the earth—two men I chose, and sent with them a third as a herald. Now when they had gone ashore, they went along a smooth road by which wagons were wont to bring wood down to the city from the high mountains.<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />And before the city they met a maiden drawing water, the goodly<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> daughter of Laestrygonian Antiphates, who had come down to the fair-flowing spring Artacia, from whence they were wont to bear water to the town. So they came up to her and spoke to her,<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />and asked her who was king of this folk, and who they were of whom he was lord. And she showed them forth with the high-roofed house of her father. Now when they had entered the glorious house, they found there his wife, huge as the peak of a mountain, and they were aghast at her. At once she called from the place of assembly the glorious Antiphates,<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />her husband, and he devised for them woeful destruction. Straightway he seized one of my comrades and made ready his meal, but the other two sprang up and came in flight to the ships. Then he raised a cry throughout the city, and as they heard it the mighty Laestrygonians came thronging from all sides,<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />a host past counting, not like men but like the Giants. They hurled at us from the cliffs with rocks huge as a man could lift, and at once there rose throughout the ships a dreadful din, alike from men that were dying and from ships that were being crushed. And spearing them like fishes they bore them home, a loathly meal.<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />Now while they were slaying those within the deep harbor, I meanwhile drew my sharp sword from beside my thigh, and cut therewith the cables of my dark-prowed ship; and quickly calling to my comrades bade them fall to their oars, that we might escape from out our evil plight.<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />And they all tossed the sea with their oar-blades in fear of death, and joyfully seaward, away from the beetling cliffs, my ship sped on; but all those other ships were lost together there.</p>

“Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, glad to have escaped death, though we had lost our dear comrades;<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />and we came to the isle of Aeaea, where dwelt fair-tressed Circe, a dread goddess of human speech, own sister to Aeetes of baneful mind; and both are sprung from Helius, who gives light to mortals, and from <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Perse</placeName>, their mother, whom Oceanus begot.<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />Here we put in to shore with our ship in silence, into a harbor where ships may lie, and some god guided us. Then we disembarked, and lay there for two days and two nights, eating our hearts for weariness and sorrow. But when fair-tressed Dawn brought to its birth the third day,<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />then I took my spear and my sharp sword, and quickly went up from the ship to a place of wide prospect, in the hope that I might see the works of men, and hear their voice. So I climbed to a rugged height, a place of outlook, and there took my stand, and I saw smoke rising from the broad-wayed earth<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />in the halls of Circe, through the thick brush and the wood. And I debated in mind and heart, whether I should go and make search, when I had seen the flaming smoke. And as I pondered, this seemed to me to be the better way, to go first to the swift ship and the shore of the sea,<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />and give my comrades their meal, and send them forth to make search. But when, as I went, I was near to the curved ship, then some god took pity on me in my loneliness, and sent a great, high-horned stag into my very path. He was coming down to the river from his pasture in the wood<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />to drink, for the might of the sun oppressed him; and as he came out I struck him on the spine in the middle of the back, and the bronze spear passed right through him, and down he fell in the dust with a moan, and his spirit flew from him. Then I planted my foot upon him,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />and drew the bronze spear forth from the wound, and left it there to lie on the ground. But for myself, I plucked twigs and osiers, and weaving a rope as it were a fathom in length, well twisted from end to end, I bound together the feet of the monstrous beast, and went my way to the black ship, bearing him across my back and<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />leaning on my spear, since in no wise could I hold him on my shoulder with one hand, for he was a very mighty beast. Down I flung him before the ship, and heartened my comrades with gentle words, coming up to each man in turn:
“‘Friends, not yet shall we go down<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />to the house of Hades, despite our sorrows, before the day of fate comes upon us. Nay, come, while there is yet food and drink in our swift ship, let us bethink us of food, that we pine not with hunger.’</p>

                <div2 n="178" type="card">
                    <p>
“So I spoke, and they quickly hearkened to my words. From their faces they drew their cloaks,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />and marvelled at the stag on the shore of the unresting sea, for he was a very mighty beast. But when they had satisfied their eyes with gazing, they washed their hands, and made ready a glorious feast. So then all day long till set of sun we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine.<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />But when the sun set and darkness came on, then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea. And as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, I called my men together, and spoke among them all:
“‘Hearken to my words, comrades, for all your evil plight.<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />My friends, we know not where the darkness is or where the dawn, neither where the sun, who give light to mortals, goes beneath the earth, nor where he rises; but let us straightway take thought if any device be still left us. As for me I think not that there is. For I climbed to a rugged point of outlook, and beheld<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />the island, about which is set as a crown the boundless deep. The isle itself lies low, and in the midst of it my eyes saw smoke through the thick brush and the wood.’
“So I spoke, and their spirit was broken within them, as they remembered the deeds of the Laestrygonian, Antiphates,<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />and the violence of the great-hearted <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, the man-eater. And they wailed aloud, and shed big tears. But no good came of their mourning.
“Then I told off in two bands all my well-greaved comrades, and appointed a leader for each band.<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />Of the one I took command, and of the other godlike Eurylochus. Quickly then we shook lots in a brazen helmet, and out leapt the lot of great-hearted Eurylochus.</p>

                <div2 n="208" type="card">
                    <p>So he set out, and with him went two-and-twenty comrades, all weeping; and they left us behind, lamenting.<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />Within the forest glades they found the house of Circe, built of polished stone in a place of wide outlook,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and round about it were mountain wolves and lions, whom Circe herself had bewitched; for she gave them evil drugs. Yet these beasts did not rush upon my men,<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />but pranced about them fawningly, wagging their long tails. And as when hounds fawn around their master as he comes from a feast, for he ever brings them bits to soothe their temper, so about them fawned the stout-clawed wolves and lions; but they were seized with fear, as they saw the dread monsters.<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />So they stood in the gateway of the fair-tressed goddess, and within they heard Circe singing with sweet voice, as she went to and fro before a great imperishable web, such as is the handiwork of goddesses, finely-woven and beautiful, and glorious. Then among them spoke Polites, a leader of men,<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />dearest to me of my comrades, and trustiest:
“‘Friends, within someone goes to and fro before a great web, singing sweetly, so that all the floor echoes; some goddess it is, or some woman. Come, let us quickly call to her.’
“So he spoke, and they cried aloud, and called to her.<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />And she straightway came forth and opened the bright doors, and bade them in; and all went with her in their folly. Only Eurylochus remained behind, for he suspected that there was a snare. She brought them in and made them sit on chairs and seats, and made for them a potion of cheese and barley meal and yellow honey<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />with Pramnian wine; but in the food she mixed baneful drugs, that they might utterly forget their native land. Now when she had given them the potion, and they had drunk it off, then she presently smote them with her wand, and penned them in the sties. And they had the heads, and voice, and bristles,<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />and shape of swine, but their minds remained unchanged even as before. So they were penned there weeping, and before them Circe flung mast and acorns, and the fruit of the cornel tree, to eat, such things as wallowing swine are wont to feed upon.
“But Eurylochus came back straightway to the swift, black ship,<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />to bring tiding of his comrades and their shameful doom. Not a word could he utter, for all his desire, so stricken to the heart was he with great distress, and his eyes were filled with tears, and his spirit was set on lamentation. But when we questioned him in amazement,<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />then he told the fate of the others, his comrades.
“‘We went through the thickets, as thou badest, noble Odysseus. We found in the forest glades a fair palace, built of polished stones, in a place of wide outlook. There someone was going to and fro before a great web, and singing with clear voice,<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />some goddess or some woman, and they cried aloud, and called to her. And she came forth straightway, and opened the bright doors, and bade them in; and they all went with her in their folly. But I remained behind, for I suspected that there was a snare. Then they all vanished together, nor did one of them<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />appear again, though I sat long and watched.’</p>

                <div2 n="261" type="card">
                    <p>
“So he spoke, and I cast my silver-studded sword about my shoulders, a great sword of bronze, and slung my bow about me, and bade him lead me back by the self-same road. But he clasped me with both hands, and be sought me by my knees,<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />and with wailing he spoke to me winged words:
“‘Lead me not thither against my will, O thou fostered of Zeus, but leave me here. For I know that thou wilt neither come back thyself, nor bring anyone of thy comrades. Nay, with these that are here let us flee with all speed, for still we may haply escape the evil day.’
<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />“So he spoke, but I answered him, and said:‘Eurylochus, do thou stay here in this place, eating and drinking by the hollow, black ship; but I will go, for strong necessity is laid upon me.’
“So saying, I went up from the ship and the sea.<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />But when, as I went through the sacred glades, I was about to come to the great house of the sorceress, Circe, then Hermes, of the golden wand, met me as I went toward the house, in the likeness of a young man with the first down upon his lip, in whom the charm of youth is fairest.<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />He clasped my hand, and spoke, and addressed me:
“‘Whither now again, hapless man, dost thou go alone through the hills, knowing naught of the country? Lo, thy comrades yonder in the house of Circe are penned like swine in close-barred sties. And art thou come to release them? Nay, I tell thee, thou shalt not<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />thyself return, but shalt remain there with the others. But come, I will free thee from harm, and save thee. Here, take this potent herb, and go to the house of Circe, and it shall ward off from thy head the evil day. And I will tell thee all the baneful wiles of Circe.<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />She will mix thee a potion, and cast drugs into the food; but even so she shall not be able to bewitch thee, for the potent herb that I shall give thee will not suffer it. And I will tell thee all. When Circe shall smite thee with her long wand, then do thou draw thy sharp sword from beside thy thigh,<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />and rush upon Circe, as though thou wouldst slay her. And she will be seized with fear, and will bid thee lie with her. Then do not thou thereafter refuse the couch of the goddess, that she may set free thy comrades, and give entertainment to thee. But bid her swear a great oath by the blessed gods,<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />that she will not plot against thee any fresh mischief to thy hurt, lest when she has thee stripped she may render thee a weakling and unmanned.’</p>

                <div2 n="302" type="card">
                    <p>
“So saying, Argeiphontes gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its nature. At the root it was black, but its flower was like milk.<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />Moly the gods call it, and it is hard for mortal men to dig; but with the gods all things are possible. Hermes then departed to high <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> through the wooded isle, and I went my way to the house of Circe, and many things did my heart darkly ponder as I went.<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />So I stood at the gates of the fair-tressed goddess. There I stood and called, and the goddess heard my voice. Straightway then she came forth, and opened the bright doors, and bade me in; and I went with her, my heart sore troubled. She brought me in and made me sit on a silver-studded chair,<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />a beautiful chair, richly wrought, and beneath was a foot-stool for the feet. And she prepared me a potion in a golden cup, that I might drink, and put therein a drug, with evil purpose in her heart. But when she had given it me, and I had drunk it off, yet was not bewitched, she smote me with her wand, and spoke, and addressed me:<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />‘Begone now to the sty, and lie with the rest of thy comrades.’
“So she spoke, but I, drawing my sharp sword from beside my thigh, rushed upon Circe, as though I would slay her. But she, with a loud cry, ran beneath, and clasped my knees, and with wailing she spoke to me winged words:
<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />“‘Who art thou among men, and from whence? Where is thy city, and where thy parents? Amazement holds me that thou hast drunk this charm and wast in no wise bewitched. For no man else soever hath withstood this charm, when once he has drunk it, and it has passed the barrier of his teeth. Nay, but the mind in thy breast is one not to be beguiled.<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />Surely thou art Odysseus, the man of ready device, who Argeiphontes of the golden wand ever said to me would come hither on his way home from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> with his swift, black ship. Nay, come, put up thy sword in its sheath, and let us two then go up into my bed, that couched together<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />in love we may put trust in each other.’
“So she spoke, but I answered her, and said:‘Circe, how canst thou bid me be gentle to thee, who hast turned my comrades into swine in thy halls, and now keepest me here, and with guileful purpose biddest me<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />go to thy chamber, and go up into thy bed, that when thou hast me stripped thou mayest render me a weakling and unmanned? Nay, verily, it is not I that shall be fain to go up into thy bed, unless thou, goddess, wilt consent to swear a mighty oath that thou wilt not plot against me any fresh mischief to my hurt.’</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="345" type="card">

                        <milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />“So I spoke, and she straightway swore the oath to do me no harm, as I bade her. But when she had sworn, and made an end of the oath, then I went up to the beautiful bed of Circe.
“But her handmaids meanwhile were busied in the halls, four maidens who are her serving-women in the house.<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />Children are they of the springs and groves, and of the sacred rivers that flow forth to the sea, and of them one threw upon chairs fair rugs of purple above, and spread beneath them a linen cloth; another drew up before the chairs tables<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />of silver, and set upon them golden baskets; and the third mixed sweet, honey-hearted wine in a bowl of silver, and served out golden cups; and the fourth brought water, and kindled a great fire beneath a large cauldron, and the water grew warm.<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />But when the water boiled in the bright bronze, she set me in a bath, and bathed me with water from out the great cauldron, mixing it to my liking, and pouring it over my head and shoulders, till she took from my limbs soul-consuming weariness. But when she had bathed me, and anointed me richly with oil,<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />and had cast about me a fair cloak and a tunic, she brought me into the hall, and made me sit upon a silver-studded chair—a beautiful chair, richly wrought, and beneath was a foot-stool for the feet. Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />for me to wash, and beside me drew up a polished table. And the grave housewife brought and set before me bread, and therewith meats in abundance, granting freely of her store. Then she bade me eat, but my heart inclined not thereto. Rather, I sat with other thoughts, and my spirit boded ill.
<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />“Now when Circe noted that I sat thus, and did not put forth my hands to the food, but was burdened with sore grief, she came close to me, and spoke winged words:
“‘Why, Odysseus, dost thou sit thus like one that is dumb, eating thy heart, and dost not touch food or drink?<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />Dost thou haply forbode some other guile? Nay, thou needest in no wise fear, for already have I sworn a mighty oath to do thee no harm.’
“So she spoke, but I answered her, and said:‘Circe, what man that is right-minded could bring himself to taste of food or drink,<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />ere yet he had won freedom for his comrades, and beheld them before his face? But if thou of a ready heart dost bid me eat and drink, set them free, that mine eyes may behold my trusty comrades.’</p>

                <div2 n="388" type="card">

“So I spoke, and Circe went forth through the hall holding her wand in her hand, and opened the doors of the sty,<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />and drove them out in the form of swine of nine years old. So they stood there before her, and she went through the midst of them, and anointed each man with another charm. Then from their limbs the bristles fell away which the baneful drug that queenly Circe gave them had before made to grow,<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />and they became men again, younger than they were before, and far comelier and taller to look upon. They knew me, and clung to my hands, each man of them, and upon them all came a passionate sobbing, and the house about them rang wondrously, and the goddess herself was moved to pity.
<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />“Then the beautiful goddess drew near me, and said: ‘Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, go now to thy swift ship and to the shore of the sea. First of all do ye draw the ship up on the land, and store your goods and all the tackling in caves.<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />Then come back thyself, and bring thy trusty comrades.’
“So she spoke, and my proud heart consented. I went my way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea, and there I found my trusty comrades by the swift ship, wailing piteously, shedding big tears.<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />And as when calves in a farmstead sport about the droves of cows returning to the yard, when they have had their fill of grazing—all together they frisk before them, and the pens no longer hold them, but with constant lowing they run about their mothers—so those men, when their eyes beheld me,<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />thronged about me weeping, and it seemed to their hearts as though they had got to their native land, and the very city of rugged <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, where they were bred and born. And with wailing they spoke to me winged words:
“‘At thy return, O thou fostered of Zeus, we are as glad<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />as though we had returned to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, our native land. But come, tell the fate of the others, our comrades.’
“So they spoke, and I answered them with gentle words: ‘First of all let us draw the ship up on the land, and store our goods and all the tackling in caves.<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />Then haste you, one and all, to go with me that you may see your comrades in the sacred halls of Circe, drinking and eating, for they have unfailing store.’</p>

                <div2 n="428" type="card">
                    <p>
“So I spoke, and they quickly hearkened to my words. Eurylochus alone sought to hold back all my comrades,<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" /> and he spoke, and addressed them with winged words:
“‘Ah, wretched men, whither are we going? Why are you so enamoured of these woes, as to go down to the house of Circe, who will change us all to swine, or wolves, or lions, that so we may guard her great house perforce?<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />Even so did the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, when our comrades went to his fold, and with them went this reckless Odysseus. For it was through this man's folly that they too perished.’
“So he spoke, and I pondered in heart, whether to draw my long sword from beside my stout thigh,<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />and therewith strike off his head, and bring it to the ground, near kinsman of mine by marriage though he was; but my comrades one after another sought to check me with gentle words:
“‘O thou sprung from Zeus, as for this man, we will leave him, if thou so biddest, to abide here by the ship, and to guard the ship,<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line" />but as for us, do thou lead us to the sacred house of Circe.’
“So saying, they went up from the ship and the sea. Nor was Eurylochus left beside the hollow ship, but he went with us, for he feared my dread reproof.
“Meanwhile in her halls Circe<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line" />bathed the rest of my comrades with kindly care, and anointed them richly with oil, and cast about them fleecy cloaks and tunics; and we found them all feasting bountifully in the halls. But when they saw and recognized one another, face to face, they wept and wailed, and the house rang around.<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line" />Then the beautiful goddess drew near me, and said:
“‘No longer now do ye rouse this plenteous lamenting. Of myself I know both all the woes you have suffered on the teeming deep, and all the wrong that cruel men have done you on the land.<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line" />Nay, come, eat food and drink wine, until you once more get spirit in your breasts such as when at the first you left your native land of rugged <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>; but now ye are withered and spiritless, ever thinking of your weary wanderings, nor are your<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line" />hearts ever joyful, for verily ye have suffered much.’
“So she spoke, and our proud hearts consented. So there day after day for a full year we abode, feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine. But when a year was gone and the seasons turned,<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line" />as the months waned and the long days were brought in their course, then my trusty comrades called me forth, and said:
“‘Strange man, bethink thee now at last of thy native land, if it is fated for thee to be saved, and to reach thy high-roofed house and thy native land.’</p>

But when the sun set and darkness came on, they lay down to sleep throughout the shadowy halls,<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line" />but I went up to the beautiful bed of Circe, and besought her by her knees; and the goddess heard my voice, and I spoke, and addressed her with winged words:
“‘Circe, fulfil for me the promise which thou gavest to send me home; for my spirit is now eager to be gone,<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line" />and the spirit of my comrades, who make my heart to pine, as they sit about me mourning, whensoever thou haply art not at hand.’
“So I spoke, and the beautiful goddess straightway made answer: ‘Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, abide ye now no longer in my house against your will;<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line" />but you must first complete another journey, and come to the house of Hades and dread Persephone, to seek soothsaying of the spirit of Theban Teiresias, the blind seer, whose mind abides steadfast. To him even in death Persephone has granted reason,<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line" />that he alone should have understanding; but the others flit about as shadows.’
“So she spoke, and my spirit was broken within me, and I wept as I sat on the bed, nor had my heart any longer desire to live and behold the light of the sun. But when I had my fill of weeping and writhing,<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line" />then I made answer, and addressed her, saying:
“‘O Circe, who will guide us on this journey? To Hades no man ever yet went in a black ship.’</p>

But when in thy ship thou hast now crossed the stream of Oceanus, where is a level shore and the groves of Persephone—<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line" />tall poplars, and willows that shed their fruit—there do thou beach thy ship by the deep eddying Oceanus, but go thyself to the dank house of Hades. There into <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName> flow Periphlegethon and Cocytus, which is a branch of the water of the Styx;<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line" />and there is a rock, and the meeting place of the two roaring rivers. Thither, prince, do thou draw nigh, as I bid thee, and dig a pit of a cubit's length this way and that, and around it pour a libation to all the dead, first with milk and honey, thereafter with sweet wine,<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line" />and in the third place with water, and sprinkle thereon white barley meal.

But when with prayers thou hast made supplication to the glorious tribes of the dead, then sacrifice a ram and a black ewe, turning their heads toward Erebus but thyself turning backward, and setting thy face towards the streams of the river. Then many<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line" />ghosts of men that are dead will come forth.

“So she spoke, and straightway came golden-throned Dawn.

“‘No longer now sleep ye, and drowse in sweet slumber, but let us go; lo! queenly Circe has told me all.’
<milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line" />“So I spoke, and their proud hearts consented. But not even from thence could I lead my men unscathed. There was one, Elpenor, the youngest of all, not over valiant in war nor sound of understanding, who had laid him down apart from his comrades in the sacred house of Circe,<milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line" />seeking the cool air, for he was heavy with wine. He heard the noise and the bustle of his comrades as they moved about, and suddenly sprang up, and forgot to go to the long ladder that he might come down again, but fell headlong from the roof, and his neck<milestone ed="p" n="560" unit="line" />was broken away from the spine, and his spirit went down to the house of Hades.
“But as my men were going on their way I spoke among them, saying: ‘Ye think, forsooth, that ye are going to your dear native land; but Circe has pointed out for us another journey, even to the house of Hades and dread Persephone,<milestone ed="p" n="565" unit="line" />to consult the spirit of Theban Teiresias.’
“So I spoke, and their spirit was broken within them, and sitting down right where they were, they wept and tore their hair. But no good came of their lamenting.
“But when we were on our way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea,<milestone ed="p" n="570" unit="line" />sorrowing and shedding big tears, meanwhile Circe had gone forth and made fast beside the black ship a ram and a black ewe, for easily had she passed us by.

And for our aid in the wake of our dark-prowed ship a fair wind that filled the sail, a goodly comrade, was sent by fair-tressed Circe, dread goddess of human speech. So when we had made fast all the tackling throughout the ship,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />we sat down, and the wind and the helms man made straight her course. All the day long her sail was stretched as she sped over the sea; and the sun set and all the ways grew dark.
“She came to deep-flowing Oceanus, that bounds the Earth,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> where is the land and city of the Cimmerians,<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />wrapped in mist and cloud. Never does the bright sun look down on them with his rays either when he mounts the starry heaven or when he turns again to earth from heaven, but baneful night is spread over wretched mortals.<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />Thither we came and beached our ship, and took out the sheep, and ourselves went beside the stream of Oceanus until we came to the place of which Circe had told us.
“Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sharp sword from beside my thigh,<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />and dug a pit of a cubit's length this way and that, and around it poured a libation to all the dead, first with milk and honey, thereafter with sweet wine, and in the third place with water, and I sprinkled thereon white barley meal.

But when with vows and prayers<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />I had made supplication to the tribes of the dead, I took the sheep and cut their throats over the pit, and the dark blood ran forth. Then there gathered from out of Erebus the spirits of those that are dead, brides, and unwedded youths, and toil-worn old men, and tender maidens with hearts yet new to sorrow,<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />and many, too, that had been wounded with bronze-tipped spears, men slain in fight, wearing their blood-stained armour. These came thronging in crowds about the pit from every side, with a wondrous cry; and pale fear seized me. Then I called to my comrades and bade them flay and burn<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />the sheep that lay there slain with the pitiless bronze, and to make prayer to the gods, to mighty Hades and dread Persephone.

“The first to come was the spirit of my comrade Elpenor.

“‘Elpenor, how didst thou come beneath the murky darkness? Thou coming on foot hast out-stripped me in my black ship.’
“So I spoke, and with a groan he answered me and said:<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />‘Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, an evil doom of some god was my undoing, and measureless wine. When I had lain down to sleep in the house of Circe I did not think to go to the long ladder that I might come down again, but fell headlong from the roof, and my neck<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />was broken away from the spine and my spirit went down to the house of Hades. Now I beseech thee by those whom we left behind, who are not present with us, by thy wife and thy father who reared thee when a babe, and by Telemachus whom thou didst leave an only son in thy halls; for I know that as thou goest hence from the house of Hades<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />thou wilt touch at the Aeaean isle with thy well-built ship. There, then, O prince, I bid thee remember me. Leave me not behind thee unwept and unburied as thou goest thence, and turn not away from me, lest haply I bring the wrath of the gods upon thee. Nay, burn me with my armour, all that is mine,<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />and heap up a mound for me on the shore of the grey sea, in memory of an unhappy man, that men yet to be may learn of me.

“So he spoke, and I made answer and said:<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />‘All this, unhappy man, will I perform and do.’
“Thus we two sat and held sad converse one with the other, I on one side holding my sword over the blood, while on the other side the phantom of my comrade spoke at large.
“Then there came up the spirit of my dead mother,<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />Anticleia, the daughter of great-hearted Autolycus, whom I had left alive when I departed for sacred <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>.

<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />“Then there came up the spirit of the Theban Teiresias, bearing his golden staff in his hand, and he knew me and spoke to me: ‘Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, what now, hapless man?

<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />“‘Thou askest of thy honey-sweet return, glorious Odysseus, but this shall a god make grievous unto thee; for I think not that thou shalt elude the Earth-shaker, seeing that he has laid up wrath in his heart against thee, angered that thou didst blind his dear son. Yet even so ye may reach home, though in evil plight,<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />if thou wilt curb thine own spirit and that of thy comrades, as soon as thou shalt bring thy well-built ship to the island Thrinacia, escaping from the violet sea, and ye find grazing there the kine and goodly flocks of Helios, who over sees and overhears all things.<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />If thou leavest these unharmed and heedest thy homeward way, verily ye may yet reach <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, though in evil plight.

I see here the spirit of my dead mother; she sits in silence near the blood, and deigns not to look upon the face of her own son or to speak to him. Tell me, prince, how she may recognize that I am he?’
<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />“So I spoke, and he straightway made answer, and said: ‘Easy is the word that I shall say and put in thy mind.

<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />“‘My child, how didst thou come beneath the murky darkness, being still alive? Hard is it for those that live to behold these realms, for between are great rivers and dread streams; Oceanus first, which one may in no wise cross on foot, but only if one have a well-built ship.<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />Art thou but now come hither from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> after long wanderings with thy ship and thy companions? and hast thou not yet reached <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, nor seen thy wife in thy halls?’

But the fair honor that was thine no man yet possesses,<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />but Telemachus holds thy demesne unharassed, and feasts a equal banquets, such as it is fitting that one who deals judgment should share, for all men invite him. But thy father abides there in the tilled land, and comes not to the city, nor has he, for bedding, bed and cloaks and bright coverlets,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />but through the winter he sleeps in the house, where the slaves sleep, in the ashes by the fire, and wears upon his body mean raiment. But when summer comes and rich autumn, then all about the slope of his vineyard plot are strewn his lowly beds of fallen leaves.<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />There he lies sorrowing, and nurses his great grief in his heart, in longing for thy return, and heavy old age has come upon him.

<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />“So I spoke, and my honored mother straightway answered: ‘Ah me, my child, ill-fated above all men, in no wise does Persephone, the daughter of Zeus, deceive thee, but this is the appointed way with mortals when one dies. For the sinews no longer hold the flesh and the bones together,<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />but the strong might of blazing fire destroys these, as soon as the life leaves the white bones, and the spirit, like a dream, flits away, and hovers to and fro.

I drew my long sword from beside my stout thigh, and would not suffer them to drink of the dark blood all at one time. So they drew near, one after the other, and each declared her birth, and I questioned them all.
<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />“Then verily the first that I saw was high-born Tyro, who said that she was the daughter of noble Salmoneus, and declared herself to be the wife of Cretheus, son of Aeolus.

But when the god had ended his work of love, he clasped her hand, and spoke, and addressed her:

These do thou tend and rear. But now go to thy house, and hold thy peace, and tell no man; but know that I am Poseidon, the shaker of the earth.’
“So saying, he plunged beneath the surging sea.

“And I saw beauteous Chloris, whom once Neleus wedded because of her beauty, when he had brought countless gifts of wooing.

But as often as we fought with the bronze on the Trojan plain, he would never remain behind in the throng or press of men,<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line" />but would ever run forth far to the front, yielding to none in his might; and many men he slew in dread combat.

And again, when we, the best of the Argives, were about to go down into the horse which Epeus made, and the command of all was laid upon me,<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line" />both to open and to close the door of our stout-built ambush, then the other leaders and counsellors of the Danaans would wipe away tears from their eyes, and each man's limbs shook beneath him, but never did my eyes see his fair face grow pale at all, nor see him<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line" />wiping tears from his cheeks; but he earnestly besought me to let him go forth from the horse, and kept handling his sword-hilt and his spear heavy with bronze, and was eager to work harm to the Trojans. But after we had sacked the lofty city of Priam, he went on board his ship with his share of the spoil and a goodly prize—<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line" />all unscathed he was, neither smitten with the sharp spear nor wounded in close fight, as often befalls in war; for Ares rages confusedly.’</p>

“So I spoke, and the spirit of the son of Aeacus departed with long strides over the field of asphodel,<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line" />joyful in that I said that his son was preeminent.
“And other spirits of those dead and gone stood sorrowing, and each asked of those dear to him.

To him I spoke with soothing words:
“‘Aias, son of peerless Telamon, wast thou then not even in death to forget thy wrath against me because of<milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line" />those accursed arms? Surely the gods set them to be a bane to the Argives: such a tower of strength was lost to them in thee; and for thee in death we Achaeans sorrow unceasingly, even as for the life of Achilles, son of Peleus. Yet no other is to blame but Zeus,<milestone ed="p" n="560" unit="line" />who bore terrible hatred against the host of Danaan spearmen, and brought on thee thy doom. Nay, come hither, prince, that thou mayest hear my word and my speech; and subdue thy wrath and thy proud spirit.’
“So I spoke, but he answered me not a word, but went his way to Erebus to join the other spirits of those dead and gone.<milestone ed="p" n="565" unit="line" />Then would he nevertheless have spoken to me for all his wrath, or I to him, but the heart in my breast was fain to see the spirits of those others that are dead.</p>

“As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, then I sent forth my comrades to the house of Circe<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />to fetch the body of the dead Elpenor.

And thereby has no ship of men ever yet escaped that has come thither, but the planks of ships and bodies of men are whirled confusedly by the waves of the sea and the blasts of baneful fire. One seafaring ship alone has passed thereby,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />that <placeName key="tgn,1094163">Argo</placeName> famed of all, on her voyage from Aeetes, and even her the wave would speedily have dashed there against the great crags, had not Here sent her through, for that Jason was dear to her.</p>

“‘Now on the other path are two cliffs, one of which reaches with its sharp peak to the broad heaven, and a dark cloud surrounds it.<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />This never melts away, nor does clear sky ever surround that peak in summer or in harvest time. No mortal man could scale it or set foot upon the top, not though he had twenty hands and feet; for the rock is smooth, as if it were polished.<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />And in the midst of the cliff is a dim cave, turned to the West, toward Erebus, even where you shall steer your hollow ship, glorious Odysseus. Not even a man of might could shoot an arrow from the hollow ship so as to reach into that vaulted cave.<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />Therein dwells Scylla, yelping terribly. Her voice is indeed but as the voice of a new-born whelp, but she herself is an evil monster, nor would anyone be glad at sight of her, no, not though it were a god that met her. Verily she has twelve feet, all misshapen,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />and six necks, exceeding long, and on each one an awful head, and therein three rows of teeth, thick and close, and full of black death. Up to her middle she is hidden in the hollow cave, but she holds her head out beyond the dread chasm,<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />and fishes there, eagerly searching around the rock for dolphins and sea-dogs and whatever greater beast she may haply catch, such creatures as deep-moaning Amphitrite rears in multitudes past counting. By her no sailors yet may boast that they have fled unscathed in their ship, for with each head she carries off<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />a man, snatching him from the dark-prowed ship.
“‘But the other cliff, thou wilt note, Odysseus, is lower—they are close to each other; thou couldst even shoot an arrow across—and on it is a great fig tree with rich foliage, but beneath this divine Charybdis sucks down the black water.<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />Thrice a day she belches it forth, and thrice she sucks it down terribly. Mayest thou not be there when she sucks it down, for no one could save thee from ruin, no, not the Earth-shaker. Nay, draw very close to Scylla's cliff, and drive thy ship past quickly; for it is better far<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />to mourn six comrades in thy ship than all together.’</p>

“So she spoke, but I made answer and said:‘Come, I pray thee, goddess, tell me this thing truly, if in any wise I might escape from fell Charybids, and ward off that other, when she works harm to my comrades.’
<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />“So I spoke, and the beautiful goddess answered and said: ‘Rash man, lo, now again thy heart is set on the deeds of war and on toil. Wilt thou not yield even to the immortal gods? She is not mortal, but an immortal bane, dread, and dire, and fierce, and not to be fought with;<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />there is no defence; to flee from her is bravest. For if thou tarriest to arm thyself by the cliff, I fear lest she may again dart forth and attack thee with as many heads and seize as many men as before. Nay, row past with all thy might, and call upon Crataiis,<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />the mother of Scylla, who bore her for a bane to mortals. Then will she keep her from darting forth again.
“‘And thou wilt come to the isle Thrinacia. There in great numbers feed the kine of Helios and his goodly flocks, seven herds of kine and as many fair flocks of sheep,<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />and fifty in each. These bear no young, nor do they ever die, and goddesses are their shepherds, fair-tressed nymphs, Phaethusa and Lampetie, whom beautiful Neaera bore to Helios Hyperion. These their honored mother, when she had borne and reared them,<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />sent to the isle Thrinacia to dwell afar, and keep the flocks of their father and his sleek kine. If thou leavest these unharmed and heedest thy homeward way, verily ye may yet reach <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, though in evil plight. But if thou harmest them, then I foretell ruin<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />for thy ship and for thy comrades, and even if thou shalt thyself escape, late shalt thou come home and in evil case, after losing all thy comrades.’
“So she spoke, and presently came golden-throned Dawn. Then the beautiful goddess departed up the island, but I went to the ship and roused my comrades<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />themselves to embark and to loose the stern cables. So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches, and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars. And for our aid in the wake of our dark-prowed ship a fair wind that filled the sail, a goodly comrade, was sent<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />by fair-tressed Circe, dread goddess of human speech. So when we had straightway made fast all the tackling throughout the ship we sat down, but the wind and the helmsman guided the ship.</p>

                <div2 n="153" type="card">
                    <p>
“Then verily I spoke among my comrades, grieved at heart: ‘Friends, since it is not right that one or two alone should know<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />the oracles that Circe, the beautiful goddess, told me, therefore will I tell them, in order that knowing them we may either die or, shunning death and fate, escape. First she bade us avoid the voice of the wondrous Sirens, and their flowery meadow.<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />Me alone she bade to listen to their voice; but do ye bind me with grievous bonds, that I may abide fast where I am, upright in the step of the mast, and let the ropes be made fast at the ends to the mast itself; and if I implore and bid you to loose me, then do ye tie me fast with yet more bonds.’
<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />“Thus I rehearsed all these things and told them to my comrades. Meanwhile the well-built ship speedily came to the isle of the two Sirens, for a fair and gentle wind bore her on. Then presently the wind ceased and there was a windless calm, and a god lulled the waves to sleep.<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />But my comrades rose up and furled the sail and stowed it in the hollow ship, and thereafter sat at the oars and made the water white with their polished oars of fir. But I with my sharp sword cut into small bits a great round cake of wax, and kneaded it with my strong hands,<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />and soon the wax grew warm, forced by the strong pressure and the rays of the lord Helios Hyperion.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> Then I anointed with this the ears of all my comrades in turn; and they bound me in the ship hand and foot, upright in the step of the mast, and made the ropes fast at the ends to the mast itself;<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />and themselves sitting down smote the grey sea with their oars. But when we were as far distant as a man can make himself heard when he shouts, driving swiftly on our way, the Sirens failed not to note the swift ship as it drew near, and they raised their clear-toned song:
“‘Come hither, as thou farest, renowned Odysseus, great glory of the Achaeans;<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />stay thy ship that thou mayest listen to the voice of us two. For never yet has any man rowed past this isle in his black ship until he has heard the sweet voice from our lips. Nay, he has joy of it, and goes his way a wiser man. For we know all the toils that in wide <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />the Argives and Trojans endured through the will of the gods, and we know all things that come to pass upon the fruitful earth.’</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="192" type="card">
                    <p>
“So they spoke, sending forth their beautiful voice, and my heart was fain to listen, and I bade my comrades loose me, nodding to them with my brows; but they fell to their oars and rowed on.<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />And presently Perimedes and Eurylochus arose and bound me with yet more bonds and drew them tighter. But when they had rowed past the Sirens, and we could no more hear their voice or their song, then straightway my trusty comrades took away the<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />wax with which I had anointed their ears and loosed me from my bonds.
“But when we had left the island, I presently saw smoke and a great billow, and heard a booming. Then from the hands of my men in their terror the oars flew, and splashed one and all in the swirl, and<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />the ship stood still where it was, when they no longer plied with their hands the tapering oars. But I went through the ship and cheered my men with gentle words, coming up to each man in turn:
“‘Friends, hitherto we have been in no wise ignorant of sorrow; surely this evil that besets us now is no greater than when the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />penned us in his hollow cave by brutal strength; yet even thence we made our escape through my valor and counsel and wit; these dangers, too, methinks we shall some day remember. But now come, as I bid, let us all obey. Do you keep your seats on the benches<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />and smite with your oars the deep surf of the sea, in the hope that Zeus may grant us to escape and avoid this death. And to thee, steersman, I give this command, and do thou lay it to heart, since thou wieldest the steering oar of the hollow ship. From this smoke and surf keep<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />the ship well away and hug the cliff, lest, ere thou know it, the ship swerve off to the other side and thou cast us into destruction.’
“So I spoke, and they quickly hearkened to my words. But of Scylla I went not on to speak, a cureless bane, lest haply my comrades, seized with fear, should cease<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />from rowing and huddle together in the hold. Then verily I forgot the hard command of Circe, whereas she bade me in no wise to arm myself; but when I had put on my glorious armour and grasped in my hand two long spears, I went to the fore-deck of the ship,<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />whence I deemed that Scylla of the rock would first be seen, who was to bring ruin upon my comrades. But nowhere could I descry her, and my eyes grew weary as I gazed everywhere toward the misty rock.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="234" type="card">
                    <p>
“We then sailed on up the narrow strait with wailing.<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />For on one side lay Scylla and on the other divine Charybdis terribly sucked down the salt water of the sea. Verily whenever she belched it forth, like a cauldron on a great fire she would seethe and bubble in utter turmoil, and high over head the spray would fall on the tops of both the cliffs.<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />But as often as she sucked down the salt water of the sea, within she could all be seen in utter turmoil, and round about the rock roared terribly, while beneath the earth appeared black with sand; and pale fear seized my men. So we looked toward her and feared destruction;<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />but meanwhile Scylla seized from out the hollow ship six of my comrades who were the best in strength and in might. Turning my eyes to the swift ship and to the company of my men,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> even then I noted above me their feet and hands as they were raised aloft. To me they cried aloud, calling upon me<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />by name for that last time in anguish of heart. And as a fisher on a jutting rock, when he casts in his baits as a snare to the little fishes, with his long pole lets down into the sea the horn of an ox of the steading,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> and then as he catches a fish flings it writhing ashore,<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />even so were they drawn writhing up towards the cliffs. Then at her doors she devoured them shrieking and stretching out their hands toward me in their awful death-struggle. Most piteous did mine eyes behold that thing of all that I bore while I explored the paths of the sea.
<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />“Now when we had escaped the rocks, and dread Charybdis and Scylla, presently then we came to the goodly island of the god, where were the fair kine, broad of brow, and the many goodly flocks of Helios Hyperion. Then while I was still out at sea in my black ship,<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />I heard the lowing of the cattle that were being stalled and the bleating of the sheep, and upon my mind fell the words of the blind seer, Theban Teiresias, and of Aeaean Circe, who very straitly charged me to shun the island of Helios, who gives joy to mortals.<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />Then verily I spoke among my comrades, grieved at heart:
“‘Hear my words, comrades, for all your evil plight, that I may tell you the oracles of Teiresias and of Aeaean Circe, who very straitly charged me to shun the island of Helios, who gives joy to mortals;<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />for there, she said, was our most terrible bane. Nay, row the black ship out past the island.’</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="277" type="card">
                    <p>
“So I spoke, but their spirit was broken within them, and straightway Eurylochus answered me with hateful words:
“‘Hardy art thou, Odysseus; thou hast strength beyond that of other men and thy limbs never<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />grow weary. Verily thou art wholly wrought of iron, seeing that thou sufferest not thy comrades, worn out with toil and drowsiness, to set foot on shore, where on this sea-girt isle we might once more make ready a savoury supper; but thou biddest us even as we are to wander on through the swift night,<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />driven away from the island over the misty deep. It is from the night that fierce winds are born, wreckers of ships. How could one escape utter destruction, if haply there should suddenly come a blast of the South Wind or the blustering <placeName key="tgn,2081336">West Wind</placeName>, which oftenest<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />wreck ships in despite of the sovereign gods? Nay, verily for this time let us yield to black night and make ready our supper, remaining by the swift ship, and in the morning we will go aboard, and put out into the broad sea.’
“So spoke Eurylochus, and the rest of my comrades gave assent.<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />Then verily I knew that some god was assuredly devising ill, and I spoke and addressed him with winged words:
“‘Eurylochus, verily ye constrain me, who stand alone. But come now, do ye all swear to me a mighty oath, to the end that, if we haply find a herd of kine or a great flock of sheep,<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />no man may slay either cow or sheep in the blind folly of his mind; but be content to eat the food which immortal Circe gave.’
“So I spoke; and they straightway swore that they would not, even as I bade them. But when they had sworn and made an end of the oath,<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />we moored our well-built ship in the hollow harbor near a spring of sweet water, and my comrades went forth from the ship and skilfully made ready their supper. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, then they fell to weeping, as they remembered their dear comrades<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />whom Scylla had snatched from out the hollow ship and devoured; and sweet sleep came upon them as they wept. But when it was the third watch of the night, and the stars had turned their course, Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, roused against us a fierce wind with a wondrous tempest, and hid with clouds<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />the land and sea alike, and night rushed down from heaven. And as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, we dragged our ship, and made her fast in a hollow cave, where were the fair dancing-floors and seats of the nymphs. Then I called my men together and spoke among them:
<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />“‘Friends, in our swift ship is meat and drink; let us therefore keep our hands from those kine lest we come to harm, for these are the cows and goodly sheep of a dread god, even of Helios, who oversees all things and overhears all things.’
“So I spoke, and their proud hearts consented.<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />Then for a full month the South Wind blew unceasingly, nor did any other wind arise except the East and the South.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="327" type="card">
                    <p>
“Now so long as my men had grain and red wine they kept their hands from the kine, for they were eager to save their lives.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> But when all the stores had been consumed from out the ship,<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />and now they must needs roam about in search of game, fishes, and fowl, and whatever might come to their hands—fishing with bent hooks, for hunger pinched their bellies—then I went apart up the island that I might pray to the gods in the hope that one of them might show me a way to go.<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />And when, as I went through the island, I had got away from my comrades, I washed my hands in a place where there was shelter from the wind, and prayed to all the gods that hold <placeName key="tgn,2109778">Olympus</placeName>; but they shed sweet sleep upon my eyelids. And meanwhile Eurylochus began to give evil counsel to my comrades:
<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />“‘Hear my words, comrades, for all your evil plight. All forms of death are hateful to wretched mortals, but to die of hunger, and so meet one's doom, is the most pitiful. Nay, come, let us drive off the best of the kine of Helios and offer sacrifice to the immortals who hold broad heaven.<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" /> And if we ever reach <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName>, our native land, we will straightway build a rich temple to Helios Hyperion and put therein many goodly offerings. And if haply he be wroth at all because of his straight-horned kine, and be minded to destroy our ship, and the other gods consent,<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />rather would I lose my life once for all with a gulp at the wave, than pine slowly away in a desert isle.’
“So spoke Eurylochus, and the rest of my comrades gave assent. Straightway they drove off the best of the kine of Helios from near at hand, for not far from the dark-prowed ship<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />were grazing the fair, sleek kine, broad of brow. Around these, then, they stood and made prayer to the gods, plucking the tender leaves from off a high-crested oak;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> for they had no white barley on board the well-benched ship. Now when they had prayed and had cut the throats of the kine and flayed them,<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />they cut out the thigh-pieces and covered them with a double layer of fat and laid raw flesh upon them. They had no wine to pour over the blazing sacrifice, but they made libations with water, and roasted all the entrails over the fire. </p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="364" type="card">
                    <p>Now when the thighs were wholly burned and they had tasted the inner parts,<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />they cut up the rest and spitted it. Then it was that sweet sleep fled from my eyelids, and I went my way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea. But when, as I went, I drew near to the curved ship, then verily the hot savour of the fat was wafted about me,<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />and I groaned and cried aloud to the immortal gods:
“‘Father Zeus and ye other blessed gods that are for ever, verily it was for my ruin that ye lulled me in pitiless sleep, while my comrades remaining behind have contrived a monstrous deed.’
“Swiftly then to Helios Hyperion came<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />Lampetie of the long robes, bearing tidings that we had slain his kine; and straightway he spoke among the immortals, wroth at heart:
“‘Father Zeus and ye other blessed gods that are for ever, take vengeance now on the comrades of Odysseus, son of Laertes, who have insolently slain my kine, in which I<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />ever took delight, when I went toward the starry heaven and when I turned back again to earth from heaven. If they do not pay me fit atonement for the kine I will go down to Hades and shine among the dead.’
“Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered him and said:<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />‘Helios, do thou verily shine on among the immortals and among mortal men upon the earth, the giver of grain. As for these men I will soon smite their swift ship with my bright thunder-bolt, and shatter it to pieces in the midst of the wine-dark sea.’
“This I heard from fair-haired Calypso,<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />and she said that she herself had heard it from the messenger Hermes.
“But when I had come down to the ship and to the sea I upbraided my men, coming up to each in turn, but we could find no remedy—the kine were already dead. For my men, then, the gods straightway shewed forth portents.<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />The hides crawled, the flesh, both roast and raw, bellowed upon the spits, and there was a lowing as of kine.</p>

“For six days, then, my trusty comrades feasted on the best of the kine of Helios which they had driven off. But when Zeus, the son of Cronos, brought upon us the seventh day,<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />then the wind ceased to blow tempestuously, and we straightway went on board, and put out into the broad sea when we had set up the mast and hoisted the white sail.
“But when we had left that island and no other land appeared, but only sky and sea,<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />then verily the son of Cronos set a black cloud above the hollow ship, and the sea grew dark beneath it. She ran on for no long time, for straightway came the shrieking <placeName key="tgn,2081336">West Wind</placeName>, blowing with a furious tempest, and the blast of the wind snapped both the fore-stays of the mast,<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />so that the mast fell backward and all its tackling was strewn in the bilge. On the stern of the ship the mast struck the head of the pilot and crushed all the bones of his skull together, and like a diver he fell from the deck and his proud spirit left his bones.<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />Therewith Zeus thundered and hurled his bolt upon the ship, and she quivered from stem to stern, smitten by the bolt of Zeus, and was filled with sulphurous smoke, and my comrades fell from out the ship. Like sea-crows they were borne on the waves about the black ship, and the god took from them their returning.<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />But I kept pacing up and down the ship till the surge tore the sides from the keel, and the wave bore her on dismantled and snapped the mast off at the keel; but over the mast had been flung the back-stay fashioned of ox-hide; with this I lashed the two together, both keel and mast,<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />and sitting on these was borne by the direful winds.</p>

All night long was I borne, and at the rising of the sun<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />I came to the cliff of Scylla and to dread <placeName key="tgn,2233588">Charybdis</placeName>. She verily sucked down the salt water of the sea, but I, springing up to the tall fig-tree, laid hold of it, and clung to it like a bat.

At the hour when a man rises from the assembly for his supper,<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />one that decides the many quarrels of young men that seek judgment, even at that hour those spars appeared from out <placeName key="tgn,2233588">Charybdis</placeName>.

And to each man of you that in my halls are ever wont to drink the flaming wine of the elders, and to listen to the minstrel, I speak, and give this charge.<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />Raiment for the stranger lies already stored in the polished chest, with gold curiously wrought and all the other gifts which the counsellors of the Phaeacians brought hither. But, come now, let us give him a great tripod and a cauldron, each man of us, and we in turn will gather the cost from among the people,<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />and repay ourselves. It were hard for one man to give freely, without requital.”
So spake Alcinous, and his word was pleasing to them. They then went, each man to his house, to take their rest; but as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, they hastened to the ship and brought the bronze, that gives strength to men.<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />And the strong and mighty Alcinous went himself throughout the ship, and carefully stowed the gifts beneath the benches, that they might not hinder any of the crew at their rowing, when they busily plied the oars. Then they went to the house of Alcinous, and prepared a feast.
And for them the strong and mighty Alcinous sacrificed a bull<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />to Zeus, son of Cronos, god of the dark clouds, who is lord of all. Then, when they had burned the thigh-pieces, they feasted a glorious feast, and made merry, and among them the divine minstrel Demodocus, held in honor by the people, sang to the lyre. But Odysseus would ever turn his head toward the blazing sun,<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />eager to see it set, for verily he was eager to return home. And as a man longs for supper, for whom all day long a yoke of wine-dark oxen has drawn the jointed plough through fallow land, and gladly for him does the light of the sun sink, that he may busy him with his supper, and his knees grow weary as he goes;<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />even so gladly for Odysseus did the light of the sun sink. Straightway then he spoke among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar, and to Alcinous above all he declared his word, and said:
“Lord Alcinous, renowned above all men, pour libations now, and send ye me on my way in peace; and yourselves too—Farewell!<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />For now all that my heart desired has been brought to pass: a convoy, and gifts of friendship. May the gods of heaven bless them to me, and on my return may I find in my home my peerless wife with those I love unscathed; and may you again, remaining here, make glad<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />your wedded wives and children; and may the gods grant you prosperity of every sort, and may no evil come upon your people.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="47" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and they all praised his words, and bade send the stranger on his way, since he had spoken fittingly. Then the mighty Alcinous spoke to the herald, saying:<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />“Pontonous, mix the bowl, and serve out wine to all in the hall, in order that, when we have made prayer to father Zeus, we may send forth the stranger to his own native land.”
So he spoke, and Pontonous mixed the honey hearted wine and served out to all, coming up to each in turn;<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />and they poured libations to the blessed gods, who hold broad heaven, from where they sat. But goodly Odysseus arose, and placed in the hand of Arete the two-handled cup, and spoke, and addressed her with winged words:
“Fare thee well, O queen, throughout all the years, till old age<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />and death come, which are the lot of mortals. As for me, I go my way, but do thou in this house have joy of thy children and thy people and Alcinous the king.”
So the goodly Odysseus spake and passed over the threshold. And with him the mighty Alcinous sent forth a herald<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />to lead him to the swift ship and the shore of the sea. And Arete sent with him slave women, one bearing a newly washed cloak and a tunic, and another again she bade follow to bear the strong chest, and yet another bore bread and red wine.
<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />But when they had come down to the ship and to the sea, straightway the lordly youths that were his escort took these things, and stowed them in the hollow ship, even all the food and drink. Then for Odysseus they spread a rug and a linen sheet on the deck of the hollow ship<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />at the stern, that he might sleep soundly; and he too went aboard, and laid him down in silence. Then they sat down on the benches, each in order, and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone. And as soon as they leaned back, and tossed the brine with their oarblades, sweet sleep fell upon his eyelids,<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />an unawakening sleep, most sweet, and most like to death. And as on a plain four yoked stallions spring forward all together beneath the strokes of the lash, and leaping on high swiftly accomplish their way, even so the stern of that ship leapt on high, and in her wake<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />the dark wave of the loud-sounding sea foamed mightily, and she sped safely and surely on her way; not even the circling hawk, the swiftest of winged things, could have kept pace with her. Thus she sped on swiftly and clove the waves of the sea, bearing a man the peer of the gods in counsel,<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />one who in time past had suffered many griefs at heart in passing through wars of men and the grievous waves; but now he slept in peace, forgetful of all that he had suffered.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="93" type="card">
                    <p>
Now when that brightest of stars rose which ever comes to herald the light of early Dawn,<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />even then the seafaring ship drew near to the island.
There is in the land of <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName> a certain harbor of Phorcys, the old man of the sea, and at its mouth two projecting headlands sheer to seaward, but sloping down on the side toward the harbor. These keep back the great waves raised by heavy winds<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />without, but within the benched ships lie unmoored when they have reached the point of anchorage. At the head of the harbor is a long-leafed olive tree, and near it a pleasant, shadowy cave sacred to the nymphs that are called Naiads.<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />Therein are mixing bowls and jars of stone, and there too the bees store honey. And in the cave are long looms of stone, at which the nymphs weave webs of purple dye, a wonder to behold; and therein are also ever-flowing springs. Two doors there are to the cave,<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />one toward the <placeName key="tgn,2550011">North Wind</placeName>, by which men go down, but that toward the South Wind is sacred, nor do men enter thereby; it is the way of the immortals.
Here they rowed in, knowing the place of old; and the ship ran full half her length on the shore<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />in her swift course, at such pace was she driven by the arms of the rowers. Then they stepped forth from the benched ship upon the land, and first they lifted Odysseus out of the hollow ship, with the linen sheet and bright rug as they were, and laid him down on the sand, still overpowered by sleep.<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />And they lifted out the goods which the lordly Phaeacians had given him, as he set out for home, through the favour of great-hearted Athena. These they set all together by the trunk of the olive tree, out of the path, lest haply some wayfarer, before Odysseus awoke, might come upon them and spoil them.<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />Then they themselves returned home again. But the Shaker of the Earth did not forget the threats wherewith at the first he had threatened godlike Odysseus, and he thus enquired of the purpose of Zeus:
“Father Zeus, no longer shall I, even I, be held in honor among the immortal gods, seeing that mortals honor me not a whit—<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />even the Phaeacians, who, thou knowest, are of my own lineage. For I but now declared that Odysseus should suffer many woes ere he reached his home, though I did not wholly rob him of his return when once thou hadst promised it and confirmed it with thy nod; yet in his sleep these men have borne him in a swift ship over the sea<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />and set him down in <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName>, and have given him gifts past telling, stores of bronze and gold and woven raiment, more than Odysseus would ever have won for himself from <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>, if he had returned unscathed with his due share of the spoil.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="139" type="card">
                    <p>
Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered him, and said:<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />“Ah me, thou shaker of the earth, wide of sway, what a thing hast thou said! The gods do thee no dishonor; hard indeed would it be to assail with dishonor our eldest and best. But as for men, if any one, yielding to his might and strength, fails to do thee honor in aught, thou mayest ever take vengeance, even thereafter.<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />Do as thou wilt, and as is thy good pleasure.”
Then Poseidon, the earth-shaker, answered him: “Straightway should I have done as thou sayest, thou god of the dark clouds, but I ever dread and avoid thy wrath. But now I am minded to smite the fair ship of the Phaeacians,<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />as she comes back from his convoy on the misty deep, that hereafter they may desist and cease from giving convoy to men, and to fling a great mountain about their city.”
Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered him and said: “Lazy one, hear what seems best in my sight.<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />When all the people are looking forth from the city upon her as she speeds on her way, then do thou turn her to stone hard by the land—a stone in the shape of a swift ship, that all men may marvel; and do thou fling a great mountain about their city.”
Now when Poseidon, the earth-shaker, heard this<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />he went his way to <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Scheria</placeName>, where the Phaeacians dwell, and there he waited. And she drew close to shore, the seafaring ship, speeding swiftly on her way. Then near her came the Earth-shaker and turned her to stone, and rooted her fast beneath by a blow of the flat of his hand, and then he was gone.
<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />But they spoke winged words to one another, the Phaeacians of the long oars, men famed for their ships. And thus would one speak, with a glance at his neighbor:
“Ah me, who has now bound our swift ship on the sea as she sped homeward? Lo, she was in plain sight.”
<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />So would one of them speak, but they knew not how these things were to be. Then Alcinous addressed their company and said:
“Lo now, verily the oracles of my father, uttered long ago, have come upon me. He was wont to say that Poseidon was wroth with us because we give safe convoy to all men.<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />He said that some day, as a beautiful ship of the Phaeacians was returning from a convoy over the misty deep, Poseidon would smite her, and would fling a great mountain about our town. So that old man spoke, and lo, now all this is being brought to pass. But now come, as I bid let us all obey.<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />Cease ye to give convoy to mortals, when anyone comes to our city, and let us sacrifice to Poseidon twelve choice bulls, if haply he may take pity, and not fling a lofty mountain about our town.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="184" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and they were seized with fear and made ready the bulls.<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />Thus they were praying to the lord Poseidon, the leaders and counsellors of the land of the Phaeacians, as they stood about the altar, but Odysseus awoke out of his sleep in his native land. Yet he knew it not after his long absence, for about him the goddess had shed a mist,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />even Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, that she might render him unknown, and tell him all things, so that his wife might not know him, nor his townsfolk, nor his friends, until the wooers had paid the full price of all their transgressions. Therefore all things seemed strange to their lord,<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />the long paths, the bays offering safe anchorage, the sheer cliffs, and the luxuriant trees. So he sprang up and stood and looked upon his native land, and then he groaned and smote both of his thighs with the flat of his hands, and mournfully spoke, and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />“Woe is me, to the land of what mortals am I now come? Are they cruel, and wild, and unjust, or do they love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts? Whither shall I bear all this wealth, or whither shall I myself go wandering on? Would that I had remained there among the Phaeacians,<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />and had then come to some other of the mighty kings, who would have entertained me and sent me on my homeward way. But now I know not where to bestow this wealth; yet here will I not leave it, lest haply it become the spoil of others to my cost. Out upon them; not wholly wise, it seems, nor just<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />were the leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians who have brought me to a strange land. Verily they said that they would bring me to clear-seen <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName>, but they have not made good their word. May Zeus, the suppliant's god, requite them, who watches over all men, and punishes him that sins.<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />But come, I will number the goods, and go over them, lest to my cost these men have carried off aught with them in the hollow ship.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="217" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spake, and set him to count the beautiful tripods, and the cauldrons, and the gold, and the fair woven raiment, and of these he missed nothing. Then, mournfully longing for his native land,<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />he paced by the shore of the loud-sounding sea, uttering many a moan. And Athena drew near him in the form of a young man, a herdsman of sheep, one most delicate, as are the sons of princes. In a double fold about her shoulders she wore a well-wrought cloak,<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />and beneath her shining feet she had sandals, and in her hands a spear. Then Odysseus was glad at sight of her, and came to meet her, and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words:
“Friend, since thou art the first to whom I have come in this land, hail to thee, and mayst thou meet me with no evil mind.<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />Nay, save this treasure, and save me; for to thee do I pray, as to a god, and am come to thy dear knees. And tell me this also truly, that I may know full well. What land, what people is this? What men dwell here? Is it some clear-seen island, or a shore<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />of the deep-soiled mainland that lies resting on the sea?”
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “A fool art thou, stranger, or art come from far, if indeed thou askest of this land. Surely it is no wise so nameless, but full many know it,<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />both all those who dwell toward the dawn and the sun, and all those that are behind toward the murky darkness. It is a rugged isle, not fit for driving horses, yet it is not utterly poor, though it be but narrow. Therein grows corn beyond measure, and the wine-grape as well,<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />and the rain never fails it, nor the rich dew. It is a good land for pasturing goats and kine; there are trees of every sort, and in it also pools for watering that fail not the year through. Therefore, stranger, the name of <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName> has reached even to the land of <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName> which, they say, is far from this land of Achaea.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="250" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />So she spake, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was glad, and rejoiced in his land, the land of his fathers, as he heard the word of Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis; and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words; yet he spoke not the truth, but checked the word ere it was uttered,<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />ever revolving in his breast thoughts of great cunning:
“I heard of <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName>, even in broad <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, far over the sea; and now have I myself come hither with these my goods. And I left as much more with my children, when I fled the land, after I had slain the dear son of Idomeneus,<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />Orsilochus, swift of foot, who in broad <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> surpassed in fleetness all men that live by toil. Now he would have robbed me of all that booty of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, for which I had borne grief of heart, passing through wars of men and the grievous waves,<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />for that I would not shew favour to his father, and serve as his squire in the land of the Trojans, but commanded other men of my own. So I smote him with my bronze-tipped spear as he came home from the field, lying in wait for him with one of my men by the roadside. A dark night covered the heavens, and no<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />man was ware of us, but unseen I took away his life. Now when I had slain him with the sharp bronze, I went straightway to a ship, and made prayer to the lordly Phoenicians, giving them booty to satisfy their hearts. I bade them take me aboard and land me at <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />or at goodly <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, where the Epeans hold sway. Yet verily the force of the wind thrust them away from thence, sore against their will, nor did they purpose to play me false; but driven wandering from thence we came hither by night. With eager haste we rowed on into the harbor, nor had we any<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />thought of supper, sore as was our need of it, but even as we were we went forth from the ship and lay down, one and all. Then upon me came sweet sleep in my weariness, but they took my goods out of the hollow ship and set them where I myself lay on the sands.<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />And they went on board, and departed for the well-peopled land of <placeName key="tgn,7002861">Sidon</placeName>; but I was left here, my heart sore troubled.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="287" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, smiled, and stroked him with her hand, and changed herself to the form of a woman, comely and tall, and skilled in glorious handiwork.<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />And she spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
“Cunning must he be and knavish, who would go beyond thee in all manner of guile, aye, though it were a god that met thee. Bold man, crafty in counsel, insatiate in deceit, not even in thine own land, it seems, wast thou to cease from guile<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />and deceitful tales, which thou lovest from the bottom of thine heart. But come, let us no longer talk of this, being both well versed in craft, since thou art far the best of all men in counsel and in speech, and I among all the gods am famed for wisdom and craft. Yet thou didst not know<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, even me, who ever stand by thy side, and guard thee in all toils. Aye, and I made thee beloved by all the Phaeacians. And now am I come hither to weave a plan with thee, and to hide all the treasure, which the lordly Phaeacians<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />gave thee by my counsel and will, when thou didst set out for home; and to tell thee all the measure of woe it is thy fate to fulfil in thy well-built house. But do thou be strong, for bear it thou must, and tell no man of them all nor any woman that thou hast come back from thy wanderings, but in silence<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />endure thy many griefs, and submit to the violence of men.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Hard is it, goddess, for a mortal man to know thee when he meets thee, how wise soever he be, for thou takest what shape thou wilt. But this I know well, that of old thou wast kindly toward me,<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />so long as we sons of the Achaeans were warring in the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. But after we had sacked the lofty city of Priam, and had gone away in our ships, and a god had scattered the Achaeans, never since then have I seen thee, daughter of Zeus, nor marked thee coming on board my ship, that thou mightest ward off sorrow from me.<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />Nay, I ever wandered on, bearing in my breast a stricken heart, till the gods delivered me from evil, even until in the rich land of the Phaeacians thou didst cheer me with thy words, and thyself lead me to their city. But now I beseech thee by thy father—for I think not<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />that I am come to clear-seen <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>; nay, it is some other land over which I roam, and thou, methinks, dost speak thus in mockery to beguile my mind—tell me whether in very truth I am come to my dear native land.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="329" type="card">
                    <p>
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />“Ever such is the thought in thy breast, and therefore it is that I cannot leave thee in thy sorrow, for thou art soft of speech, keen of wit, and prudent. Eagerly would another man on his return from wanderings have hastened to behold in his halls his children and his wife;<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />but thou art not yet minded to know or learn of aught, till thou hast furthermore proved thy wife, who abides as of old in her halls, and ever sorrowfully for her the nights and days wane, as she weeps. But as for me, I never doubted of this, but in my heart<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />knew it well, that thou wouldest come home after losing all thy comrades. Yet, thou must know, I was not minded to strive against Poseidon, my father's brother, who laid up wrath in his heart against thee, angered that thou didst blind his dear son. But come, I will shew thee the land of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, that thou mayest be sure.<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />This is the harbor of Phorcys, the old man of the sea, and here at the head of the harbor is the long-leafed olive tree, and near it is the pleasant, shadowy cave, sacred to the nymphs that are called Naiads. This, thou must know, is the vaulted cave in which thou<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />wast wont to offer to the nymphs many hecatombs that bring fulfillment; and yonder is Mount Neriton, clothed with its forests.”
So spake the goddess, and scattered the mist, and the land appeared. Glad then was the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus, rejoicing in his own land, and he kissed the earth, the giver of grain.<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />And straightway he prayed to the nymphs with upstretched hands:
“Ye Naiad Nymphs, daughters of Zeus, never did I think to behold you again, but now I hail you with loving prayers. Aye, and gifts too will I give, as aforetime, if the daughter of Zeus, she that drives the spoil, shall graciously grant me<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />to live, and shall bring to manhood my dear son.”
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him again: “Be of good cheer, and let not these things distress thy heart. But let us now forthwith set thy goods in the innermost recess of the wondrous cave, where they may abide for thee in safety,<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />and let us ourselves take thought how all may be far the best.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="366" type="card">
                    <p>
So saying, the goddess entered the shadowy cave and searched out its hiding-places. And Odysseus brought all the treasure thither, the gold and the stubborn bronze and the finely-wrought raiment, which the Phaeacians gave him.<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />These things he carefully laid away, and Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis, set a stone at the door. Then the two sat them down by the trunk of the sacred olive tree, and devised death for the insolent wooers. And the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, was the first to speak, saying:
<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />“Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, take thought how thou mayest put forth thy hands on the shameless wooers, who now for three years have been lording it in thy halls, wooing thy godlike wife, and offering wooers' gifts. And she, as she mournfully looks for thy coming,<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />offers hopes to all, and has promises for each man, sending them messages, but her mind is set on other things.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Lo now, of a surety I was like to have perished in my halls by the evil fate of Agamemnon, son of Atreus,<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />hadst not thou, goddess, duly told me all. But come, weave some plan by which I may requite them; and stand thyself by my side, and endue me with dauntless courage, even as when we loosed the bright diadem of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. Wouldest thou but stand by my side, thou flashing-eyed one, as eager as thou wast then,<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />I would fight even against three hundred men, with thee, mighty goddess, if with a ready heart thou wouldest give me aid.”
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Yea verily, I will be with thee, and will not forget thee, when we are busied with this work; and methinks many a one<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />of the wooers that devour thy substance shall bespatter the vast earth with his blood and brains. But come, I will make thee unknown to all mortals. I will shrivel the fair skin on thy supple limbs, and destroy the flaxen hair from off thy head, and clothe thee in a ragged garment,<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />such that one would shudder to see a man clad therein. And I will dim thy two eyes that were before so beautiful, that thou mayest appear mean in the sight of all the wooers, and of thy wife, and of thy son, whom thou didst leave in thy halls. And for thyself, do thou go first of all<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />to the swineherd who keeps thy swine, and withal has a kindly heart towards thee, and loves thy son and constant Penelope. Thou wilt find him abiding by the swine, and they are feeding by the rock of Corax and the spring Arethusa, eating acorns to their heart's content and<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />drinking the black water, things which cause the rich flesh of swine to wax fat. There do thou stay, and sitting by his side question him of all things, while I go to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, the land of fair women, to summon thence Telemachus, thy dear son, Odysseus, who went to spacious <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> to the house of Menelaus,<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />to seek tidings of thee, if thou wast still anywhere alive.”</p>

                <div2 n="416" type="card">

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her: “Why then, I pray thee, didst thou not tell him, thou whose mind knows all things? Nay, was it haply that he too might suffer woes, wandering over the unresting sea, and that others might devour his substance?”
<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Nay verily, not for him be thy heart overmuch troubled. It was I that guided him, that he might win good report by going thither, and he has no toil, but sits in peace in the palace of the son of Atreus, and good cheer past telling is before him.<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />Truly young men in a black ship lie in wait for him, eager to slay him before he comes to his native land, but methinks this shall not be. Ere that shall the earth cover many a one of the wooers that devour thy substance.”
So saying, Athena touched him with her wand.<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />She withered the fair flesh on his supple limbs, and destroyed the flaxen hair from off his head, and about all his limbs she put the skin of an aged old man. And she dimmed his two eyes that were before so beautiful, and clothed him in other raiment,<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />a vile ragged cloak and a tunic, tattered garments and foul, begrimed with filthy smoke. And about him she cast the great skin of a swift hind, stripped of the hair, and she gave him a staff, and a miserable wallet, full of holes, slung by a twisted cord.
So when the two had thus taken counsel together, they parted; and thereupon the goddess<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />went to goodly <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> to fetch the son of Odysseus.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />But Odysseus went forth from the harbor by the rough path up over the woodland and through the heights to the place where Athena had shewed him that he should find the goodly swineherd, who cared for his substance above all the slaves that goodly Odysseus had gotten.
<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />He found him sitting in the fore-hall of his house, where his court was built high in a place of wide outlook, a great and goodly court with an open space around it. This the swineherd had himself built for the swine of his master, that was gone, without the knowledge of his mistress and the old man Laertes.<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />With huge stones had he built it, and set on it a coping of thorn. Without he had driven stakes the whole length, this way and that, huge stakes, set close together, which he had made by splitting an oak to the black core;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and within the court he had made twelve sties close by one another, as beds for the swine, and in each one<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />were penned fifty wallowing swine, females for breeding; but the boars slept without. These were far fewer in numbers, for on them the godlike wooers feasted, and lessened them, for the swineherd ever sent in the best of all the fatted hogs,<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />which numbered three hundred and sixty. By these ever slept four dogs, savage as wild beasts, which the swineherd had reared, a leader of men. But he himself was fitting boots about his feet, cutting an ox-hide of good color, while the others<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />had gone, three of them, one here one there, with the droves of swine; and the fourth he had sent to the city to drive perforce a boar to the insolent wooers, that they might slay it and satisfy their souls with meat.
Suddenly then the baying hounds caught sight of Odysseus,<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />and rushed upon him with loud barking, but Odysseus sat down in his cunning, and the staff fell from his hand. Then even in his own farmstead would he have suffered cruel hurt, but the swineherd with swift steps followed after them, and hastened through the gateway, and the hide fell from his hand.<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />He called aloud to the dogs, and drove them this way and that with a shower of stones, and spoke to his master, and said:
“Old man, verily the dogs were like to have torn thee to pieces all of a sudden, and on me thou wouldest have shed reproach. Aye, and the gods have given me other griefs and sorrow.<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />It is for a godlike master that I mourn and grieve, as I abide here, and rear fat swine for other men to eat, while he haply in want of food wanders over the land and city of men of strange speech, if indeed he still lives and sees the light of the sun.<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />But come with me, let us go to the hut, old man, that when thou hast satisfied thy heart with food and wine, thou too mayest tell whence thou art, and all the woes thou hast endured.”</p>

                <div2 n="48" type="card">
                    <p>
So saying, the goodly swineherd led him to the hut, and brought him in, and made him sit, strowing beneath thick brushwood,<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />and thereon spreading the skin of a shaggy wild goat, large and hairy, on which he was himself wont to sleep. And Odysseus was glad that he gave him such welcome, and spoke, and addressed him:
“Stranger, may Zeus and the other immortal gods grant thee what most thou desirest, since thou with a ready heart hast given me welcome.”
<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Nay, stranger, it were not right for me, even though one meaner than thou were to come, to slight a stranger: for from Zeus are all strangers and beggars, and a gift, though small, is welcome from such as we; since this is the lot of slaves,<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />ever in fear when over them as lords their masters hold sway—young masters such as ours. For verily the gods have stayed the return of him who would have loved me with all kindness, and would have given me possessions of my own, a house and a bit of land, and a wife, sought of many wooers, even such things as a kindly master gives to his thrall<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />who has toiled much for him, and whose labour the god makes to prosper, even as this work of mine prospers, to which I give heed. Therefore would my master have richly rewarded me, if he had grown old here at home: but he perished—as I would all the kindred of Helen had perished in utter ruin, since she loosened the knees of many warriors.<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />For he too went forth to win recompense for Agamemnon to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>, famed for its horses, that he might fight with the Trojans.”</p>

So saying, he quickly bound up his tunic with his belt, and went to the sties, where the tribes of swine were penned. Choosing two from thence, he brought them in and slew them both,<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />and singed, and cut them up, and spitted them. Then, when he had roasted all, he brought and set it before Odysseus, hot upon the spits, and sprinkled over it white barley meal. Then in a bowl of ivy wood he mixed honey-sweet wine, and himself sat down over against Odysseus, and bade him to his food, and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />“Eat now, stranger, such food as slaves have to offer, meat of young pigs; the fatted hogs the wooers eat, who reck not in their hearts of the wrath of the gods, nor have any pity. Verily the blessed gods love not reckless deeds, but they honor justice and the righteous deeds of men.<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />Even cruel foemen that set foot on the land of others, and Zeus gives them booty, and they fill their ships and depart for home—even on the hearts of these falls great fear of the wrath of the gods. But these men here, look you, know somewhat, and have heard some voice of a god<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />regarding my master's pitiful death, seeing that they will not woo righteously, nor go back to their own, but at their ease they waste our substance in insolent wise, and there is no sparing. For every day and night that comes from Zeus they sacrifice not one victim nor two alone,<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />and they draw forth wine, and waste it in insolent wise. Verily his substance was great past telling, so much has no lord either on the dark mainland or in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself; nay, not twenty men together have wealth so great. Lo, I will tell thee the tale thereof;<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />twelve herds of kine has he on the mainland; as many flocks of sheep; as many droves of swine; as many packed herds of goats do herdsmen, both foreigners and of his own people, pasture. And here too graze roving herds of goats on the borders of the island, eleven in all, and over them trusty men keep watch.<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />And each man of these ever drives up day by day one of his flock for the wooers, even that one of the fatted goats which seems to him the best. But as for me, I guard and keep these swine, and choose out with care and send them the best of the boars.”</p>

                <div2 n="109" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, but Odysseus eagerly<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> ate flesh and drank wine,<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />greedily, in silence, and was sowing the seeds of evil for the wooers. But when he had dined, and satisfied his soul with food, then the swineherd filled the bowl from which he was himself wont to drink, and gave it him brim full of wine, and he took it, and was glad at heart; and he spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />“Friend, who was it who bought thee with his wealth, a man so very rich and mighty, as thou tellest? Thou saidest that he died to win recompense for Agamemnon; tell me, if haply I may know him, being such an one. For Zeus, I ween, and the other immortal gods know<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />whether I have seen him, and could bring tidings; for I have wandered far.”
Then the swineherd, a leader of men, answered him: “Old man, no wanderer that came and brought tidings of him could persuade his wife and his dear son; nay, at random, when they have need of entertainment, do vagabonds<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />lie, and are not minded to speak the truth. Whosoever in his wanderings comes to the land of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, goes to my mistress and tells a deceitful tale. And she, receiving him kindly, gives him entertainment, and questions him of all things, and the tears fall from her eyelids, while she weeps,<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />as is the way of a woman, when her husband dies afar. And readily wouldest thou too, old man, fashion a story, if one would give thee a cloak and a tunic for raiment. But as for him, ere now dogs and swift birds are like to have torn the flesh from his bones, and his spirit has left him;<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />or in the sea fishes have eaten him, and his bones lie there on the shore, wrapped in deep sand. Thus has he perished yonder, and to his friends grief is appointed for days to come, to all, but most of all to me. For never again shall I find a master so kind, how far soever I go,<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />not though I come again to the house of my father and mother, where at the first I was born, and they reared me themselves. Yet it is not for them that I henceforth mourn so much, eager though I am to behold them with my eyes and to be in my native land; nay, it is longing for Odysseus, who is gone, that seizes me.<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />His name, stranger, absent though he is, I speak with awe, for greatly did he love me and care for me at heart; but I call him my lord beloved, for all he is not here.”</p>

                <div2 n="147" type="card">
                    <p>
Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: “Friend, since thou dost utterly make denial, and declarest<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />that he will never come again, and thy heart is ever unbelieving, therefore will I tell thee, not at random but with an oath, that Odysseus shall return. And let me have a reward for bearing good tidings, as soon as he shall come, and reach his home; clothe me in a cloak and tunic, goodly raiment.<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />But ere that, how sore soever my need, I will accept naught; for hateful in my eyes as the gates of Hades is that man, who, yielding to stress of poverty, tells a deceitful tale. Now be my witness Zeus, above all gods, and this hospitable board, and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come,<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />that verily all these things shall be brought to pass even as I tell thee. In the course of this self-same day<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> Odysseus shall come hither, as the old moon wanes, and the new appears. He shall return, and take vengeance on all those who here dishonor his wife and his glorious son.”
<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Old man, neither shall I, meseems, pay thee this reward for bearing good tidings, nor shall Odysseus ever come to his home. Nay, drink in peace, and let us turn our thoughts to other things, and do not thou recall this to my mind; for verily the heart in my breast<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />is grieved whenever any one makes mention of my good master. But as for thy oath, we will let it be; yet I would that Odysseus might come, even as I desire, I, and Penelope, and the old man Laertes, and godlike Telemachus. But now it is for his son that I grieve unceasingly,<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />even for Telemachus, whom Odysseus begot. When the gods had made him grow like a sapling, and I thought that he would be among men no whit worse than his dear father, glorious in form and comeliness, then some one of the immortals marred the wise spirit within him, or haply some man, and he went<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />to sacred <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> after tidings of his father. For him now the lordly wooers lie in wait on his homeward way, that the race of godlike Arceisius may perish out of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and leave no name. But verily we will let him be; he may be taken, or he may escape, and the son of Cronos stretch forth his hand to guard him.<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />But come, do thou, old man, tell me of thine own sorrows, and declare me this truly, that I may know full well. Who art thou among men, and from whence? Where is thy city, and where thy parents? On what manner of ship didst thou come, and how did sailors bring thee to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>? Who did they declare themselves to be?<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />For nowise, methinks, didst thou come hither on foot.”</p>

                    <p>
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Then verily I will frankly tell thee all. Would that now we two might have food and sweet wine for the while,<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />to feast on in quiet here in thy hut, and that others might go about their work; easily then might I tell on for a full year, and yet in no wise finish the tale of the woes of my spirit—even all the toils that I have endured by the will of the gods.
“From broad <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> I declare that I am come by lineage,<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />the son of a wealthy man. And many other sons too were born and bred in his halls, true sons of a lawful wife; but the mother that bore me was bought, a concubine. Yet Castor, son of Hylax, of whom I declare that I am sprung, honored me even as his true-born sons.<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />He was at that time honored as a god among the Cretans in the land for his good estate, and his wealth, and his glorious sons. But the fates of death bore him away to the house of Hades, and his proud sons divided among them his substance, and cast lots therefor.<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />To me they gave a very small portion, and allotted a dwelling. But I took unto me a wife from a house that had wide possessions, winning her by my valor; for I was no weakling, nor a coward in fight. Now all that strength is gone; yet even so, in seeing the stubble, methinks<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />thou mayest judge what the grain was; for verily troubles in full measure encompass me. But then Ares and Athena gave me courage, and strength that breaks the ranks of men; and whenever I picked the best warriors for an ambush, sowing the seeds of evil for the foe, never did my proud spirit forbode death,<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />but ever far the first did I leap forth, and slay with my spear whosoever of the foe gave way in flight before me.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> Such a man was I in war, but labour in the field was never to my liking, nor the care of a household, which rears goodly children, but oared ships were ever dear to me,<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />and wars, and polished spears, and arrows,—grievous things, whereat others are wont to shudder. But those things, I ween, were dear to me, which a god put in my heart; for different men take joy in different works. For before the sons of the Achaeans set foot on the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />I had nine times led warriors and swift-faring ships against foreign folk, and great spoil had ever fallen to my hands. Of this I would choose what pleased my mind, and much I afterwards obtained by lot. Thus my house straightway grew rich, and thereafter I became one feared and honored among the Cretans.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />“But when Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, devised that hateful journey which loosened the knees of many a warrior, then they bade me and glorious Idomeneus to lead the ships to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>, nor was there any way to refuse, for the voice of the people pressed hard upon us.<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />There for nine years we sons of the Achaeans warred, and in the tenth we sacked the city of Priam, and set out for home in our ships, and a god scattered the Achaeans. But for me, wretched man that I was, Zeus, the counsellor, devised evil. For a month only I remained, taking joy in my children,<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />my wedded wife, and my wealth; and then to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> did my spirit bid me voyage with my godlike comrades, when I had fitted out my ships with care. Nine ships I fitted out, and the host gathered speedily. Then for six days my trusty comrades<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />feasted, and I gave them many victims, that they might sacrifice to the gods, and prepare a feast for themselves; and on the seventh we embarked and set sail from broad <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, with the North Wind blowing fresh and fair, and ran on easily as if down stream. No<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />harm came to any of my ships, but free from scathe and from disease we sat, and the wind and the helmsman guided the ships.
“On the fifth day we came to fair-flowing <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Aegyptus</placeName>, and in the river <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Aegyptus</placeName> I moored my curved ships. Then verily I bade my trusty comrades<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />to remain there by the ships, and to guard the ships, and I sent out scouts to go to places of outlook. But my comrades, yielding to wantonness, and led on by their own might, straightway set about wasting the fair fields of the men of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; and they carried off the women and little children,<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />and slew the men; and the cry came quickly to the city. Then, hearing the shouting, the people came forth at break of day, and the whole plain was filled with footmen, and chariots and the flashing of bronze. But Zeus who hurls the thunderbolt cast an evil panic upon my comrades, and none had the courage<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />to hold his ground and face the foe; for evil surrounded us on every side. So then they slew many of us with the sharp bronze, and others they led up to their city alive, to work for them perforce. But in my heart Zeus himself put this thought—I would that I had rather died and met my fate<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />there in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, for still was sorrow to give me welcome. Straightway I put off from my head my well-wrought helmet, and the shield from off my shoulders, and let the spear fall from my hand, and went toward the chariot horses of the king. I clasped, and kissed his knees, and he delivered me, and took pity on me,<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />and, setting me in his chariot, took me weeping to his home. Verily full many rushed upon me with their ashen spears, eager to slay me, for they were exceeding angry.

There I remained with him for a full year. But when at length the months and the days were being brought to fulfillment, as the year rolled round and the seasons came on,<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />he set me on a seafaring ship bound for <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, having given lying counsel to the end that I should convey a cargo with him, but in truth that, when there, he might sell me and get a vast price.

Therewith Zeus thundered, and hurled his bolt upon the ship, and she quivered from stem to stern, smitten by the bolt of Zeus, and was filled with sulphurous smoke, and all the crew fell from out the ship. Like sea-crows they were borne on the waves about the black ship, and the god took from them their returning.<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />But as for me, Zeus himself when my heart was compassed with woe, put into my hands the tossing<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> mast of the dark-prowed ship, that I might again escape destruction.

They stripped me of my garments, my cloak and tunic, and clothed me in other raiment, a vile ragged cloak and tunic, even the tattered garments which thou seest before thine eyes; and at evening they reached the tilled fields of clear-seen <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>.<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />Then with a twisted rope they bound me fast in the benched ship, and themselves went ashore, and made haste to take their supper by the shore of the sea. But as for me, the gods themselves undid my bonds full easily, and, wrapping the tattered cloak about my head,<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />I slid down the smooth lading-plank,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and brought my breast to the sea, and then struck out with both hands, and swam, and very soon was out of the water, and away from them. Then I went up to a place where there was a thicket of leafy wood, and lay there crouching.<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />And they went hither and thither with loud cries; but as there seemed to be no profit in going further in their search, they went back again on board their hollow ship. And the gods themselves hid me easily, and led me, and brought me to the farmstead of a wise man; for still haply it is my lot to live.”</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Ah, wretched stranger, verily thou hast stirred my heart deeply in telling all the tale of thy sufferings and thy wanderings. But in this, methinks, thou hast not spoken aright, nor shalt thou persuade me with thy tale about Odysseus. Why shouldst thou, who art in such plight<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />lie to no purpose? Nay, of myself I know well regarding the return of my master, that he was utterly hated of all the gods, in that they did not slay him among the Trojans, or in the arms of his friends, when he had wound up the skein of war. Then would the whole host of the Achaeans have made him a tomb,<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />and for his son too he would have won great glory in days to come. But as it is the spirits of the storm have swept him away, and left no tidings. I, for my part, dwell aloof with the swine, nor do I go to the city, unless haply wise Penelope bids me thither, when tidings come to her from anywhere.<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />Then men sit around him that comes, and question him closely, both those that grieve for their lord, that has long been gone, and those who rejoice, as they devour his substance without atonement. But I care not to ask or enquire, since the time when an Aetolian beguiled me with his story,<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />one that had killed a man, and after wandering over the wide earth came to my house, and I gave him kindly welcome. He said that he had seen Odysseus among the Cretans at the house of Idomeneus, mending his ships which storms had shattered. And he said that he would come either by summer or by harvest-time,<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />bringing much treasure along with his godlike comrades. Thou too, old man of many sorrows, since a god has brought thee to me, seek not to win my favour by lies, nor in any wise to cajole me. It is not for this that I shall shew thee respect or kindness, but from fear of Zeus, the stranger's god, and from pity for thyself.”
<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Verily thou hast in thy bosom a heart that is slow to believe, seeing that in such wise, even with an oath, I won thee not, neither persuade thee. But come now, let us make a covenant, and the gods who hold <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> shall be witnesses for us both in time to come.<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />If thy master returns to this house, clothe me in a cloak and tunic, as raiment, and send me on my way to Dulichium, where I desire to be. But if thy master does not come as I say, set the slaves upon me, and fling me down from a great cliff,<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />that another beggar may beware of deceiving.”</p>

                <div2 n="401" type="card">
                    <p>
And the goodly swineherd answered him, and said: “Aye, stranger, so should I indeed win fair fame and prosperity among men both now and hereafter, if I, who brought thee to my hut and gave thee entertainment,<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />should then slay thee, and take away thy dear life. With a ready heart thereafter should I pray to Zeus, son of Cronos. But it is now time for supper, and may my comrades soon be here, that we may make ready a savoury supper in the hut.”
Thus they spoke to one another,<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />and the swine and the swineherds drew near. The sows they shut up to sleep in their wonted sties, and a wondrous noise arose from them, as they were penned. Then the goodly swineherd called to his comrades saying: 
“Bring forth the best of the boars, that I may slaughter him for the stranger<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />who comes from afar, and we too shall have some profit therefrom, who have long borne toil and suffering for the sake of the white-tusked swine, while others devour our labour without atonement.”
So saying, he split wood with the pitiless bronze, and the others brought in a fatted boar of five years old,<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />and set him by the hearth. Nor did the swineherd forget the immortals, for he had an understanding heart, but as a first offering he cast into the fire bristles from the head of the white-tusked boar, and made prayer to all the gods that wise Odysseus might return to his own house.<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />Then he raised himself up, and smote the boar with a billet of oak, which he had left when splitting the wood, and the boar's life left him. And the others cut the boar's throat, and signed him, and quickly cut him up, and the swineherd took as first offerings bits of raw flesh from all the limbs, and laid them in the rich fat. These he cast into the fire, when he had sprinkled them with barley meal,<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />but the rest they cut up and spitted, and roasted it carefully, and drew it all off the spits, and cast it in a heap on platters. Then the swineherd stood up to carve, for well did his heart know what was fair, and he cut up the mess and divided it into seven portions.<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />One with a prayer he set aside for the nymphs and for Hermes, son of <placeName key="tgn,1049816">Maia</placeName>, and the rest he distributed to each. And Odysseus he honored with the long chine of the white-tusked boar, and made glad the heart of his master; and Odysseus of many wiles spoke to him, and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />“Eumaeus, mayest thou be as dear to father Zeus as thou art to me, since thou honourest me with a good portion, albeit I am in such plight.” 
To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Eat, unhappy stranger, and have joy of such fare as is here. It is the god that will give one thing and withhold another,<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line" />even as seems good to his heart; for he can do all things.”</p>

                    <p>
He spoke, and sacrificed the firstling pieces to the gods that are for ever, and, when he had made libations of the flaming wine, he placed the cup in the hands of Odysseus, the sacker of cities, and took his seat by his own portion. And bread was served to them by Mesaulius, whom the swineherd<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line" />had gotten by himself alone, while his master was gone, without the knowledge of his mistress or the old Laertes, buying him of the Taphians with his own goods. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink,<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line" />Mesaulius took away the food, and they were fain to go to their rest, sated with bread and meat.
Now the night came on, foul and without a moon, and Zeus rained the whole night through, and the West Wind, ever the rainy wind, blew strong. Then Odysseus spoke among them, making trial of the swineherd,<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line" />to see whether he would strip off his own cloak and give it him, or bid some other of his comrades to do so, since he cared for him so greatly:
“Hear me now, Eumaeus and all the rest of you, his men, with a wish in my heart will I tell a tale; for the wine bids me, befooling wine, which sets one, even though he be right wise, to singing<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line" />and laughing softly, and makes him stand up and dance, aye, and brings forth a word which were better unspoken. Still, since I have once spoken out, I will hide nothing. Would that I were young and my strength firm as when we made ready our ambush, and led it beneath the walls of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Troy</placeName>.<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line" />The leaders were Odysseus and Menelaus, son of Atreus, and with them I was third in command; for so had they ordered it themselves. Now when we had come to the city and the steep wall, round about the town in the thick brushwood among the needs and swamp-land<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line" />we lay, crouching beneath our arms, and night came on, foul, when the North Wind had fallen, and frosty, and snow came down on us from above, covering us like rime, bitter cold, and ice formed upon our shields. Now all the rest had cloaks and tunics, and slept in peace, with their shields covering their shoulders,<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line" />but I, when I set out, had left my cloak behind with my comrades in my folly, for I did not think that even so I should be cold, and had come with my shield alone and my bright kilt. But when it was the third watch of the night, and the stars had turned their course, then I spoke to Odysseus, who was near me,<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line" />nudging him with my elbow; and he straightway gave ear:
“Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, lo now, no longer shall I be among the living. Nay, the cold is killing me, for I have no cloak. Some god beguiled me to wear my tunic only, and now there is no more escape.’
<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line" />“So I spoke, and he then devised this plan in his heart, such a man was he both to plan and to fight; and speaking in a low voice he said to me: ‘Be silent now, lest another of the Achaeans hear thee.’</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="494" type="card">
                    <p>
“With this he raised his head upon his elbow, and spoke, saying:<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line" />‘Hear me, friends; a dream from the gods came to me in my sleep. Lo, we have come very far from the ships, and I would that there were one to bear word to Agamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the host, in the hope that he might bid more men to come from the ships.’
“So he spoke, and Thoas, son of Andraemon, sprang up<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line" />quickly, and from him flung his purple cloak, and set out to run to the ships. Then in his garment I gladly lay, and golden-throned Dawn appeared. Would that I were young as then, and my strength as firm; then would one of the swineherds in the farmstead give me a cloak<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line" />both from kindness and from respect for a brave warrior. But as it is they scorn me, since I have foul raiment about me.”
To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Old man, the tale thou hast told is a good one, nor hast thou thus far spoken aught amiss or unprofitably.<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line" />Wherefore thou shalt lack neither clothing nor aught else that a sore-tried suppliant should receive, when he meets one—for this night at least; but in the morning thou shalt shake about thee those rags of thine. For not many cloaks are here or changes of tunics to put on, but each man has one alone.<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line" />But when the dear son of Odysseus comes, he will himself give thee a cloak and a tunic as raiment, and will send thee whithersoever thy heart and spirit bid thee go.”
So saying, he sprang up and placed a bed for Odysseus near the fire, and cast upon it skins of sheep and goats.<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line" />There Odysseus lay down, and the swineherd threw over him a great thick cloak, which he kept at hand for a change of clothing whenever a terrible storm should arise.
So there Odysseus slept, and beside him slept the young men. But the swineherd<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line" />liked not a bed in that place, that he should lay him down away from the boars; so he made ready to go outside. And Odysseus was glad that he took such care of his master's substance while he was afar. First Eumaeus flung his sharp sword over his strong shoulders, and then put about him a cloak, very thick, to keep off the wind;<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line" />and he picked up the fleece of a large, well-fatted goat, took a sharp javelin to ward off dogs and men, and went forth to lie down to sleep where the white-tusked boars slept beneath a hollow rock, in a place sheltered from the North Wind.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />But Pallas Athena went to spacious <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> to remind the glorious son of great-hearted Odysseus of his return, and to hasten his coming. She found Telemachus and the noble son of Nestor<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />lying in the fore-hall of the palace of glorious Menelaus. Now Nestor's son was overcome with soft sleep, but sweet sleep did not hold Telemachus, but all through the immortal night anxious thoughts for his father kept him wakeful. And flashing-eyed Athena stood near him, and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />“Telemachus, thou dost not well to wander longer far from thy home, leaving behind thee thy wealth and men in thy house so insolent, lest they divide and devour all thy possessions, and thou shalt have gone on a fruitless journey. Nay, rouse with all speed Menelaus, good at the war-cry,<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />to send thee on thy way, that thou mayest find thy noble mother still in her home. For now her father and her brothers bid her wed Eurymachus, for he surpasses all the wooers in his presents, and has increased his gifts of wooing. Beware lest she carry forth from thy halls some treasure against thy will.<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />For thou knowest what sort of a spirit there is in a woman's breast; she is fain to increase the house of the man who weds her, but of her former children and of the lord of her youth she takes no thought, when once he is dead, and asks no longer concerning them. Nay, go, and thyself put all thy possessions in the charge of whatsoever one<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />of the handmaids seems to thee the best, until the gods shall show thee a noble bride. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. The best men of the wooers lie in wait for thee of set purpose in the strait between <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> and rugged <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />eager to slay thee before thou comest to thy native land. But methinks this shall not be; ere that shall the earth cover many a one of the wooers that devour thy substance. But do thou keep thy well-built ship far from the islands, and sail by night as well as by day, and that<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />one of the immortals, who keeps and guards thee, will send a fair breeze in thy wake. But when thou hast reached the nearest shore of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, send thy ship and all thy comrades on to the city, but thyself go first of all to the swineherd who keeps thy swine, and withal has a kindly heart toward thee.<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />There do thou spend the night, and bid him to go to the city to bear word to wise Penelope that she has thee safe, and thou art come from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>.”
So saying, she departed to high <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>. But Telemachus woke the son of Nestor out of sweet sleep,<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />rousing him with a touch of his heel, and spoke to him, saying:
“Awake, Peisistratus, son of Nestor; bring up thy fiery-hoofed<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> horses, and yoke them beneath the car, that we may speed on our way.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="48" type="card">
                    <p>
Then Peisistratus, son of Nestor, answered, and said: “Telemachus, in no wise may we<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />drive through the dark night, how eager soever for our journey; and soon it will be dawn. Wait then, until the warrior son of Atreus, Menelaus, famed for his spear, shall bring gifts and set them on the car, and shall send us on our way with kindly words of farewell. For a guest remembers all his days<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />the host who shews him kindness.”
So he spoke, and presently came golden-throned Dawn. Up to them then came Menelaus, good at the war-cry, rising from his couch from beside fair-tressed Helen. And when the prince, the dear son of Odysseus, saw him,<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />he made haste to put about him his bright tunic, and to fling over his mighty shoulders a great cloak, and went forth. Then Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, came up to Menelaus, and addressed him, saying:
“Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts,<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />send me back now at length to my dear native land, for now my heart is eager to return home.”
Then Menelaus, good at the war-cry, answered him: “Telemachus, I verily shall not hold thee here a long time, when thou art eager to return. Nay, I should blame another,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" /> who, as host, loves overmuch or hates overmuch; better is due measure in all things. 'Tis equal wrong if a man speed on a guest who is loath to go, and if he keep back one that is eager to be gone. One should make welcome the present guest, and send forth him that would go.<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />But stay, till I bring fair gifts and put them on thy car, and thine own eyes behold them, and till I bid the women make ready a meal in the halls of the abundant store that is within. It is a double boon—honor and glory it brings, and profit withal—that the traveller should dine before he goes forth over the wide and boundless earth.<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />And if thou art fain to journey through <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> and mid-<placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, be it so, to the end that I may myself go with thee, and I will yoke for thee horses, and lead thee to the cities of men. Nor will any one send us away empty-handed, but will give us some one thing at least to bear with us, a fair brazen tripod or cauldron,<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />or a pair of mules, or a golden cup.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts, rather would I go at once to my home, for when I departed I left behind me no one to watch over my possessions.<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />I would not that in seeking for my god-like father I myself should perish, or some goodly treasure be lost from my halls.”</p>

                    <p>
Now when Menelaus, good in battle, heard this, he straightway bade his wife and her handmaids make ready a meal in the halls of the abundant store that was within.<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />Up to him then came Eteoneus, son of Boethous, just risen from his bed, for he dwelt not far from him. Him Menelaus, good at the war-cry, bade kindle a fire and roast of the flesh; and he heard, and obeyed. And Menelaus himself went down to his vaulted<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> treasure-chamber,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />not alone, for with him went Helen and Megapenthes. But when they came to the place where his treasures were stored, the son of Atreus took a two-handled cup, and bade his son Megapenthes bear a mixing bowl of silver. And Helen came up to the chests<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />in which were her richly-broidered robes, that she herself had wrought. One of these Helen, the beautiful lady, lifted out and bore away, the one that was fairest in its broideries, and the amplest. It shone like a star, and lay beneath all the rest. Then they went forth through the house until they came to<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />Telemachus; and fair-haired Menelaus spoke to him, and said:
“Telemachus, may Zeus, the loud-thundering lord of Here, verily bring to pass for thee thy return, even as thy heart desires. And of all the gifts that lie stored as treasures in my house, I will give thee that one which is fairest and costliest.<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />I will give thee a well-wrought mixing-bowl. It is all of silver, and with gold are the rims thereof gilded, the work of Hephaestus; and the warrior Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me, when his house sheltered me as I came thither; and now I am minded to give it to thee.”
<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />So saying, the warrior, son of Atreus, placed the two-handled cup in his hands. And the strong Megapenthes brought the bright mixing-bowl of silver and set it before him, and fair-cheeked Helen came up with the robe in her hands, and spoke, and addressed him:
<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />“Lo, I too give thee this gift, dear child, a remembrance of the hands of Helen, against the day of thy longed-for marriage, for thy bride to wear it. But until then let it lie in thy halls in the keeping of thy dear mother. And for thyself I wish that with joy thou mayest reach thy well-built house and thy native land.”</p>

And the prince Peisistratus took the gifts, and laid them in the box of the chariot, and gazed at them all wondering in his heart. Then fair-haired Menelaus led them to the house, and the two sat down on chairs and high seats.<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />And a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin for them to wash, and beside them drew up a polished table. And the grave housewife brought and set before them bread, and therewith meats in abundance, granting freely of her store.<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />And hard by the son of Boethous carved the meat, and divided the portions, and the son of glorious Menelaus poured the wine. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, then Telemachus and the glorious son of Nestor<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />yoked the horses and mounted the inlaid car, and drove forth from the gateway and the echoing portico. After them went the son of Atreus, fair-haired Menelaus, bearing in his right hand honey-hearted wine in a cup of gold, that they might pour libations ere they set out.<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />And he took his stand before the horses, and pledged the youths, and said:
“Fare ye well, young men, and bear greeting to Nestor, shepherd of the host, for verily he was kind as a father to me, while we sons of the Achaeans warred in the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />“Aye, verily, king, fostered of Zeus, to him will we tell all this on our coming, as thou dost bid. And I would that, when I return to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, I might as surely find Odysseus in his house, to tell him how I met with every kindness at thy hands, ere I departed and bring with me treasures many and goodly.”
<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />Even as he spoke a bird flew by on the right, an eagle, bearing in his talons a great, white goose, a tame fowl from the yard, and men and women followed shouting. But the eagle drew near to them, and darted off to the right in front of the horses; and<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />they were glad as they saw it, and the hearts in the breasts of all were cheered. And among them Peisistratus, son of Nestor, was first to speak:
“Consider, Menelaus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts, whether it was for us two that the god showed this sign, or for thyself.”
so he spoke, and Menelaus, dear to Ares, pondered<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />how he might with understanding interpret the sign aright. But long-robed Helen took the word from him, and said:
“Hear me, and I will prophesy as the immortals put it into my heart, and as I think it will be brought to pass. Even as this eagle came<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />from the mountain, where are his kin, and where he was born, and snatched up the goose that was bred in the house, even so shall Odysseus return to his home after many toils and many wanderings, and shall take vengeance; or even now he is at home, and is sowing the seeds of evil for all the wooers.”</p>

Then again wise Telemachus answered her:<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />“So may Zeus grant, the loud-thundering lord of Here; then will I even there ever pray to thee, as to a god.”
He spoke, and touched the two horses with the lash, and they sped swiftly toward the plain, coursing eagerly through the city. So all day long they shook the yoke they bore about their necks.<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />And the sun set, and all the ways grew dark. And they came to Pherae, to the house of Diocles, son of Ortilochus, whom Alpheus begot. There they spent the night, and before them he set the entertainment due to strangers. 
As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />they yoked the horses, and mounted the inlaid car, and drove forth from the gateway and the echoing portico. Then Peisistratus touched the horses with the whip to start them, and nothing loath the pair sped onward, and soon thereafter they reached the steep citadel of <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>. Then Telemachus spoke to the son of Nestor, saying:
<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />“Son of Nestor, wilt thou now make me a promise, and fulfil it, as I bid? Friends from of old we call ourselves by reason of our fathers' friendship, and we are moreover of the same age, and this journey shall yet more stablish us in oneness of heart. Lead me not past my ship, O thou fostered of Zeus, but leave me there,<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />lest that old man keep me in his house against my will, fain to show me kindness, whereas I must needs hasten home.”
So he spoke, and the son of Nestor took counsel with his heart, how he might duly give the promise and fulfil it. And, as he pondered, this seemed to him the better course.<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />He turned his horses to the swift ship and the shore of the sea, and took out, and set in the stern of the ship the beautiful gifts, the raiment and gold, which Menelaus gave him. And he urged on Telemachus, and addressed him with winged words:
“Make haste now to go on board, and bid all thy comrades to do likewise,<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />before I reach home and bring the old man word. For well I know this in mind and heart, so masterful is his spirit he will not let thee go, but will himself come hither to bid thee to his house; and, I tell thee, he will not go back without thee; for very wroth will he be, despite of all.” 
<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />So saying, he drove his horses with beautiful mane back to the city of the Pylians, and speedily reached the palace. And Telemachus called to his men, and gave command to them, saying:
“Set all the gear in order, men, in the black ship, and let us go on board ourselves, that we may speed on our way.”
<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />So he spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed; and at once they went on board, and sat down upon the benches.</p>

He verily was busied thus, and was praying and offering sacrifice to Athena by the stern of the ship, when there drew nigh to him a man from a far land, one that was fleeing out of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> because he had slain a man;<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />and he was a seer. By lineage he was sprung from Melampus, who of old dwelt in <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, mother of flocks, a rich man and one that had a very wealthy house among the Pylians, but had afterward come to a land of strangers, fleeing from his country and from great-hearted Neleus, the lordliest of living men,<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />who for a full year had kept much wealth from him by force.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> Now Melampus meanwhile lay bound with bitter bonds in the halls of Phylacus, suffering grievous pains because of the daughter of Neleus, and the terrible blindness of heart which the goddess, the Erinys, who brings houses to ruin,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> had laid upon him.<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />Howbeit he escaped his fate, and drove off the deep-lowing kine from <placeName key="perseus,Phylace">Phylace</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, and avenged the cruel deed upon godlike Neleus, and brought the maiden home to be his own brother's wife. For himself, he went to the land of other men, to horse-pasturing <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, for there it was appointed him<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />to dwell, bearing sway over many Argives. There he wedded a wife and built him a high-roofed house, and begot Antiphates and Mantius, two stalwart sons. Now Antiphates begot great-hearted Oicles, and Oicles Amphiaraus, the rouser of the host,<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />whom Zeus, who bears the aegis, and Apollo heartily loved with all manner of love. Yet he did not reach the threshold of old age, but died in Thebe, because of a woman's gifts. To him were born sons, Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. And Mantius on his part begot Polypheides and Cleitus.<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />Now Cleitus golden-throned Dawn snatched away by reason of his beauty, that he might dwell with the immortals; but of Polypheides, high of heart, Apollo made a seer, far the best of mortals, after that Amphiaraus was dead. He removed to <placeName key="perseus,Hyperesia">Hyperesia</placeName>, having waxed wroth with his father,<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />and there he dwelt and prophesied to all men.
His son it was, Theoclymenus by name, who now came and stood by Telemachus; and he found him pouring libations and praying by his swift, black ship, and he spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />“Friend, since I find thee making burnt-offering in this place, I beseech thee by thine offerings and by the god, aye, and by thine own life and the lives of thy comrades who follow thee, tell me truly what I ask, and hide it not.

Of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> I am by birth, and my father is Odysseus, as sure as ever<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> such a one there was; but now he has perished by a pitiful fate. Therefore have I now taken my comrades and a black ship,<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />and am come to seek tidings of my father, that has long been gone.”
Then godlike Theoclymenus answered him: “Even so have I, too, fled from my country, for that I slew a man, one of mine own kin. And many brethren and kinsmen of his there are in horse-pasturing <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and mightily do they bear sway over the Achaeans.<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />It is to shun death and black fate at their hands that I flee, for, I ween, it is my lot to be a wanderer among men. But do thou set me on thy ship, since in my flight I have made prayer to thee, lest they utterly slay me; for methinks they are in pursuit.”
And wise Telemachus answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />“Then will I in no wise thrust thee from my shapely ship, since thou art eager to come. Nay, follow with us, and in our home shalt thou find entertainment such as we have.”
So saying, he took from him his spear of bronze, and laid it at length on the deck of the curved ship, and himself went aboard the seafaring ship.<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />Then he sat down in the stern and made Theoclymenus sit down beside him; and his men loosed the stern cables. And Telemachus called to his men and bade them lay hold of the tackling, and they quickly obeyed. The mast of fir<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />they raised and set in the hollow socket, and made it fast with fore-stays, and hauled up the white sail with twisted thongs of oxhide. And flashing-eyed Athena sent them a favorable wind, blowing strongly through the sky, that, speeding swiftly, the ship might accomplish her way over the salt water of the sea.<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />So they fared past Crouni and <placeName key="perseus,Chalcis">Chalcis</placeName>, with its beautiful streams.

But the two, Odysseus and the goodly swineherd, were supping in the hut, and with them supped the other men. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, Odysseus spoke among them, making trial of the swineherd to see<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />whether he would still entertain him with kindly care and bid him remain there at the farmstead, or send him forth to the city:
“Hearken now, Eumaeus, and all ye other men. In the morning I am minded to go forth to the city to beg, that I may not be the ruin of thee and of thy men. Now then, give me good counsel, and send with me a trusty guide to lead me thither;<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />but through the city will I wander by myself perforce, in the hope that one haply will give me a cup of water and a loaf. Aye, and I would go to the house of godlike Odysseus and bear tidings to the wise Penelope,<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />and join the company of the insolent wooers, if perchance they may give me a meal, since they have good cheer in abundance. Straightway might I do good service among them in all that they would. For I will tell thee, and do thou give heed and hearken. By the favour of Hermes, the messenger, who<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />lends grace and glory to all men's work, in the business of serving no man beside can vie with me, in piling well a fire, in splitting dry faggots, in carving and roasting meat, and in pouring wine —in all things in which meaner men serve the noble.”
<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />Then deeply moved didst thou speak to him, swineherd Eumaeus: “Ah me, stranger, why has such a thought come into thy mind? Verily thou art fain utterly to perish there, if thou wouldest indeed enter the throng of the wooers, whose wantonness and violence reach the iron heaven.<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />Not such as thou are their serving men; nay, they that serve them are young men, well clad in cloaks and tunics, and ever are their heads and bright faces sleek; and polished tables are laden with bread, and meat, and wine.<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />Nay, abide here; there is none that is vexed by thy presence, not I, nor any other of the men that are with me. But when the dear son of Odysseus comes, he will himself clothe thee in a cloak and a tunic as raiment, and will send thee whithersoever thy heart and spirit bid thee go.”</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: “Would, Eumaeus, that thou mightest be as dear to father Zeus as thou art to me, for that thou hast made me cease from wandering and from grievous hardships. Than roaming naught else is more evil for mortals; yet for their cursed belly's sake<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />men endure evil woes, when wandering and sorrow and pain come upon them. But now, since thou keepest me here and biddest me await thy master, come, tell me of the mother of godlike Odysseus, and of the father, whom, when he went forth, he left behind him on the threshold of old age. Are they haply still living beneath the rays of the sun?<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />or are they now dead and in the house of Hades?”
Then the swineherd, a leader of men, answered him: “Then verily, stranger, will I frankly tell thee. Laertes still lives, but ever prays to Zeus that his life may waste away from his limbs within his halls.<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />For wondrously does he grieve for his son that is gone, and for the wise lady, his wedded wife, whose death troubled him most of all, and brought him to untimely old age. But she died of grief for her glorious son by a miserable death, as I would that no man may die<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />who dwells here as my friend and does me kindness. So long as she lived, though it was in sorrow, it was ever a pleasure to me to ask and enquire after her, for she herself had brought me up with long-robed Ctimene, her noble daughter, whom she bore as her youngest child.<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />With her was I brought up, and the mother honored me little less than her own children. But when we both reached the longed-for prime of youth they sent her to Same to wed, and got themselves countless bridal gifts, but as for me, my lady clad me in a cloak and tunic, right goodly raiment, and gave me sandals for my feet<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />and sent me forth to the field; but in her heart she loved me the more. But now I lack all this, though for my own part the blessed gods make to prosper the work to which I give heed. Therefrom have I eaten and drunk, and given to reverend strangers. But from my mistress I may hear naught pleasant,<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />whether word or deed, for a plague has fallen upon the house, even overweening men. Yet greatly do servants long to speak before their mistress, and learn of all, and to eat and drink, and thereafter to carry off somewhat also to the fields, such things as ever make the heart of a servant to grow warm.”</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Lo now, surely when thou wast but a child, swineherd Eumaeus, thou didst wander far from thy country and thy parents. But come now, tell me this, and declare it truly. Was a broad-wayed city of men sacked,<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />wherein thy father and honored mother dwelt? Or, when thou wast alone with thy sheep or cattle, did foemen take thee in their ships and bear thee for sale to the house of this thy master, who paid for thee a goodly price?”
Then the swineherd, a leader of men, answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />“Stranger, since thou dost ask and question me of this, hearken now in silence, and take thy joy, and drink thy wine, as thou sittest here. These nights are wondrous long. There is time for sleep, and there is time to take joy in hearing tales; thou needest not lay thee down till it be time; there is weariness even in too much sleep.<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />As for the rest, if any man's heart and spirit bid him, let him go forth and sleep, and at daybreak let him eat, and follow our master's swine. But we two will drink and feast in the hut, and will take delight each in the other's grievous woes,<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />as we recall them to mind. For in after time a man finds joy even in woes, whosoever has suffered much, and wandered much. But this will I tell thee, of which thou dost ask and enquire. 
“There is an isle called <placeName key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, if haply thou hast heard thereof, above Ortygia, where are the turning-places of the sun.<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />It is not so very thickly settled, but it is a good land, rich in herds, rich in flocks, full of wine, abounding in wheat.

Her the wily Phoenicians beguiled.<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />First, as she was washing clothes, one of them lay with her in love by the hollow ship; for this beguiles the minds of women, even though one be upright. Then he asked her who she was, and whence she came, and she straightway shewed him the high-roofed home of my father, and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />“‘Out of <placeName key="tgn,7002861">Sidon</placeName>, rich in bronze, I declare that I come, and I am the daughter of Arybas, to whom wealth flowed in streams.

<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />“Then the man who had lain with her in secret answered her: ‘Wouldest thou then return again with us to thy home, that thou mayest see the high-roofed house of thy father and mother, and see them too? For of a truth they yet live, and are accounted rich.’
“Then the woman answered him, and said:<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />‘This may well be, if you sailors will pledge yourselves by an oath, that you will bring me safely home.’
“So she spoke, and they all gave an oath thereto, as she bade them. But when they had sworn and made an end of the oath, the woman again spoke among them, and made answer:
<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />“‘Be silent now, and let no one of your company speak to me, if he meets me in the street or haply at the well, lest some one go to the palace and tell the old king, and he wax suspicious and bind me with grievous bonds, and devise death for you.<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line" />Nay, keep my words in mind, and speed the barter of your wares. But, when your ship is laden with goods, let a message come quickly to me at the palace; for I will also bring whatever gold comes under my hand.

“So saying, she departed to the fair palace.<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line" />And they remained there in our land a full year, and got by trade much substance in their hollow ship. But when their hollow ship was laden for their return, then they sent a messenger to bear tidings to the woman. There came a man, well versed in guile, to my father's house<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line" />with a necklace of gold, and with amber beads was it strung between. This the maidens in the hall and my honored mother were handling, and were gazing on it, and were offering him their price; but he nodded to the woman in silence. Then verily when he had nodded to her, he went his way to the hollow ship,<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line" />but she took me by the hand, and led me forth from the house. Now in the fore-hall of the palace she found the cups and tables of the banqueters, who waited upon my father. They had gone forth to the council and the people's place of debate, but she quickly hid three goblets in her bosom,<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line" />and bore them away; and I followed in my heedlessness. Then the sun set, and all the ways grew dark. And we made haste and came to the goodly harbor, where was the swift ship of the Phoenicians. Then they embarked,<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line" />putting both of us on board as well, and sailed over the watery ways, and Zeus sent them a favorable wind. For six days we sailed, night and day alike; but when Zeus, son of Cronos, brought upon us the seventh day, then Artemis, the archer, smote the woman, and she fell with a thud into the hold, as a sea bird plunges.<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line" />Her they cast forth to be a prey to seals and fishes, but I was left, my heart sore stricken. Now the wind, as it bore them, and the wave, brought them to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, where Laertes bought me with his wealth. Thus it was that my eyes beheld this land.”
<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line" />To him then Zeus-born Odysseus made answer, and said: “Eumaeus, of a truth thou hast deeply stirred the heart in my breast in telling all this tale of the sorrow thou hast borne at heart. Yet verily in thy case Zeus has given good side by side with the evil, since after all thy toil thou hast come to the house of<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line" />a kindly man, who gives thee food and drink, and that with kindness, and thou livest well; while as for me, it is while wandering through the many cities of men that I am come hither.”</p>

Thus they spoke to one another, and then lay down to sleep, for no long time, but for a little;<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line" />for soon came fair-throned Dawn. But the comrades of Telemachus, drawing near the shore, furled the sail, and took down the mast quickly, and rowed the ship to her anchorage with their oars. Then they cast out the mooring-stones and made fast the stern cables, and themselves went forth upon the shore of the sea,<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line" />and made ready their meal and mixed the flaming wine. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, among them wise Telemachus was the first to speak, saying:
“Do you now row the black ship to the city, but I will visit the fields and the herdsmen,<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line" />and at evening will come to the city when I have looked over my lands. And in the morning I will set before you, as wages for your journey, a good feast of flesh and sweet wine.”
Then godlike Theoclymenus answered him: “Whither shall I go, dear child? To whose house shall I come<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line" />of those who rule in rocky <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>? Or shall I go straight to thy mother's house and thine?”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Were things otherwise, I should bid thee go even to our house, for there is in no wise lack of entertainment for strangers, but<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line" />it would be worse for thyself, since I shall be away, and my mother will not see thee. For she does not often appear before the wooers in the house, but apart from them weaves at her loom in an upper chamber. But I will tell thee of another man to whom thou mayest go, Eurymachus, glorious son of wise Polybus,<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line" />whom now the men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> look upon as on a god. For he is by far the best man, and is most eager to marry my mother and to have the honor of Odysseus.

In his talons he held a dove, and was plucking her and shedding the feathers down on the ground midway between the ship and Telemachus himself. Then Theoclymenus called him apart from his companions,<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line" />and clasped his hand, and spoke, and addressed him:
“Telemachus, surely not without a god's warrant has this bird flown forth upon our right, for I knew, as I looked upon him, that he was a bird of omen. Than yours is no other house in the land of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> more kingly; nay, ye are ever supreme.”
<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line" />Then wise Telemachus answered him again: “Ah, stranger, I would that this word of thine might be fulfilled. Then shouldest thou straightway know of kindness and many a gift from me, so that one that met thee would call thee blessed.”
Therewith he spoke to Peiraeus, his trusty comrade:<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line" /> “Peiraeus, son of Clytius, it is thou that in other matters art wont to hearken to me above all my comrades, who went with me to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>; so now do thou, I pray thee, take this stranger and give him kindly welcome in thy house, and show him honor until I come.”
<milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line" />Then Peiraeus, the famous spearman, answered him: “Telemachus, though thou shouldest stay here long, I will entertain him, and he shall have no lack of what is due to strangers.” 
So saying, he went on board the ship, and bade his comrades themselves to embark and to loose the stern cables. So they went on board straightway, and sat down upon the benches.<milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line" />But Telemachus bound beneath his feet his fair sandals, and took his mighty spear, tipped with sharp bronze, from the deck of the ship. Then the men loosed the stern cables, and thrusting off, sailed to the city, as Telemachus bade, the dear son of divine Odysseus.<milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line" />But his feet bore him swiftly on, as he strode forward, until he reached the farmstead where were his countless swine, among whom slept the worthy swineherd with a heart loyal to his masters.</p>

And goodly Odysseus noted the fawning of the hounds, and the sound of footsteps fell upon his ears; and straightway he spoke to Eumaeus winged words:
“Eumaeus, surely some comrade of thine will be coming, or at least some one thou knowest, for the hounds do not bark,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />but fawn about him, and I hear the sound of footsteps.”
Not yet was the word fully uttered, when his own dear son stood in the doorway.

And he went to meet his lord,<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />and kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes and his two hands, and a big tear fell from him.

For thou dost not often visit the farm and the herdsmen, but abidest in the town; so, I ween, has it seemed good to thy heart, to look upon the destructive throng of the wooers.”
<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />Then wise Telemachus answered him: “So shall it be, father. It is for thy sake that I am come hither, to see thee with my eyes, and to hear thee tell whether my mother still abides in the halls, or whether by now some other man has wedded her, and the couch of Odysseus<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />lies haply in want of bedding, covered with foul spider-webs.”
Then the swineherd, a leader of men, answered him: “Aye, verily, she abides with steadfast heart in thy halls, and ever sorrowfully for her the nights and the days wane as she weeps.”
<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />So saying, he took from him the spear of bronze, and Telemachus went in and passed over the stone threshold. As he drew near, his father, Odysseus, rose from his seat and gave him place, but Telemachus on his part checked him, and said:
“Be seated, stranger, and we shall find a seat elsewhere<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />in our farmstead. There is a man here who will set us one.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="46" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and Odysseus went back and sat down again, and for Telemachus the swineherd strewed green brushwood beneath and a fleece above it, and there the dear son of Odysseus sat down. Then the swineherd set before them platters<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />of roast meats, which they had left at their meal the day before, and quickly heaped up bread in baskets, and mixed in a bowl of ivy wood honey-sweet wine, and himself sat down over against divine Odysseus. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them.<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, Telemachus spoke to the goodly swineherd, and said:
“Father, from whence did this stranger come to thee? How did sailors bring him to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>? Who did they declare themselves to be? For nowise, methinks, did he come hither on foot.”
<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Then verily, my child, I will tell thee all the truth. From broad <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> he declares that he has birth, and he says that he has wandered roaming through many cities of mortals; so has a god spun for him this lot.<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />But now he has run away from a ship of the Thesprotians and come to my farmstead, and I shall put him in thy hands. Do what thou wilt. He declares himself thy suppliant.”
Then again wise Telemachus answered him: “Eumaeus, verily this word which thou hast uttered stings me to the heart.<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />For how am I to welcome this stranger in my house? I am myself but young, nor have I yet trust in my might to defend me against a man, when one waxes wroth without a cause. And as for my mother, the heart in her breast wavers this way and that, whether to abide here with me and keep the house,<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />respecting the bed of her husband and the voice of the people, or to go now with him whosoever is best of the Achaeans that woo her in the halls, and offers the most gifts of wooing. But verily, as regards this stranger, now that he has come to thy house, I will clothe him in a cloak and tunic, fair raiment,<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />and will give him a two-edged sword, and sandals for his feet, and send him whithersoever his heart and spirit bid him go. Or, if thou wilt, do thou keep him here at the farmstead, and care for him, and raiment will I send hither and all his food to eat, that he be not the ruin of thee and of thy men.<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />But thither will I not suffer him to go, to join the company of the wooers, for they are over-full of wanton insolence, lest they mock him, and dread grief come upon me. And to achieve aught is hard for one man among many, how mighty soever he be, for verily they are far stronger.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="90" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: “Friend, since surely it is right for me to make answer—verily ye rend my heart, as I hear your words, such wantonness you say the wooers devise in the halls in despite of thee, so goodly a man.<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />Tell me, art thou willingly thus oppressed? Or do the people throughout the land hate thee, following the voice of a god? Or hast thou cause to blame thy brothers, in whose fighting a man trusts even if a great strife arise. Would that with my present temper I were as young as thou,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />either the son of blameless Odysseus, or Odysseus himself,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> straightway then might some stranger cut my head from off my neck, if I did not prove myself the bane of them all when I had come to the halls of Odysseus, son of Laertes.<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />But if they should overwhelm me by their numbers, alone as I was, far rather would I die, slain in my own halls, than behold continually these shameful deeds, strangers mishandled, and men dragging the handmaidens in shameful fashion through the fair halls,<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />and wine drawn to waste, and men devouring my bread all heedlessly, without limit, with no end to the business.”
And wise Telemachus answered him: “Then verily, stranger, I will frankly tell thee all. Neither do the people at large bear me any grudge or hatred,<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />nor have I cause to blame brothers, in whose fighting a man trusts, even if a great strife arise. For in this wise has the son of Cronos made our house to run in but a single line. As his only son did Arceisius beget Laertes, as his only son again did his father beget Odysseus, and Odysseus<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />begot me as his only son, and left me in his halls, and had no joy of me. Therefore it is that foes past counting are now in the house; for all the princes who hold sway over the islands—Dulichium, and Same, and wooded Zacynthus—and those who lord it over rocky <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />all these woo my mother and lay waste my house. And she neither refuses the hateful marriage, nor is she able to make an end; but they with feasting consume my substance, and will ere long bring me, too, to ruin. Yet these things verily lie on the knees of the gods.<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />But, father, do thou go with speed, and tell constant Penelope that she has me safe, and I am come from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>. But I will abide here, and do thou come back hither, when thou hast told thy tale to her alone; but of the rest of the Achaeans let no one learn it, for many there are who contrive evil against me.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="135" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “I see, I give heed; this thou biddest one with understanding. But come now, tell me this, and declare it truly; whether I shall go on the self-same way with tidings to Laertes also, wretched man, who for a time, though grieving sorely for Odysseus,<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />was still wont to oversee the fields, and would eat and drink with the slaves in the house, as the heart in his breast bade him. But now, from the day when thou wentest in thy ship to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, they say he has no more eaten and drunk as before, nor overseen the fields, but with groaning and wailing<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />he sits and weeps, and the flesh wastes from off his bones.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “'Tis the sadder; but none the less we will let him be, despite our sorrow; for if in any wise all things might be had by mortals for the wishing, we should choose first of all the day of my father's return.<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />No, do thou come back, when thou hast given thy message, and wander not over the fields in search of Laertes; but did my mother with all speed send forth her handmaid, the housewife, secretly, for she might bear word to the old man.”
With this he roused the swineherd, and he took his sandals in his hands<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />and bound them beneath his feet and went forth to the city. Nor was Athena unaware that the swineherd Eumaeus was gone from the farmstead, but she drew near in the likeness of a woman, comely and tall, and skilled in glorious handiwork. And she stood over against the door of the hut, shewing herself to Odysseus,<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />but Telemachus did not see her before him, or notice her; for in no wise do the gods appear in manifest presence to all. But Odysseus saw her, and the hounds, and they barked not, but with whining slunk in fear to the further side of the farmstead. The she made a sign with her brows, and goodly Odysseus perceived it,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />and went forth from the hall, past the great wall of the court, and stood before her, and Athena spoke to him, saying:
“Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, even now do thou reveal thy word to thy son, and hide it not, that when you two have planned death and fate for the wooers,<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />you may go to the famous city. Nor will I myself be long away from you, for I am eager for the battle.”
With this, Athena touched him with her golden wand. A well-washed cloak and a tunic she first of all cast about his breast, and she increased his stature and his youthful bloom.<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />Once more he grew dark of color, and his cheeks filled out, and dark grew the beard about his chin. Then, when she had wrought thus, she departed, but Odysseus went into the hut. And his dear son marvelled, and, seized with fear, turned his eyes aside, lest it should be a god.<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />And he spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
“Of other sort thou seemest to me now, stranger, than awhile ago, and other are the garments thou hast on, and thy color is no more the same. Verily thou art a god, one of those who hold broad heaven. Nay then, be gracious, that we may offer to thee acceptable sacrifices<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />and golden gifts, finely wrought; but do thou spare us.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="186" type="card">
                    <p>
Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: “Be sure I am no god; why dost thou liken me to the immortals? Nay, I am thy father, for whose sake thou dost with groaning endure many griefs, and submittest to the violence of men.” 
<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />So saying, he kissed his son, and from his cheeks let fall a tear to earth, but before he ever steadfastly held them back. Howbeit Telemachus—for he did not yet believe that it was his father—again answered, and spoke to him, saying:
“Thou verily art not my father Odysseus, but some god<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />beguiles me, that I may weep and groan yet more. For nowise could a mortal man contrive this by his own wit, unless a god were himself to come to him, and easily by his will make him young or old. For verily but now thou wast an old man and meanly clad,<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />whereas now thou art like the gods, who hold broad heaven.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Telemachus, it beseems thee not to wonder overmuch that thy father is in the house, or to be amazed. For thou mayest be sure no other Odysseus will ever come hither;<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />but I here, I, even such as thou seest me, after sufferings and many wanderings, am come in the twentieth year to my native land. But this, thou must know, is the work of Athena, driver of the spoil, who makes me such as she will—for she has the power—now like a beggar, and now again<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />like a young man, and one wearing fair raiment about his body. Easy it is for the gods, who hold broad heaven, both to glorify a mortal man and to abase him.”
So saying, he sat down, and Telemachus, flinging his arms about his noble father, wept and shed tears,<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />and in the hearts of both arose a longing for lamentation. And they wailed aloud more vehemently than birds, sea-eagles, or vultures with crooked talons, whose young the country-folk have taken from their nest before they were fledged; even so piteously did they let tears fall from beneath their brows.<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />And now would the light of the sun have gone down upon their weeping, had not Telemachus spoken to his father suddenly:
“In what manner of ship, dear father, have sailors now brought thee hither to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>? Who did they declare themselves to be? For nowise, methinks, didst thou come hither on foot.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="225" type="card">

                        <milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />And the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: “Then verily, my child, I will tell thee all the truth. The Phaeacians brought me, men famed for their ships, who send other men too on their way, whosoever comes to them. And they brought me as I slept in a swift ship over the sea,<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />and set me down in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and gave me glorious gifts, stores of bronze and gold and woven raiment. These treasures, by the favour of the gods, are lying in caves. And now I am come hither at the bidding of Athena, that we may take counsel about the slaying of our foes.<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />Come now, count me the wooers, and tell their tale, that I may know how many they are and what manner of men, and that I may ponder in my noble heart and decide whether we two shall be able to maintain our cause against them alone without others, or whether we shall also seek out others.”
<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Father, of a truth I have ever heard of thy great fame, that thou wast a warrior in strength of hand and in wise counsel, but this thou sayest is too great; amazement holds me. It could not be that two men should fight against many men and mighty.<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />For of the wooers there are not ten alone, or twice ten, but full many more. Here as we are shalt thou straightway learn their number. From Dulichium there are two and fifty chosen youths, and six serving men attend them; from Same came four and twenty men;<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />from <placeName key="tgn,7011374">Zacynthus</placeName> there are twenty youths of the Achaeans; and from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself twelve men, all of them the noblest, and with them is Medon, the herald, and the divine minstrel, and two squires skilled in carving meats. If we shall meet all these within the halls,<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />bitter, I fear, and with bane will be thy coming to avenge violence. Nay, do thou consider, if thou canst bethink thee of any helper—one that would aid us two with a ready heart.”
Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him:“Well, then, I will tell thee, and do thou give heed and hearken to my words,<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />and consider whether for us two Athena, with father Zeus, will be enough, or whether I shall bethink me of some other helper.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Good, thou mayest be sure, are these two helpers whom thou dost mention, though high in the clouds do they abide, and they<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />rule over all men alike and the immortal gods.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="266" type="card">
                    <p>
Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered: “Not long of a surety will those two hold aloof from the mighty fray, when between the wooers and us in my halls the might of Ares is put to the test.<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />But for the present, do thou go at daybreak to thy house and join the company of the haughty wooers. As for me, the swineherd will lead me later on to the city in the likeness of a woeful and aged beggar. And if they shall put despite on me in the house,<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />let the heart in thy breast endure while I am evil entreated, even if they drag me by the feet through the house to the door, or hurl at me and smite me; still do thou endure to behold it. Thou shalt indeed bid them cease their folly, seeking to dissuade them with gentle words; yet in no wise<milestone ed="p" n="580" unit="line" />will they hearken to thee, for verily their day of doom is at hand. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. When Athena, rich in counsel, shall put it in my mind, I will nod to thee with my head; and do thou thereupon, when thou notest it, take all the weapons of war that lie in thy halls,<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />and lay them away one and all in the secret place of the lofty store-room. And as for the wooers, when they miss the arms and question thee, do thou beguile them with gentle words, saying:
“‘Out of the smoke have I laid them,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> since they are no longer like those which of old Odysseus left behind him when he went forth to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />but are all befouled so far as the breath of the fire has reached them. And furthermore this greater fear has the son of Cronos put in my heart, lest haply, when heated with wine, you may set a quarrel afoot among you and wound one another, and so bring shame on your feast and on your wooing. For of itself does the iron draw a man to it.’
<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />“But for us two alone do thou leave behind two swords and two spears, and two ox-hide shields for us to grasp, that we may rush upon them and seize them; while as for the wooers, Pallas Athena and Zeus, the counsellor, will beguile them. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart.<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />If in truth thou art my son and of our blood, then let no one hear that Odysseus is at home; neither let Laertes know it, nor the swineherd, nor any of the household, nor Penelope herself; but by ourselves thou and I will learn the temper of the women.<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />Aye, and we will likewise make trial of many a one of the serving men, and see where any of them honours us two and fears us at heart, and who recks not of us and scorns thee, a man so goodly.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="308" type="card">
                    <p>
Then his glorious son answered him, and said: “Father, my spirit, methinks,<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />thou shalt verily come to know hereafter, for no slackness of will possesses me. But I think not that this plan will be a gain to us both, and so I bid thee take thought. Long time shalt thou vainly go about, making trial of each man as thou visitest the farms, while in thy halls those others at their ease<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />are wasting thy substance in insolent wise, and there is no sparing. Yet verily, as for the women, I do bid thee learn who among them dishonor thee, and who are guiltless. But of the men in the farmsteads I would not that we should make trial, but that we should deal therewith hereafter,<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />if in very truth thou knowest some sign from Zeus who bears the aegis.”
Thus they spoke to one another, but meanwhile into <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> put the well-built ship that brought Telemachus and all his comrades from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>; and they, when they had come into the deep harbor,<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />drew the black ship up on the shore, while proud squires bore forth their armour and straightway carried the beauteous gifts to the house of Clytius. But they sent a herald forth to the house of Odysseus to bear word to wise Penelope<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />that Telemachus was at the farm, and had bidden the ship to sail on to the city, lest the noble queen might grow anxious and let round tears fall. So the two met, the herald and the goodly swineherd, on the self-same errand, to bear tidings to the lady.<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />And when they reached the palace of the godlike king, the herald spoke out in the midst of the handmaids, and said: “Even now, queen, thy son has come back from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>.”
But the swineherd came close to Penelope and told her all that her dear son had bidden him say.<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />And when he had fully told all that had been commanded him, he went his way to the swine and left the courtyard and the hall.
But the wooers were dismayed and downcast in spirit, and forth they went from the hall past the great wall of the court, and there before the gates they sat down.<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />Then among them Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the first to speak:
“My friends, verily a great deed has been insolently brought to pass by Telemachus, even this journey, and we deemed that he would never see it accomplished. But come, let us launch a black ship, the best we have, and let us get together seamen as rowers that they may straightway<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />bear tidings to those others speedily to return home.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="351" type="card">
                    <p>
Not yet was the word fully uttered when Amphinomus, turning in his place, saw a ship in the deep harbor and men furling the sail, and with oars in their hands. Then, breaking into a merry laugh, he spoke among his comrades:
<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />“Let us not be sending a message any more, for here they are at home. Either some god told them of this, or they themselves caught sight of the ship of Telemachus as she sailed by, but could not catch her.”
So he spoke, and they rose up and went to the shore of the sea. Swiftly the men drew up the black ship on the shore,<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />and proud squires bore forth their armour. Themselves meanwhile went all together to the place of assembly, and none other would they suffer to sit with them, either of the young men or the old. Then among them spoke Antinous, son of Eupeithes:
“Lo, now, see how the gods have delivered this man from destruction.<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />Day by day watchmen sat upon the windy heights, watch ever following watch, and at set of sun we never spent a night upon the shore, but sailing over the deep in our swift ship we waited for the bright Dawn, lying in wait for Telemachus, that we might take him and slay<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />the man himself; howbeit meanwhile some god has brought him home. But, on our part, let us here devise for him a woeful death, even for Telemachus, and let him not escape from out our hands, for I deem that while he lives this work of ours will not prosper. For he is himself shrewd in counsel and in wisdom,<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />and the people nowise show us favour any more. Nay, come, before he gathers the Achaeans to the place of assembly—for methinks he will in no wise be slow to act, but will be full of wrath, and rising up will declare among them all how that we contrived against him utter destruction, but did not catch him;<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />and they will not praise us when they hear of our evil deeds. Beware, then, lest they work us some harm and drive us out from our country, and we come to the land of strangers. Nay, let us act first, and seize him in the field far from the city, or on the road; and his substance let us ourselves keep, and his wealth,<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />dividing them fairly among us; though the house we would give to his mother to possess, and to him who weds her. Howbeit if this plan does not please you, but you choose rather that he should live and keep all the wealth of his fathers, let us not continue to devour his store of pleasant things<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />as we gather together here, but let each man from his own hall woo her with his gifts and seek to win her; and she then would wed him who offers most, and who comes as her fated lord.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="393" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and they were all hushed in silence. Then Amphinomus addressed their assembly, and spoke among them.<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />He was the glorious son of the prince Nisus, son of Aretias, and he led the wooers who came from Dulichium, rich in wheat and in grass, and above all the others he pleased Penelope with his words, for he had an understanding heart. He it was who with good intent addressed their assembly, and spoke among them:
<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />“Friends, I surely would not choose to kill Telemachus; a dread thing is it to slay one of royal stock. Nay, let us first seek to learn the will of the gods. If the oracles of great Zeus approve, I will myself slay him, and bid all the others do so;<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />but if the gods turn us from the act, I bid you desist.”
Thus spoke Amphinomus, and his word was pleasing to them. So they arose straightway and went to the house of Odysseus, and entering in, sat down on the polished seats.
Then the wise Penelope took other counsel,<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />to show herself to the wooers, overweening in their insolence. For she had learned of the threatened death of her son in her halls, for the herald Medon told her, who had heard their counsel. So she went her way toward the hall with her handmaids. But when the fair lady reached the wooers,<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />she stood by the doorpost of the well-built hall, holding before her face her shining veil; and she rebuked Antinous, and spoke, and addressed him:
“Antinous, full of insolence, deviser of evil! and yet it is thou, men say, that dost excel among all of thy years in the land of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />in counsel and in speech. But thou, it seems, art not such a man. Madman! why dost thou devise death and fate for Telemachus, and carest not for suppliants, for whom Zeus is witness. 'Tis an impious thing to plot evil one against another. Dost thou not know of the time when thy father came to this house a fugitive<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />in terror of the people? For of a truth they were greatly wroth with him because he had joined Taphian pirates and harried the Thesprotians, who were in league with us. Him, then, they were minded to slay, and take from him his life by violence, and utterly to devour his great and pleasant livelihood;<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />but Odysseus held them back, and stayed them despite their eagerness. His house it is that thou consumest now without atonement, and wooest his wife, and seekest to slay his son, and on me thou bringest great distress. Nay, forbear, I charge thee, and bid the rest forbear.”</p>

Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered her:<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />“Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, be of good cheer, and let not things distress thy heart. That man lives not, nor shall live, nor shall ever be born, who shall lay hands upon thy son Telemachus while I live and behold the light upon the earth.<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />For thus will I speak out to thee, and verily it shall be brought to pass. Quickly shall that man's black blood flow forth about my spear; for of a truth me, too, did Odysseus the sacker of cities often set upon his knees, and put roast meat in my hands, and hold to my lips red wine.<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line" />Therefore Telemachus is far the dearest of all men to me, and I bid him have no fear of death, at least from the wooers; but from the gods can no man avoid it.”
Thus he spoke to cheer her, but against that son he was himself plotting death. So she went up to her bright upper chamber<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line" />and then bewailed Odysseus, her dear husband, until flashing-eyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.
But at evening the goodly swineherd came back to Odysseus and his son, and they were busily making ready their supper, and had slain a boar of a year old. Then Athena<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line" />came close to Odysseus, son of Laertes, and smote him with her wand, and again made him an old man; and mean raiment she put about his body, lest the swineherd might look upon him and know him, and might go to bear tidings to constant Penelope, and not hold the secret fast in his heart.
<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line" />Now Telemachus spoke first to the swineherd, and said: “Thou hast come, goodly Eumaeus. What news is there in the city? Have the proud wooers by this time come home from their ambush, or are they still watching for me where they were, to take me on my homeward way?”
To him, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer and say:<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line" />“I was not minded to go about the city, asking and enquiring of this; my heart bade me with all speed to come back hither when I had given my message. But there joined me a swift messenger from thy companions, a herald, who was the first to tell the news to thy mother.<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line" />And this further thing I know, for I saw it with my eyes. I was now above the city, as I went on my way, where the hill of Hermes is, when I saw a swift ship putting into our harbor, and there were many men in her, and she was laden with shields and double-pointed spears.<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line" />And I thought it was they, but I have no knowledge.”
So he spoke, and the strong and mighty Telemachus smiled and with his eyes he glanced at his father, but shunned the swineherd's eye.
And when they had ceased from their labour and had made ready the meal, they fell to feasting, nor did their hearts lack aught of the equal feast.<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line" />But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, they bethought them of rest, and took the gift of sleep.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, bound beneath his feet his fair sandals and took his mighty spear, that fitted his grasp,<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />hasting to the city; and he spoke to his swineherd, saying:
“Father, I verily am going to the city, that my mother may see me, for, methinks, she will not cease from woeful wailing and tearful lamentation until she sees my very self. But to thee I give this charge.<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />Lead this wretched stranger to the city, that there he may beg his food, and whoso will shall give him a loaf and a cup of water. For my part, I can in no wise burden myself with all men, seeing that I have grief at heart. But if the stranger is sore angered at this,<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />it will be the worse for him. I verily love to speak the truth.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Friend, be sure I am not myself fain to be left here. For a beggar it is better to beg his food in the town than in the fields, and whoso will shall give it me.<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />For I am no more of an age to remain at the farmstead, so as to obey in all things the command of an overseer. Nay, go thy way; this man that thou biddest will lead me as soon as I have warmed myself at the fire, and the sun has grown hot. For miserably poor are these garments which I wear, and I fear lest<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />the morning frost may overcome me; and ye say it is far to the city.” 
So he spoke, and Telemachus passed out through the farmstead with rapid strides, and was sowing the seeds of evil for the wooers. But when he came to the stately house he set his spear in place, leaning it against a tall pillar,<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />and himself went in and crossed the threshold of stone.
Him the nurse Eurycleia was far the first to see, as she was spreading fleeces on the richly-wrought chairs. With a burst of tears she came straight toward him, and round about them gathered the other maids of Odysseus of the steadfast heart,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />and they kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome.
Then forth from her chamber came wise Penelope, like unto Artemis or golden Aphrodite, and bursting into tears she flung her arms about her dear son, and kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes;<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />and with wailing she spoke to him winged words:
“Thou art come, Telemachus, sweet light of my eyes; I thought I should never see thee more after thou hadst gone in thy ship to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>—secretly, and in my despite, to seek tidings of thy dear father. Come, then, tell me what sight thou hadst of him.”</p>

                <div2 n="45" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />Then wise Telemachus answered her:“My mother, stir not lamentation, I pray thee, nor rouse the heart in my breast, seeing that I am escaped from utter destruction. Nay, bathe thyself, and take clean raiment for thy body, and then, going to thy upper chamber with thy handmaids,<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />vow to all the gods that thou wilt offer hecatombs that bring fulfillment, in the hope that Zeus may some day bring deeds of requital to pass. But I will go to the place of assembly that I may bid to our house a stranger who followed me from Pylos on my way hither. Him I sent forward with my godlike comrades,<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />and I bade Peiraeus take him home and give him kindly welcome, and show him honor until I should come.”
So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> Then she bathed and took clean raiment for her body, and vowed to all the gods that she would offer hecatombs<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />that bring fulfillment, in the hope that Zeus would some day bring deeds of requital to pass.
But Telemachus thereafter went forth through the hall with his spear in his hand, and with him went two swift hounds. And wondrous was the grace that Athena shed upon him, and all the people marvelled at him as he came.<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />Round about him the proud wooers thronged, speaking him fair, but pondering evil in the deep of their hearts. Howbeit he avoided the great throng of these men, but where Mentor sat, and Antiphus, and Halitherses, who were friends of his father's house of old,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />there he went and sat down, and they questioned him of each thing. Then Peiraeus, the famous spearman, drew near, leading the stranger through the city to the place of assembly; and Telemachus did not long turn away from his guest, but went up to him. Then Peiraeus was the first to speak, saying:
<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />“Telemachus, quickly send women to my house, that I may send to thee the gifts which Menelaus gave thee.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Peiraeus, we know not how these things will be. If the proud wooers<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />shall secretly slay me in my hall, and divide among them all the goods of my fathers, I would that thou shouldest keep and enjoy these things thyself rather than one of these. But if I shall sow for them the seeds of death and fate, then do thou bring all to my house gladly, as I shall be glad.”</p>

                <div2 n="84" type="card">
                    <p>
So saying, he led the sore-tired stranger to the house.<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />Now when they had come to the stately house they laid their cloaks on the chairs and high seats, and went into the polished baths and bathed. And when the maids had bathed them and anointed them with oil, and had cast about them fleecy cloaks and tunics,<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />they came forth from the baths and sat down upon the chairs. Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold, and poured it over a silver basin for them to wash, and beside them drew up a polished table. And the grave housewife brought and set before them bread,<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />and therewith meats in abundance, granting freely of her store. And his mother sat over against Telemachus by the door-post of the hall, leaning against a chair and spinning fine threads of yarn. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />the wise Penelope spoke first among them:
“Telemachus, I truly will go to my upper chamber and lay me on my bed, which has become for me a bed of wailing, ever wet with my tears, since the day when Odysseus set forth with the sons of Atreus for <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>. But thou tookest no care,<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />before the proud wooers come into this house, to tell me plainly of the return of thy father, if haply thou heardest aught.”
And wise Telemachus answered her: “Then verily, mother, I will tell thee all the truth. We went to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> and to Nestor, the shepherd of the people,<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />and he received me in his lofty house and gave me kindly welcome, as a father might his own son who after a long time had newly come from a far: even so kindly he tended me with his glorious sons. Yet of Odysseus of the steadfast heart,<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />whether living or dead, he said he had heard naught from any man on earth. But he sent me on my way with horses and jointed car to Menelaus, son of Atreus, the famous spearman. There I saw Argive Helen, for whose sake Argives and Trojans toiled much by the will of the gods.</p>

                <div2 n="120" type="card">

                        <milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />And straightway Menelaus, good at the war-cry, asked me in quest of what I had come to goodly <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>; and I told him all the truth. Then he made answer to me, and said:
“‘Out upon them! for verily in the bed of a man of valiant heart<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />were they fain to lie, who are themselves cravens. Even as when in the thicket-lair of a mighty lion a hind has laid to sleep her new-born suckling fawns, and roams over the mountain slopes and grassy vales seeking pasture, and then the lion comes to his lair<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />and upon the two lets loose a cruel doom, so will Odysseus let loose a cruel doom upon these men. I would, O father Zeus, and Athena, and Apollo, that in such strength, as when once in fair-stablished <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName> he rose up and wrestled a match with Philomeleides<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />and threw him mightily, and all the Achaeans rejoiced, even in such strength Odysseus might come among the wooers; then should they all find swift destruction and bitterness in their wooing. But in this matter of which thou dost ask and entreat me, verily I will not swerve aside to speak of other things, nor will I deceive thee;<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />but of all that the unerring old man of the sea told me, not one thing will I hide from thee or conceal. He said that he had seen Odysseus in an island in grievous distress, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who keeps him there perforce. And he cannot come to his own native land, for he has at hand no ships with oars, and no comrades,<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea.’
“So spoke Menelaus, son of Atreus, the famous spearman. Now when I had made an end of all this I set out for home, and the immortals gave me a fair wind and brought me quickly to my dear native land.”
<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />So he spoke, and stirred the heart in her breast. Then among them spoke also the godlike Theoclymenus, saying:
“Honored wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, he truly has no clear understanding; but do thou hearken to my words, for with certain knowledge will I prophesy to thee, and will hide naught.<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />Be my witness Zeus above all gods, and this hospitable board and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come, that verily Odysseus is even now in his native land, resting or moving, learning of these evil deeds, and he is sowing the seeds of evil for all the wooers.<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />So plain a bird of omen did I mark as I sat on the benched ship, and I declared it to Telemachus.”
Then wise Penelope answered him: “Ah, stranger, I would that this word of thine might be fulfilled. Then shouldest thou straightway know of kindness and many a gift<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />from me, so that one who met thee would call the blessed.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="166" type="card">
                    <p>
Thus they spoke to one another. And the wooers meanwhile in front of the palace of Odysseus were making merry, throwing the discus and the javelin in a levelled place, as their wont was, in insolence of heart.<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />But when it was the hour for dinner, and the flocks came in from all sides from the fields, and the men led them who were wont to lead, then Medon, who of all the heralds was most to their liking and was ever present at their feasts, spoke to them, saying:
“Youths, now that you have all made glad your hearts with sport,<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />come to the house that we may make ready a feast; for it is no bad thing to take one's dinner in season.”
So he spoke, and they rose up and went, and hearkened to his word. And when they had come to the stately house they laid their cloaks on the chairs and high seats,<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />and men fell to slaying great sheep and fat goats, aye, and fatted and swine, and a heifer of the herd, and so made ready the meal. But Odysseus and the goodly swineherd were making haste to go from the field to the city; and the swineherd, a leader of men, spoke first, and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />“Stranger, since thou art eager to go the city today, as my master bade—though for myself I would rather have thee left here to keep the farmstead; but I reverence and fear him, lest hereafter he chide me, and hard are the rebukes of masters—<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />come now, let us go. The day is far spent, and soon thou wilt find it colder toward evening.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “I see, I give heed; this thou biddest one with understanding. Come, let us go, and be thou my guide all the way.<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />But give me a staff to lean upon, if thou hast one cut anywhere, for verily ye said that the way was treacherous.” 
He spoke, and flung about his shoulders his miserable wallet, full of holes, slung by a twisted cord, and Eumaeus gave him a staff to his liking.<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />So they two set forth, and the dogs and the herdsmen stayed behind to guard the farmstead; but the swineherd led his master to the city in the likeness of a woeful and aged beggar, leaning on a staff; and miserable was the raiment that he wore about his body.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="204" type="card">
                    <p>
But when, as they went along the rugged path,<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />they were near the city, and had come to a well-wrought, fair-flowing fountain, wherefrom the townsfolk drew water—this Ithacus had made, and Neritus, and Polyctor, and around was a grove of poplars, that grow by the waters, circling it on all sides, and down the cold water flowed<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />from the rock above, and on the top was built an altar to the nymphs where all passers-by made offerings—there Melantheus, son of Dolius, met them as he was driving his she-goats, the best that were in all the herds, to make a feast for the wooers; and two herdsmen followed with him.<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />As he saw them, he spoke and addressed them, and reviled them in terrible and unseemly words, and stirred the heart of Odysseus:
“Lo, now, in very truth the vile leads the vile. As ever, the god is bringing like and like together. Whither, pray, art thou leading this filthy wretch,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> thou miserable swineherd,<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />this nuisance of a beggar to mar our feasts? He is a man to stand and rub his shoulders on many doorposts, begging for scraps, not for swords or cauldrons.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> If thou wouldest give me this fellow to keep my farmstead, to sweep out the pens and to carry young shoots to the kids,<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />then by drinking whey he might get himself a sturdy thigh. But since he has learned only deeds of evil, he will not care to busy himself with work, but is minded rather to go skulking through the land, that by begging he may feed his insatiate belly. But I will speak out to thee, and this word shall verily be brought to pass.<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />If he comes to the palace of divine Odysseus, many a footstool, hurled about his head by the hands of those that are men, shall be broken on his ribs<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> as he is pelted through the house.”
So he spoke, and as he passed he kicked Odysseus on the hip in his folly, yet he did not drive him from the path,<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />but he stood steadfast. And Odysseus pondered whether he should leap upon him and take his life with his staff, or seize him round about,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> and lift him up, and dash his head upon the ground. Yet he endured, and stayed him from his purpose. And the swineherd looked the man in the face, and rebuked him, and lifted up his hands, and prayed aloud:
<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />“Nymphs of the fountain, daughters of Zeus, if ever Odysseus burned upon your altars pieces of the thighs of lambs or kids, wrapped in rich fat, fulfil for me this prayer; grant that he, my master, may come back, and that some god may guide him. Then would he scatter all the proud airs<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />which now thou puttest on in thy insolence,ever roaming about the city, while evil herdsmen destroy the flock.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="247" type="card">
                    <p>
Then Melanthius, the goatherd, answered him: “Lo now, how the cur talks, his mind full of mischief. Him will I some day<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />take on a black, benched ship far from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, that he may bring me in much wealth. Would that Apollo, of the silver bow, might smite Telemachus to-day in the halls, or that he might be slain by the wooers, as surely as for Odysseus in a far land the day of return has been lost.”
So saying, he left them there, as they walked slowly on,<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />but himself strode forward and right swiftly came to the palace of the king. Straightway he entered in and sat down among the wooers over against Eurymachus, for he loved him best of all. Then by him those that served set a portion of meat, and the grave housewife brought and set before him bread,<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />for him to eat. And Odysseus and the goodly swineherd halted as they drew nigh, and about them rang the sound of the hollow lyre, for Phemius was striking the chords to sing before the wooers. Then Odysseus clasped the swineherd by the hand, and said:
“Eumaeus, surely this is the beautiful house of Odysseus.<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />Easily might it be known, though seen among many. There is building upon building, and the court is built with wall and coping, and the double gates are well-fenced; no man may scorn it. And I mark that in the house itself many<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />men are feasting: for the savour of meat arises from it, and therewith resounds the voice of the lyre, which the gods have made the companion of the feast.”
To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Easily hast thou marked it, for in all things thou art ready of wit. But come, let us take thought how these things shall be.<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />Either do thou go first into the stately palace, and enter the company of the wooers, and I will remain behind here, or, if thou wilt, remain thou here and I will go before thee. But do not thou linger long, lest some man see thee without and pelt thee or smite thee. Of this I bid thee take thought.”
<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: “I see, I give heed: this thou biddest one with understanding. But go thou before, and I will remain behind here; for no whit unused am I to blows and peltings. Staunch is my heart, for much evil have I suffered<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />amid the waves and in war; let this too be added to what has gone before. But a ravening belly may no man hide, an accursed plague that brings many evils upon men. Because of it are the benched ships also made ready, that bear evil to foemen over the unresting sea.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="290" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />Thus they spoke to one another. And a hound that lay there raised his head and pricked up his ears, <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, the hound of Odysseus, of the steadfast heart, whom of old he had himself bred, but had no joy of him, for ere that he went to sacred <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>. In days past the young men were wont to take the hound to hunt<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />the wild goats, and deer, and hares; but now he lay neglected, his master gone, in the deep dung of mules and cattle, which lay in heaps before the doors, till the slaves of Odysseus should take it away to dung his wide lands.<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />There lay the hound <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, full of vermin; yet even now, when he marked Odysseus standing near, he wagged his tail and dropped both his ears, but nearer to his master he had no longer strength to move. Then Odysseus looked aside and wiped away a tear,<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />easily hiding from Eumaeus what he did; and straightway he questioned him, and said:
“Eumaeus, verily it is strange that this hound lies here in the dung. He is fine of form, but I do not clearly know whether he has speed of foot to match this beauty or whether he is merely as table-dogs<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />are, which their masters keep for show.”
To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer and say: “Aye, verily this is the hound of a man that has died in a far land. If he were but in form and in action such as he was when Odysseus left him and went to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />thou wouldest soon be amazed at seeing his speed and his strength. No creature that he started in the depths of the thick wood could escape him, and in tracking too he was keen of scent. But now he is in evil plight, and his master has perished far from his native land, and the heedless women give him no care.<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />Slaves, when their masters lose their power, are no longer minded thereafter to do honest service: for Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, takes away half his worth from a man, when the day of slavery comes upon him.”
So saying, he entered the stately house<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />and went straight to the hall to join the company of the lordly wooers. But as for <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, the fate of black death seized him straightway when he had seen Odysseus in the twentieth year.
Now as the swineherd came through the hall godlike Telemachus was far the first to see him, and quickly<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />with a nod he called him and to his side. And Eumaeus looked about him and took a stool that lay near, on which the carver was wont to sit when carving for the wooers the many joints of meat, as they feasted in the hall. This he took and placed at the table of Telemachus, over against him, and there sat down himself. And a herald<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />took a portion of meat and set it before him, and bread from out the basket.</p>

                <div2 n="336" type="card">
                    <p>
Night after him Odysseus entered the palace in the likeness of a woeful and aged beggar, leaning on a staff, and miserable was the raiment that he wore about his body. He sat down upon the ashen threshold within the doorway,<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />leaning against a post of cypress wood, which of old a carpenter had skilfully planed, and made straight to the line. Then Telemachus called the swineherd to him, and, taking a whole loaf from out the beautiful basket, and all the meat his hands could hold in their grasp, spoke to him saying:
<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />“Take, and give this mess to yon stranger, and bid him go about himself and beg of the wooers one and all. Shame is no good comrade for a man that is in need.”
So he spoke, and the swineherd went, when he had heard this saying, and coming up to Odysseus spoke to him winged words:
<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />“Stranger, Telemachus gives thee these, and bids thee go about and beg of the wooers one and all. Shame, he says, is no good thing in a beggar man.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said, “King Zeus, grant, I pray thee, that Telemachus may be blest among men,<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />and may have all that his heart desires.”
He spoke, and took the mess in both his hands and set it down there before his feet on his miserable wallet. Then he ate so long as the minstrel sang in the halls. But when he had dined and the divine minstrel was ceasing to sing,<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />the wooers broke into uproar throughout the halls; but Athena drew close to the side of Odysseus, son of Laertes, and roused him to go among the wooers and gather bits of bread, and learn which of them were righteous and which lawless. Yet even so she was not minded to save one of them from ruin.<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />So he set out to beg of every man, beginning on the right, stretching out his hand on every side, as though he had been long a beggar. And they pitied him and gave, and marvelled at him, asking one another who he was and whence he came.
Then among them spoke Melanthius, the goatherd:<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />“Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, regarding this stranger, for verily I have seen him before. Truly it was the swineherd that led him hither, but of the man himself I know not surely from whence he declares his birth to be.”
So he spoke, and Antinous rebuked the swineherd, saying:<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />“Notorious swineherd, why, pray, didst thou bring this man to the city? Have we not vagabonds enough without him, nuisances of beggars to mar our feast? Dost thou not think it enough that they gather here and devour the substance of thy master, that thou dost bid this fellow too?”</p>

                <div2 n="380" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Antinous, no fair words are these thou speakest, noble though thou art. Who pray, of himself ever seeks out and bids a stranger from abroad, unless it be one of those that are masters of some public craft, a prophet, or a healer of ills, or a builder,<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />aye, or a divine minstrel, who gives delight with his song? For these men are bidden all over the boundless earth. Yet a beggar would no man bid to be burden to himself. But thou art ever harsh above all the wooers to the slaves of Odysseus, and most of all to me; yet I<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />care not, so long as my lady, the constant Penelope, lives in the hall, and godlike Telemachus.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Be silent: do not, I bid thee, answer yonder man with many words, for Antinous is wont ever in evil wise to provoke to anger<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />with harsh words, aye, and urges on the others too.”
With this he spoke winged words to Antinous: “Antinous, truly thou carest well for me, as a father for his son, seeing that thou biddest me drive yonder stranger from the hall with a word of compulsion. May the god never bring such a thing to pass.<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />Nay, take and give him somewhat: I begrudge it not, but rather myself bid thee give. In this matter regard not my mother, no, nor any of the slaves that are in the house of divine Odysseus. But verily far other is the thought in thy breast; for thou art far more fain thyself to eat than to give to another.”
<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />Then Antinous answered him, and said: “Telemachus, thou braggart, unrestrained in daring, what a thing hast thou said! If all the wooers would but hand him as much as I, for full three months' space this house would keep him at a distance.”
So he spoke, and seized the footstool<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />on which he was wont to rest his shining feet as he feasted, and shewed it from beneath the table, where it lay. But all the rest gave gifts, and filled the wallet with bread and bits of meat. And now Odysseus was like to have gone back again to the threshold, and to have made trial of the Achaeans without cost,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> but he paused by Antinous, and spoke to him, saying: 
<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />“Friend, give me some gift; thou seemest not in my eyes to be the basest of the Achaeans, but rather the noblest, for thou art like a king. Therefore it is meet that thou shouldest give even a better portion of bread than the rest; so would I make thy fame known all over the boundless earth. For I too once dwelt in a house of my own among men,<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />a rich man in a wealthy house, and full often I gave gifts to a wanderer, whosoever he was and with whatsoever need he came. Slaves too I had past counting, and all other things in abundance whereby men live well and are reputed wealthy.</p>

                <div2 n="424" type="card">
                    <p>
But Zeus, son of Cronos, brought all to naught—so, I ween, was his good pleasure—<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />who sent me forth with roaming pirates to go to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, a far voyage, that I might meet my ruin; and in the river <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Aegyptus</placeName> I moored my curved ships. Then verily I bade my trusty comrades to remain there by the ships and to guard the ships,<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />and I sent out scouts to go to places of outlook. But my comrades, yielding to wantonness and led on by their own might, straightway set about wasting the fair fields of the men of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; and they carried off the women and little children, and slew the men; and the cry came quickly to the city.<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />Then, hearing the shouting, the people came forth at break of day, and the whole plain was filled with footmen and chariots and the flashing of bronze. And Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt, cast an evil panic upon my comrades, and none had courage to take his stand and face the foe; for evil surrounded us on every side.<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />So then they slew many of us with the sharp bronze, and others they led up to their city alive, to work for them perforce. But they gave me to a friend who met them to take to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, even to Dmetor, son of Iasus, who ruled mightily over <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>; and from thence am I now come hither, sore distressed.”
<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line" />Then Antinous answered him, and said: “What god has brought this bane hither to trouble our feast? Stand off yonder in the midst, away from my table, lest thou come presently to a bitter <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and a bitter <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, seeing that thou art a bold and shameless beggar.<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line" />Thou comest up to every man in turn, and they give recklessly; for there is no restraint or scruple in giving freely of another's goods, since each man has plenty beside him.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles drew back, and said to him: “Lo, now, it seems that thou at least hast not wits to match thy beauty.<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line" />Thou wouldest not out of thine own substance give even a grain of salt to thy suppliant, thou who now, when sitting at another's table, hadst not the heart to take of the bread and give me aught. Yet here lies plenty at thy hand.”
So he spoke, and Antinous waxed the more wroth at heart, and with an angry glance from beneath his brows spoke to him winged words:
<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line" />“Now verily, methinks, thou shalt no more go forth from the hall in seemly fashion, since thou dost even utter words of reviling.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="462" type="card">
                    <p>
So saying, he seized the footstool and flung it, and struck Odysseus on the base of the right shoulder, where it joins the back. But he stood firm as a rock, nor did the missile of Antinous make him reel;<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line" />but he shook his head in silence, pondering evil in the deep of his heart. Then back to the threshold he went and sat down, and down he laid his well-filled wallet; and he spoke among the wooers: 
“Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me.<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line" />Verily there is no pain of heart nor any grief when a man is smitten while fighting for his own possessions, whether for his cattle or for his white sheep; but Antinous has smitten me for my wretched belly's sake, an accursed plague that brings many evils upon men.<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line" />Ah, if for beggars there are gods and avengers, may the doom of death come upon Antinous before his marriage.”
Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: “Sit still, and eat, stranger, or go elsewhere; lest the young men drag thee<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line" />by hand or foot through the house for words like these, and strip off all thy skin.”
So he spoke, but they all were filled with exceeding indignation, and thus would one of the proud youths speak:
“Antinous, thou didst not well to strike the wretched wanderer. Doomed man that thou art, what if haply he be some god come down from heaven!<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line" />Aye, and the gods in the guise of strangers from afar put on all manner of shapes, and visit the cities, beholding the violence and the righteousness of men.”
So spoke the wooers, but Antinous paid no heed to their words. And Telemachus nursed in his heart great grief<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line" />for the smiting, though he let no tear fall from his eyelids to the ground; but he shook his head in silence, pondering evil in the deep of his heart.
Howbeit when wise Penelope heard of the man's being smitten in the hall, she spoke among her handmaids, and said: “Even so may thine own self be smitten by the famed archer Apollo.” 
<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line" />And again the housewife Eurynome said to her: “Would that fulfillment might be granted to our prayers. So should not one of these men come to the fair-throned Dawn.”
And wise Penelope answered her: “Nurse, enemies are they all, for they devise evil.<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line" />But Antinous more than all is like black fate. Some wretched stranger roams through the house, begging alms of the men, for want compels him, and all the others filled his wallet and gave him gifts, but Antinous flung a footstool and smote him at the base of the right shoulder.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="505" type="card">

                        <milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line" />So she spoke among her handmaids, sitting in her chamber, while goodly Odysseus was at meat. Then she called to her the goodly swineherd, and said:
“Go, goodly Eumaeus, and bid the stranger come hither, that I may give him greeting, and ask him<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line" />if haply he has heard of Odysseus of the steadfast heart, or has seen him with his eyes. He seems like one that has wandered far.”
To her, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “I would, O queen, that the Achaeans would keep silence, for he speaks such words as would charm thy very soul.<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line" />Three nights I had him by me, and three days I kept him in my hut, for to me first he came when he fled by stealth from a ship, but he had not yet ended the tale of his sufferings. Even as when a man gazes upon a minstrel who sings to mortals songs of longing that the gods have taught him,<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line" />and their desire to hear him has no end, whensoever he sings, even so he charmed me as he sat in my hall. He says that he is an ancestral friend of Odysseus, and that he dwells in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, where is the race of Minos. From thence has he now come on this journey hither, ever suffering woes<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line" />as he wanders on and on. And he insists that he has heard tidings of Odysseus, near at hand in the rich land of the Thesprotians and yet alive; and he is bringing many treasures to his home.”
Then wise Penelope answered him: “Go, call him hither, that he may himself tell me to my face.<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line" />But as for these men, let them make sport as they sit in the doorway or here in the house, since their hearts are merry. For their own possessions lie untouched in their homes, bread and sweet wine, and on these do their servants feed. But themselves throng our house day after day,<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line" />slaying our oxen, and sheep, and fat goats, and keep revel and drink the flaming wine recklessly, and havoc is made of all this wealth, for there is no man here such as Odysseus was to keep ruin from the house. But if Odysseus should come and return to his native land,<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line" />straightway would he with his son take vengeance on these men for their violent deeds.”
So she spoke, and Telemachus sneezed loudly, and all the room round about echoed wondrously. And Penelope laughed, and straightway spoke to Eumaeus winged words:
“Go, pray, call the stranger here before me.<milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line" />Dost thou not note that my son has sneezed at all my words. Therefore shall utter death fall upon the wooers one and all, nor shall one of them escape death and the fates. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. If I find that he speaks all things truly,<milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line" />I will clothe him in a cloak and tunic, fair raiment.”
So she spoke, and the swineherd went when he had heard this saying; and coming up to Odysseus he spoke to him winged words: 
“Sir stranger, wise Penelope calls for thee, the mother of Telemachus, and her heart<milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line" />bids her make enquiry about her husband, though she has suffered many woes. And if she finds that thou speakest all things truly, she will clothe thee in a cloak and tunic, which thou needest most of all. As for thy food, thou shalt beg it through the land, and feed thy belly, and whoso will shall give it thee.”</p>

                <div2 n="560" type="card">

                        <milestone ed="p" n="560" unit="line" />Then the much-enduring goodly Odysseus answered him: “Eumaeus, soon will I tell all the truth to the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope. For well do I know of Odysseus, and in common have we borne affliction. But I have fear of this throng of harsh wooers,<milestone ed="p" n="565" unit="line" />whose wantonness and violence reach the iron heaven. For even now, when, as I was going through the hall doing no evil, this man struck me and hurt me, neither Telemachus nor any other did aught to ward off the blow. Wherefore now bid Penelope<milestone ed="p" n="570" unit="line" />to wait in the halls, eager though she be, till set of sun; and then let her ask me of her husband regarding the day of his return, giving me a seat nearer the fire, for lo, the raiment that I wear is mean, and this thou knowest of thyself, for to thee first did I make my prayer.”
So he spoke, and the swineherd went when he had heard this saying.<milestone ed="p" n="575" unit="line" />And as he passed over the threshold Penelope said to him:
“Thou dost not bring him, Eumaeus. What does the wanderer mean by this? Does he fear some one beyond measure, or does he idly feel ashamed in the house? 'Tis ill for a beggar to feel shame.”
To her, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer and say:<milestone ed="p" n="580" unit="line" />“He speaks rightly, even as any other man would deem, in seeking to shun the insolence of overweening men. But he bids thee to wait till set of sun. And for thyself, too, it is far more seemly, O queen, to speak to the stranger alone, and to hear his words.”
<milestone ed="p" n="585" unit="line" />Then wise Penelope answered him: “Not without wisdom is the stranger; he divines how it may be. There are no mortal men, methinks, who in wantonness devise such wicked folly as these.”
So she spoke, and the goodly swineherd departed<milestone ed="p" n="590" unit="line" />into the throng of the wooers when he had told her all. And straightway he spoke winged words to Telemachus, holding his head close to him that the others might not hear:
“Friend, I am going forth to guard the swine and all things there, thy livelihood and mine; but have thou charge of all things here.<milestone ed="p" n="595" unit="line" />Thine own self do thou keep safe first of all, and let thy mind beware lest some ill befall thee, for many of the Achaeans are devising evil, whom may Zeus utterly destroy before harm fall on us.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “So shall it be, father; go thy way when thou hast supped.<milestone ed="p" n="600" unit="line" />And in the morning do thou come and bring goodly victims. But all matters here shall be a care to me and to the immortals.”
So he spoke, and the swineherd sat down again on the polished chair. But when he had satisfied his heart with meat and drink, he went his way to the swine, and left the courts and the hall<milestone ed="p" n="605" unit="line" />full of banqueters. And they were making merry with dance and song, for evening had now come on.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />Now there came up a public beggar who was wont to beg through the town of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and was known for his greedy belly, eating and drinking without end. No strength had he nor might, but in bulk was big indeed to look upon.<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />Arnaeus was his name, for this name his honored mother had given him at his birth; but Irus all the young men called him, because he used to run on errands<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> when anyone bade him. He came now, and was for driving Odysseus from his own house; and he began to revile him, and spoke winged words:
<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />“Give way, old man, from the doorway, lest soon thou be even dragged out by the foot. Dost thou not see that all men are winking at me, and bidding me drag thee? Yet for myself, I am ashamed to do it. Nay, up with thee, lest our quarrel even come to blows.”
Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />“Good fellow, I harm thee not in deed or word, nor do I begrudge that any man should give thee, though the portion he took up were a large one. This threshold will hold us both, and thou hast no need to be jealous for the goods of other folk. Thou seemest to me to be a vagrant, even as I am; and as for happy fortune, it is the gods that are like to give us that.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />But with thy fists do not provoke me overmuch, lest thou anger me, and, old man though I am, I befoul thy breast and lips with blood. So should I have the greater peace tomorrow, for I deem not that thou shalt return a second time to the hall of Odysseus, son of Laertes.”
<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />Then, waxing wroth, the vagrant Irus said to him: “Now see how glibly the filthy wretch talks, like an old kitchen-wife. But I will devise evil for him, smiting him left and right, and will scatter on the ground all the teeth from his jaws, as though he were a swine wasting the corn.<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />Gird thyself now, that these men, too, may all know our fighting. But how couldst thou fight with a younger man?”
Thus on the polished threshold before the lofty doors they stirred one another's rage right heartily. And the strong and mighty Antinous heard the two,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />and, breaking into a merry laugh, he spoke among the wooers:
“Friends, never before has such a thing come to pass, that a god has brought sport like this to this house. Yon stranger and Irus are provoking one another to blows. Come, let us quickly set them on.”
<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />So he spoke, and they all sprang up laughing and gathered about the tattered beggars. And Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke among them, and said:
“Hear me, ye proud wooers, that I may say somewhat. Here at the fire are goats' paunches lying, which<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />we set there for supper, when we had filled them with fat and blood. Now whichever of the two wins and proves himself the better man, let him rise and choose for himself which one of these he will. And furthermore he shall always feast with us, nor will we suffer any other beggar to join our company and beg of us.”</p>

                <div2 n="50" type="card">

                        <milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />So spoke Antinous, and his word was pleasing to them. Then with crafty mind Odysseus of many wiles spoke among them:
“Friends, in no wise may an old man that is overcome with woe fight with a younger. Howbeit my belly, that worker of evil, urges me on, that I may be overcome by his blows.<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />But come now, do you all swear to me a mighty oath, to the end that no man, doing a favour to Irus, may deal me a foul blow with heavy hand, and so by violence subdue me to this fellow.”
So he spoke, and they all gave the oath not to smite him, even as he bade. But when they had sworn and made an end of the oath,<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />among them spoke again the strong and mighty Telemachus:
“Stranger, if thy heart and thy proud spirit bid thee beat off this fellow, then fear not thou any man of all the Achaeans, for whoso strikes thee shall have to fight with more than thou. Thy host am I, and the princes assent hereto,<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />Antinous and Eurymachus, men of prudence both.”
So he spoke, and they all praised his words. But Odysseus girded his rags about his loins and showed his thighs, comely and great, and his broad shoulders came to view, and his chest and mighty arms. And Athena<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />drew nigh and made greater the limbs of the shepherd of the people. Then all the wooers marvelled exceedingly, and thus would one speak with a glance at his neighbor: 
“Right soon shall Irus, un-Irused, have a bane of his own bringing, such a thigh does yon old man show from beneath his rags.”
<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />So they spoke, and the mind of Irus was miserably shaken; yet even so the serving men girded him, and led him out perforce all filled with dread, and his flesh trembled on his limbs. Then Antinous rated him and spoke, and addressed him:
“Better were it now, thou braggart, that thou wert not living, nor hadst ever been born,<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />if thou quailest and art so terribly afraid of this fellow—a man that is old and overcome by the woe that has come upon him. But I will speak out to thee, and this word shall verily be brought to pass. If this fellow conquers thee and proves the better man, I will fling thee into a black ship and send thee to the mainland<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />to King Echetus, the maimer of all men, who will cut off thy nose and ears with the pitiless bronze, and will draw forth thy vitals and give them raw to dogs to rend.”</p>

                <div2 n="88" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and thereat yet greater trembling seized the other's limbs, and they led him into the ring and both men put up their hands.<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was divided in mind whether he should strike him so that life should leave him even there as he fell, or whether he should deal him a light blow and stretch him on the earth. And, as he pondered, this seemed to him the better course, to deal him a light blow, that the Achaeans might not take note of him.<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />Then verily, when they had put up their hands, Irus let drive at the right shoulder, but Odysseus smote him on the neck beneath the ear and crushed in the bones, and straightway the red blood ran forth from his mouth, and down he fell in the dust with a moan, and he gnashed his teeth, kicking the ground with his feet. But the lordly wooers<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />raised their hands, and were like to die with laughter. Then Odysseus seized him by the foot, and dragged him forth through the doorway until he came to the court and the gates of the portico. And he set him down and leaned him against the wall of the court, and thrust his staff into his hand and spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />“Sit there now, and scare off swine and dogs, and do not thou be lord of strangers and beggars, miserable that thou art, lest haply thou meet with some worse thing to profit withal.”
He spoke, and flung about his shoulders his miserable wallet, full of holes, and slung by a twisted cord.<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />Then back to the threshold he went and sat down; and the wooers went within, laughing merrily, and they greeted him, saying:
“May Zeus grant thee, stranger, and the other immortal gods what thou desirest most, and the dearest wish of thy heart, seeing that thou hast made this insatiate fellow to cease from begging<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />in the land. For soon shall we take him to the mainland to King Echetus, the maimer of all men.”
So they spoke, and goodly Odysseus was glad at the word of omen. And Antinous set before him the great paunch, filled with fat and blood, and Amphinomus<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />took up two loaves from the basket and set them before him, and pledged him in a cup of gold, and said:
“Hail, Sir stranger; may happy fortune be thine in time to come, though now thou art the thrall of many sorrows.”</p>

                <div2 n="124" type="card">
                    <p>
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said:<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />“Amphinomus, verily thou seemest to me to be a man of prudence; and such a man, too, was thy father, for I have heard of his fair fame, that Nisus of Dulichium was a brave man and a wealthy. From him, they say, thou art sprung, and thou seemest a man soft of speech. Wherefore I will tell thee, and do thou give heed and hearken.<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />Nothing feebler does earth nurture than man, of all things that on earth are breathing and moving. For he thinks that he will never suffer evil in time to come, so long as the gods give him prosperity and his knees are quick; but when again the blessed gods decree him sorrow,<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />this too he bears in sore despite with steadfast heart; for the spirit of men upon the earth is even such as the day which the father of gods and men brings upon them. For I, too, was once like to be prosperous among men, but many deeds of wantonness I wrought, yielding to my might and my strength,<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />and trusting in my father and my brethren. Wherefore let no man soever be lawless at any time, but let him keep in silence whatever gifts the gods give. Aye, for I see the wooers devising wantonness, wasting the wealth and dishonoring the wife<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />of a man who, I tell thee, will not long be away from his friends and his native land; nay, he is very near. But may some god lead thee forth hence to thy home, and mayest thou not meet him when he comes home to his dear native land. For not without bloodshed, methinks,<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />will the wooers and he part one from the other when once he comes beneath his roof.”
So he spoke, and pouring a libation, drank of the honey-sweet wine, and then gave back the cup into the hands of the marshaller of the people. But Amphinomus went through the hall with a heavy heart, bowing his head; for his spirit boded bane.<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />Yet even so he did not escape his fate, but him, too, did Athena set in bonds so that he might be slain outright at the hands of Telemachus and by his spear. So he sat down again on the chair from which he had risen.
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, put it in the heart of the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope,<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />to show herself to the wooers, that she might set their hearts a-flutter and win greater honor from her husband and her son than heretofore. Then she laughed a meaningless laugh and spoke, and addressed the nurse:
“Eurynome, my heart longs, though it has never longed before,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />to show myself to the wooers, hateful though they are. Also I would say a word to my son that will be for his profit, namely, that he should not consort ever with the overweening wooers, who speak him fair but have evil plans thereafter.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="169" type="card">
                    <p>
Then the housewife, Eurynome, spoke to her and said:<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />“Aye, verily, child, all this hast thou spoken aright. Go, then, reveal thy word to thy son and hide it not; but first wash thy body and anoint thy face, and go not as thou art with both cheeks stained with tears. Go, for it is ill to grieve ever without ceasing.<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />For now, behold, thy son is of such an age, and it has been thy dearest prayer to the immortals to see him a bearded man.”
Then wise Penelope answered her again: “Eurynome, beguile me not thus in thy love to wash my body and anoint me with oil.<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />All beauty of mine have the gods, that hold <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, destroyed since the day when my lord departed in the hollow ships. But bid Autonoe and Hippodameia come to me, that they may stand by my side in the hall. Alone I will not go among men, for I am ashamed.”
<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />So she spoke, and the old woman went forth through the chamber to bear tidings to the women, and bid them come.
Then again the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. On the daughter of Icarius she shed sweet sleep, and she leaned back and slept<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />there on her couch, and all her joints were relaxed. And meanwhile the fair goddess was giving her immortal gifts, that the Achaeans might marvel at her. With balm<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> she first made fair her beautiful face, with balm ambrosial, such as that wherewith Cytherea, of the fair crown, anoints herself when she goes into the lovely dance of the Graces;<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />and she made her taller, too, and statelier to behold, and made her whiter than new-sawn ivory. Now when she had done this the fair goddess departed, and the white-armed handmaids came forth from the chamber and drew near with sound of talking. Then sweet sleep released Penelope,<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />and she rubbed her cheeks with her hands, and said:
“Ah, in my utter wretchedness soft slumber enfolded me. Would that pure Artemis would even now give so soft a death, that I might no more waste my life away with sorrow at heart, longing for<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />the manifold excellence of my dear husband, for that he was pre-eminent among the Achaeans.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="206" type="card">
                    <p>
So saying, she went down from the bright upper chamber, not alone, for two handmaids attended her. Now when the fair lady reached the wooers she stood by the doorpost of the well-built hall,<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />holding before her face her shining veil; and a faithful handmaid stood on either side of her. Straightway then the knees of the wooers were loosened and their hearts enchanted with love, and they all prayed, each that he might lie by her side. But she spoke to Telemachus, her dear son:
<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />“Telemachus, thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer steadfast as heretofore. When thou wast but a child thou wast wont to revolve in thy mind thoughts more cunning; but now that thou art grown and hast reached the bounds of manhood, and wouldest be called a rich man's son by one who looked only to thy stature and thy comeliness, being himself a stranger from afar,<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />thy mind and thy thoughts are no longer right as before. What a thing is this that has been done in these halls, that thou hast suffered yon stranger to be so maltreated! How now, if the stranger, while sitting thus in our house, should come to some harm through grievous mishandling?<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />On thee, then, would fall shame and disgrace among men.”
Then wise Telemachus answered her: “My mother, in this matter I take it not ill that thou art filled with anger. Yet of myself I know in my heart and understand each thing, the good and the evil, whereas heretofore I was but a child.<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />But I am not able to plan all things wisely, for these men here thwart my will, keeping by me, one on this side and one on that, with evil purpose, and I have none to help me. Howbeit, I can tell thee, this battle between the stranger and Irus fell not out according to the mind of the wooers, but the stranger proved the better man.<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />I would, O father Zeus, and Athena, and Apollo, that even now the wooers were thus subdued in our halls, and were hanging their heads, some in the court and some within the hall, and that each man's limbs were loosened, even as Irus now sits yonder by the gate of the court,<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />hanging his head like a drunken man, and cannot stand erect upon his feet, or go home to whatsoever place he is wont to go, because his limbs are loosened.”
Thus they spoke to one another. But Eurymachus addressed Penelope, and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />“Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, if all the Achaeans throughout Iasian Argos could see thee, even more wooers would be feasting in your halls from to-morrow on, for thou excellest all women in comeliness and stature, and in the wise heart within thee.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="250" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />Then wise Penelope answered him: “Eurymachus, all excellence of mine, both of beauty and of form, the immortals destroyed on the day when the Argives embarked for <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>, and with them went my husband Odysseus. If he might but come and watch over this life of mine,<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />greater would be my fame and fairer. But now I am in sorrow, so many woes has some god brought upon me. Verily, when he went forth and left his native land, he clasped my right hand by the wrist, and said:
“‘Wife, I deem not that the well-greaved Achaeans<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />will all return from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> safe and unscathed, for the Trojans, men say, are men of war, hurlers of the spear, and drawers of the bow, and drivers of swift horses, such as most quickly decide the great strife of equal war.<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />Therefore I know not whether the god will bring me back, or whether I shall be cut off there in the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>: so have thou charge of all things here. Be mindful of my father and my mother in the halls even as thou art now, or yet more, while I am far away. But when thou shalt see my son a bearded man,<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />wed whom thou wilt, and leave thy house.’
“So he spoke, and now all this is being brought to pass. The night shall come when a hateful marriage shall fall to the lot of me accursed, whose happiness Zeus has taken away. But herein has bitter grief come upon my heart and soul,<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />for such as yours was never the way of wooers heretofore. They who are fain to woo a lady of worth and the daughter of a rich man and vie with one another, these bring of themselves cattle and goodly flocks, a banquet for the friends of the bride, and give to her glorious gifts;<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />but they do not devour the livelihood of another without atonement.”
So she spoke, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was glad, because she drew from them gifts, and beguiled their souls with gentle words, but her mind was set on other things.
Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke to her again, and said:<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />“Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, as for gifts, if any man of the Achaeans is minded to bring them hither, do thou take them; for it is not well to refuse a gift. But for us, we will go neither to our lands nor elsewhither, until thou weddest him whosoever is best of the Achaeans.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="290" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />So spoke Antinous, and his word was pleasing to them, and each man sent forth a herald to bring his gifts. For Antinous he brought a large and beautiful robe, richly broidered, and in it were golden brooches, twelve in all, fitted with curved clasps.<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />And a chain did another straightway bring to Eurymachus, one cunningly wrought of gold, strung with amber beads, bright as the sun. A pair of earrings his squires brought to Eurydamas, with three clustering<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> drops, and great grace shone therefrom. And out of the house of lord Peisander, son of Polyctor,<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />his squire brought a necklace, a jewel exceeding fair. So of the Achaeans one brought one fair gift and one another. But she thereafter, the fair lady, went up to her upper chamber, and her handmaids bare for her the beautiful gifts.
But the wooers<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />turned to dance and gladsome song, and made them merry, and waited for evening to come on. And as they made merry dark evening came upon them. Presently they set up three braziers in the hall to give them light, and round about them placed dry faggots, long since seasoned and hard, and newly split with the axe;<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />and in the spaces between they set torches;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> and in turn the handmaids of Odysseus, of the steadfast heart, kindled the flame. Then Zeus-born Odysseus, of many wiles, himself spoke among the maids, and said:
“Maidens of Odysseus, that has long been gone, go to the chambers where your honored queen abides,<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />and twist the yarn by her side, and make glad her heart, as you sit in the chamber, or card the wool with your hands; but I will give light to all these men. For if they wish to wait for fair-throned Dawn, they shall in no wise outdo me. I am one that can endure much.”
<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />So he spoke, and the maids broke into a laugh, and glanced at one another. And fair-cheeked Melantho rated him shamefully, Melantho, whom Dolius begot, but whom Penelope had reared and cherished as her own child, and gave her playthings to her heart's desire. Yet even so she had at heart no sorrow for Penelope,<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />but she loved Eurymachus and was wont to lie with him. She then rated Odysseus with reviling words:
“Wretched stranger, thou art but a crack-brained fellow, unwilling to go to a smithy to sleep, or to a common lodge, but pratest here continually,<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />unabashed in the company of many lords, and hast no fear at heart. Surely wine has mastered thy wits, or else thy mind is ever thus, that thou dost babble idly. Art thou beside thyself because thou hast beaten that vagrant Irus? Beware, lest presently another better than Irus shall rise up against thee<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />to beat thee about the head with heavy hands, and befoul thee with streams of blood, and send thee forth from the house.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="337" type="card">
                    <p>
Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered her: “Presently shall I go yonder, thou shameless thing, and tell Telemachus, since thou speakest thus, that on the spot he may cut thee limb from limb.”
<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />So he spoke, and with his words scattered the women, who fled through the hall, and the limbs of each were loosened beneath her in terror, for they thought that he spoke truth. But Odysseus took his stand by the burning braziers to give light, and looked upon all the men.<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />Yet other things was the heart within him pondering—things that were not to be unfulfilled.
But Athena would in no wise suffer the proud wooers to abstain from bitter outrage, that pain might sink yet deeper into the heart of Odysseus, son of Laertes. So among them Eurymachus, son of Polybus, began to speak,<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />jeering at Odysseus, and making mirth for his companions:
“Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me. Not without the will of the gods has this man come to the palace of Odysseus; in any case there is a glare of torches from him—<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />from his head, for there is no hair on it, no, not a trace.”<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
Therewith he called to Odysseus, sacker of cities: “Stranger, wouldest thou have a mind to serve for hire, if I should take thee into service on an outlying farm—thy pay shall be assured thee—gathering stones for walls, and planting tall trees?<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />There would I provide thee with food the year through, and clothe thee with raiment and give thee sandals for thy feet. But since thou hast learned only deeds of evil, thou wilt not care to busy thyself with work, but art minded rather to go skulking through the land, that thou mayest have wherewith to feed thy insatiate belly.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="365" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Eurymachus, I would that we two might have a match in working in the season of spring, when the long days come, at mowing the grass, I with a curved scythe in my hands and thou with another like it,<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />and that the grass might be in plenty that so we might test our work, fasting till late evening. Or I would again that there were oxen to drive—the best there are, tawny and large, both well fed with grass, of like age and like power to bear the yoke, tireless in strength—and that there were a field of four acres, and the soil should yield before the plough:<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />then shouldest thou see me, whether or no I could cut a straight furrow to the end. Or I would again that this day the son of Cronos might bring war upon us from whence he would, and I had a shield and two spears and a helmet all of bronze, that fitted well my temples: then shouldest thou see me mingling amid the foremost fighters,<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />and wouldest not prate, taunting me with this belly of mine. But right insolent art thou, and thy heart is cruel, and forsooth thou thinkest thyself to be some great man and mighty, because thou consortest with few men and weak. If but Odysseus might return, and come to his native land,<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />soon would yonder doors, right wide though they are, prove all too narrow for thee in thy flight out through the doorway.”
So he spoke, and Eurymachus waxed the more wroth at heart, and with an angry glance from beneath his brows spoke to him winged words:
“Wretch, presently will I work thee evil, that thou pratest thus,<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />unabashed in the presence of many lords, and hast no fear at heart. Surely wine has mastered thy wits, or else thy mind is ever thus, that thou dost babble idly. Art thou beside thyself because thou hast beaten that vagrant Irus?”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="394" type="card">
                    <p>
So saying, he seized a footstool, but Odysseus<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />sat down at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, in fear of Eurymachus. And so Eurymachus struck a cup-bearer on the right hand, and the wine-jug fell to the ground with a clang, and the bearer groaned, and fell backwards in the dust. Then the wooers broke into uproar throughout the shadowy halls,<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />and thus would one man speak with a glance at his neighbor: 
“Would that yon stranger had perished elsewhere on his wanderings or ever he came hither; then should he never have brought among us all this tumult. But now we are brawling about beggars, nor shall there be any joy in our rich feast, since worse things prevail.”
<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />Then among them spoke the strong and mighty Telemachus: “Strange sirs, ye are mad, and no longer hide that ye have eaten and drunk; some god surely is moving you. Nay, now that you have well feasted, go to your homes and take your rest, when your spirits bid you. Yet do I drive no man forth.”
<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />So he spoke, and they all bit their lips, and marvelled at Telemachus, that he spoke boldly. But Amphinomus spoke, and addressed them—he was son of the noble prince Nisus, son of Aretias:
“Friends, no man in answer to what has been fairly spoken<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />would wax wroth and make reply with wrangling words. Abuse not any more this stranger nor any one of the slaves that are in the house of divine Odysseus. Nay, come, let the bearer pour drops for libation in the cups, that we may pour libations, and go home to take our rest. As for this stranger,<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />let us leave him in the halls of Odysseus to be cared for by Telemachus; for to his house has he come.”
So said he, and the words that he spoke were pleasing to all. Then a bowl was mixed for them by the lord Mulius, a herald from Dulichium, who was squire to Amphinomus.<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />And he served out to all, coming up to each in turn; and they made libations to the blessed gods, and drank the honey-sweet wine. Then when they had made libations and had drunk to their heart's content, they went their way, each man to his own house, to take their rest.</p>
                </div2>
            </div1>
            <div1 n="19" type="Book">

                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />So goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall, planning with Athena's aid the slaying of the wooers, and he straightway spoke winged words to Telemachus:
“Telemachus, the weapons of war thou must needs lay away within<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />one and all, and when the wooers miss them and question thee, thou must beguile them with gentle words, saying: ‘Out of the smoke have I laid them, since they are no longer like those which of old Odysseus left behind him, when he went forth to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, but are all befouled, so far as the breath of fire has reached them.<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />And furthermore this greater fear has a god put in my heart, lest haply, when heated with wine, you may set a quarrel afoot among you, and wound one another, and so bring shame on your feast and on your wooing. For of itself does the iron draw a man to it.’” So he spoke, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father,<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />and calling forth the nurse Eurycleia, said to her:
“Nurse, come now, I bid thee, shut up the women in their rooms, while I lay away in the store-room the weapons of my father, the goodly weapons which all uncared-for the smoke bedims in the hall since my father went forth, and I was still a child.<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />But now I am minded to lay them away, where the breath of the fire will not come upon them.” 
Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered him: “Aye, child, I would thou mightest ever take thought to care for the house and guard all its wealth. But come, who then shall fetch a light and bear it for thee,<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />since thou wouldest not suffer the maids, who might have given light, to go before thee?”
Then wise Telemachus answered her; “This stranger here; for I will suffer no man to be idle who touches my portion of meal,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> even though he has come from afar.”
So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged, and she locked the doors of the stately hall.<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />Then the two sprang up, Odysseus and his glorious son, and set about bearing within the helmets and the bossy shields and the sharp-pointed spears; and before them Pallas Athena, bearing a golden lamp, made a most beauteous light.<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />Then Telemachus suddenly spoke to his father, and said:
“Father, verily this is a great marvel that my eyes behold; certainly the walls of the house and the fair beams<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> and cross-beams of fir and the pillars that reach on high, glow in my eyes as with the light of blazing fire.<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />Surely some god is within, one of those who hold broad heaven.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Hush, check thy thought, and ask no question; this, I tell thee, is the way of the gods that hold <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>. But do thou go and take thy rest and I will remain behind here,<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />that I may stir yet more the minds of the maids and of thy mother; and she with weeping shall ask me of each thing separately.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="47" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and Telemachus went forth through the hall by the light of blazing torches to go to his chamber to lie down, where he had heretofore been wont to rest, when sweet sleep came upon him.<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />There now too he lay down and waited for the bright Dawn. But goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall, planning with Athena's aid the slaying of the wooers.
Then wise Penelope came forth from her chamber like unto Artemis or golden Aphrodite,<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />and for her they set by the fire, where she was wont to sit, a chair inlaid with spirals of ivory and silver, which of old the craftsman Icmalius had made, and had set beneath it a foot-stool for the feet, that was part of the chair, and upon it a great fleece was wont to be laid. On this then wise Penelope sat down,<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />and the white-armed maids came forth from the women's hall. These began to take away the abundant food, the tables, and the cups from which the lordly men had been drinking, and they cast the embers from the braziers on to the floor, and piled upon the braziers fresh logs in abundance, to give light and warmth.
<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />But Melantho began again a second time to rate Odysseus, saying: “Stranger, wilt thou even now still be a plague to us through the night, roaming through the house, and wilt thou spy upon the women? Nay, get thee forth, thou wretch, and be content with thy supper, or straightway shalt thou even be smitten with a torch, and so go forth.”
<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered her: “Good woman, why, pray, dost thou thus assail me with angry heart? Is it because I am foul and wear mean raiment on my body, and beg through the land? Aye, for necessity compels me. Of such sort are beggars and vagabond folk.<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />For I too once dwelt in a house of my own among men, a rich man in a wealthy house, and full often I gave gifts to a wanderer, whosoever he was and with whatsoever need he came. Slaves too I had past counting and all other things in abundance whereby men live well and are reputed wealthy.<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />But Zeus, son of Cronos, brought all to naught; so, I ween, was his good pleasure. Wherefore, woman, beware lest thou too some day lose all the glory whereby thou now hast excellence among the handmaids; lest perchance thy mistress wax wroth and be angry with thee, or Odysseus come home; for there is yet room for hope.<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />But if, even as it seems, he is dead, and is no more to return, yet now is his son by the favour of Apollo such as he was—even Telemachus. Him it escapes not if any of the women in the halls work wantonness; for he is no longer the child he was.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="89" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and wise Penelope heard him;<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />and she rebuked the handmaid and spoke, and addressed her:
“Be sure, thou bold and shameless thing, that thy outrageous deed is in no wise hid from me, and with thine own head shalt thou wipe out its stain. Full well didst thou know, for thou hast heard it from my own lips, that I was minded<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />to question the stranger in my halls concerning my husband; for I am sore distressed.”
With this she spoke also to the housewife Eurynome, and said: “Eurynome, bring hither a chair and a fleece upon it, that the stranger may sit down and tell his tale, and listen to me; for I am fain to ask him of all things.” 
<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />So she spoke, and Eurynome speedily brought a polished chair and set it in place, and on it cast a fleece. Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus sat down upon it, and the wise Penelope spoke first, and said:
“Stranger, this question will I myself ask thee first.<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />Who art thou among men, and from whence? Where is thy city, and where thy parents?”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Lady, no one of mortals upon the boundless earth could find fault with thee, for thy fame goes up to the broad heaven, as does the fame of some blameless king, who with the fear of the gods in his heart,<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />is lord over many mighty men, upholding justice; and the black earth bears wheat and barley, and the trees are laden with fruit, the flocks bring forth young unceasingly, and the sea yields fish, all from his good leading; and the people prosper under him.<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />Wherefore question me now in thy house of all things else, but ask not concerning my race and my native land, lest thou fill my heart the more with pains, as I think thereon; for I am a man of many sorrows. Moreover it is not fitting<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />that I should sit weeping and wailing in another's house, for it is ill to grieve ever without ceasing. I would not that one of thy maidens or thine own self be vexed with me, and say that I swim in tears because my mind is heavy with wine.”
Then wise Penelope answered him: “Stranger, all excellence of mine, both of beauty and of form,<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />the immortals destroyed on the day when the Argives embarked for <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>, and with them went my husband, Odysseus. If he might but come, and watch over this life of mine, greater would be my fame and fairer. But now I am in sorrow, so many woes has some god brought upon me.<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />For all the princes who hold sway over the islands—Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus—and those who dwell around in clear-seen <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself, all these woo me against my will, and lay waste my house. Wherefore I pay no heed to strangers or to suppliants<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />or in any wise to heralds, whose trade is a public one; but in longing for Odysseus I waste my heart away. So these men urge on my marriage, and I wind a skein of wiles. First some god breathed the thought in my heart to set up a great web in my halls and fall to weaving a robe—<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />fine of thread was the web and very wide; and I straightway spoke among them:
“‘Young men, my wooers, since goodly Odysseus is dead, be patient, though eager for my marriage, until I finish this robe—I would not that my spinning should come to naught—a shroud for the lord Laertes against the time when<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />the fell fate of grievous death shall strike him down; lest any one of the Achaean women in the land should be wroth with me, if he were to lie without a shroud, who had won great possessions.’</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="148" type="card">
                    <p>
“So I spoke, and their proud hearts consented. Then day by day I would weave at the great web,<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />but by night would unravel it, when I had let place torches by me. Thus for three years I kept the Achaeans from knowing, and beguiled them; but when the fourth year came, as the seasons rolled on, as the months waned, and the many days were brought in their course, then verily by the help of my maidens, shameless creatures and reckless,<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />they came upon me and caught me, and upbraided me loudly. So I finished the web against my will perforce. And now I can neither escape the marriage nor devise any counsel more, and my parents are pressing me to marry, and my son frets, while these men devour his livelihood,<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />as he takes note of it all; for by now he is a man, and fully able to care for a household to which Zeus grants honor. Yet even so tell me of thy stock from whence thou art; for thou art not sprung from an oak of ancient story, or from a stone.”<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said:<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />“Honored wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, wilt thou never cease to ask me of my lineage? Well, I will tell thee; though verily thou wilt give me over to pains yet more than those by which I am now held in thrall; for so it ever is, when a man has been far from his country as long as I have now,<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />wandering through the many cities of men in sore distress. Yet even so will I tell thee what thou dost ask and enquire. There is a land called <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, in the midst of the wine-dark sea, a fair, rich land, begirt with water, and therein are many men, past counting, and ninety cities.<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />They have not all the same speech, but their tongues are mixed. There dwell Achaeans, there great-hearted native Cretans, there Cydonians, and Dorians of waving plumes, and goodly Pelasgians. Among their cities is the great city Cnosus, where Minos reigned when nine years old,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> he that held converse with great Zeus,<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />and was father of my father, great-hearted Deucalion. Now Deucalion begat me and prince Idomeneus. Idomeneus had gone forth in his beaked ships to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName> with the sons of Atreus; but my famous name is Aethon; I was the younger by birth, while he was the elder and the better man.<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />There it was that I saw Odysseus and gave him gifts of entertainment; for the force of the wind had brought him too to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, as he was making for the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and drove him out of his course past Malea. So he anchored his ships at Amnisus, where is the cave of Eilithyia, in a difficult harbor, and hardly did he escape the storm.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="190" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />Then straightway he went up to the city and asked for Idomeneus; for he declared that he was his friend, beloved and honored. But it was now the tenth or the eleventh dawn since Idomeneus had gone in his beaked ships to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>. So I took him to the house, and gave him entertainment<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />with kindly welcome of the rich store that was in the house, and to the rest of his comrades who followed with him I gathered and gave out of the public store barley meal and flaming wine and bulls for sacrifice, that their hearts might be satisfied. There for twelve days the goodly Achaeans tarried,<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />for the strong North Wind penned them there, and would not suffer them to stand upon their feet on the land, for some angry god had roused it. But on the thirteenth day the wind fell and they put to sea.”
He spoke, and made the many falsehoods of his tale seem like the truth,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and as she listened her tears flowed and her face melted<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />as the snow melts on the lofty mountains, the snow which the East Wind thaws when the West Wind has strewn it, and as it melts the streams of the rivers flow full: so her fair cheeks melted as she wept and mourned for her husband, who even then was sitting by her side. And Odysseus<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />in his heart had pity for his weeping wife, but his eyes stood fixed between his lids as though they were horn or iron, and with guile he hid his tears. But she, when she had had her fill of tearful wailing, again answered him and spoke, saying:
<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />“Now verily, stranger, am I minded to put thee to the test, whether or no thou didst in very truth entertain there in thy halls my husband with his godlike comrades, even as thou sayest. Tell me what manner of raiment he wore about his body, and what manner of man he was himself; and tell me of the comrades who followed him.”
<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Lady, hard is it for one that has been so long afar to tell thee this, for it is now the twentieth year since he went thence and departed from my country. But I will tell thee as my mind pictures him.<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />A fleecy cloak of purple did goodly Odysseus wear, a cloak of double fold, but the brooch upon it was fashioned of gold with double clasps, and on the front it was curiously wrought: a hound held in his fore paws a dappled fawn, and pinned it<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> in his jaws as it writhed. And at this all men marvelled,<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />how, though they were of gold, the hound was pinning the fawn and strangling it, and the fawn was writhing with its feet and striving to flee. And I noted the tunic about his body, all shining as is the sheen upon the skin of a dried onion, so soft it was; and it glistened like the sun.<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />Verily many women gazed at him in wonder. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. I know not whether Odysseus was thus clothed at home, or whether one of his comrades gave him the raiment when he went on board the swift ship, or haply even some stranger, since to many men<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />was Odysseus dear, for few of the Achaeans were his peers.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="241" type="card">
                    <p>
 I, too, gave him a sword of bronze, and a fair purple cloak of double fold, and a fringed tunic, and with all honor sent him forth on his benched ship. Furthermore, a herald<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />attended him, a little older than he, and I will tell thee of him too, what manner of man he was. He was round-shouldered, dark of skin, and curly-haired, and his name was Eurybates; and Odysseus honored him above his other comrades, because he was like-minded with himself.”
So he spoke, and in her heart aroused yet more the desire of weeping,<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />as she recognized the sure tokens that Odysseus told her. But she, when she had had her fill of tearful wailing, made answer and said to him:
“Now verily, stranger, though before thou wast pitied, shalt thou be dear and honored in my halls,<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />for it was I that gave him this raiment, since thou describest it thus, and folded it, and brought it forth from the store-room, and added thereto the shining brooch to be a thing of joy to him. But my husband I shall never welcome back, returning home to his dear native land. Wherefore it was with an evil fate that Odysseus<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />went forth in the hollow ship to see evil <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>, that should never be named.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Honored wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, mar not now thy fair face any more, nor waste thy heart at all in weeping for thy husband. I count it indeed no blame in thee;<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />for any woman weeps when she has lost her wedded husband, to whom she has borne children in her love, though he were far other than Odysseus, who, they say, is like unto the gods. Yet do thou cease from weeping, and hearken to my words; for I will tell thee with sure truth, and will hide nothing,<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />how but lately I heard of the return of Odysseus, that he is near at hand in the rich land of the Thesprotians, and yet alive, and he is bringing with him many rich treasures, as he begs through the land. But he lost his trusty comrades and his hollow ship on the wine-dark sea,<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />as he journeyed from the isle Thrinacia; for Zeus and Helios waxed wroth against him because his comrades had slain the kine of Helios.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="277" type="card">
                    <p>
So they all perished in the surging sea, but he on the keel of his ship was cast forth by the wave on the shore, on the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the gods.<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />These heartily showed him all honor, as if he were a god, and gave him many gifts, and were fain themselves to send him home unscathed. Yea, and Odysseus would long since have been here, only it seemed to his mind more profitable to gather wealth by roaming over the wide earth;<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />so truly does Odysseus beyond all mortal men know many gainful ways, nor could any mortal beside vie with him. Thus Pheidon, king of the Thesprotians, told me the tale. Moreover he swore in my own presence, as he poured libations in his halls, that the ship was launched and the men ready<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />who were to convey him to his dear native land. But me he sent forth first, for a ship of the Thesprotians chanced to be setting out for Dulichium, rich in wheat. And he showed me all the treasure that Odysseus had gathered; verily unto the tenth generation would it feed his children after him,<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />so great was the wealth that lay stored for him in the halls of the king. But Odysseus, he said, had gone to <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> to hear the will of Zeus from the high-crested oak of the god, even how he might return to his dear native land after so long an absence, whether openly or in secret.
<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />“Thus, as I tell thee, he is safe, and will presently come; he is very near, and not long will he now be far from his friends and his native land. Yet will I give thee an oath. Be Zeus my witness first, highest and best of gods, and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come,<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />that verily all these things shall be brought to pass even as I tell thee. In the course of this very month shall Odysseus come hither, as the old moon wanes and the new appears.”
Then wise Penelope answered him: “Ah, stranger, I would that this word of thine might be fulfilled.<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />Then shouldest thou straightway know of kindness and many a gift from me, so that one who met thee would call thee blessed. Yet in my heart I forebode it thus, even as it shall be. Neither shall Odysseus any more come home, nor shalt thou obtain a convoy hence, since there are not now in the house such masters<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />as Odysseus was among men—as sure as ever such a man there was—to send reverend strangers on their way, and to welcome them.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="317" type="card">
                    <p>
But still, my maidens, wash the stranger's feet and prepare his bed—bedstead and cloaks and bright coverlets—that in warmth and comfort he may come to the golden-throned Dawn.<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />And right early in the morning bathe him and anoint him, that in our house at the side of Telemachus he may bethink him of food as he sits in the hall. And worse shall it be for any man among them who vexes this man's soul with pain; naught thereafter shall he accomplish here, how fierce soever his wrath.<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />For how shalt thou learn of me, stranger, whether I in any wise excel other women in wit and prudent counsel, if all unkempt and clad in poor raiment thou sittest at meat in my halls? Men are but short-lived. If one be himself hard, and have a hard heart,<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />on him do all mortal men invoke woes for the time to come, while he still lives, and when he is dead all men mock at him. But if one be blameless and have a blameless heart, his fame do strangers bear far and wide among all men, and many call him a true man.”
<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Honored wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, verily cloaks and bright coverlets became hateful in my eyes on the day when first I left behind me the snowy mountains of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, as I fared on my long-oared ship.<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />Nay, I will lie, as in time past I was wont to rest through sleepless nights; for many a night have I lain upon a foul bed and waited for the bright-throned Dawn. Aye, and baths for the feet give my heart no pleasure, nor shall any woman touch my foot<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />of all those who are serving-women in thy hall, unless there is some old, true-hearted dame who has suffered in her heart as many woes as I; such an one I would not grudge to touch my feet.”
Then wise Penelope answered him again:<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />“Dear stranger, never yet has a man discreet as thou, of those who are strangers from afar, come to my house as a more welcome guest, so wise and prudent are all thy words. I have an old dame with a heart of understanding in her breast, who lovingly nursed and cherished my hapless husband,<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />and took him in her arms on the day when his mother bore him. She shall wash thy feet, weak with age though she be. Come now, wise Eurycleia, arise and wash the feet of one of like age with thy master. Even such as his are now haply the feet of Odysseus, and such his hands,<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />for quickly do men grow old in evil fortune.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="361" type="card">
                    <p>
So she spoke, and the old woman hid her face in her hands and let fall hot tears, uttering words of lamentation:
“Ah, woe is me, child, because of thee, for that I can do naught. Surely Zeus hated thee above all men, though thou hadst a god-fearing heart.<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />For never yet did any mortal burn to Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt, so many fat thigh-pieces or so many choice hecatombs as thou gavest him, with prayers that thou mightest reach a sleek old age and rear thy glorious son. But lo, now, from thee alone has he wholly cut off the day of thy returning.<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />Even thus, I ween, did women mock at him too,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> in a strange and distant land, when he came to some man's glorious house, as these shameless creatures here all mock at thee. It is to shun insult now from them and their many taunts that thou dost not suffer them to wash thy feet, but me, who am nothing loath, has<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, bidden to wash thee. Therefore will I wash thy feet, both for Penelope's own sake and for thine, for the heart within me is stirred with sorrow. But come now, hearken to the word that I shall speak. Many sore-tried strangers have come hither,<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />but I declare that never yet have I seen any man so like another as thou in form, and in voice, and in feet art like Odysseus.” 
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Old dame, so say all men whose eyes have beheld us two, that<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />we are very like each other, even as thou thyself dost note and say.”
So he spoke, and the old dame took the shining cauldron with water wherefrom she was about to wash his feet, and poured in cold water in plenty, and then added thereto the warm. But Odysseus sat him down away from the hearth and straightway turned himself toward the darkness,<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />for he at once had a foreboding at heart that, as she touched him, she might note a scar, and the truth be made manifest. So she drew near and began to wash her lord, and straightway knew the scar of the wound which long ago a boar had dealt him with his white tusk, when Odysseus had gone to <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> to visit Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus,<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />his mother's noble father, who excelled all men in thievery and in oaths. It was a god himself that had given him this skill, even Hermes, for to him he was wont to burn acceptable sacrifices of the thighs of lambs and kids; so Hermes befriended him with a ready heart. Now Autolycus, on coming once to the rich land of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />had found his daughter's son a babe new-born, and when he was finishing his supper, Eurycleia laid the child upon his knees and spoke, and addressed him:
“Autolycus, find now thyself a name to give to thy child's own child; be sure he has long been prayed for.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="405" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />Then Autolycus answered her, and said: “My daughter's husband and my daughter, give him whatsoever name I say. Lo, inasmuch as I am come hither as one that has been angered with many, both men and women, over the fruitful earth, therefore let the name by which the child is named be Odysseus.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> And for my part,<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />when he is a man grown and comes to the great house of his mother's kin at <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, where are my possessions, I will give him thereof and send him back rejoicing.”
It was for this reason that Odysseus had come, that Autolycus might give him the glorious gifts. And Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />clasped his hands in welcome and greeted him with gentle words, and Amphithea, his mother's mother, took Odysseus in her arms and kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes. But Autolycus called to his glorious sons to make ready the meal, and they hearkened to his call.<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />At once they led in a bull, five years old, which they flayed and dressed, and cut up all the limbs. Then they sliced these cunningly and pierced them with spits, and roasted them skilfully and distributed the portions. So, then, all day long till set of sun<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />they feasted, nor did their hearts lack aught of the equal feast. But when the sun set and darkness came on they lay down to rest and took the gift of sleep.
But as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, they went forth to the hunt, the hounds and<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />the sons of Autolycus too, and with them went goodly Odysseus. Up the steep mountain <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, clothed with forests, they climbed, and presently reached its windy hollows. The sun was now just striking on the fields, as he rose from softly-gliding, deep-flowing Oceanus,<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />when the beaters came to a glade. Before them went the hounds, tracking the scent, and behind them the sons of Autolycus, and among these the goodly Odysseus followed, close upon the hounds, brandishing his long spear. Now thereby a great wild boar was lying in a thick lair,<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />through which the strength of the wet winds could never blow nor the rays of the bright sun beat, nor could the rain pierce through it, so thick it was; and fallen leaves were there in plenty. Then about the boar there came the noise of the feet of men and dogs<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line" />as they pressed on in the chase, and forth from his lair he came against them with bristling back and eyes flashing fire, and stood there at bay close before them. Then first of all Odysseus rushed on, holding his long spear on high in his stout hand, eager to smite him; but the boar was too quick for him and struck him<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line" />above the knee, charging upon him sideways, and with his tusk tore a long gash in the flesh, but did not reach the bone of the man. But Odysseus with sure aim smote him on the right shoulder, and clear through went the point of the bright spear, and the boar fell in the dust with a cry, and his life flew from him.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="455" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line" />Then the dear sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the carcase, and the wound of noble, god-like Odysseus they bound up skilfully, and checked the black blood with a charm, and straightway returned to the house of their dear father. And when Autolycus and the sons of Autolycus<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line" />had fully healed him, and had given him glorious gifts, they quickly sent him back with joy to his native land, to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. Then his father and his honored mother rejoiced at his return, and asked him all the story, how he got his wound; and he told them all the truth,<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line" />how, while he was hunting, a boar had struck him with his white tusk when he had gone to <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> with the sons of Autolycus.
This scar the old dame, when she had taken the limb in the flat of her hands, knew by the touch, and she let fall the foot. Into the basin the leg fell, and the brazen vessel rang.<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line" />Over it tilted, and the water was spilled upon the ground. Then upon her soul came joy and grief in one moment, and both her eyes were filled with tears and the flow of her voice was checked. But she touched the chin of Odysseus, and said:
“Verily thou art Odysseus, dear child, and I knew thee not,<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line" />till I had handled all the body of my lord.”
She spoke, and with her eyes looked toward Penelope, fain to show her that her dear husband was at home. But Penelope could not meet her glance nor understand, for Athena had turned her thoughts aside. But Odysseus,<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line" />feeling for the woman's throat, seized it with his right hand, and with the other drew her closer to him, and said:
“Mother, why wilt thou destroy me? Thou didst thyself nurse me at this thy breast, and now after many grievous toils I am come in the twentieth year to my native land.<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line" />But since thou hast found me out, and a god has put this in thy heart, be silent lest any other in the halls learn hereof. For thus will I speak out to thee, and verily it shall be brought to pass: if a god shall subdue the lordly wooers unto me, I will not spare thee, my nurse though thou art, when<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line" />I slay the other serving-women in my halls.”
Then wise Eurycleia answered him: “My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth! Thou knowest how firm my spirit is and unyielding: I shall be as close as hard stone or iron.<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line" />And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. If a god shall subdue the lordly wooers unto thee, then will I name over to thee the women in thy halls, which ones dishonor thee, and which are guiltless.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="499" type="card">
                    <p>
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said:<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line" />“Mother, why, pray, wilt thou speak of them? Thou needest not at all. Of myself will I mark them well, and come to know each one. Nay, keep the matter to thyself, and leave the issue to the gods.”
So he spoke, and the old woman went forth through the hall to bring water for his feet, for all the first was spilled.<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line" />And when she had washed him, and anointed him richly with oil, Odysseus again drew his chair nearer to the fire to warm himself, and hid the scar with his rags.
Then wise Penelope was the first to speak, saying: “Stranger, this little thing further will I ask thee myself,<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line" />for it will soon be the hour for pleasant rest, for him at least on whom sweet sleep may come despite his care. But to me has a god given sorrow that is beyond all measure, for day by day I find my joy in mourning and lamenting, while looking to my household tasks and those of my women in the house,<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line" />but when night comes and sleep lays hold of all, I lie upon my bed, and sharp cares, crowding close about my throbbing heart, disquiet me, as I mourn. Even as when the daughter of Pandareus, the nightingale of the greenwood,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> sings sweetly, when spring is newly come,<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line" />as she sits perched amid the thick leafage of the trees, and with many trilling notes pours forth her rich voice in wailing for her child, dear Itylus, whom she had one day slain with the sword unwittingly, Itylus, the son of king Zethus; even so my heart sways to and fro in doubt,<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line" />whether to abide with my son and keep all things safe, my possessions, my slaves, and my great, high-roofed house, respecting the bed of my husband and the voice of the people, or to go now with him whosoever is best of the Achaeans, who woos me in the halls and offers bride-gifts past counting.<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line" />Furthermore my son, so long as he was a child and slack of wit, would not suffer me to marry and leave the house of my husband; but now that he is grown and has reached the bounds of manhood, lo, he even prays me to go back again from these halls, being vexed for his substance that the Achaeans devour to his cost.<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line" />But come now, hear this dream of mine, and interpret it for me. Twenty geese I have in the house that come forth from the water<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and eat wheat, and my heart warms with joy as I watch them. But forth from the mountain there came a great eagle with crooked beak and broke all their necks and killed them; and they lay strewn<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line" />in a heap in the halls, while he was borne aloft to the bright sky. Now for my part I wept and wailed, in a dream though it was, and round me thronged the fair-tressed Achaean women, as I grieved piteously because the eagle had slain my geese.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="544" type="card">
                    <p>
Then back he came and perched upon a projecting roof-beam,<milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line" />and with the voice of a mortal man checked my weeping, and said:
“‘Be of good cheer, daughter of far-famed Icarius; this is no dream, but a true vision of good which shall verily find fulfillment. The geese are the wooers, and I, that before was the eagle, am now again come back as thy husband,<milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line" />who will let loose a cruel doom upon all the wooers.’
“So he spoke, and sweet sleep released me, and looking about I saw the geese in the halls, feeding on wheat beside the trough, where they had before been wont to feed.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her and said:<milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line" />“Lady, in no wise is it possible to wrest this dream aside and give it another meaning, since verily Odysseus himself has shewn thee how he will bring it to pass. For the wooers' destruction is plain to see, for one and all; not one of them shall escape death and the fates.”
Then wise Penelope answered him again:<milestone ed="p" n="560" unit="line" />“Stranger, dreams verily are baffling and unclear of meaning, and in no wise do they find fulfillment in all things for men. For two are the gates of shadowy dreams, and one is fashioned of horn and one of ivory. Those dreams that pass through the gate of sawn ivory<milestone ed="p" n="565" unit="line" />deceive men, bringing words that find no fulfillment.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> But those that come forth through the gate of polished horn bring true issues to pass, when any mortal sees them. But in my case it was not from thence, methinks, that my strange dream came. Ah, truly it would then have been welcome to me and to my son.<milestone ed="p" n="570" unit="line" />But another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. Even now is coming on this morn of evil name which is to cut me off from the house of Odysseus; for now I shall appoint for a contest those axes which he was wont to set up in line in his halls, like props of a ship that is building, twelve in all,<milestone ed="p" n="575" unit="line" />and he would stand afar off and shoot an arrow through them.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                    </p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="576" type="card">
                    <p>
Now then I shall set this contest before the wooers: whosoever shall most easily string the bow in his hands, and shoot an arrow through all twelve axes, with him will I go and forsake this house<milestone ed="p" n="580" unit="line" />of my wedded life, a house most fair and filled with livelihood, which, methinks, I shall ever remember even in my dreams.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Honored wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, no longer now do thou put off this contest in thy halls;<milestone ed="p" n="585" unit="line" />for, I tell thee, Odysseus of many wiles will be here, ere these men, handling this polished bow, shall have strung it, and shot an arrow through the iron.”
Then wise Penelope answered him: “If thou couldest but wish, stranger, to sit here in my halls<milestone ed="p" n="590" unit="line" />and give me joy, sleep should never be shed over my eyelids. But it is in no wise possible that men should forever be sleepless, for the immortals have appointed a proper time for each thing upon the earth, the giver of grain. But I verily will go to my upper chamber<milestone ed="p" n="595" unit="line" />and lay me on my bed, which has become for me a bed of wailings, ever bedewed with my tears, since the day when Odysseus went to see evil <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName>, that should never be named. There will I lay me down, but do thou lie down here in the hall, when thou hast strewn bedding on the floor; or let the maids set a bedstead for thee.” 
<milestone ed="p" n="600" unit="line" />So saying, she went up to her bright upper chamber, not alone, for with her went her handmaids as well. And when she had gone up to her upper chamber with her handmaids, she then bewailed Odysseus, her dear husband, until flashing-eyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.</p>
                </div2>
            </div1>
            <div1 n="20" type="Book">
                <div2 n="1" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />But the goodly Odysseus lay down to sleep in the fore-hall of the house. On the ground he spread an undressed ox-hide and above it many fleeces of sheep, which the Achaeans were wont to slay, and Eurynome threw over him a cloak, when he had laid him down.<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />There Odysseus, pondering in his heart evil for the wooers, lay sleepless. And the women came forth from the hall, those that had before been wont to lie with the wooers, making laughter and merriment among themselves. But the heart was stirred in his breast,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />and much he debated in mind and heart, whether he should rush after them and deal death to each, or suffer them to lie with the insolent wooers for the last and latest time; and his heart growled within him. And as a bitch stands over her tender whelps<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />growling, when she sees a man she does not know, and is eager to fight, so his heart growled within him in his wrath at their evil deeds; but he smote his breast, and rebuked his heart, saying:
“Endure, my heart; a worse thing even than this didst thou once endure on that day when the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, unrestrained in daring, devoured my<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />mighty comrades; but thou didst endure until craft got thee forth from the cave where thou thoughtest to die.”
So he spoke, chiding the heart in his breast, and his heart remained bound<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> within him to endure steadfastly; but he himself lay tossing this way and that.<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />And as when a man before a great blazing fire turns swiftly this way and that a paunch full of fat and blood, and is very eager to have it roasted quickly, so Odysseus tossed from side to side, pondering how he might put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers,<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />one man as he was against so many. Then Athena came down from heaven and drew near to him in the likeness of a woman, and she stood above his head, and spoke to him, and said:
“Why now again art thou wakeful, ill-fated above all men? Lo, this is thy house, and here within is thy wife<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />and thy child, such a man, methinks, as anyone might pray to have for his son.”
And Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Yea, goddess, all this hast thou spoken aright. But the heart in my breast is pondering somewhat upon this, how I may put forth my hands upon the shameless wooers,<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />all alone as I am, while they remain always in a body in the house. And furthermore this other and harder thing I ponder in my mind: even if I were to slay them by the will of Zeus and of thyself, where then should I find escape from bane? Of this I bid thee take thought.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="44" type="card">
                    <p>
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />“Obstinate one, many a man puts his trust even in a weaker friend than I am, one that is mortal, and knows not such wisdom as mine; but I am a god, that guard thee to the end in all thy toils. And I will tell thee openly; if fifty troops of mortal men<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />should stand about us, eager to slay us in battle, even their cattle and goodly sheep shouldest thou drive off. Nay, let sleep now come over thee. There is weariness also in keeping wakeful watch the whole night through; and even now shalt thou come forth from out thy perils.”
So she spoke, and shed sleep upon his eyelids,<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />but herself, the fair goddess, went back to <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>.
Now while sleep seized him, loosening the cares of his heart, sleep that loosens the limbs of men, his true-hearted wife awoke, and wept, as she sat upon her soft bed. But when her heart had had its fill of weeping,<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />to Artemis first of all the fair lady made her prayer:
“Artemis, mighty goddess, daughter of Zeus, would that now thou wouldest fix thy arrow in my breast and take away my life even in this hour; or that a storm-wind might catch me up and bear me hence over the murky ways,<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />and cast me forth at the mouth of backward-flowing Oceanus, even as on a time storm-winds bore away the daughters of Pandareus. Their parents the gods had slain, and they were left orphans in the halls, and fair Aphrodite tended them with cheese, and sweet honey, and pleasant wine,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />and Here gave them beauty and wisdom above all women, and chaste Artemis gave them stature, and Athena taught them skill in famous handiwork. But while beautiful Aphrodite was going to high <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> to ask for the maidens the accomplishment of gladsome marriage—<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />going to Zeus who hurls the thunderbolt, for well he knows all things, both the happiness and the haplessness of mortal men—meanwhile the spirits of the storm snatched away the maidens and gave them to the hateful Erinyes to deal with.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> Would that even so those who have dwellings on <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> would blot me from sight,<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />or that fair-tressed Artemis would smite me, so that with Odysseus before my mind I might even pass beneath the hateful earth, and never gladden in any wise the heart of a baser man. Yet when a man weeps by day with a heart sore distressed,<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />but at night sleep holds him, this brings with it an evil that may well be borne—for sleep makes one forget all things, the good and the evil, when once it envelops the eyelids—but upon me a god sends evil dreams as well. For this night again there lay by my side one like him, even such as he was when he went forth with the host, and my heart<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />was glad, for I deemed it was no dream, but the truth at last.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="91" type="card">
                    <p>
So she spoke, and straightway came golden-throned Dawn. But as she wept goodly Odysseus heard her voice, and thereupon he mused, and it seemed to his heart that she knew him and was standing by his head.<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he was lying and laid them on a chair in the hall, and carried the ox-hide out of doors and set it down; and he lifted up his hands and prayed to Zeus:
“Father Zeus, if of your good will ye gods have brought me over land and sea to my own country, when ye had afflicted me sore,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />let some one of those who are awaking utter a word of omen for me within, and without let a sign from Zeus be shown besides.”
So he spoke in prayer, and Zeus the counsellor heard him. Straightway he thundered from gleaming <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, from on high from out the clouds; and goodly Odysseus was glad.<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />And a woman, grinding at the mill, uttered a word of omen from within the house hard by, where the mills of the shepherd of the people were set. At these mills twelve women in all were wont to ply their tasks, making meal of barley and of wheat, the marrow of men. Now the others were sleeping, for they had ground their wheat,<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />but she alone had not yet ceased, for she was the weakest of all. She now stopped her mill and spoke a word, a sign for her master:
“Father Zeus, who art lord over gods and men, verily loud hast thou thundered from the starry sky, yet nowhere is there any cloud: surely this is a sign that thou art showing to some man.<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />Fulfil now even for wretched me the word that I shall speak. May the wooers this day for the last and latest time hold their glad feast in the halls of Odysseus. They that have loosened my limbs with bitter labour, as I made them barley meal, may they now sup their last.”
<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />So she spoke, and goodly Odysseus was glad at the word of omen and at the thunder of Zeus, for he thought he had gotten vengeance on the guilty.
Now the other maidens in the fair palace of Odysseus had gathered together and were kindling on the hearth unwearied fire, and Telemachus rose from his bed, a godlike man,<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />and put on his clothing. He slung his sharp sword about his shoulder, and beneath his shining feet he bound his fair sandals; and he took his mighty spear, tipped with sharp bronze, and went and stood upon the threshold, and spoke to Eurycleia:
“Dear nurse, have ye honored the stranger in our house<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />with bed and food, or does he lie all uncared for? For such is my mother's way, wise though she is: in wondrous fashion she honours one of mortal men, though he be the worse, while the better she sends unhonored away.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="133" type="card">
                    <p>
Then wise Eurycleia answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />“In this matter, child, thou shouldest not blame her, who is without blame. He sat here and drank wine as long as he would, but for food he said he had no more hunger, for she asked him. But when he bethought him of rest and sleep, she bade the maidens strew his bed.<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />But he, as one wholly wretched and hapless, would not sleep on a bed and under blankets, but on an undressed ox-hide and fleeces of sheep he slept in the fore-hall, and we flung over him a cloak.”
So she spoke, and Telemachus went forth through the hall<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />with his spear in his hand, and with him went two swift hounds. And he went his way to the place of assembly to join the company of the well-greaved Achaeans, but Eurycleia, the goodly lady, daughter of Ops, son of Peisenor, called to her maidens, saying:
“Come, let some of you busily sweep the hall<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />and sprinkle it, and throw on the shapely chairs coverlets of purple, and let others wipe all the tables with sponges and cleanse the mixing-bowls and the well-wrought double cups, and others still go to the spring for water and bring it quickly here.<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />For the wooers will not long be absent from the hall, but will return right early; for it is a feast-day for all men.”
So she spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed. Twenty of them went to the spring of dark water, and the others busied themselves there in the house in skilful fashion.
<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />Then in came the serving-men of the Acheans, who thereafter split logs of wood well and skilfully; and the women came back from the spring. After them came the swineherd, driving three boars which were the best in all his herd. These he let be to feed in the fair courts,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />but himself spoke to Odysseus with gentle words:
“Stranger, do the Achaeans look on thee with any more regard, or do they dishonor thee in the halls as before?”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Ah, Eumaeus, I would that the gods might take vengeance on the outrage<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />wherewith these men in wantonness devise wicked folly in another's house, and have no place for shame.”
Thus they spoke to one another. And near to them came Melanthius the goatherd, leading she-goats that were the best in all the herds,<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />to make a feast for the wooers, and two herdsmen followed with him. The goats he tethered beneath the echoing portico, and himself spoke to Odysseus with taunting words:
“Stranger, wilt thou even now still be a plague to us here in the hall, asking alms of men, and wilt thou not begone?<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />'Tis plain, methinks, that we two shall not part company till we taste one another's fists, for thy begging is in no wise decent. Also it is not here alone that there are feasts of the Achaeans.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="183" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, but Odysseus of many wiles made no answer, but he shook his head in silence, pondering evil in the deep of his heart.
<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />Besides these a third man came, Philoetius, a leader of men, driving for the wooers a barren heifer and fat she-goats. These had been brought over from the mainland by ferrymen, who send other men, too, on their way, whosoever comes to them. The beasts he tethered carefully beneath the echoing portico,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />but himself came close to the swineherd and questioned him, saying: 
“Who is this stranger, swineherd, who has newly come to our house? From what men does he declare himself to be sprung? Where are his kinsmen and his native fields? Hapless man! Yet truly in form he is like a royal prince;<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />howbeit the gods bring to misery far-wandering men, whenever they spin for them the threads of trouble, even though they be kings.”
Therewith he drew near to Odysseus, and stretching forth his right hand in greeting, spoke and addressed him with winged words:
“Hail, Sir stranger;<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />may happy fortune be thine in time to come, though now thou art the thrall of many sorrows! Father Zeus, no other god is more baneful than thou; thou hast no pity on men when thou hast thyself given them birth, but bringest them into misery and wretched pains. The sweat broke out on me when I marked the man, and my eyes are full of tears<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />as I think of Odysseus; for he, too, I ween, is clothed in such rags and is a wanderer among men, if indeed he still lives and beholds the light of the sun. But if he is already dead and in the house of Hades, then woe is me for blameless Odysseus, who<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />set me over his cattle, when I was yet a boy, in the land of the Cephallenians And now these wax past counting; in no other wise could the breed of broad-browed cattle yield better increase<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> for a mortal man. But strangers bid me drive these now for themselves to eat, and they care nothing for the son in the house,<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />nor do they tremble at the wrath of the gods, for they are eager now to divide among themselves the possessions of our lord that has long been gone. Now, as for myself, the heart in my breast keeps revolving this matter: a very evil thing it is, while the son lives, to depart along with my cattle and go to a land of strangers,<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />even to an alien folk; but this is worse still, to remain here and suffer woes in charge of cattle that are given over to others. Aye, verily, long ago would I have fled and come to some other of the proud kings, for now things are no more to be borne; but still I think of that hapless one, if perchance he might come back I know not whence,<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />and make a scattering of the wooers in his house.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="226" type="card">
                    <p>
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Neatherd, since thou seemest to be neither an evil man nor a witless, and I see for myself that thou hast gotten an understanding heart, therefore will I speak out and swear a great oath to confirm my words.<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />Now be my witness Zeus above all gods, and this hospitable board, and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come, that verily while thou art here Odysseus shall come home, and thou shalt see with thine eyes, if thou wilt, the slaying of the wooers, who lord it here.”
<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />Then the herdsman of the cattle answered him: “Ah, stranger, I would that the son of Cronos might fulfil this word of thine! Then shouldest thou know what manner of might is mine, and how my hands obey.”
And even in like manner did Eumaeus pray to all the gods that wise Odysseus might come back to his own home.
<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />Thus they spoke to one another, but the wooers meanwhile were plotting death and fate for Telemachus; howbeit there came to them a bird on their left, an eagle of lofty flight, clutching a timid dove. Then Amphinomus spoke in their assembly, and said: 
<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />“Friends, this plan of ours will not run to our liking, even the slaying of Telemachus; nay, let us bethink us of the feast.”
So spoke Amphinomus, and his word was pleasing to them. Then, going into the house of godlike Odysseus, they laid their cloaks on the chairs and high seats,<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />and men fell to slaying great sheep and fat goats, aye, and fatted swine, and the heifer of the herd. Then they roasted the entrails and served them out, and mixed wine in the bowls, and the swineherd handed out the cups. And Philoetius, a leader of men, handed them bread<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />in a beautiful basket, and Melanthius poured them wine. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them.
But Telemachus, with crafty thought, made Odysseus sit within the well-built hall by the threshold of stone, and placed for him a mean stool and a little table.<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />Beside him he set portions of the entrails and poured wine in a cup of gold, and said to him:
“Sit down here among the lords and drink thy wine, and the revilings and blows of all the wooers will I myself ward from thee; for this is no public<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />resort, but the house of Odysseus, and it was for me that he won it. And for your part, ye wooers, refrain your minds from rebukes and blows, that no strife or quarrel may arise.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="268" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and they all bit their lips and marvelled at Telemachus for that he spoke boldly;<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />and Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke among them, saying:
“Hard though it be, Achaeans, let us accept the word of Telemachus, though boldly he threatens us in his speech. For Zeus, son of Cronos, did not suffer it, else would we ere now have silenced him in the halls, clear-voiced talker though he is.”
<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />So spoke Antinous, but Telemachus paid no heed to his words. Meanwhile the heralds were leading through the city the holy hecatomb of the gods, and the long-haired Achaeans gathered together beneath a shady grove of Apollo, the archer-god.
But when they had roasted the outer flesh and drawn it off the spits,<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />they divided the portions and feasted a glorious feast. And by Odysseus those who served set a portion equal to that which they received themselves, for so Telemachus commanded, the dear son of divine Odysseus.
But the proud wooers Athena<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />would in no wise suffer to abstain from bitter outrage, that pain might sink yet deeper into the heart of Odysseus, son of Laertes. There was among the wooers a man with his heart set on lawlessness—Ctesippus was his name, and in Same was his dwelling—who, trusting forsooth in his boundless wealth,<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />wooed the wife of Odysseus, that had long been gone. He it was who now spoke among the haughty wooers:
“Hear me, ye proud wooers, that I may say somewhat. A portion has the stranger long had, an equal portion, as is meet; for it is not well nor just to rob of their due<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />the guests of Telemachus, whosoever he be that comes to this house. Nay, come, I too will give him a stranger's-gift, that he in turn may give a present either to the bath-woman or to some other of the slaves who are in the house of godlike Odysseus.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="299" type="card">
                    <p>
So saying, he hurled with strong hand the hoof of an ox,<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />taking it up from the basket where it lay. But Odysseus avoided it with a quick turn of his head, and in his heart he smiled a right grim and bitter smile; and the ox's hoof struck the well-built wall. Then Telemachus rebuked Ctesippus, and said:
“Ctesippus, verily this thing fell out more to thy soul's profit.<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />Thou didst not smite the stranger, for he himself avoided thy missile, else surely would I have struck thee through the middle with my sharp spear, and instead of a wedding feast thy father would have been busied with a funeral feast in this land. Wherefore let no man, I warn you, make a show of forwardness in my house; for now I mark and understand all things,<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />the good and the evil, whereas heretofore I was but a child. But none the less we still endure to see these deeds, while sheep are slaughtered, and wine drunk, and bread consumed, for hard it is for one man to restrain many. Yet come, no longer work me harm of your evil wills.<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />But if you are minded even now to slay me myself with the sword, even that would I choose, and it would be better far to die than continually to behold these shameful deeds, strangers mishandled and men dragging the handmaidens in shameful fashion through the fair hall.”
<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />So he spoke, and they were all hushed in silence, but at last there spoke among them Agelaus, son of Damastor:
“Friends, no man in answer to what has been fairly spoken would wax wroth and make reply with wrangling words. Abuse not any more the stranger nor any<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />of the slaves that are in the house of divine Odysseus. But to Telemachus and his mother I would speak a gentle word, if perchance it may find favour in the minds of both. So long as the hearts in your breasts had hope that wise Odysseus would return to his own house,<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />so long there was no ground for blame that you waited, and restrained the wooers in your halls; for this was the better course, had Odysseus returned and come back to his house. But now this is plain, that he will return no more. Nay then, come, sit by thy mother and tell her this,<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />namely that she must wed him whosoever is the best man, and who offers the most gifts; to the end that thou mayest enjoy in peace all the heritage of thy fathers, eating and drinking, and that she may keep the house of another.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Nay, by Zeus, Agelaus, and by the woes of my father,<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />who somewhere far from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> has perished or is wandering, in no wise do I delay my mother's marriage, but I bid her wed what man she will, and I offer besides gifts past counting. But I am ashamed to drive her forth from the hall against her will by a word of compulsion. May God never bring such a thing to pass.”</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />So spoke Telemachus, but among the wooers Pallas Athena roused unquenchable laughter, and turned their wits awry. And now they laughed with alien lips, and all bedabbled with blood was the flesh they ate,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and their eyes were filled with tears and their spirits set on wailing.<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />Then among them spoke godlike Theoclymenus:
“Ah, wretched men, what evil is this that you suffer? Shrouded in night are your heads and your faces and your knees beneath you; kindled is the sound of wailing, bathed in tears are your cheeks, and sprinkled with blood are the walls and the fair rafters.<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />And full of ghosts is the porch and full the court, of ghosts that hasten down to Erebus beneath the darkness, and the sun has perished out of heaven and an evil mist hovers over all.”
So he spoke, but they all laughed merrily at him. And among them Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the first to speak:
<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />“Mad is the stranger that has newly come from abroad. Quick, ye youths, convey him forth out of doors to go his way to the place of assembly, since here he finds it like night.”
Then godlike Theoclymenus answered him: “Eurymachus, in no wise do I bid thee give me guides for my way.<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />I have eyes and ears and my two feet, and a mind in my breast that is in no wise meanly fashioned. With these will I go forth out of doors, for I mark evil coming upon you which not one of the wooers may escape or avoid, of all you who in the house of godlike Odysseus<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />insult men and devise wicked folly.”
So saying, he went forth from the stately halls and came to Piraeus, who received him with a ready heart. But all the wooers, looking at one another, sought to provoke Telemachus by laughing at his guests.<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />And thus would one of the proud youths speak:
“Telemachus, no man is more unlucky in his guests than thou, seeing that thou keepest such a filthy vagabond as this man here, always wanting bread and wine, and skilled neither in the works of peace nor those of war, but a mere burden of the earth.<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />And this other fellow again stood up to prophesy. Nay, if thou wouldst hearken to me it would be better far: let us fling these strangers on board a benched ship, and send them to the Sicilians, whence they would bring<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> thee in a fitting price.”
So spake the wooers, but he paid no heed to their words.<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />Nay, in silence he watched his father, ever waiting until he should put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers.
But the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had set her beautiful chair over against them, and heard the words of each man in the hall.<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />For they had made ready their meal in the midst of their laughing, a sweet meal, and one to satisfy the heart, for they had slain many beasts. But never could meal have been more graceless than a supper such as a goddess and a mighty man were soon to set before them. For unprovoked they were contriving deeds of shame.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />But the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, put it into the heart of the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, to set before the wooers in the halls of Odysseus the bow and the gray iron, to be a contest and the beginning of death.<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />She climbed the high stairway to her chamber, and took the bent key in her strong hand—a goodly key of bronze, and on it was a handle of ivory. And she went her way with her handmaidens to a store-room, far remote, where lay the treasures of her lord,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />bronze and gold and iron, wrought with toil. And there lay the back-bent bow and the quiver that held the arrows, and many arrows were in it, fraught with groanings—gifts which a friend of Odysseus had given him when he met him once in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, even Iphitus, son of Eurytus, a man like unto the immortals.<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />They two had met one another in <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> in the house of wise Ortilochus. Odysseus verily had come to collect a debt which the whole people owed him, for the men of <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> had lifted from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> in their benched ships three hundred sheep and the shepherds with them.<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />It was on an embassy in quest of these that Odysseus had come a far journey, while he was but a youth; for his father and the other elders had sent him forth. And Iphitus, on his part, had come in search of twelve brood mares, which he had lost, with sturdy mules at the teat; but to him thereafter did they bring death and doom,<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />when he came to the stout-hearted son of Zeus, the man Heracles, who well knew<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> deeds of daring; for Heracles slew him, his guest though he was, in his own house, ruthlessly, and had regard neither for the wrath of the gods nor for the table which he had set before him, but slew the man thereafter,<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />and himself kept the stout-hoofed mares in his halls. It was while asking for these that Iphitus met Odysseus, and gave him the bow, which of old great Eurytus had been wont to bear, and had left at his death to his son in his lofty house. And to Iphitus Odysseus gave a sharp sword and a mighty spear,<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />as the beginning of loving friendship; yet they never knew one another at the table, for ere that might be the son of Zeus had slain Iphitus, son of Eurytus, a man like unto the immortals, who gave Odysseus the bow. This bow goodly Odysseus, when going forth to war, would never<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />take with him on the black ships, but it lay in his halls at home as a memorial of a dear friend, and he carried it in his own land.</p>

Now when the fair lady had come to the store-room, and had stepped upon the threshold of oak, which of old the carpenter had skilfully planed and made straight to the line—<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />thereon had he also fitted door-posts, and set on them bright doors—straightway she quickly loosed the thong<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> from the handle and thrust in the key, and with sure aim shot back the bolts. And as a bull bellows<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />when grazing in a meadow, even so bellowed the fair doors, smitten by the key; and quickly they flew open before her. Then she stepped upon the high floor, where the chests stood in which fragrant raiment was stored, and stretched out her hand from thence and took from its peg the bow together with the bright case which surrounded it.<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />And there she sat down and laid the case upon her knees and wept aloud, and took out the bow of her lord. But when she had had her fill of tearful wailing, she went her way to the hall, to the company of the lordly wooers, bearing in her hands the back-bent bow and the quiver<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />that held the arrows, and many arrows were in it, fraught with groanings. And by her side her maidens bore a chest, wherein lay abundance of iron and bronze, the battle-gear of her lord. Now when the fair lady reached the wooers, she stood by the door-post of the well-built hall,<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />holding before her face her shining veil; and a faithful handmaid stood on either side of her. Then straightway she spoke among the wooers, and said:
“Hear me, ye proud wooers, who have beset this house to eat and drink ever without end,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />since its master has long been gone, nor could you find any other plea to urge, save only as desiring to wed me and take me to wife. Nay, come now, ye wooers, since this is shewn to be your prize.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> I will set before you the great bow of divine Odysseus,<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />and whosoever shall most easily string the bow in his hands and shoot an arrow through all twelve axes, with him will I go, and forsake this house of my wedded life, a house most fair and filled with livelihood, which, methinks I shall ever remember even in my dreams.”</p>

                <div2 n="80" type="card">

                        <milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />So she spoke, and bade Eumaeus, the goodly swineherd, set for the wooers the bow and the grey iron. And, bursting into tears, Eumaeus took them and laid them down, and in another place the neatherd wept, when he saw the bow of his lord. Then Antinous rebuked them, and spoke, and addressed them:
<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />“Foolish boors, who mind only the things of the day! Wretched pair, why now do you shed tears, and trouble the soul in the breast of the lady, whose heart even as it is lies low in pain, seeing that she has lost her dear husband? Nay, sit and feast in silence,<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />or else go forth and weep, and leave the bow here behind as a decisive<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> contest for the wooers; for not easily, methinks, is this polished bow to be strung. For there is no man among all these here such as Odysseus was, and I myself saw him.<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />For I remember him, though I was still but a child.”
So he spoke, but the heart in his breast hoped that he would string the bow and shoot an arrow through the iron. Yet verily he was to be the first to taste of an arrow from the hands of noble Odysseus, whom then he,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />as he sat in the halls, was dishonoring, and urging on all his comrades.
Then among them spoke the strong and mighty Telemachus: “Lo now, of a truth Zeus, son of Cronos, has made me witless. My dear mother, for all that she is wise, declares that she will follow another lord, forsaking this house;<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />yet I laugh, and am glad with a witless mind. Come then, ye wooers, since this is shewn to be your prize, a lady, the like of whom is not now in the Achaean land, neither in sacred <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, nor in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, nor in Mycene, nor yet in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself, nor in the dark mainland.<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" /> Nay, but of yourselves you know this—what need have I to praise my mother? Come then, put not the matter aside with excuses, nor any more turn away too long from the drawing of the bow, that we may see the issue. Yea, and I would myself make trial of yon bow. If I shall string it and shoot an arrow through the iron,<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />it will not vex me that my honored mother should leave this house and go along with another, seeing that I should be left here able now to wield the goodly battle-gear of my father.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="118" type="card">
                    <p>
With this he flung the scarlet cloak from off his back, and sprang up erect; and he laid his sharp sword from off his shoulders.<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />First then he set up the axes, when he had dug a trench, one long trench for all, and made it straight to the line, and about them he stamped in the earth. And amazement seized all who saw him, that he set them out so orderly, though before he had never seen them. Then he went and stood upon the threshold, and began to try the bow.<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />Thrice he made it quiver in his eagerness to draw it, and thrice he relaxed his effort, though in his heart he hoped to string the bow and shoot an arrow through the iron. And now at the last he would haply have strung it in his might, as for the fourth time he sought to draw up the string, but Odysseus nodded in dissent, and checked him in his eagerness.<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />Then the strong and mighty Telemachus spoke among them again:
“Out on it, even in days to come shall I be a coward and a weakling, or else I am too young, and have not yet trust in my might to defend me against a man, when one waxes wroth without a cause. But, come now, you that are mightier than I,<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />make trial of the bow, and let us end the contest.”
So saying, he set the bow from him on the ground, leaning it against the jointed, polished door, and hard by he leaned the swift arrow against the fair bow-tip, and then sat down again on the seat from which he had risen.
<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke among them: “Rise up in order, all you of our company, from left to right, beginning from the place where the cupbearer pours the wine.”
So spoke Antinous, and his word was pleasing to them. Then first arose Leiodes, son of Oenops,<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />who was their soothsayer, and ever sat by the fair mixing-bowl in the innermost part of the hall; deeds of wanton folly were hateful to him alone, and he was full of indignation at all the wooers. He it was who now first took the bow and swift arrow, and he went and stood upon the threshold, and began to try the bow;<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />but he could not string it. Ere that might be his hands grew weary, as he sought to draw up the string, his unworn delicate hands; and he spoke among the wooers:
“Friends, it is not I that shall string it; let another take it. For many princes shall this bow rob of spirit and of life, since verily it is better far<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />to die than to live on and fail of that for the sake of which we ever gather here, waiting expectantly day after day. Now many a man even hopes in his heart and desires to wed Penelope, the wife of Odysseus; but when he shall have made trial of the bow, and seen the outcome, thereafter let him woo<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />some other of the fair-robed Achaean women with his gifts, and seek to win her; then should Penelope wed him who offers most, and who comes as her fated lord.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="163" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and set the bow from him, leaning it against the jointed, polished door,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />and hard by he leaned the swift arrow against the fair bow-tip, and then sat down on the seat from which he had risen. But Antinous rebuked him, and spoke, and addressed him: “Leiodes, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth, a dread word and grievous! I am angered to hear it,<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />if forsooth this bow is to rob princes of spirit and of life, because thou art not able to string it. For, I tell thee, thy honored mother did not bear thee of such strength as to draw a bow and shoot arrows; but others of the lordly wooers will soon string it.”
<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />So he spoke, and called to Melanthius, the goatherd: “Come now, light a fire in the hall, Melanthius; and set by it a great seat with a fleece upon it, and bring forth a great cake of the fat that is within, that we youths may warm the bow, and anoint it with fat,<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />and so make trial of it, and end the contest.”
So he spoke, and Melanthius straightway rekindled the unwearied fire, and brought and placed by it a great seat with a fleece upon it, and he brought forth a great cake of the fat that was within. Therewith the youths warmed the bow, and made trial of it, but they could not<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />string it, for they were far lacking in strength.
Now Antinous was still persisting and godlike Eurymachus, leaders of the wooers, who were far the best in valiance; but those other two had gone forth both together from the hall, the neatherd and the swineherd of divine Odysseus;<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />and after them Odysseus himself went forth from the house. But when they were now outside the gates and the court, he spoke and addressed them with gentle words: 
“Neatherd, and thou too swineherd, shall I tell you something or keep it to myself? Nay, my spirit bids me tell it.<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />What manner of men would you be to defend Odysseus, if he should come from somewhere thus suddenly, and some god should bring him? Would you bear aid to the wooers or to Odysseus? Speak out as your heart and spirit bid you.”
Then the herdsmen of the cattle answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />“Father Zeus, oh that thou wouldest fulfil this wish! Grant that that man may come back, and that some god may guide him. Then shouldest thou know what manner of might is mine, and how my hands obey.”
And even in like manner did Eumaeus pray to all the gods that wise Odysseus; might come back to his own home.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="205" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />But when he knew with certainty the mind of these, he made answer, and spoke to them again, saying:
“At home now in truth am I here before you, my very self. After many grievous toils I am come in the twentieth year to my native land. And I know that by you two<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />alone of all my thralls is my coming desired, but of the rest have I heard not one praying that I might come back again to my home. But to you two will I tell the truth, even as it shall be. If a god shall subdue the lordly wooers unto me, I will bring you each a wife, and will give you possessions<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />and a house built near my own, and thereafter you two shall be in my eyes friends and brothers of Telemachus. Nay, come, more than this, I will shew you also a manifest sign, that you may know me well and be assured in heart, even the scar of the wound which long ago a boar dealt me with his white tusk,<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />when I went to <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> with the sons of Autolycus.” 
So saying, he drew aside the rags from the great scar. And when the two had seen it, and had marked each thing well, they flung their arms about wise Odysseus, and wept; and they kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome.<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />And even in like manner Odysseus kissed their heads and hands. And now the light of the sun would have gone down upon their weeping, had not Odysseus himself checked them, and said:
“Cease now from weeping and wailing, lest some one come forth from the hall and see us, and make it known within as well.<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />But go within one after another, not all together, I first and you thereafter, and let this be made a sign. All the rest, as many as are lordly wooers, will not suffer the bow and the quiver to be given to me; but do thou, goodly Eumaeus, as thou bearest the bow through the halls,<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />place it in my hands, and bid the women bar the close-fitting doors of their hall. And if any one of them hears groanings or the din of men within our walls, let them not rush out, but remain where they are in silence at their work.<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />But to thee, goodly Philoetius, do I give charge to fasten with a bar the gate of the court, and swiftly to cast a cord upon it.”
So saying, he entered the stately house, and went and sat down on the seat from which he had risen. And the two slaves of divine Odysseus went in as well.
<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />Eurymachus was now handling the bow, warming it on this side and on that in the light of the fire; but not even so was he able to string it; and in his noble heart he groaned, and with a burst of anger he spoke and addressed them: 
“Out on it! Verily I am grieved for myself and for you all.<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />It is in no wise for the marriage that I mourn so greatly, grieved though I am; for there are many other Achaean women, some in sea-girt <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself, and some in other cities; but I mourn if in truth we fall so far short of godlike Odysseus in might, seeing that we cannot string<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />his bow. This is a reproach for men that are yet to be to hear of.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="256" type="card">
                    <p>
Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: “Eurymachus, this shall not be so, and thou of thyself too knowest it. For to-day throughout the land is the feast of the god<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>—a holy feast. Who then would bend a bow? Nay, quietly<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />set it by; and as for the axes—what if we should let them all stand as they are? No man, methinks, will come to the hall of Odysseus, son of Laertes, and carry them off. Nay, come, let the bearer pour drops for libation into the cups, that we may pour libations, and lay aside the curved bow.<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />And in the morning bid Melanthius, the goatherd, to bring she-goats, far the best in all the herds, that we may lay thigh-pieces on the altar of Apollo, the famed archer; and so make trial of the bow, and end the contest.”
So spoke Antinous, and his word was pleasing to them.<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />Then the heralds poured water over their hands, and youths filled the bowls brim full of drink, and served out to all, pouring first drops for libation into the cups. But when they had poured libations, and had drunk to their heart's content, then with crafty mind Odysseus of many wiles spoke among them:
<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />“Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me. To Eurymachus most of all do I make my prayer, and to godlike Antinous, since this word also of his was spoken aright, namely that for the present you cease to try the bow, and leave the issue with the gods;<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />and in the morning the god will give the victory to whomsoever he will. But come, give me the polished bow, that in your midst I may prove my hands and strength, whether I have yet might such as was of old in my supple limbs, or whether by now my wanderings and lack of food have destroyed it.”
<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />So he spoke, and they all waxed exceeding wroth, fearing lest he might string the polished bow. And Antinous rebuked him, and spoke and addressed him:
“Ah, wretched stranger, thou hast no wit, no, not a trace. Art thou not content<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />that thou feastest undisturbed in our proud company, and lackest naught of the banquet, but hearest our words and our speech, while no other that is a stranger and beggar hears our words? It is wine that wounds thee, honey-sweet wine, which works harm to others too, if one takes it in great gulps, and drinks beyond measure.<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />It was wine that made foolish even the centaur, glorious Eurytion, in the hall of greathearted Peirithous, when he went to the Lapithae: and when his heart had been made foolish with wine, in his madness he wrought evil in the house of Peirithous. Then grief seized the heroes,<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />and they leapt up and dragged him forth through the gateway, when they had shorn off his ears and his nostrils with the pitiless bronze, and he, made foolish in heart, went his way, bearing with him the curse of his sin in the folly of his heart. From hence the feud arose between the centaurs and mankind; but it was for himself first that he found evil, being heavy with wine.<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />Even so do I declare great harm for thee, if thou shalt string the bow, for thou shalt meet with no kindness at the hands of anyone in our land, but we will send thee straightway in a black ship to king Echetus, the maimer of all men, from whose hands thou shalt in no wise escape alive. Nay, then, be still,<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />and drink thy wine, and do not strive with men younger than thou.”</p>

Then wise Penelope answered him: “Antinous, it is not well nor just to rob of their due the guests of Telemachus, whosoever he be that comes to this house. Dost thou think that, if yon stranger<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />strings the great bow of Odysseus, trusting in his strength and his might, he will lead me to his home, and make me his wife? Nay, he himself, I ween, has not this hope in his breast; so let no one of you on this account sit at meat here in sorrow of heart; nay, that were indeed unseemly.”
<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered her: “Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, it is not that we think the man will lead thee to his home—that were indeed unseemly—but that we dread the talk of men and women, lest hereafter some base fellow among the Achaeans should say:<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />‘Truly men weaker far are wooing the wife of a noble man, and cannot string his polished bow. But another, a beggar, that came on his wanderings, easily strung the bow, and shot through the iron.’ Thus will men speak, but to us this would become a reproach.”
<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />Then wise Penelope answered him again: “Eurymachus, in no wise can there be good report in the land for men who dishonor and consume the house of a prince. Why then do you make this matter<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> a reproach? This stranger is right tall and well-built,<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />and declares himself to be born the son of a good father. Nay, come, give him the polished bow and let us see. For thus will I speak out to thee, and this word shall verily be brought to pass; if he shall string the bow, and Apollo grant him glory, I will clothe him with a cloak and tunic, fair raiment,<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />and will give him a sharp javelin to ward off dogs and men, and a two-edged sword; and I will give him sandals to bind beneath his feet, and will send him whithersoever his heart and spirit bid him go.”
Then wise Telemachus answered her: “My mother, as for the bow, no man of the Achaeans<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />has a better right than I to give or to deny it to whomsoever I will—no, not all those who lord it in rocky <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, or in the islands towards horse-pasturing <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>. No man among these shall thwart me against my will, even though I should wish to give this bow outright to the stranger to bear away with him.<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />But do thou go thy chamber, and busy thyself with thine own tasks, the loom and the distaff, and bid thy handmaids ply their tasks. The bow shall be for men, for all, but most of all for me; since mine is the authority in the house.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="354" type="card">
                    <p>
She then, seized with wonder, went back to her chamber,<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />for she laid to heart the wise saying of her son. Up to her upper chamber she went with her handmaids, and then bewailed Odysseus, her dear husband, until flashing-eyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.
Now the goodly swineherd had taken the curved bow and was bearing it,<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />but the wooers all cried out in the halls. And thus would one of the proud youths speak:
“Whither, pray, art thou bearing the curved bow, miserable swineherd, thou man distraught? Soon by thy swine, alone and apart from men, shall the swift hounds devour thee—hounds thyself didst rear—if but Apollo<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />be gracious to us, and the other immortal gods.”
So they spoke, and he set down the bow, as he bore it, in that very place, seized with fear because many men were crying out aloud in the halls. But Telemachus on the other side called out threateningly:
“Father, bear the bow onward—soon shalt thou rue giving heed to all—<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />lest, younger though I am, I drive thee to the field, and pelt thee with stones; for in strength I am the better. I would that I were even so much better in strength and might than all the wooers that are in the house; then would I soon send many a one<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />forth from our house to go his way in evil case; for they devise wickedness.”
So he spoke, but all the wooers laughed merrily at him, and relaxed the bitterness of their anger against Telemachus. Howbeit the swineherd bore the bow through the hall, and came up to wise Odysseus, and put it in his hands.<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />Then he called forth the nurse Eurycleia, and said to her:
“Telemachus bids thee, wise Eurycleia, to bar the close-fitting doors of the hall, and if any of the women hear within groanings or the din of men within our walls, let them not<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />rush out, but remain where they are in silence at their work.”
So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged; and she barred the doors of the stately halls. 
But in silence Philoetius hastened forth from the house, and barred the gates of the well-fenced court.<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />Now there lay beneath the portico the cable of a curved ship, made of byblus plant, wherewith he made fast the gates, and then himself went within. Thereafter he came and sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and gazed upon Odysseus; now he was already handling the bow, turning it round and round, and trying it this way and that,<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />lest worms might have eaten the horns, while its lord was afar. And thus would one speak with a glance at his neighbor:
“Verily he has a shrewd eye, and is a cunning knave with a bow. It may be haply that he has himself such bows stored away at home, or else he is minded to make one, that he thus<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />turns it this way and that in his hands, the rascally vagabond.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="401" type="card">
                    <p>
And again another of the proud youths would say: “Would that the fellow might find profit in just such measure as he shall prove able ever to string this bow.”
So spoke the wooers, but Odysseus of many wiles,<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />as soon as he had lifted the great bow and scanned it on every side—even as when a man well-skilled in the lyre and in song easily stretches the string about a new peg, making fast at either end the twisted sheep-gut—so without effort did Odysseus string the great bow.<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />And he held it in his right hand, and tried the string, which sang sweetly beneath his touch, like to a swallow in tone. But upon the wooers came great grief, and the faces of them changed color, and Zeus thundered loud, shewing forth his signs. Then glad at heart was the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />that the son of crooked-counselling Cronos sent him an omen, and he took up a swift arrow, which lay by him on the table, bare, but the others were stored within the hollow quiver, even those of which the Achaeans were soon to taste. This he took, and laid upon the bridge of the bow, and drew the bow-string and the notched arrow<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />even from the chair where he sat, and let fly the shaft with sure aim, and did not miss the end of the handle of one of the axes, but clean through and out at the end passed the arrow weighted with bronze. But he spoke to Telemachus, saying:
“Telemachus, the stranger<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />that sits in thy halls brings no shame upon thee, nor in any wise did I miss the mark, or labour long in stringing the bow; still is my strength unbroken—not as the wooers scornfully taunt me. But now it is time that supper too be made ready for the Achaeans, while yet there is light, and thereafter must yet other sport be made<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />with song and with the lyre; for these things are the accompaniments of a feast.”
He spoke, and made a sign with his brows, and Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, girt about him his sharp sword, and took his spear in his grasp, and stood by the chair at his father's side, armed with gleaming bronze.</p>

            </div1>
            <div1 n="22" type="Book">
                <div2 n="1" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />But Odysseus of many wiles stripped off his rags and sprang to the great threshold with the bow and the quiver full of arrows, and poured forth the swift arrows right there before his feet, and spoke among the wooers:
<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />“Lo, now at last is this decisive contest ended; and now as for another mark, which till now no man has ever smitten, I will know<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> if haply I may strike it, and Apollo grant me glory.”
He spoke, and aimed a bitter arrow at Antinous. Now he was on the point of raising to his lips a fair goblet,<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />a two-eared cup of gold, and was even now handling it, that he might drink of the wine, and death was not in his thoughts. For who among men that sat at meat could think that one man among many, how strong soever he were, would bring upon himself evil death and black fate?<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />But Odysseus took aim, and smote him with an arrow in the throat, and clean out through the tender neck passed the point; he sank to one side, and the cup fell from his hand as he was smitten, and straightway up through his nostrils there came a thick jet of the blood of man; and quickly<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />he thrust the table from him with a kick of his foot, and spilled all the food on the floor, and the bread and roast flesh were befouled. Then into uproar broke the wooers through the halls, as they saw the man fallen, and from their high seats they sprang, driven in fear through the hall, gazing everywhere along the well-built walls;<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />but nowhere was there a shield or mighty spear to seize. But they railed at Odysseus with angry words:
“Stranger, to thy cost dost thou shoot at men; never again shalt thou take part in other contests; now is thy utter destruction sure. Aye, for thou hast now slain a man who was far the best<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />of the youths in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>; therefore shall vultures devour thee here.”
So spoke<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> each man, for verily they thought that he had not slain the man willfully; and in their folly they knew not this, that over themselves one and all the cords of destruction had been made fast. Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered them:
<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />“Ye dogs, ye thought that I should never more come home from the land of the Trojans, seeing that ye wasted my house, and lay with the maidservants by force, and while yet I lived covertly wooed my wife, having no fear of the gods, who hold broad heaven,<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />nor of the indignation of men, that is to be hereafter. Now over you one and all have the cords of destruction been made fast.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="42" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and thereat<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> pale fear seized them all, and each man gazed about to see how he might escape utter destruction; Eurymachus alone answered him, and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />“If thou art indeed Odysseus of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, come home again, this that thou sayest is just regarding all that the Achaeans have wrought—many deeds of wanton folly in thy halls and many in the field. But he now lies dead, who was to blame for all, even Antinous; for it was he who set on foot these deeds,<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />not so much through desire or need of the marriage, but with another purpose, which the son of Cronos did not bring to pass for him, that in the land of settled <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> he might himself be king, and might lie in wait for thy son and slay him. But now he lies slain, as was his due, but do thou spare the people<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />that are thine own; and we will hereafter go about the land and get thee recompense for all that has been drunk and eaten in thy halls, and will bring each man for himself in requital the worth of twenty oxen, and pay thee back in bronze and gold until thy heart be warmed; but till then no one could blame thee that thou art wroth.”
<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him: “Eurymachus, not even if you should give me in requital all that your fathers left you, even all that you now have, and should add other wealth thereto from whence ye might, not even so would I henceforth stay my hands from slaying until the wooers had paid the full price of all their transgression.<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />Now it lies before you to fight in open fight, or to flee, if any man may avoid death and the fates; but many a one, methinks, shall not escape from utter destruction.”
So he spoke, and their knees were loosened where they stood, and their hearts melted; and Eurymachus spoke among them again a second time:
<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />“Friends, for you see that this man will not stay his invincible hands, but now that he was got the polished bow and the quiver, will shoot from the smooth threshold until he slays us all, come, let us take thought of battle. Draw your swords, and hold the tables before you against<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />the arrows that bring swift death, and let us all have at him in a body, in the hope that we may thrust him from the threshold and the doorway, and go throughout the city, and so the alarm be swiftly raised; then should this fellow soon have shot his last.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="79" type="card">
                    <p>
So saying, he drew his sharp sword<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />of bronze, two-edged, and sprang upon Odysseus with a terrible cry, but at the same instant goodly Odysseus let fly an arrow, and struck him upon the breast beside the nipple, and fixed the swift shaft in his liver. And Eurymachus let the sword fall from his hand to the ground, and writhing over the table<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />he bowed and fell, and spilt upon the floor the food and the two-handled cup. With his brow he beat the earth in agony of soul, and with both his feet he spurned and shook the chair, and a mist was shed over his eyes.
Then Amphinomus made at glorious Odysseus,<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />rushing straight upon him, and had drawn his sharp sword, in hope that Odysseus might give way before him from the door. But Telemachus was too quick for him, and cast, and smote him from behind with his bronze-tipped spear between the shoulders, and drove it through his breast; and he fell with a thud, and struck the ground full with his forehead.<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />But Telemachus sprang back, leaving the long spear where it was, fixed in Amphinomus, for he greatly feared lest, as he sought to draw forth the long spear, one of the Achaeans might rush upon him and stab with his sword, or deal him a blow as he stooped over the corpse. So he started to run, and came quickly to his dear father,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />and standing by his side spoke to him winged words: 
“Father, now will I bring thee a shield and two spears and a helmet all of bronze, well fitted to the temples, and when I come back I will arm myself, and will give armour likewise to the swineherd and yon neatherd; for it is better to be clothed in armour.”
<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said: “Run, and bring them, while yet I have arrows to defend me, lest they thrust me from the door, alone as I am.”
So he spoke, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father, and went his way to the store-chamber where the glorious arms were stored.<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />Thence he took four shields and eight spears and four helmets of bronze, with thick plumes of horse-hair; and he bore them forth, and quickly came to his dear father. Then first of all he himself girded the bronze about his body, and even in like manner the two slaves put on them the beautiful armour,<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />and took their stand on either side of Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded.
But he, so long as he had arrows to defend him, would ever aim, and smite the wooers one by one in his house, and they fell thick and fast. But when the arrows failed the prince, as he shot,<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />he leaned the bow against the door-post of the well-built hall, and let it stand against the bright entrance wall. For himself, he put about his shoulders a four-fold shield, and set on his mighty head a well-wrought helmet with horse-hair plume, and terribly did the plume wave above him;<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />and he took two mighty spears, tipped with bronze.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="126" type="card">
                    <p>
Now there was in the well-built wall a certain postern door,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and along the topmost level of the threshold of the well-built hall was a way into a passage, and well-fitting folding doors closed it. This postern Odysseus bade the goodly swineherd watch,<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />taking his stand close by, for there was but a single way to reach it. Then Agelaus spoke among the wooers, and declared his word to all:
“Friends, will not one mount up by the postern door, and tell the people, that so an alarm may be raised straightway? Then should this fellow soon have shot his last.”
<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />Then Melanthius, the goatherd, answered him: “It may not be, Agelaus, fostered of Zeus, for terribly near is the fair door of the court, and the mouth of the passage is hard. One man could bar the way for all, so he were valiant. But come, let me bring you<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />from the store-room arms to don, for it is within, methinks, and nowhere else that Odysseus and his glorious son have laid the arms.”
So saying, Melanthius, the goatherd, mounted up by the steps<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> of the hall to the store-rooms of Odysseus. Thence he took twelve shields, as many spears,<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />and as many helmets of bronze with thick plumes of horsehair, and went his way, and quickly brought and gave them to the wooers. Then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and his heart melted, when he saw them donning armour and brandishing long spears in their hands, and great did his task seem to him;<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />but quickly he spoke to Telemachus winged words:
“Telemachus, verily some one of the women in the halls is rousing against us an evil battle, or haply it is Melanthius.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Father, it is I myself that am at fault in this, and no other<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />is to blame, for I left the close-fitting door of the store-room open: their watcher was better than I. But go now, goodly Eumaeus, close the door of the store-room, and see whether it is one of the women who does this, or Melanthius, son of Dolius, as I suspect.”
<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />Thus they spoke to one another. But Melanthius, the goatherd, went again to the store-room to bring beautiful armour; howbeit the goodly swineherd marked him, and straightway said to Odysseus who was near:
“Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />yonder again is the pestilent fellow, whom we ourselves suspect, going to the store-room. But do thou tell me truly, shall I slay him, if I prove the better man, or shall I bring him hither to thee, that the fellow may pay for the many crimes that he has planned in thy house?”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="170" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said: “Verily I and Telemachus will keep the lordly wooers within the hall, how fierce soever they be, but do you two bend behind him his feet and his arms above, and cast him into the store-room, and tie boards behind his back;<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />then make fast to his body a twisted rope, and hoist him up the tall pillar, till you bring him near the roof-beams, that he may keep alive long, and suffer grievous torment.”
So he spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed. Forth they went to the store-room, unseen of him who was within.<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />He truly was seeking for armour in the innermost part of the store-room, and the two lay in wait, standing on either side of the door-posts. And when Melanthius, the goatherd, was about to pass over the threshold, bearing in one hand a goodly helm, and in the other a broad old shield, flecked with rust—<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />the shield of lord Laertes, which he was wont to bear in his youth, but now it was laid by, and the seams of its straps were loosened—then the two sprang upon him and seized him. They dragged him in by the hair, and flung him down on the ground in sore terror, and bound his feet and hands with galling bonds,<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />binding them firmly behind his back, as the son of Laertes bade them, the much enduring, goodly Odysseus; and they made fast to his body a twisted rope, and hoisted him up the tall pillar, till they brought him near the roof-beams. Then didst thou mock him, swineherd Eumaeus, and say:
<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />“Now verily, Melanthius, shalt thou watch the whole night through, lying on a soft bed, as befits thee, nor shalt thou fail to mark the early Dawn, golden-throned, as she comes forth from the streams of Oceanus, at the hour when thou art wont to drive thy she-goats for the wooers, to prepare a feast in the halls.” 
<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />So he was left there, stretched in the direful bond, but the two put on their armour, and closed the bright door, and went to Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded. There they stood, breathing fury, those on the threshold but four, while those within the hall were many and brave.<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />Then Athena, daughter of Zeus, drew near them, like unto Mentor in form and voice, and Odysseus saw her, and was glad; and he spoke, saying:
“Mentor, ward off ruin, and remember me, thy dear comrade, who often befriended thee. Thou art of like age with myself.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="210" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />So he spoke, deeming that it was Athena, the rouser of hosts. But the wooers on the other side shouted aloud in the hall, and first Agelaus, son of Damastor, rebuked Athena, saying:
“Mentor, let not Odysseus beguile thee with his words to fight against the wooers and bear aid to himself.<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />For in this wise, methinks, shall our will be brought to pass: when we have killed these men, father and son, thereafter shalt thou too be slain with them, such deeds art thou minded to do in these halls: with thine own head shalt thou pay the price. But when with the sword we have stripped you of your might,<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />all the possessions that thou hast within doors and in the fields we will mingle with those of Odysseus, and will not suffer thy sons or thy daughters to dwell in thy halls, nor thy faithful wife to fare at large in the city of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>.”
So he spoke, and Athena waxed the more wroth at heart,<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />and she rebuked Odysseus with angry words:
“Odysseus, no longer hast thou steadfast might nor any valor, such as was thine when for high-born Helen of the white arms thou didst for nine years battle with the Trojans unceasingly, and many men thou slewest in dread conflict,<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />and by thy counsel was the broad-wayed city of Priam taken. How is it that now, when thou hast come to thy house and thine own possessions, thou shrinkest with wailing from playing the man, and that against the wooers? Nay, friend, come hither and take thy stand by my side, and see my deeds, that thou mayest know what manner of man<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />Mentor, son of Alcimus, is to repay kindness in the midst of the foe.”
She spoke, but did not give him strength utterly to turn the course of the battle, but still made trial of the might and valor of Odysseus and his glorious son; and for herself,<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />she flew up to the roof-beam of the smoky hall, and sat there in the guise of a swallow to look upon.
Now the wooers were urged on by Agelaus, son of Damastor, by Eurynomus, and Amphimedon and Demoptolemus and Peisander, son of Polyctor, and wise Polybus, for these were in valiance far the best of all the wooers<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />who still lived and fought for their lives; but the rest the bow and the swiftly-falling arrows had by now laid low. But Agelaus spoke among them, and declared his word to all:
“Friends, now at length will this man stay his invincible hands. Lo, Mentor has gone from him, and has but uttered empty boasts,<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />and they are left alone there at the outer doors. Therefore hurl not now upon them your long spears all at once, but come, do you six throw first in the hope that Zeus may grant that Odysseus be struck, and that we win glory. Of the rest there is no care, once he shall have fallen.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="255" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />So he spoke, and they all hurled their spears, as he bade, eagerly; but Athena made all vain. One man smote the door-post of the well-built hall, another the close-fitting door, another's ashen spear, heavy with bronze, struck upon the wall.<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />But when they had avoided the spears of the wooers, first among them spoke the much-enduring goodly Odysseus:
“Friends, now I give the word that we too cast our spears into the throng of the wooers, who are minded to slay us in addition to their former wrongs.”
<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />So he spoke, and they all hurled their sharp spears with sure aim. Odysseus smote Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, the swineherd Elatus, and the herdsmen of the cattle slew Peisander. So these all at the same moment bit the vast floor with their teeth,<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />and the wooers drew back to the innermost part of the hall. But the others sprang forward and drew forth their spears from the dead bodies.
Then again the wooers hurled their sharp spears eagerly, but Athena made them vain, many as they were. One man<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />smote the door-post of the well-built hall, another the close-fitting door, another's ashen spear, heavy with bronze, struck upon the wall. But Amphimedon smote Telemachus on the hand by the wrist, a grazing blow, and the bronze tore the surface of the skin. And Ctesippus with his long spear<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />grazed the shoulder of Eumaeus above his shield, but the spear flew over and fell upon the ground. Then once more Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded, and his company hurled their sharp spears into the throng of the wooers, and again Odysseus, the sacker of cities, smote Eurydamas, and Telemachus Amphimedon, the swineherd Polybus,<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />and thereafter the herdsman of the cattle smote Ctesippus in the breast, and boasted over him, saying:
“Son of Polytherses, thou lover of revilings, never more at all do thou speak big, yielding to folly, but leave the matter to the gods, since verily they are mightier far.<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />This is thy gift of welcome to match the hoof which of late thou gavest to godlike Odysseus, when he went begging through the house.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="292" type="card">
                    <p>
So spoke the herdsman of the sleek cattle. But Odysseus wounded the son of Damastor in close fight with a thrust of his long spear, and Telemachus wounded Leiocritus, son of Evenor,<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />with a spear-thrust full upon the groin, and drove the bronze clean through, and he fell headlong and struck the ground full with his forehead. Then Athena held up her aegis, the bane of mortals, on high from the roof, and the minds of the wooers were panic-stricken, and they fled through the halls like a herd of kine<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />that the darting gad-fly falls upon and drives along in the season of spring, when the long days come. And even as vultures of crooked talons and curved beaks come forth from the mountains and dart upon smaller birds, which scour the plain, flying low beneath the clouds,<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />and the vultures pounce upon them and slay them, and they have no defence or way of escape, and men rejoice at the chase; even so did those others set upon the wooers and smite them left and right through the hall. And therefrom rose hideous groaning as heads were smitten, and all the floor swam with blood.
<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />But Leiodes rushed forward and clasped the knees of Odysseus, and made entreaty to him, and spoke winged words: 
“By thy knees I beseech thee, Odysseus, and do thou respect me and have pity. For I declare to thee that never yet have I wronged one of the women in thy halls by wanton word or deed; nay,<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />I sought to check the other wooers, when any would do such deeds. But they would not hearken to me to withhold their hands from evil, wherefore through their wanton folly they have met a cruel doom. Yet I, the soothsayer among them, that have done no wrong, shall be laid low even as they; so true is it that there is no gratitude in aftertime for good deeds done.”
<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him: “If verily thou dost declare thyself the soothsayer among these men, often, I ween, must thou have prayed in the halls that far from me the issue of a joyous return might be removed, and that it might be with thee that my dear wife should go and bear thee children;<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />wherefore thou shalt not escape grievous death.”
So saying, he seized in his strong hand a sword that lay near, which Agelaus had let fall to the ground when he was slain, and with this he smote him full upon the neck. And even while he was yet speaking his head was mingled with the dust.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="330" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />Now the son of Terpes, the minstrel, was still seeking to escape black fate, even Phemius, who sang perforce among the wooers. He stood with the clear-toned lyre in his hands near the postern door, and he was divided in mind whether he should slip out from the hall<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />and sit down by the well-built altar of great Zeus, the God of the court, whereon Laertes and Odysseus had burned many things of oxen, or whether he should rush forward and clasp the knees of Odysseus in prayer. And as he pondered this seemed to him the better course, to clasp the knees of Odysseus, son of Laertes.<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />So he laid the hollow lyre on the ground between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded chair, and himself rushed forward and clasped Odysseus by the knees, and made entreaty to him, and spoke winged words:
“By thy knees I beseech thee, Odysseus, and do thou respect me and have pity;<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />on thine own self shall sorrow come hereafter, if thou slayest the minstrel, even me, who sing to gods and men. Self-taught am I, and the god has planted in my heart all manner of lays, and worthy am I to sing to thee as to a god; wherefore be not eager to cut my throat.<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />Aye, and Telemachus too will bear witness to this, thy dear son, how that through no will or desire of mine I was wont to resort to thy house to sing to the wooers at their feasts, but they, being far more and stronger, led me hither perforce.”
So he spoke, and the strong and mighty Telemachus heard him,<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />and quickly spoke to his father, who was near:
“Stay thy hand, and do not wound this guiltless man with the sword. Aye, and let us save also the herald, Medon, who ever cared for me in our house, when I was a child—unless perchance Philoetius has already slain him, or the swineherd,<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />or he met thee as thou didst rage through the house.”
So he spoke, and Medon, wise of heart, heard him, for he lay crouching beneath a chair, and had clothed himself in the skin of an ox, newly flayed, seeking to avoid black fate. Straightway he rose from beneath the chair and stripped off the ox-hide,<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />and then rushed forward and clasped Telemachus by the knees, and made entreaty to him, and spoke winged words: 
“Friend, here I am; stay thou thy hand and bid thy father stay his, lest in the greatness of his might he harm me with the sharp bronze in his wrath against the wooers, who wasted his<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />possessions in the halls, and in their folly honored thee not at all.”
But Odysseus of many wiles smiled, and said to him: “Be of good cheer, for he has delivered thee and saved thee, that thou mayest know in thy heart and tell also to another, how far better is the doing of good deeds than of evil.<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />But go forth from the halls and sit down outside in the court away from the slaughter, thou and the minstrel of many songs, till I shall have finished all that I must needs do in the house.”</p>

                <div2 n="378" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and the two went their way forth from the hall and sat down by the altar of great Zeus,<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />gazing about on every side, ever expecting death. And Odysseus too gazed about all through his house to see if any man yet lived, and was hiding there, seeking to avoid black fate. But he found them one and all fallen in the blood and dust—all the host of them, like fishes that fishermen<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />have drawn forth in the meshes of their net from the grey sea upon the curving beach, and they all lie heaped upon the sand, longing for the waves of the sea, and the bright sun takes away their life; even so now the wooers lay heaped upon each other.<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />Then Odysseus of many wiles spoke to Telemachus:
“Telemachus, go call me the nurse Eurycleia, that I may tell her the word that is in my mind.”
So he spoke, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father, and shaking the door said to Eurycleia:
<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />“Up and hither, aged wife, that hast charge of all our woman servants in the halls. Come, my father calls thee, that he may tell thee somewhat.” 
So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged; she opened the doors of the stately hall,<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />and came forth, and Telemachus led the way before her. There she found Odysseus amid the bodies of the slain, all befouled with blood and filth, like a lion that comes from feeding on an ox of the farmstead, and all his breast and his cheeks on either side<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />are stained with blood, and he is terrible to look upon; even so was Odysseus befouled, his feet and his hands above. But she, when she beheld the corpses and the great welter of blood, made ready to utter loud cries of joy, seeing what a deed had been wrought. But Odysseus stayed and checked her in her eagerness,<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />and spoke and addressed her with winged words:
“In thine own heart rejoice, old dame, but refrain thyself and cry not out aloud: an unholy thing is it to boast over slain men. These men here has the fate of the gods destroyed and their own reckless deeds, for they honored no one of men upon the earth,<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />were he evil or good, whosoever came among them; wherefore by their wanton folly they brought on themselves a shameful death. But come, name thou over to me the women in the halls, which ones dishonor me and which are guiltless.”
Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />“Then verily, my child, will I tell thee all the truth. Fifty women servants hast thou in the halls, women that we have taught to do their work, to card the wool and bear the lot of slaves. Of these twelve in all have set their feet in the way of shamelessness,<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />and regard not me nor Penelope herself. And Telemachus is but newly grown to manhood, and his mother would not suffer him to rule over the women servants. But come, let me go up to the bright upper chamber and bear word to thy wife, on whom some god has sent sleep.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="430" type="card">

                        <milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Wake her not yet, but do thou bid come hither the women, who in time past have contrived shameful deeds.”
So he spoke, and the old dame went forth through the hall to bear tidings to the women, and bid them come;<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />but Odysseus called to him Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd, and spoke to them winged words:
“Begin now to bear forth the dead bodies and bid the women help you, and thereafter cleanse the beautiful chairs and the tables with water and porous sponges.<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />But when you have set all the house in order, lead the women forth from the well-built hall to a place between the dome<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and the goodly fence of the court, and there strike them down with your long swords, until you take away the life from them all, and they forget the love<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line" />which they had at the bidding of the wooers, when they lay with them in secret.”
So he spoke, and the women came all in a throng, wailing terribly and shedding big tears. First they bore forth the bodies of the slain and set them down beneath the portico of the well-fenced court,<milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line" />propping them one against the other; and Odysseus himself gave them orders and hastened on the work, and they bore the bodies forth perforce. Then they cleansed the beautiful high seats and the tables with water and porous sponges. But Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line" />scraped with hoes the floor of the well-built house, and the women bore the scrapings forth and threw them out of doors. But when they had set in order all the hall, they led the women forth from the well-built hall to a place between the dome and the goodly fence of the court,<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line" />and shut them up in a narrow space, whence it was in no wise possible to escape. Then wise Telemachus was the first to speak to the others, saying:
“Let it be by no clean death that I take the lives of these women, who on my own head have poured reproaches and on my mother, and were wont to lie with the wooers.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="465" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line" />So he spoke, and tied the cable of a dark-prowed ship to a great pillar and flung it round the dome, stretching it on high that none might reach the ground with her feet. And as when long-winged thrushes or doves fall into a snare that is set in a thicket,<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line" />as they seek to reach their resting-place, and hateful is the bed that gives them welcome, even so the women held their heads in a row, and round the necks of all nooses were laid, that they might die most piteously. And they writhed a little while with their feet, but not long.
Then forth they led Melanthius through the doorway and the court,<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line" />and cut off his nostrils and his ears with the pitiless bronze, and drew out his vitals for the dogs to eat raw, and cut off his hands and his feet in their furious wrath.
Thereafter they washed their hands and feet, and went into the house to Odysseus, and the work was done.<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line" />But Odysseus said to the dear nurse Eurycleia: “Bring sulphur, old dame, to cleanse from pollution, and bring me fire, that I may purge the hall; and do thou bid Penelope come hither with her handmaidens, and order all the women in the house to come.”
<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line" />Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered him: “Yea, all this, my child, hast thou spoken aright. But come, let me bring thee a cloak and a tunic for raiment, and do not thou stand thus in the halls with thy broad shoulders wrapped in rags; that were a cause for blame.”
<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line" />Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her: “First of all let a fire now be made me in the hall.”
So he spoke, and the dear nurse Eurycleia did not disobey, but brought fire and sulphur; but Odysseus throughly purged the hall and the house and the court.
<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line" />Then the old dame went back through the fair house of Odysseus to bear tidings to the women and bid them come; and they came forth from their hall with torches in their hands. They thronged about Odysseus and embraced him, and clasped and kissed his head and shoulders<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line" />and his hands in loving welcome; and a sweet longing seized him to weep and wail, for in his heart he knew them all.</p>

            </div1>
            <div1 n="23" type="Book">

                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />Then the old dame went up to the upper chamber, laughing aloud, to tell her mistress that her dear husband was in the house. Her knees moved nimbly, but her feet trotted along beneath her;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> and she stood above her lady's head, and spoke to her, and said:
<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />“Awake, Penelope, dear child, that with thine own eyes thou mayest see what thou desirest all thy days. Odysseus is here, and has come home, late though his coming has been, and has slain the proud wooers who vexed his house, and devoured his substance, and oppressed his son.”
<milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />Then wise Penelope answered her: “Dear nurse, the gods have made thee mad, they who can make foolish even one who is full wise, and set the simple-minded in the paths of understanding; it is they that have marred thy wits, though heretofore thou wast sound of mind.<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />Why dost thou mock me, who have a heart full of sorrow, to tell me this wild tale, and dost rouse me out of slumber, the sweet slumber that bound me and enfolded my eyelids? For never yet have I slept so sound since the day when Odysseus went forth to see evil <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName> that should not be named.<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />Nay come now, go down and back to the women's hall, for if any other of the women that are mine had come and told me this, and had roused me out of sleep, straightway would I have sent her back in sorry wise to return again to the hall, but to thee old age shall bring this profit.”
<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered her: “I mock thee not, dear child, but in very truth Odysseus is here, and has come home, even as I tell thee. He is that stranger to whom all men did dishonor in the halls. But Telemachus long ago knew that he was here,<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />yet in his prudence he hid the purpose of his father, till he should take vengeance on the violence of overweening men.”
So she spoke, and Penelope was glad, and she leapt from her bed and flung her arms about the old woman and let the tears fall from her eyelids; and she spoke, and addressed her with winged words:
<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />“Come now, dear nurse, I pray thee tell me truly, if verily he has come home, as thou sayest, how he put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers, all alone as he was, while they remained always in a body in the house.”
Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered her:<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />“I saw not, I asked not; only I heard the groaning of men that were being slain. As for us women, we sat terror-stricken in the innermost part of our well-built chambers, and the close-fitting doors shut us in, until the hour when thy son Telemachus called me from the hall, for his father had sent him forth to call me.<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />Then I found Odysseus standing among the bodies of the slain, and they, stretched all around him on the hard floor, lay one upon the other; the sight would have warmed thy heart with cheer.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>

                    <p>
And now the bodies are all gathered together at the gates of the court,<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />but he is purging the fair house with sulphur, and has kindled a great fire, and sent me forth to call thee. Nay, come with me, that the hearts of you two may enter into joy, for you have suffered many woes. But now at length has this thy long desire been fulfilled:<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />he has come himself, alive to his own hearth, and he has found both thee and his son in the halls; while as for those, even the wooers, who wrought him evil, on them has he taken vengeance one and all in his house.”
Then wise Penelope answered her: “Dear nurse, boast not yet loudly over them with laughter.<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />Thou knowest how welcome the sight of him in the halls would be to all, but above all to me and to his son, born of us two. But this is no true tale, as thou tellest it; nay, some one of the immortals has slain the lordly wooers in wrath at their grievous insolence and their evil deeds.<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />For they honored no one among men upon the earth, were he evil or good, whosoever came among them; therefore it is through their own wanton folly that they have suffered evil. But Odysseus far away has lost his return to the land of <placeName key="tgn,7002733">Achaea</placeName>, and is lost himself.”
Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered her:<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />“My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth, in that thou saidst that thy husband, who even now is here, at his own hearth, would never more return! Thy heart is ever unbelieving. Nay come, I will tell thee a manifest sign besides, even the scar of the wound which long ago the boar dealt him with his white tusk.<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />This I marked while I washed his feet, and was fain to tell it to thee as well, but he laid his hand upon my mouth, and in the great wisdom of his heart would not suffer me to speak. So come with me; but I will set my very life at stake that, if I deceive thee, thou shouldest slay me by a most pitiful death.”
<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />Then wise Penelope answered her: “Dear nurse, it is hard for thee to comprehend the counsels of the gods that are forever, how wise soever thou art. Nevertheless let us go to my son, that I may see the wooers dead and him that slew them.”</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line" />So saying, she went down from the upper chamber, and much her heart pondered whether she should stand aloof and question her dear husband, or whether she should go up to him, and clasp and kiss his head and hands. But when she had come in and had passed over the stone threshold, she sat down opposite Odysseus in the light of the fire<milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line" />beside the further wall; but he was sitting by a tall pillar, looking down, and waiting to see whether his noble wife would say aught to him, when her eyes beheld him. Howbeit she sat long in silence, and amazement came upon her soul; and now with her eyes she would look full upon his face, and now again<milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line" />she would fail to know him, for that he had upon him mean raiment. But Telemachus rebuked her, and spoke, and addressed her:
“My mother, cruel mother, that hast an unyielding heart, why dost thou thus hold aloof from my father, and dost not sit by his side and ask and question him?<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />No other woman would harden her heart as thou dost, and stand aloof from her husband, who after many grievous toils had come back to her in the twentieth year to his native land: but thy heart is ever harder than stone.” 
Then wise Penelope answered him:<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />“My child, the heart in my breast is lost in wonder, and I have no power to speak at all, nor to ask a question, nor to look him in the face. But if in very truth he is Odysseus, and has come home, we two shall surely know one another more certainly;<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />for we have signs which we two alone know, signs hidden from others.”
So she spoke, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus smiled, and straightway spoke to Telemachus winged words:
“Telemachus, suffer now thy mother to test me in the halls; presently shall she win more certain knowledge.<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />But now because I am foul, and am clad about my body in mean clothing, she scorns me, and will not yet admit that I am he. But for us, let us take thought how all may be the very best. For whoso has slain but one man in a land, even though it be a man that leaves not many behind to avenge him,<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />he goes into exile, and leaves his kindred and his native land; but we have slain those who were the very stay of the city, far the noblest of the youths of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. Of this I bid thee take thought.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Do thou thyself look to this, dear father; for thy<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />counsel, they say, is the best among men, nor could any other of mortal men vie with thee. As for us, we will follow with thee eagerly, nor methinks shall we be wanting in valor, so far as we have strength.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="129" type="card">
                    <p>
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said:<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />“Then will I tell thee what seems to me to be the best way. First bathe yourselves, and put on your tunics, and bid the handmaids in the halls to take their raiment. But let the divine minstrel with his clear-toned lyre in hand be our leader in the gladsome dance,<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />that any man who hears the sound from without, whether a passer-by or one of those who dwell around, may say that it is a wedding feast; and so the rumor of the slaying of the wooers shall not be spread abroad throughout the city before we go forth to our well-wooded farm. There<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />shall we afterwards devise whatever advantage the Olympian may vouchsafe us.”
So he spoke, and they all readily hearkened and obeyed. First they bathed and put on their tunics, and the women arrayed themselves, and the divine minstrel took the hollow lyre and aroused in them the desire<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />of sweet song and goodly dance. So the great hall resounded all about with the tread of dancing men and of fair-girdled women; and thus would one speak who heard the noise from without the house:
“Aye, verily some one has wedded the queen wooed of many.<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />Cruel she was, nor had she the heart to keep the great house of her wedded husband to the end, even till he should come.”
So they would say, but they knew not how these things were. Meanwhile the housewife Eurynome bathed the great-hearted Odysseus in his house, and anointed him with oil,<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />and cast about him a fair cloak and a tunic; and over his head Athena shed abundant beauty, making him taller to look upon and mightier, and from his head she made locks to flow in curls like the hyacinth flower. And as when a man overlays silver with gold,<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athena have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is the work he produces, even so the goddess shed grace on his head and shoulders, and forth from the bath he came, in form like unto the immortals. Then he sat down again on the chair from which he had risen,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />opposite his wife; and he spoke to her and said:
“Strange lady! to thee beyond all women have the dwellers on <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> given a heart that cannot be softened. No other woman would harden her heart as thou dost, and stand aloof from her husband who after many grievous toils<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />had come to her in the twentieth year to his native land. Nay come, nurse, strew me a couch, that all alone I may lay me down, for verily the heart in her breast is of iron.”
Then wise Penelope answered him: “Strange sir, I am neither in any wise proud, nor do I scorn thee,<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />nor yet am I too greatly amazed, but right well do I know what manner of man thou wast, when thou wentest forth from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> on thy long-oared ship. Yet come, Eurycleia, strew for him the stout bedstead outside the well-built bridal chamber which he made himself. Thither do ye bring for him the stout bedstead, and cast upon it bedding,<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />fleeces and cloaks and bright coverlets.”</p>

                <div2 n="181" type="card">

So she spoke, and made trial of her husband. But Odysseus, in a burst of anger, spoke to his true-hearted wife, and said: “Woman, truly this is a bitter word that thou hast spoken. Who has set my bed elsewhere? Hard would it be for one,<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />though never so skilled, unless a god himself should come and easily by his will set it in another place. But of men there is no mortal that lives, be he never so young and strong, who could easily pry it from its place, for a great token is wrought in the fashioned bed, and it was I that built it and none other.<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />A bush of long-leafed olive was growing within the court, strong and vigorous, and girth it was like a pillar. Round about this I built my chamber, till I had finished it, with close-set stones, and I roofed it over well, and added to it jointed doors, close-fitting.<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />Thereafter I cut away the leafy branches of the long-leafed olive, and, trimming the trunk from the root, I smoothed it around with the adze well and cunningly, and made it straight to the line, thus fashioning the bed-post; and I bored it all with the augur. Beginning with this I hewed out my bed, till I had finished it,<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />inlaying it with gold and silver and ivory, and I stretched on it a thong of ox-hide, bright with purple. Thus do I declare to thee this token; but I know not, woman, whether my bedstead is still fast in its place, or whether by now some man has cut from beneath the olive stump, and set the bedstead elsewhere.”
<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />So he spoke, and her knees were loosened where she sat, and her heart melted, as she knew the sure tokens which Odysseus told her. Then with a burst of tears she ran straight toward him, and flung her arms about the neck of Odysseus, and kissed his head, and spoke, saying:
“Be not vexed with me, Odysseus, for in all else<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />thou wast ever the wisest of men. It is the gods that gave us sorrow, the gods who begrudged that we two should remain with each other and enjoy our youth, and come to the threshold of old age. But be not now wroth with me for this, nor full of indignation, because at the first, when I saw thee, I did not thus give thee welcome.<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />For always the heart in my breast was full of dread, lest some man should come and beguile me with his words; for there are many that plan devices of evil. Nay, even Argive Helen, daughter of Zeus, would not have lain in love with a man of another folk,<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />had she known that the warlike sons of the Achaeans were to bring her home again to her dear native land. Yet verily in her case a god prompted her to work a shameful deed; nor until then did she lay up in her mind the thought of that folly, the grievous folly from which at the first sorrow came upon us too.<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />But now, since thou hast told the clear tokens of our bed, which no mortal beside has ever seen save thee and me alone and one single handmaid, the daughter of Actor, whom my father gave me or ever I came hither, even her who kept the doors of our strong bridal chamber,<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />lo, thou dost convince my heart, unbending as it is.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="231" type="card">
                    <p>
So she spoke, and in his heart aroused yet more the desire for lamentation; and he wept, holding in his arms his dear and true-hearted wife. And welcome as is the sight of land to men that swim, whose well-built ship Poseidon<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />has smitten on the sea as it was driven on by the wind and the swollen wave, and but few have made their escape from the gray sea to the shore by swimming, and thickly are their bodies crusted with brine, and gladly have they set foot on the land and escaped from their evil case; even so welcome to her was her husband, as she gazed upon him,<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />and from his neck she could in no wise let her white arms go. And now would the rosy-fingered Dawn have arisen upon their weeping, had not the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, taken other counsel. The long night she held back at the end of its course, and likewise stayed the golden-throned Dawn at the streams of Oceanus, and would not suffer her<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />to yoke her swift-footed horses that bring light to men, Lampus and Phaethon, who are the colts that bear the Dawn. 
Then to his wife said Odysseus of many wiles: “Wife, we have not yet come to the end of all our trials, but still hereafter there is to be measureless toil,<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />long and hard, which I must fulfil to the end; for so did the spirit of Teiresias foretell to me on the day when I went down into the house of Hades to enquire concerning the return of my comrades and myself. But come, wife, let us to bed, that<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />lulled now by sweet slumber we may take our joy of rest.”
Then wise Penelope answered him: “Thy bed shall be ready for thee whensoever thy heart shall desire it, since the gods have indeed caused thee to come back to thy well-built house and thy native land.<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />But since thou hast bethought thee of this, and a god has put it into thy heart, come, tell me of this trial, for in time to come, methinks, I shall learn of it, and to know it at once is no whit worse.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="263" type="card">
                    <p>
And Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Strange lady! why dost thou now so urgently bid me<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />tell thee? Yet I will declare it, and will hide nothing. Verily thy heart shall have no joy of it, even as I myself have none; for Teiresias bade me go forth to full many cities of men, bearing a shapely oar in my hands, till I should come<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />to men that know naught of the sea, and eat not of food mingled with salt; aye, and they know naught of ships with purple cheeks, or of shapely oars that serve as wings to ships. And he told me this sign, right manifest; nor will I hide it from thee. When another wayfarer, on meeting me,<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />should say that I had a winnowing fan on my stout shoulder, then he bade me fix my oar in the earth, and make goodly offerings to lord Poseidon—a ram and a bull and a boar, that mates with sows—and depart for my home, and offer sacred hecatombs<milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />to the immortal gods, who hold broad heaven, to each one in due order. And death shall come to me myself far from the sea, a death so gentle, that shall lay me low, when I am overcome with sleek old age, and my people shall dwell in prosperity around me. All this, he said, should I see fulfilled.”
<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />Then wise Penelope answered him: “If verily the gods are to bring about for thee a happier old age, there is hope then that thou wilt find an escape from evil.”
Thus they spoke to one another; and meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse made ready the bed<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />of soft coverlets by the light of blazing torches. But when they had busily spread the stout-built bedstead, the old nurse went back to her chamber to lie down, and Eurynome, the maiden of the bedchamber, led them on their way to the couch with a torch in her hands;<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />and when she had led them to the bridal chamber, she went back. And they then gladly came to the place of the couch that was theirs of old. But Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd stayed their feet from dancing, and stayed the women, and themselves lay down to sleep throughout the shadowy halls.
<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />But when the two had had their fill of the joy of love, they took delight in tales, speaking each to the other. She, the fair lady, told of all that she had endured in the halls, looking upon the destructive throng of the wooers, who for her sake<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />slew many beasts, cattle and goodly sheep; and great store of wine was drawn from the jars. But Zeus-born Odysseus recounted all the woes that he had brought on men, and all the toil that in his sorrow he had himself endured, and she was glad to listen, nor did sweet sleep fall upon her eyelids, till he had told all the tale.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />He began by telling how at the first he overcame the Cicones, and then came to the rich land of the Lotus-eaters, and all that the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> wrought, and how he made him pay the price for his mighty comrades, whom the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> had eaten, and had shown no pity. Then how he came to Aeolus, who received him with a ready heart,<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />and sent him on his way; but it was not yet his fate to come to his dear native land, nay, the storm-wind caught him up again, and bore him over the teeming deep, groaning heavily. Next how he came to Telepylus of the Laestrygonians, who destroyed his ships and his well-greaved comrades<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />one and all, and Odysseus alone escaped in his black ship. Then he told of all the wiles and craftiness of Circe, and how in his benched ship he had gone to the dank house of Hades to consult the spirit of Theban Teiresias, and had seen all his comrades<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />and the mother who bore him and nursed him, when a child. And how he heard the voice of the Sirens, who sing unceasingly, and had come to the Wandering Rocks, and to dread Charybdis, and to Scylla, from whom never yet had men escaped unscathed. Then how his comrades slew the kine of Helios,<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />and how Zeus, who thunders on high, smote his swift ship with a flaming thunderbolt, and his goodly comrades perished all together, while he alone escaped the evil fates. And how he came to the isle Ogygia and to the nymph Calypso, who kept him there<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />in her hollow caves, yearning that he should be her husband, and tended him, and said that she would make him immortal and ageless all his days; yet she could never persuade the heart in his breast. Then how he came after many toils to the Phaeacians, who heartily showed him all honor, as if he were a god,<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />and sent him in a ship to his dear native land, after giving him stores of bronze and gold and raiment. This was the end of the tale he told, when sweet sleep, that loosens the limbs of men, leapt upon him, loosening the cares of his heart.</p>

Then again the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel.<milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />When she judged that the heart of Odysseus had had its fill of dalliance with his wife and of sleep, straightway she roused from Oceanus golden-throned Dawn to bring light to men; and Odysseus rose from his soft couch, and gave charge to his wife, saying:
<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />“Wife, by now have we had our fill of many trials, thou and I, thou here, mourning over my troublous journey home, while as for me, Zeus and the other gods bound me fast in sorrows far from my native land, all eager as I was to return. But now that we have both come to the couch of our desire,<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />do thou care for the wealth that I have within the halls; as for the flocks which the insolent wooers have wasted, I shall myself get me many as booty, and others will the Achaeans give, until they fill all my folds; but I verily will go to my well-wooded farm<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />to see my noble father, who for my sake is sore distressed, and on thee, wife, do I lay this charge, wise though thou art. Straightway at the rising of the sun will report go abroad concerning the wooers whom I slew in the halls. Therefore go thou up to thy upper chamber with thy handmaids,<milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />and abide there. Look thou on no man, nor ask a question.”
He spoke, and girt about his shoulders his beautiful armour, and roused Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd, and bade them all take weapons of war in their hands. They did not disobey, but clad themselves in bronze,<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />and opened the doors, and went forth, and Odysseus led the way. By now there was light over the earth, but Athena hid them in night, and swiftly led them forth from the city.</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="1" unit="line" />Meanwhile Cyllenian Hermes called forth the spirits of the wooers. He held in his hands his wand, a fair wand of gold, wherewith he lulls to sleep the eyes of whom he will, while others again he wakens even out of slumber;<milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line" />with this he roused and led the spirits, and they followed gibbering. And as in the innermost recess of a wondrous cave bats flit about gibbering, when one has fallen from off the rock from the chain in which they cling to one another, so these went with him gibbering, and <milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line" />Hermes, the Helper, led them down the dank ways. Past the streams of Oceanus they went, past the rock <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leucas</placeName>, past the gates of the sun and the land of dreams, and quickly came to the mead of asphodel, where the spirits dwell, phantoms of men who have done with toils.<milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line" />Here they found the spirit of Achilles, son of Peleus, and those of Patroclus, of peerless Antilochus, and of Aias, who in comeliness and form was the goodliest of all the Danaans after the peerless son of Peleus.
So these were thronging about Achilles, and near to them<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line" />drew the spirit of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, sorrowing; and round about him others were gathered, the spirits of all those who were slain with him in the house of Aegisthus, and met their fate. And the spirit of the son of Peleus was first to address him, saying: 
“Son of Atreus, we deemed that thou<milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line" />above all other heroes wast all thy days dear to Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt, because thou wast lord over many mighty men in the land of the Trojans, where we Achaeans suffered woes. But verily on thee too was deadly doom to come all too early, the doom that not one avoids of those who are born.<milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line" />Ah, would that in the pride of that honor of which thou wast master thou hadst met death and fate in the land of the Trojans. Then would the whole host of the Achaeans have made thee a tomb, and for thy son too wouldst thou have won great glory in days to come; but now, as it seems, it has been decreed that thou shouldst be cut off by a most piteous death.”</p>

                        <milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line" />Then the spirit of the son of Atreus answered him: “Fortunate son of Peleus, godlike Achilles, that wast slain in the land of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> far from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and about thee others fell, the best of the sons of the Trojans and Achaeans, fighting for thy body; and thou in the whirl of dust<milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line" />didst lie mighty in thy mightiness, forgetful of thy horsemanship. We on our part strove the whole day long, nor should we ever have stayed from the fight, had not Zeus stayed us with a storm. But after we had borne thee to the ships from out the fight, we laid thee on a bier, and cleansed thy fair flesh<milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line" />with warm water and with ointment, and many hot tears did the Danaans shed around thee, and they shore their hair. And thy mother came forth from the sea with the immortal sea-nymphs, when she heard the tidings, and a wondrous cry arose over the deep, and thereat trembling laid hold of all the Achaeans.<milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line" />Then would they all have sprung up and rushed to the hollow ships, had not a man, wise in the wisdom of old, stayed them, even Nestor, whose counsel had before appeared the best. He with good intent addressed their assembly, and said:
“‘Hold, ye Argives; flee not, Achaean youths.<milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line" />'Tis his mother who comes here forth from the sea with the immortal sea-nymphs to look upon the face of her dead son.’
“So he spoke, and the great-hearted Achaeans ceased from their flight. Then around thee stood the daughters of the old man of the sea wailing piteously, and they clothed thee about with immortal raiment.<milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line" />And the Muses, nine in all, replying to one another with sweet voices, led the dirge. There couldst thou not have seen an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> but was in tears, so deeply did the clear-toned Muse move their hearts. Thus for seventeen days alike by night and day did we bewail thee, immortal gods and mortal men,<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line" />and on the eighteenth we gave thee to the fire, and many well-fatted sheep we slew around thee and sleek kine. So thou wast burned in the raiment of the gods and in abundance of unguents and sweet honey; and many Achaean warriors moved in their armour about the pyre, when thou wast burning,<milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line" />both footmen and charioteers, and a great din arose. But when the flame of Hephaestus had made an end of thee, in the morning we gathered thy white bones, Achilles, and laid them in unmixed wine and unguents. Thy mother had given a two-handled, golden urn, and<milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line" />said that it was the gift of Dionysus, and the handiwork of famed Hephaestus. In this lie thy white bones, glorious Achilles, and mingled with them the bones of the dead Patroclus, son of Menoetius, but apart lie those of Antilochus, whom thou didst honor above all the rest of thy comrades after the dead Patroclus.<milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line" />And over them we heaped up a great and goodly tomb, we the mighty host of <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> spearmen, on a projecting headland by the broad <placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, that it might be seen from far over the sea both by men that now are and that shall be born hereafter.</p>

                        <note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> but hadst thou seen that sight thou wouldst most have marvelled at heart, such beautiful prizes did the goddess, silver-footed Thetis, set there in thy honor; for very dear wast thou to the gods.

For on my return Zeus devised for me a woeful doom at the hands of Aegisthus and my accursed wife.”
Thus they spoke to one another, but the messenger, Argeiphontes, drew near,<milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line" />leading down the spirits of the wooers slain by Odysseus; and the two, seized with wonder, went straight toward them when they beheld them. And the spirit of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, recognized the dear son of Melaneus, glorious Amphimedon, who had been his host, dwelling in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>.<milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line" />Then the spirit of the son of Atreus spoke first to him and said 
“Amphimedon, what has befallen you that ye have come down beneath the dark earth, all of you picked men and of like age? One would make no other choice, were one to pick the best men in a city. Did Poseidon smite you on board your ships,<milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line" />when he had roused cruel winds and long waves? Or did foemen work you harm on the land, while you were cutting off their cattle and fair flocks of sheep, or while they fought in defence of their city and their women? Tell me what I ask; for I declare that I am a friend of thy house.<milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line" />Dost thou not remember when I came thither to your house with godlike Menelaus to urge Odysseus to go with us to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilios</placeName> on the benched ships? A full month it took us to cross all the wide sea, for hardly could we win to our will Odysseus, the sacker of cities.”
<milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line" />Then the spirit of Amphimedon answered him, and said: “Most glorious son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, I remember all these things, O thou fostered of Zeus, even as thou dost tell them; and on my part I will frankly tell thee all the truth, how for us an evil end of death was wrought.<milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line" />We wooed the wife of Odysseus, that had long been gone, and she neither refused the hateful marriage, nor would she ever make an end, devising for us death and black fate. Nay, she contrived in her heart this guileful thing also: she set up in her halls a great web, and fell to weaving—<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line" />fine of thread was the web and very wide; and straightway she spoke among us:
“‘Young men, my wooers, since goodly Odysseus is dead, be patient, though eager for my marriage, until I finish this robe—I would not that my spinning should come to naught—a shroud for the lord Laertes against the time when<milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line" />the fell fate of grievous death shall strike him down; lest any of the Achaean women in the land should be wroth at me, if he were to lie without a shroud, who had won great possessions.’</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="138" type="card">
                    <p>
“So she spoke, and our proud hearts consented. Then day by day she would weave at the great web,<milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line" />but by night would unravel it, when she had let place torches by her. Thus for three years she by her craft kept the Achaeans from knowing, and beguiled them; but when the fourth year came, as the seasons rolled on, as the months waned and many days were brought in their course, even then one of her women who knew all, told us,<milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line" />and we caught her unravelling the splendid web. So she finished it against her will perforce.
“Now when she had shewn us the robe, after weaving the great web and washing it, and it shone like the sun or the moon, then it was that some cruel god brought Odysseus from somewhere<milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line" />to the border of the land, where the swineherd dwelt. Thither too came the dear son of divine Odysseus on his return from sandy <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> in his black ship, and these two, when they had planned an evil death for the wooers, came to the famous city, Odysseus verily<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line" />later, but Telemachus led the way before him. Now the swineherd brought his master, clad in mean raiment, in the likeness of a woeful and aged beggar, leaning on a staff, and miserable was the raiment that he wore about his body; and not one of us could know that it was he,<milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line" />when he appeared so suddenly, no, not even those that were older men, but we assailed him with evil words and with missiles. Howbeit he with steadfast heart endured for a time to be pelted and taunted in his own halls; but when at last the will of Zeus, who bears the aegis, roused him,<milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line" />with the help of Telemachus he took all the beautiful arms and laid them away in the store-room and made fast the bolts. Then in his great cunning he bade his wife set before the wooers his bow and the grey iron to be a contest for us ill-fated men and the beginning of death.<milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line" />And no man of us was able to stretch the string of the mighty bow; nay, we fell far short of that strength. But when the great bow came to the hands of Odysseus, then we all cried out aloud not to give him the bow, how much soever he might speak;<milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line" />but Telemachus alone urged him on, and bade him take it. Then he took the bow in his hand, the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus, and with ease did he string it and send an arrow through the iron. Then he went and stood on the threshold, and poured out the swift arrows, glaring about him terribly, and smote king Antinous.<milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line" />And thereafter upon the others he with sure aim let fly his shafts, fraught with groanings, and the men fell thick and fast. Then was it known that some god was their helper; for straightway rushing on through the halls in their fury they slew men left and right, and therefrom rose hideous groaning,<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line" />as heads were smitten, and all the floor swam with blood. Thus we perished, Agamemnon, and even now our bodies still lie uncared-for in the halls of Odysseus; for our friends in each man's home know naught as yet—our friends who might wash the black blood from our wounds<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line" />and lay our bodies out with wailing; for that is the due of the dead.”</p>

                <div2 n="191" type="card">
                    <p>
Then the spirit of the son of Atreus answered him: “Happy son of Laertes, Odysseus of many devices, of a truth full of all excellence was the wife thou didst win, so good of understanding was peerless Penelope,<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line" />daughter of Icarius, in that she was loyally mindful of Odysseus, her wedded husband. Therefore the fame of her virtue shall never perish, but the immortals shall make among men on earth a pleasant song in honor of constant Penelope. Not on this wise did the daughter of Tyndareus devise evil deeds<milestone ed="p" n="200" unit="line" />and slay her wedded husband, and hateful shall the song regarding her be among men, and evil repute doth she bring upon all womankind, even upon her that doeth uprightly.”
Thus the two spoke to one another, as they stood in the house of Hades beneath the depths of the earth.
<milestone ed="p" n="205" unit="line" />But Odysseus and his men, when they had gone down from the city, quickly came to the fair and well-ordered farm of Laertes, which he had won for himself in days past, and much had he toiled for it.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> There was his house, and all about it ran the sheds in which ate, and sat, and slept<milestone ed="p" n="210" unit="line" />the servants that were bondsmen, that did his pleasure; but within it was an old Sicilian woman, who tended the old man with kindly care there at the farm, far from the city. Then Odysseus spoke to the servants and to his son, saying:
“Do you now go within the well-built house,<milestone ed="p" n="215" unit="line" />and straightway slay for dinner the best of the swine; but I will make trial of my father, and see whether he will recognize me and know me by sight, or whether he will fail to know me, since I have been gone so long a time.”
So saying, he gave to the slaves his battle-gear.<milestone ed="p" n="220" unit="line" />They thereafter went quickly to the house; but Odysseus drew near to the fruitful vineyard in his quest. Now he did not find Dolius as he went down into the great orchard, nor any of his slaves or of his sons, but as it chanced<milestone ed="p" n="225" unit="line" />they had gone to gather stones for the vineyard wall, and the old man was their leader. But he found his father alone in the well-ordered vineyard, digging about a plant; and he was clothed in a foul tunic, patched and wretched, and about his shins he had bound stitched greaves of ox-hide to guard against scratches,<milestone ed="p" n="230" unit="line" />and he wore gloves upon his hands because of the thorns, and on his head a goatskin cap; and he nursed his sorrow.</p>

                <div2 n="232" type="card">
                    <p>
Now when the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus saw him, worn with old age and laden with great grief at heart, he stood still beneath a tall pear tree, and shed tears.<milestone ed="p" n="235" unit="line" />Then he debated in mind and heart whether to kiss and embrace his father, and tell him all, how he had returned and come to his native land, or whether he should first question him, and prove him in each thing. And, as he pondered, this seemed to him the better course,<milestone ed="p" n="240" unit="line" />to prove him first with mocking words. So with this in mind the goodly Odysseus went straight toward him. He verily was holding his head down, digging about a plant, and his glorious son came up to him, and addressed him, saying:
“Old man, no lack of skill hast thou to tend<milestone ed="p" n="245" unit="line" />a garden; nay, thy care is good, and there is naught whatsoever, either plant or fig tree, or vine, nay, or olive, or pear, or garden-plot in all the field that lacks care. But another thing will I tell thee, and do thou not lay up wrath thereat in thy heart: thou thyself enjoyest no good care, but<milestone ed="p" n="250" unit="line" />thou bearest woeful old age, and therewith art foul and unkempt, and clad in mean raiment. Surely it is not because of sloth on thy part that thy master cares not for thee, nor dost thou seem in any wise like a slave to look upon either in form or in stature; for thou art like a king, even like one who, when he has bathed and eaten,<milestone ed="p" n="255" unit="line" />should sleep soft; for this is the way of old men. But come, tell me this, and declare it truly. Whose slave art thou, and whose orchard dost thou tend? And tell me this also truly, that I may know full well, whether this is indeed <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, to which we are now come, as<milestone ed="p" n="260" unit="line" />a man yonder told me, who met me but now on my way hither. In no wise over sound of wit was he, for he deigned not to tell me of each thing, nor to listen to my word, when I questioned him about a friend of mine, whether haply he still lives, or is now dead and in the house of Hades.<milestone ed="p" n="265" unit="line" />For I will tell thee, and do thou give heed and hearken. I once entertained in my dear native land a man that came to our house, and never did any man beside of strangers that dwell afar come to my house a more welcome guest. He declared that by lineage he came from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and said<milestone ed="p" n="270" unit="line" />that his own father was Laertes, son of Arceisius. So I took him to the house and gave him entertainment with kindly welcome of the rich store that was within, and I gave him gifts of friendship, such as are meet. Of well-wrought gold<milestone ed="p" n="275" unit="line" />I gave him seven talents, and a mixing-bowl all of silver, embossed with flowers, and twelve cloaks of single fold, and as many coverlets, and as many fair mantles, and as many tunics besides, and furthermore women, skilled in goodly handiwork, four comely women, whom he himself was minded to choose.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="280" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="280" unit="line" />Then his father answered him, weeping: “Stranger, verily thou art come to the country of which thou dost ask, but wanton and reckless men now possess it. And all in vain didst thou bestow those gifts, the countless gifts thou gavest. For if thou hadst found him yet alive in the land of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>,<milestone ed="p" n="285" unit="line" />then would he have sent thee on thy way with ample requital of gifts and good entertainment; for that is the due of him who begins the kindness But come, tell me this, and declare it truly. How many years have passed since thou didst entertain that guest, that hapless guest, my son—as sure as ever such a man there was—<milestone ed="p" n="290" unit="line" />my ill-starred son, whom far from his friends and his native land haply the fishes have devoured in the deep, or on the shore he has become the spoil of beasts and birds? Nor did his mother deck him for burial and weep over him, nor his father, we who gave him birth, no, nor did his wife, wooed with many gifts,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> constant Penelope,<milestone ed="p" n="295" unit="line" />bewail her own husband upon the bier, as was meet, when she had closed his eyes in death; though that is the due of the dead. And tell me this also truly, that I may know full well. Who art thou among men, and from whence? Where is thy city, and where thy parents? Where is the swift ship moored that brought thee hither<milestone ed="p" n="300" unit="line" />with thy godlike comrades? Or didst thou come as a passenger on another's ship, and did they depart when they had set thee on shore?” 
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Then verily will I frankly tell thee all. I come from Alybas, where I have a glorious house,<milestone ed="p" n="305" unit="line" />and I am the son of Apheidas, son of lord Polypemon, and my own name is Eperitus. But a god drove me wandering from Sicania to come hither against my will and my ship lies yonder off the tilled land away from the city. But as for Odysseus, it is now the fifth year<milestone ed="p" n="310" unit="line" />since he went thence, and departed from my country. Hapless man! Yet he had birds of good omen, when he set out, birds upon the right. So I was glad of them, as I sent him on his way, and he went gladly forth, and our hearts hoped that we should yet meet as host and guest and give one another glorious gifts.”
<milestone ed="p" n="315" unit="line" />So he spoke, and a dark cloud of grief enwrapped Laertes, and with both his hands he took the dark dust and strewed it over his grey head with ceaseless groaning. Then the heart of Odysseus was stirred, and up through his nostrils<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">2</note> shot a keen pang, as he beheld his dear father.<milestone ed="p" n="320" unit="line" />And he sprang toward him, and clasped him in his arms, and kissed him, saying:
“Lo, father, I here before thee, my very self, am that man of whom thou dost ask; I am come in the twentieth year to my native land. But cease from grief and tearful lamenting, for I will tell thee all, though great is the need of haste.<milestone ed="p" n="325" unit="line" />The wooers have I slain in our halls, and have taken vengeance on their grievous insolence and their evil deeds.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="327" type="card">
                    <p>
Then Laertes answered him again, and said: “If it is indeed as Odysseus, my son, that thou art come hither, tell me now some clear sign, that I maybe sure.”
<milestone ed="p" n="330" unit="line" />And Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said: “This scar first do thou mark with thine eyes, the scar of the wound which a boar dealt me with his white tusk on <placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, when I had gone thither. It was thou that didst send me forth, thou and my honored mother, to Autolycus, my mother's father, that I might get<milestone ed="p" n="335" unit="line" />the gifts which, when he came hither, he promised and agreed to give me. And come, I will tell thee also the trees in the well-ordered garden which once thou gavest me, and I, who was but a child, was following thee through the garden, and asking thee for this and that. It was through these very trees that we passed, and thou didst name them, and tell me of each one.<milestone ed="p" n="340" unit="line" />Pear-trees thirteen thou gavest me, and ten apple-trees, and forty fig-trees. And rows of vines too didst thou promise to give me, even as I say, fifty of them, which ripened severally at different times—and upon them are clusters of all sorts—whensoever the seasons of Zeus weighed them down from above.”<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="345" unit="line" />So he spoke, and his father's knees were loosened where he stood, and his heart melted, as he knew the sure tokens which Odysseus told him. About his dear son he flung both his arms, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus caught him unto him fainting. But when he revived, and his spirit returned again into his breast,<milestone ed="p" n="350" unit="line" />once more he made answer, and spoke, saying:
“Father Zeus, verily ye gods yet hold sway on high <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, if indeed the wooers have paid the price of their wanton insolence. But now I have wondrous dread at heart, lest straightway all the men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> come hither against us, and<milestone ed="p" n="355" unit="line" />send messengers everywhere to the cities of the Cephallenians.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Be of good cheer, and let not these things distress thy heart. But let us go to the house, which lies near the orchard, for thither<milestone ed="p" n="360" unit="line" />I sent forward Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd, that with all speed they might prepare our meal.”
So spoke the two, and went their way to the goodly house. And when they had come to the stately house, they found Telemachus, and the neatherd, and the swineherd carving flesh in abundance, and mixing the flaming wine.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="365" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="365" unit="line" />Meanwhile the Sicilian handmaid bathed great-hearted Laertes in his house, and anointed him with oil, and about him cast a fair cloak. But Athena drew near, and made greater the limbs of the shepherd of the people, and made him taller than before and mightier to behold.<milestone ed="p" n="370" unit="line" />Then he came forth from the bath, and his dear son marvelled at him, seeing him in presence like unto the immortal gods. And he spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
“Father, surely some one of the gods that are forever has made thee goodlier to behold in comeliness and in stature.”
<milestone ed="p" n="375" unit="line" />Then wise Laertes answered him: “I would, O father Zeus, and Athena, and Apollo, that in such strength as when I took Nericus, the well built citadel on the shore of the mainland, when I was lord of the Cephallenians, even in such strength I had stood by thy side yesterday in our house<milestone ed="p" n="380" unit="line" />with my armour about my shoulders, and had beaten back the wooers. So should I have loosened the knees of many of them in the halls, and thy heart would have been made glad within thee.”
So they spoke to one another. But when the others had ceased from their labour, and had made ready the meal,<milestone ed="p" n="385" unit="line" />they sat down in order on the chairs and high seats. Then they were about to set hands to their food, when the old man Dolius drew near, and with him the old man's sons, wearied from their work in the fields, for their mother, the old Sicilian woman, had gone forth and called them, she who<milestone ed="p" n="390" unit="line" />saw to their food, and tended the old man with kindly care, now that old age had laid hold of him. And they, when they saw Odysseus, and marked him in their minds, stood in the halls lost in wonder. But Odysseus addressed them with gentle words, and said:
“Old man, sit down to dinner, and do ye wholly forget your wonder,<milestone ed="p" n="395" unit="line" />for long have we waited in the halls, though eager to set hands to the food, ever expecting your coming.”
So he spoke, and Dolius ran straight toward him with both hands outstretched, and he clasped the hand of Odysseus and kissed it on the wrist, and spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
<milestone ed="p" n="400" unit="line" />“Dear master, since thou hast come back to us, who sorely longed for thee, but had no more thought to see thee, and the gods themselves have brought thee—hail to thee, and all welcome, and may the gods grant thee happiness. And tell me this also truly, that I may know full well. Does wise Penelope yet know surely<milestone ed="p" n="405" unit="line" />that thou hast come back hither, or shall we send her a messenger?”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Old man, she knows already; why shouldst thou be busied with this?”
So he spoke, and the other sat down again on the polished chair. And even in like manner the sons of Dolius gathered around glorious Odysseus<milestone ed="p" n="410" unit="line" />and greeted him in speech, and clasped his hands. Then they sat down in order beside Dolius, their father.</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="412" type="card">
                    <p>
So they were busied with their meal in the halls; but meanwhile Rumor, the messenger, went swiftly throughout all the city, telling of the terrible death and fate of the wooers.<milestone ed="p" n="415" unit="line" />And the people heard it all at once, and gathered from every side with moanings and wailings before the palace of Odysseus. Forth from the halls they brought each his dead, and buried them; and those from other cities they sent each to his own home, placing them on swift ships for seamen to bear them,<milestone ed="p" n="420" unit="line" />but they themselves went together to the place of assembly, sad at heart. Now when they were assembled and met together Eupeithes arose and spoke among them, for comfortless grief for his son lay heavy on his heart, even for Antinous, the first man whom goodly Odysseus had slain.<milestone ed="p" n="425" unit="line" />Weeping for him he addressed their assembly and said:
“Friends, a monstrous deed has this man of a truth devised against the Achaeans. Some he led forth in his ships, many men and goodly, and he has lost his hollow ships and utterly lost his men; and others again has he slain on his return, and these by far the best of the Cephallenians.<milestone ed="p" n="430" unit="line" />Nay then, come, before the fellow goes swiftly to <placeName key="tgn,7011036">Pylos</placeName> or to goodly <placeName key="tgn,5001986">Elis</placeName>, where the Epeans hold sway, let us go forth; verily even in days to come shall we be disgraced forever. For a shame is this even for men that are yet to be to hear of, if we shall not<milestone ed="p" n="435" unit="line" />take vengeance on the slayers of our sons and our brothers. To me surely life would then no more be sweet; rather would I die at once and be among the dead. Nay, let us forth, lest they be too quick for us, and cross over the sea.”
So he spoke, weeping, and pity laid hold of all the Achaeans. Then near them came Medon and the divine minstrel<milestone ed="p" n="440" unit="line" />from the halls of Odysseus, for sleep had released them; and they took their stand in the midst, and wonder seized every man. Then Medon, wise of heart, spoke among them:
“Hearken now to me, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, for verily not without the will of the immortal gods has Odysseus devised these deeds.<milestone ed="p" n="445" unit="line" />Nay, I myself saw an immortal god, who stood close beside Odysseus, and seemed in all things like unto Mentor. Yet as an immortal god now in front of Odysseus would he appear, heartening him, and now again would rage through the hall, scaring the wooers; and they fell thick and fast.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="450" type="card">
                    <p>
                        <milestone ed="p" n="450" unit="line" />So he spoke, and thereat pale fear seized them all. Then among them spoke the old lord Halitherses, son of Mastor, for he alone saw before and after: he with good intent addressed their assembly, and said:
“Hearken now to me, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, to the word that I shall say.<milestone ed="p" n="455" unit="line" />Through your own cowardice, friends, have these deeds been brought to pass, for you would not obey me, nor Mentor, shepherd of the people, to make your sons cease from their folly. They wrought a monstrous deed in their blind and wanton wickedness, wasting the wealth and dishonoring the wife<milestone ed="p" n="460" unit="line" />of a prince, who, they said, would never more return. Now then be it thus; and do you hearken to me, as I bid. Let us not go forth, lest haply many a one shall find a bane which he has brought upon himself.”
So he spoke, but they sprang up with loud cries, more than half of them, but the rest remained together in their seats;<milestone ed="p" n="465" unit="line" />for his speech was not to their mind, but they hearkened to Eupeithes, and quickly thereafter they rushed for their arms. Then when they had clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze, they gathered together in front of the spacious city. And Eupeithes led them in his folly,<milestone ed="p" n="470" unit="line" />for he thought to avenge the slaying of his son; yet he was himself never more to come back, but was there to meet his doom.
But Athena spoke to Zeus, son of Cronos, saying: “Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high above all lords, tell to me that ask thee what purpose thy mind now hides within thee.<milestone ed="p" n="475" unit="line" />Wilt thou yet further bring to pass evil war and the dread din of battle, or wilt thou establish friendship betwixt the twain?”
Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her, and said: “My child, why dost thou ask and question me of this? Didst thou not thyself devise this plan,<milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line" />that verily Odysseus should take vengeance on these men at his coming? Do as thou wilt, but I will tell thee what is fitting. Now that goodly Odysseus has taken vengeance on the wooers, let them swear a solemn oath, and let him be king all his days, and let us on our part<milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line" />bring about a forgetting of the slaying of their sons and brothers; and let them love one another as before, and let wealth and peace abound.”
So saying, he roused Athena, who was already eager, and she went darting down from the heights of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>.
But when they had put from them the desire of honey-hearted food,<milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line" />the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was the first to speak among his company, saying: “Let one go forth and see whether they be not now drawing near.”
So he spoke, and a son of Dolius went forth, as he bade; he went and stood upon the threshold, and saw them all close at hand, and straightway he spoke to Odysseus winged words:<milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line" />“Here they are close at hand. Quick, let us arm.”</p>
                </div2>
                <div2 n="496" type="card">
                    <p>
So he spoke, and they rose up and arrayed themselves in armour: Odysseus and his men were four, and six the sons of Dolius, and among them Laertes and Dolius donned their armour, grey-headed though they were, warriors perforce.<milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line" />But when they had clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze, they opened the doors and went forth, and Odysseus led them.
Then Athena, daughter of Zeus, drew near them in the likeness of Mentor both in form and in voice, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was glad at sight of her,<milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line" />and straightway spoke to Telemachus, his dear son:
“Telemachus, now shalt thou learn this—having thyself come to the place of battle, where the best warriors are put to the trial—to bring no disgrace upon the house of thy fathers, for we have ever excelled in strength and in valor over all the earth.”
<milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line" />And wise Telemachus answered him: “Thou shalt see me, if thou wilt, dear father, in my present temper, bringing no disgrace upon thy house, even as thou sayest.”
So said he, and Laertes was glad, and spoke, saying: “What a day is this for me, kind gods!<milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line" />Verily right glad am I: my son and my son's son are vying with one another in valor.”
Then flashing-eyed Athena came near him and said: “Son of Arceisius, far the dearest of all my friends, make a prayer to the flashing-eyed maiden and to father Zeus, and then straightway raise aloft thy long spear, and hurl it.”
<milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line" />So spoke Pallas Athena, and breathed into him great might. Then he prayed to the daughter of great Zeus, and straightway raised aloft his long spear, and hurled it, and smote Eupeithes through the helmet with cheek-piece of bronze. This stayed not the spear, but the bronze passed through,<milestone ed="p" n="525" unit="line" />and he fell with a thud, and his armour clanged about him. Then on the foremost fighters fell Odysseus and his glorious son, and thrust at them with swords and double-pointed spears. And now would they have slain them all, and cut them off from returning, had not Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis,<milestone ed="p" n="530" unit="line" />shouted aloud, and checked all the host, saying:
“Refrain, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, from grievous war, that with all speed you may part, and that without bloodshed.”
So spoke Athena, and pale fear seized them. Then in their terror the arms flew from their hands<milestone ed="p" n="535" unit="line" />and fell one and all to the ground, as the goddess uttered her voice, and they turned toward the city, eager to save their lives. Terribly then shouted the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus, and gathering himself together he swooped upon them like an eagle of lofty flight, and at that moment the son of Cronos cast a flaming thunderbolt,<milestone ed="p" n="540" unit="line" />and down it fell before the flashing-eyed daughter of the mighty sire. Then flashing-eyed Athena spoke to Odysseus saying:
“Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, stay thy hand, and make the strife of equal<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">1</note> war to cease, lest haply the son of Cronos be wroth with thee, even Zeus, whose voice is borne afar.”
<milestone ed="p" n="545" unit="line" />So spoke Athena, and he obeyed, and was glad at heart. Then for all time to come a solemn covenant betwixt the twain was made by Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis, in the likeness of Mentor both in form and in voice.</p>
