<div1 type="Book" n="1">
<head>Scroll 1</head>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Tell
me, O Muse, of that many-sided hero who traveled far and wide 
after he had sacked the famous town of <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Troy</placeName>. Many cities did he visit, and
many were the people with whose customs and thinking
[<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] he was acquainted; many things he suffered at
sea while seeking to save his own life [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>]
and to achieve the safe homecoming [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] of his
companions; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they
perished through their own sheer recklessness in eating the cattle of
the Sun-god Helios; so the god prevented them from ever reaching
home. Tell me, as you have told those who came before me, about all
these things, O daughter of Zeus, starting from whatsoever point you
choose.</p>

<p><milestone n="11" unit="line"/>So now all who escaped death in
battle or by shipwreck had got safely home except Odysseus, and he,
though he was longing for his return [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] to his
wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got
him into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by,
there came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to
<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>; even then, however, when he was among his own people, his
trials [<term lang="xgreek">athloi</term>] were not yet over; nevertheless all
the gods had now begun to pity him except Poseidon, who still
persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get
home.</p>

<p><milestone n="22" unit="line"/>Now Poseidon had gone off to the
Ethiopians, who are at the world's end, and lie in two halves,
the one looking West and the other East. He had gone there to accept
a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying himself at his
festival; but the other gods met in the house of Olympian Zeus, and
the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment he was thinking
of Aigisthos, who had been killed by Agamemnon's son Orestes; so
he said to the other gods:</p>

<p><milestone n="32" unit="line"/>"See now, how men consider us gods
responsible [<term lang="xgreek">aitioi</term>] for what is after all nothing but
their own folly. Look at Aigisthos; he must needs make love to
Agamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though
he knew it would be the death of him; for I sent Hermes to warn him
not to do either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure
to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Hermes
told him this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he
has paid for everything in full."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="44">
<p><milestone n="44" unit="line"/>Then Athena said, "Father, son of
Kronos, King of kings, it served Aigisthos right, and so it would any
one else who does as he did; but Aigisthos is neither here nor there;
it is for Odysseus that my heart bleeds, when I think of his
sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island, far away, poor man, from
all his friends. It is an island covered with forest, in the very
middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there, daughter of the
magician Atlas, who looks after the bottom of the ocean, and carries
the great columns that keep heaven and earth asunder. This daughter
of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Odysseus, and keeps trying by
every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home, so that he is
tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the
smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take no heed of this, and yet
when Odysseus was before <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> did he not propitiate you with many a
burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so angry with
him?"</p>

<p><milestone n="63" unit="line"/>And Zeus said, "My child, what are
you talking about? How can I forget Odysseus than whom there is no
more capable man on earth [in regard to <term lang="xgreek">noos</term>], nor
more liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in
heaven? Bear in mind, however, that Poseidon is still furious with
Odysseus for having blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the
Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to Poseidon by the nymph Thoosa, daughter
to the sea-king Phorkys; therefore though he will not kill Odysseus
outright, he torments him by preventing him from his homecoming
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]. Still, let us lay our heads together and see
how we can help him to return; Poseidon will then be pacified, for if
we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us."</p>

<p><milestone n="80" unit="line"/>And Athena said, "Father, son of
Kronos, King of kings, if, then, the gods now mean that Odysseus
should get home, we should first send Hermes to the Ogygian island to
tell Calypso that we have made up our minds and that he is to have
his homecoming [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]. In the meantime I will go to
<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, to put heart into Odysseus' son Telemakhos; I will
embolden him to call the Achaeans in assembly, and speak out to the
suitors of his mother Penelope, who persist in eating up any number
of his sheep and oxen; I will also conduct him to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and to
<placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, to see if he can hear anything about the return
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] of his dear father - for this will give him
genuine fame [<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] throughout humankind."</p>

<p><milestone n="96" unit="line"/>So saying she bound on her
glittering golden sandals, imperishable, with which she can fly like
the wind over land or sea; she grasped the redoubtable bronze-shod
spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, wherewith she quells the ranks
of heroes who have displeased her, and down she darted from the
topmost summits of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, whereon forthwith she was in the
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, at the gateway of Odysseus' house,
disguised as a visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a
bronze spear in her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated
on hides of the oxen which they had killed and eaten, and playing
draughts in front of the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling
about to wait upon them, some mixing wine with water in the
mixing-bowls, some cleaning down the tables with wet sponges and
laying them out again, and some cutting up great quantities of
meat.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="113">
<p><milestone n="113" unit="line"/>Telemakhos saw her long before
any one else did. He was sitting moodily among the suitors thinking
about his brave father, and how he would send them fleeing out of the
house, if he were to come to his own again and be honored as in days
gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them, he caught sight of
Athena and went straight to the gate, for he was vexed that a
stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took her right
hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. "Welcome," said he,
"to our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall tell us
what you have come for."</p>

<p><milestone n="125" unit="line"/>He led the way as he spoke, and
Athena followed him. When they were within he took her spear and set
it in the spear - stand against a strong bearing-post along with the
many other spears of his unhappy father, and he conducted her to a
richly decorated seat under which he threw a cloth of damask. There
was a footstool also for her feet, and he set another seat near her
for himself, away from the suitors, that she might not be annoyed
while eating by their noise and insolence, and that he might ask her
more freely about his father.</p>

<p><milestone n="136" unit="line"/>A maid servant then brought them
water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin
for them to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them.
An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them many good
things of what there was in the house, the carver fetched them plates
of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side, and a
man-servant brought them wine and poured it out for them.</p>

<p><milestone n="144" unit="line"/>Then the suitors came in and took
their places on the benches and seats. Forthwith men servants poured
water over their hands, maids went round with the bread-baskets,
pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and they laid
their hands upon the good things that were before them. As soon as
they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted music and dancing,
which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet, so a servant
brought a lyre to Phemios, whom they compelled perforce to sing to
them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing Telemakhos
spoke low to Athena, with his head close to hers that no man might
hear.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="158">
<p><milestone n="158" unit="line"/>"I hope, sir," said he, "that you
will not be offended with what I am going to say. Singing comes cheap
to those who do not pay for it, and all this is done at the cost of
one whose bones lie rotting in some wilderness or grinding to powder
in the surf. If these men were to see my father come back to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>
they would pray for longer legs rather than a longer purse, for
wealth would not serve them; but he, alas, has fallen on an ill fate,
and even when people do sometimes say that he is coming, we no longer
heed them; we shall never see him again. And now, sir, tell me and
tell me true, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of your
town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how your crew
brought you to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and of what nation they declared themselves to
be - for you cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly, for I want
to know, are you a stranger to this house, or have you been here in
my father's time? In the old days we had many visitors for my
father went about much himself."</p>

<p><milestone n="178" unit="line"/>And Athena answered, "I will tell
you truly and particularly all about it. I am Mentes, son of
Anchialos, and I am King of the Taphians. I have come here with my
ship and crew, on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue being bound for
Temesa with a cargo of iron, and I shall bring back copper. As for my
ship, it lies over yonder off the open country away from the town, in
the harbor Rheithron under the wooded mountain Neritum. Our fathers
were friends before us, as old <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> will tell you, if you will go
and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes to town now, and
lives by himself in the country, faring hardly, with an old woman to
look after him and get his dinner for him, when he comes in tired
from pottering about his vineyard. They told me your father was at
home again, and that was why I came, but it seems the gods are still
keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on the mainland. It is
more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean, or a prisoner
among savages who are detaining him against his will. I am no seer
[<term lang="xgreek">mantis</term>], and know very little about omens, but I
speak as it is borne in upon me from heaven, and assure you that he
will not be away much longer; for he is a man of such resource that
even though he were in chains of iron he would find some means of
getting home again. But tell me, and tell me true, can Odysseus
really have such a fine looking young man for a son? You are indeed
wonderfully like him about the head and eyes, for we were close
friends before he set sail for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> where the flower of all the
Argives went also. Since that time we have never either of us seen
the other."</p>

<p><milestone n="214" unit="line"/>"My mother," answered Telemakhos,
"tells me I am son to Odysseus, but it is a wise child that knows his
own father. Would that I were son to one who had grown old upon his
own estates, for, since you ask me, there is no more ill-starred man
under heaven than he who they tell me is my father."</p>

<p><milestone n="223" unit="line"/>And Athena said, "There is no
fear of your race dying out yet, while Penelope has such a fine son
as you are. But tell me, and tell me true, what is the meaning of all
this feasting, and who are these people? What is it all about? Have
you some banquet, or is there a wedding in the family - for no one
seems to be bringing any provisions of his own? And the guests - how
atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make over the whole
house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person who comes near
them."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="230">
<p><milestone n="230" unit="line"/>"Sir," said Telemakhos, "as
regards your question, so long as my father was here it was well with
us and with the house, but the gods in their displeasure have willed
it otherwise, and have hidden him away more closely than mortal man
was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it better even though he were
dead, if he had fallen with his men in the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of
<placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, or had died with friends around him when the days of his
fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound
over his ashes, and I should myself have been heir to his renown
[<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>]; but now the storm-winds have spirited him
away we know not wither; he is gone without leaving so much as a
trace behind him, and I inherit nothing but dismay. Nor does the
matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father; heaven has
laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all our
islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of <placeName key="tgn,7011374">Zacynthus</placeName>, as
also all the principal men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself, are eating up my house
under the pretext of paying their court to my mother, who will
neither point blank say that she will not marry, nor yet bring
matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate, and before
long will do so also with myself."</p>

<p><milestone n="252" unit="line"/>"Is that so?" exclaimed Athena,
"then you do indeed want Odysseus home again. Give him his helmet,
shield, and a couple lances, and if he is the man he was when I first
knew him in our house, drinking and making merry, he would soon lay
his hands about these rascally suitors, were he to stand once more
upon his own threshold. He was then coming from <placeName key="perseus,Ephyra">Ephyra</placeName>, where he had
been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilos, son of Mermerus. Ilos
feared the ever-living gods and would not give him any, but my father
let him have some, for he was very fond of him. If Odysseus is the
man he then was these suitors will have a swift doom and a sorry
wedding.</p>

<p><milestone n="267" unit="line"/>"But there! It rests with heaven
to determine whether he is to return, and take his revenge in his own
house or no; I would, however, urge you to set about trying to get
rid of these suitors at once. Take my advice, call the Achaean heroes
in assembly tomorrow -lay your case before them, and call heaven to
bear you witness. Bid the suitors take themselves off, each to his
own place, and if your mother's mind is set on marrying again,
let her go back to her father, who will find her a husband and
provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a daughter may
expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you to take the best
ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and go in quest of your
father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you something,
or (and people often hear things in this way) some heaven-sent
message [<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] may direct you. First go to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> and
ask Nestor; thence go on to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and visit Menelaos, for he got
home last of all the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive
and about to achieve his homecoming [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>], you can
put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet another twelve
months. If on the other hand you hear of his death, come home at
once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a grave
marker [<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>] to his memory, and make your
mother marry again. Then, having done all this, think it well over in
your mind how, by fair means or foul, you may kill these suitors in
your own house. You are too old to plead infancy any longer; have you
not heard how people are singing Orestes' praises
[<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] for having killed his father's murderer
Aigisthos? You are a fine, smart looking young man; show your mettle,
then, and make yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must go back
to my ship and to my crew, who will be impatient if I keep them
waiting longer; think the matter over for yourself, and remember what
I have said to you."</p>

<p><milestone n="306" unit="line"/>"Sir," answered Telemakhos, "it
has been very kind of you to talk to me in this way, as though I were
your own son, and I will do all you tell me; I know you want to be
getting on with your voyage, but stay a little longer till you have
taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will then give you a present,
and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I will give you one of great
beauty and value - a keepsake such as only dear friends give to one
another."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="314">
<p><milestone n="314" unit="line"/>Athena answered, "Do not try to
keep me, for I would be on my way at once. As for any present you may
be disposed to make me, keep it till I come again, and I will take it
home with me. You shall give me a very good one, and I will give you
one of no less value in return."</p>

<p><milestone n="319" unit="line"/>With these words she flew away
like a bird into the air, but she had given Telemakhos courage, and
had made him think more than ever about his father. He felt the
change, wondered at it, and knew that the stranger had been a god, so
he went straight to where the suitors were sitting.</p>

<p><milestone n="325" unit="line"/>Phemios was still singing, and
his hearers sat rapt in silence as he told the baneful tale of the
homecoming [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and the ills Athena had
laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Ikarios, heard his song
from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not
alone, but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the
suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof
of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side of her. She held
a veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping
bitterly.</p>

<p><milestone n="337" unit="line"/>"Phemios," she cried, "you know
many another feat of gods and heroes, such as poets love to
celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these, and let them drink
their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for it breaks my
sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband for whom I have
grief [<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>] ever without ceasing, and whose name
[<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] was great over all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> and middle
<placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="345">
<p><milestone n="345" unit="line"/>"Mother," answered Telemakhos,
"let the bard sing what he has a mind [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] to; bards
are not responsible [<term lang="xgreek">aitios</term>] for the ills they sing
of; it is Zeus, not they, who is responsible [<term lang="xgreek">aitios</term>],
and who sends weal or woe upon humankind according to his own good
pleasure. There should be no feeling of <term lang="xgreek">nemesis</term> against this
one for singing the ill-fated return of the Danaans, for people
always favor most warmly the <term lang="xgreek">kleos</term> of the latest songs. Make
up your mind to it and bear it; Odysseus is not the only man who
never came back from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, but many another went down as well as he.
Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties,
your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for
speech is man's matter, and mine above all others - for it is I
who am master here."</p>

<p><milestone n="360" unit="line"/>She went wondering back into the
house, and laid her son's saying in her heart. Then, going
upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear
husband till Athena shed sweet sleep over her eyes. But the suitors
were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters, and prayed each one
that he might be her bed fellow.</p>

<p><milestone n="368" unit="line"/>Then Telemakhos spoke, "You
suitors of my mother," he cried, "you with your overweening
<term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>, let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be no
brawling, for it is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine
voice as Phemios has; but in the morning meet me in full assembly
that I may give you formal notice to depart, and feast at one
another's houses, turn and turn about, at your own cost. If on
the other hand you choose to persist in sponging upon one man, heaven
help me, but Zeus shall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in
my father's house there shall be no man to avenge
you."</p>

<p><milestone n="381" unit="line"/>The suitors bit their lips as
they heard him, and marveled at the boldness of his speech. Then,
Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, said, "The gods seem to have given you
lessons in bluster and tall talking; may Zeus never grant you to be
chief in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> as your father was before you."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="388">
<p><milestone n="388" unit="line"/>Telemakhos answered, "Antinoos,
do not chide with me, but, god willing, I will be chief too if I can.
Is this the worst fate you can think of for me? It is no bad thing to
be a chief, for it brings both riches and honor. Still, now that
Odysseus is dead there are many great men in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> both old and
young, and some other may take the lead among them; nevertheless I
will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom Odysseus has
won for me."</p>

<p><milestone n="399" unit="line"/>Then Eurymakhos, son of Polybos,
answered, "It rests with heaven to decide who shall be chief among
us, but you shall be master in your own house and over your own
possessions; no one while there is a man in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> shall do you
violence [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] nor rob you. And now, my good
man, I want to know about this stranger. What country does he come
from? Of what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought
you news about the return of your father, or was he on business of
his own? He seemed a well-to-do man, but he hurried off so suddenly
that he was gone in a moment before we could get to know
him."</p>

<p><milestone n="412" unit="line"/>"The <term lang="xgreek">nostos</term> of my father
is dead and gone," answered Telemakhos, "and even if some rumor
reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed
sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his
prophesying no heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of
Anchialos, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father's."
But in his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.</p>

<p><milestone n="421" unit="line"/>The suitors then returned to
their singing and dancing until the evening; but when night fell upon
their pleasuring they went home to bed each in his own abode.
Telemakhos' room was high up in a tower that looked on to the
outer court; there, then, he went, brooding and full of thought. A
good old woman, Eurykleia, daughter of Ops, the son of Pisenor, went
before him with a couple of blazing torches. <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> had bought her
with his own wealth when she was quite young; he gave the worth of
twenty oxen for her, and showed as much respect to her in his
household as he did to his own wedded wife, but he did not take her
to his bed for he feared his wife's resentment. She it was who
now lighted Telemakhos to his room, and she loved him better than any
of the other women in the house did, for she had nursed him when he
was a baby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon the
bed; as he took off his shirt he gave it to the good old woman, who
folded it tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side,
after which she went out, pulled the door to by a silver catch, and
drew the bolt home by means of the strap. But Telemakhos as he lay
covered with a woolen fleece kept thinking all night through of his
intended voyage and of the counsel that Athena had given him
<milestone n="444" unit="line"/>.</p>
</div2></div1>

<div1 type="Book" n="2">
<head>Scroll 2</head>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Now when the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemakhos rose and dressed himself. He
bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword about his
shoulder, and left his room looking like an immortal god. He at once
sent the criers round to call the people in assembly, so they called
them and the people gathered thereon; then, when they were got
together, he went to the place of assembly spear in hand - not alone,
for his two hounds went with him. Athena endowed him with a presence
of such divine comeliness [<term lang="xgreek">kharis</term>] that all marveled
at him as he went by, and when he took his place in his
father's seat even the oldest councilors made way for
him.</p>

<p><milestone n="15" unit="line"/>Aigyptios, a man bent double with
age, and of infinite experience, was the first to speak His son
Antiphos had gone with Odysseus to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilion</placeName>, land of noble steeds, but
the savage <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> had killed him when they were all shut up in the
cave, and had cooked his last dinner for him. He had three sons left,
of whom two still worked on their father's land, while the
third, Eurynomos, was one of the suitors; nevertheless their father
could not get over the loss of Antiphos, and was still weeping for
him when he began his speech.</p>

<p><milestone n="25" unit="line"/>"Men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>," he said, "hear my
words. From the day Odysseus left us there has been no meeting of our
councilors until now; who then can it be, whether old or young, that
finds it so necessary to convene us? Has he got wind of some host
approaching, and does he wish to warn us, or would he speak upon some
other matter of public moment? I am sure he is an excellent person,
and I hope Zeus will grant him his heart's desire."</p>

<p><milestone n="35" unit="line"/>Telemakhos took this speech as of
good omen and rose at once, for he was bursting with what he had to
say. He stood in the middle of the assembly and the good herald
Pisenor brought him his staff. Then, turning to Aigyptios, "Sir,"
said he, "it is I, as you will shortly learn, who have convened you,
for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I have not got wind of any
host approaching about which I would warn you, nor is there any
matter of public moment on which I would speak. My grievance is
purely personal, and turns on two great misfortunes which have fallen
upon my house. The first of these is the loss of my excellent father,
who was chief among all you here present, and was like a father to
every one of you; the second is much more serious, and ere long will
be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all the chief men among
you are pestering my mother to marry them against her will. They are
afraid to go to her father Ikarios, asking him to choose the one he
likes best, and to provide marriage gifts for his daughter, but day
by day they keep hanging about my father's house, sacrificing
our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving
so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate
can stand such recklessness; we have now no Odysseus to ward off harm
from our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never
all my days be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend
myself if I had power to do so, for I cannot stand such treatment any
longer; my house is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect,
therefore, to your own consciences and to public opinion. Fear, too,
the wrath [<term lang="xgreek">m&ecirc;nis</term>] of the gods, lest they should
be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Zeus and Themis, who
is the beginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold back,
my friends, and leave me singlehanded - unless it be that my brave
father Odysseus did some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now
avenge on me, by aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am
to be eaten out of house and home at all, I had rather you did the
eating yourselves, for I could then take action against you to some
purpose, and serve you with notices from house to house till I got
paid in full, whereas now I have no remedy."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="80">
<p><milestone n="80" unit="line"/>With this Telemakhos dashed his
staff to the ground and burst into tears. Every one was very sorry
for him, but they all sat still and no one ventured to make him an
angry answer, save only Antinoos, who spoke thus:</p>

<p><milestone n="85" unit="line"/>"Telemakhos, insolent braggart
that you are, how dare you try to throw the blame upon us suitors? We
are not the ones who are responsible [<term lang="xgreek">aitioi</term>] but your
mother is, for she knows many kinds of <term lang="xgreek">kerdos</term>. This three
years past, and close on four, she has been driving us out of our
minds, by encouraging each one of us, and sending him messages that
say one thing but her <term lang="xgreek">noos</term> means other things. And then there
was that other trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame
in her room, and began to work on an enormous piece of fine fabric.
&lsquo;Sweet hearts,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;Odysseus is indeed dead,
still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait - for I would
not have skill in weaving perish unrecorded - till I have completed a
shroud for the hero <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, to be in readiness against the time when
death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> will talk if he is laid out without a
shroud.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="103" unit="line"/>"This was what she said, and we
assented; whereon we could see her working on her great web all day
long, but at night she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight.
She fooled us in this way for three years and we never found her out,
but as time [<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>] wore on and she was now in
her fourth year, one of her maids who knew what she was doing told
us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to
finish it whether she would or no. The suitors, therefore, make you
this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand -
&lsquo;Send your mother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and
of her father's choice&rsquo;; for I do not know what will happen
if she goes on plaguing us much longer with the airs she gives
herself on the score of the accomplishments Athena has taught her,
and because she knows so many kinds of <term lang="xgreek">kerdos</term>. We never yet
heard of such a woman; we know all about Tyro, Alkmene, Mycene, and
the famous women of old, but they were nothing to your mother, any
one of them. It was not fair of her to treat us in that way, and as
long as she continues in the mind [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] with which
heaven has now endowed her, so long shall we go on eating up your
estate; and I do not see why she should change, for she gets all the
honor and glory [<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>], and it is you who pay for it,
not she. Understand, then, that we will not go back to our lands,
neither here nor elsewhere, till she has made her choice and married
some one or other of us."</p>

<p><milestone n="129" unit="line"/>Telemakhos answered, "Antinoos,
how can I drive the mother who bore me from my father's house?
My father is abroad and we do not know whether he is alive or dead.
It will be hard on me if I have to pay Ikarios the large sum which I
must give him if I insist on sending his daughter back to him. Not
only will he deal rigorously with me, but some <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term>
will also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the house will
call on the Erinyes to avenge her; besides, it will result in
<term lang="xgreek">nemesis</term> for me among men, and I will have nothing to say to
it. If you choose to take offense at this, leave the house and feast
elsewhere at one another's houses at your own cost turn and turn
about. If, on the other hand, you elect to persist in sponging upon
one man, heaven help me, but Zeus shall reckon with you in full, and
when you fall in my father's house there shall be no man to
avenge you."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="146">
<p><milestone n="146" unit="line"/>As he spoke Zeus sent two eagles
from the top of the mountain, and they flew on and on with the wind,
sailing side by side in their own lordly flight. When they were right
over the middle of the assembly they wheeled and circled about,
beating the air with their wings and glaring death into the eyes of
them that were below; then, fighting fiercely and tearing at one
another, they flew off towards the right over the town. The people
wondered as they saw them, and asked each other what an this might
be; whereon Halitherses, who was the best seer and reader of omens
among them, spoke to them plainly and in all honesty,
saying:</p>

<p><milestone n="161" unit="line"/>"Hear me, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and I
speak more particularly to the suitors, for I see mischief brewing
for them. Odysseus is not going to be away much longer; indeed he is
close at hand to deal out death and destruction, not on them alone,
but on many another of us who live in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. Let us then be wise in
time, and put a stop to this wickedness before he comes. Let the
suitors do so of their own accord; it will be better for them, for I
am not prophesying without due knowledge; everything has happened to
Odysseus as I foretold when the Argives set out for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and he with
them. I said that after going through much hardship and losing all
his men he should come home again in the twentieth year and that no
one would know him; and now all this is coming true."</p>

<p><milestone n="177" unit="line"/>Eurymakhos son of Polybos then
said, "Go home, old man, and prophesy to your own children, or it may
be worse for them. I can read these omens myself much better than you
can; birds are always flying about in the sunshine somewhere or
other, but they seldom mean anything. Odysseus has died in a far
country, and it is a pity you are not dead along with him, instead of
prating here about omens and adding fuel to the anger of Telemakhos
which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you think he will give you
something for your family, but I tell you - and it shall surely be -
when an old man like you, who should know better, talks a young one
over till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his young friend
will only fare so much the worse - he will take nothing by it, for
the suitors will prevent this - and in the next, we will lay a
heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you will at all like paying,
for it will bear hardly upon you. As for Telemakhos, I warn him in
the presence of you all to send his mother back to her father, who
will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts
so dear a daughter may expect. Till then we shall go on harassing him
with our suit; for we fear no man, and care neither for him, with all
his fine speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of yours. You may
preach as much as you please, but we shall only hate you the more. We
shall go back and continue to eat up Telemakhos' estate without
paying him, till such time as his mother leaves off tormenting us by
keeping us day after day on the tiptoe of expectation, each vying
with the other in his suit for a prize of such rare perfection
[<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>]. Besides we cannot go after the other
women whom we should marry in due course, but for the way in which
she treats us."</p>

<p><milestone n="208" unit="line"/>Then Telemakhos said,
"Eurymakhos, and you other suitors, I shall say no more, and entreat
you no further, for the gods and the people of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> now know my
story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty men to take me
hither and thither, and I will go to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> to inquire
about the <term lang="xgreek">nostos</term> of my father who has so long been missing.
Some one may tell me something, or (and people often hear
<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term> in this way) some heaven-sent message may direct me. If
I can hear of him as alive and achieving his homecoming
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] I will put up with the waste you suitors will
make for yet another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of
his death, I will return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with
all due pomp, build a grave marker [<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>] to his
memory, and make my mother marry again."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="224">
<p><milestone n="224" unit="line"/>With these words he sat down, and
Mentor who had been a friend of Odysseus, and had been left in charge
of everything with full authority over the servants, rose to speak.
He, then, plainly and in all honesty addressed them thus:</p>

<p><milestone n="229" unit="line"/>"Hear me, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, I hope
that you may never have a kind and well-disposed ruler any more, nor
one who will govern you equitably; I hope that all your chiefs
henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for there is not one of you but
has forgotten Odysseus, who ruled you as though he were your father.
I am not half so angry with the suitors, for if they choose to do
violence in the naughtiness of their minds [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>], and
wager their heads that Odysseus will not return, they can take the
high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked
at the way in which you the rest of the population
[<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>] all sit still without even trying to
stop such scandalous goings on - which you could do if you chose, for
you are many and they are few."</p>

<p><milestone n="242" unit="line"/>Leiokritos, son of Euenor,
answered him saying, "Mentor, what folly is all this, that you should
set the people to stay us? It is a hard thing for one man to fight
with many about his victuals. Even though Odysseus himself were to
set upon us while we are feasting in his house, and do his best to
oust us, his wife, who wants him back so very badly, would have small
cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon his own head if he
fought against such great odds. There is no sense in what you have
been saying. Now, therefore, do you people go about your business,
and let his father's old friends, Mentor and Halitherses, speed
this boy on his journey, if he goes at all - which I do not think he
will, for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes
and tells him something."</p>

<p><milestone n="257" unit="line"/>On this he broke up the assembly,
and every man went back to his own abode, while the suitors returned
to the house of Odysseus.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="260">
<p><milestone n="260" unit="line"/>Then Telemakhos went all alone by
the sea side, washed his hands in the gray waves, and prayed to
Athena.</p>

<p><milestone n="262" unit="line"/>"Hear me," he cried, "you god who
visited me yesterday, and bade me sail the seas in search of the
<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term> of my father who has so long been missing. I would obey
you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked suitors, are
hindering me that I cannot do so."</p>

<p><milestone n="267" unit="line"/>As he thus prayed, Athena came
close up to him in the likeness and with the voice of Mentor.
"Telemakhos," said she, "if you are made of the same stuff as your
father you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward, for Odysseus
never broke his word nor left his work half done. If, then, you take
after him, your voyage will not be fruitless, but unless you have the
blood of Odysseus and of Penelope in your veins I see no likelihood
of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men as their fathers;
they are generally worse, not better; still, as you are not going to
be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not entirely without
some share of your father's wise discernment, I look with hope
upon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause
[<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] with any of those foolish suitors, for they are
neither sensible nor just [<term lang="xgreek">dikaioi</term>], and give no
thought to death and to the doom that will shortly fall on one and
all of them, so that they shall perish on the same day. As for your
voyage, it shall not be long delayed; your father was such an old
friend of mine that I will find you a ship, and will come with you
myself. Now, however, return home, and go about among the suitors;
begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see everything well
stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the staff of
life, in leathern bags, while I go round the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> and
round up volunteers at once. There are many ships in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> both old
and new; I will run my eye over them for you and will choose the
best; we will get her ready and will put out to sea without
delay."</p>

<p><milestone n="296" unit="line"/>Thus spoke Athena daughter of
Zeus, and Telemakhos lost no time in doing as the goddess told him.
He went moodily and found the suitors flaying goats and singeing pigs
in the outer court. Antinoos came up to him at once and laughed as he
took his hand in his own, saying, "Telemakhos, my fine fire-eater,
bear no more ill blood neither in word nor deed, but eat and drink
with us as you used to do. The Achaeans will find you in everything -
a ship and a picked crew to boot - so that you can set sail for <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>
at once and get news of your noble father."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="309">
<p><milestone n="309" unit="line"/>"Antinoos," answered Telemakhos,
"I cannot eat in peace, nor take pleasure of any kind with such men
as you are. Was it not enough that you should waste so much good
property of mine while I was yet a boy? Now that I am older and know
more about it, I am also stronger, and whether here among this people
[<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>], or by going to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, I will do you all
the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain though,
thanks to you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and
must be passenger not leader."</p>

<p><milestone n="321" unit="line"/>As he spoke he snatched his hand
from that of Antinoos. Meanwhile the others went on getting dinner
ready about the buildings, jeering at him tauntingly as they did
so.</p>

<p><milestone n="325" unit="line"/>"Telemakhos," said one youngster,
"means to be the death of us; I suppose he thinks he can bring
friends to help him from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, or again from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, where he seems
bent on going. Or will he go to <placeName key="perseus,Ephyra">Ephyra</placeName> as well, for poison to put in
our wine and kill us?"</p>

<p><milestone n="331" unit="line"/>Another said, "Perhaps if
Telemakhos goes on board ship, he will be like his father and perish
far from his friends. In this case we should have plenty to do, for
we could then divide up his property amongst us: as for the house we
can let his mother and the man who marries her have that."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="337">
<p><milestone n="337" unit="line"/>This was how they talked. But
Telemakhos went down into the lofty and spacious store-room where his
father's treasure of gold and bronze lay heaped up upon the
floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were kept in open
chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant olive oil, while
casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god to
drink, were ranged against the wall in case Odysseus should come home
again after all. The room was closed with well-made doors opening in
the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper Eurykleia,
daughter of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both
night and day. Telemakhos called her to the store-room and
said:</p>

<p><milestone n="349" unit="line"/>"Nurse, draw me off some of the
best wine you have, after what you are keeping for my father's
own drinking, in case, poor man, he should escape death, and find his
way home again after all. Let me have twelve jars, and see that they
all have lids; also fill me some well-sewn leathern bags with barley
meal - about twenty measures in all. Get these things put together at
once, and say nothing about it. I will take everything away this
evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs for the night. I am
going to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> to see if I can hear anything about the
<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term> of my dear father.</p>

<p><milestone n="361" unit="line"/>When Eurykleia heard this she
began to cry, and spoke fondly to him, saying, "My dear child, what
ever can have put such notion as that into your head? Where in the
world do you want to go to - you, who are the one hope of the house?
Your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign country
[<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>] nobody knows where, and as soon as your
back is turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put
out of the way, and will share all your possessions among themselves;
stay where you are among your own people, and do not go wandering and
worrying your life out on the barren ocean."</p>

<p><milestone n="371" unit="line"/>"Fear not, nurse," answered
Telemakhos, "my scheme is not without heaven's sanction; but
swear that you will say nothing about all this to my mother, till I
have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she hears of my having
gone, and asks you; for I do not want her to spoil her beauty by
crying."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="377">
<p><milestone n="377" unit="line"/>The old woman swore most solemnly
that she would not, and when she had completed her oath, she began
drawing off the wine into jars, and getting the barley meal into the
bags, while Telemakhos went back to the suitors.</p>

<p><milestone n="382" unit="line"/>Then Athena bethought her of
another matter. She took his shape, and went round the town to each
one of the crew, telling them to meet at the ship by sundown. She
went also to Noemon son of Phronios, and asked him to let her have a
ship - which he was very ready to do. When the sun had set and
darkness was over all the land, she got the ship into the water, put
all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry, and stationed
her at the end of the harbor. Presently the crew came up, and the
goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them.</p>

<p><milestone n="393" unit="line"/>Furthermore she went to the house
of Odysseus, and threw the suitors into a deep slumber. She caused
their drink to fuddle them, and made them drop their cups from their
hands, so that instead of sitting over their wine, they went back
into the town to sleep, with their eyes heavy and full of drowsiness.
Then she took the form and voice of Mentor, and called Telemakhos to
come outside.</p>

<p><milestone n="402" unit="line"/>"Telemakhos," said she, "the men
are on board and at their oars, waiting for you to give your orders,
so make haste and let us be off."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="405">
<p><milestone n="405" unit="line"/>On this she led the way, while
Telemakhos followed in her steps. When they got to the ship they
found the crew waiting by the water side, and Telemakhos said, "Now
my men, help me to get the stores on board; they are all put together
in the room, and my mother does not know anything about it, nor any
of the maid servants except one."</p>

<p><milestone n="413" unit="line"/>With these words he led the way
and the others followed after. When they had brought the things as he
told them, Telemakhos went on board, Athena going before him and
taking her seat in the stern of the vessel, while Telemakhos sat
beside her. Then the men loosed the hawsers and took their places on
the benches. Athena sent them a fair wind from the West, that
whistled over the seething deep waves whereon Telemakhos told them to
catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they did as he told them.
They set the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it, and
made it fast with the forestays; then they hoisted their white sails
aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As the sail bellied out with the
wind, the ship flew through the seething deep water, and the foam
hissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then they made all fast
throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowls to the brim, and made
drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from everlasting, but
more particularly to the gray-eyed daughter of Zeus.</p>

<p><milestone n="434" unit="line"/>Thus, then, the ship sped on her
way through the watches of the night from dark till dawn.</p>
</div2></div1>

<div1 type="Book" n="3">
<head>Scroll 3</head>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>But as the sun was rising from the
fair sea into the firmament of heaven to shed light on mortals and
immortals, they reached <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> the city of Neleus. Now the people of
<placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> were gathered on the sea shore to offer sacrifice of black
bulls to Poseidon lord of the Earthquake. There were nine guilds with
five hundred men in each, and there were nine bulls to each guild. As
they were eating the inward meats and burning the thigh bones [on
the embers] in the name of Poseidon, Telemakhos and his crew
arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship to anchor, and went
ashore.</p>

<p><milestone n="12" unit="line"/>Athena led the way and Telemakhos
followed her. Presently she said, "Telemakhos, you must not at all
feel <term lang="xgreek">aid&ocirc;s</term> or be nervous; you have taken this voyage to
try and find out where your father is buried and how he came by his
end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may see what he has got to
tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell no lies, for
he is an excellent person."</p>

<p><milestone n="21" unit="line"/>"But how, Mentor," replied
Telemakhos, "dare I go up to Nestor, and how am I to address him? I
have never yet been used to holding long conversations with people,
and feel <term lang="xgreek">aid&ocirc;s</term> about questioning one who is so much
older than myself."</p>

<p><milestone n="25" unit="line"/>"Some things, Telemakhos,"
answered Athena, "will be suggested to you by your own instinct, and
some <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> will prompt you further; for I am assured
that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth until
now."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="29">
<p><milestone n="29" unit="line"/>She then went quickly on, and
Telemakhos followed in her steps till they reached the place where
the guilds of the Pylian people were assembled. There they found
Nestor sitting with his sons, while his company round him were busy
getting dinner ready, and putting pieces of meat on to the spits
while other pieces were cooking. When they saw the strangers they
crowded round them, took them by the hand and bade them take their
places. Nestor's son Peisistratos at once offered his hand to
each of them, and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were lying
on the sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes. Then he
gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine for them
into a golden cup, handing it to Athena first, and saluting her at
the same time.</p>

<p><milestone n="43" unit="line"/>"Offer a prayer, sir," said he,
"to lord Poseidon, for it is his feast that you are joining; when you
have duly prayed and made your drink-offering, pass the cup to your
friend that he may do so also. I doubt not that he too lifts his
hands in prayer, for man cannot live without gods in the world.
Still, he is younger than you are, and is much of an age with myself,
so I will give you the precedence."</p>

<p><milestone n="51" unit="line"/>As he spoke he handed her the cup.
Athena thought that he was just [<term lang="xgreek">dikaios</term>] and right to
have given it to herself first; she accordingly began praying
heartily to Poseidon. "O you," she cried, "who encircle the earth,
deign to grant the prayers of your servants that call upon you. More
especially we pray you send down your grace on Nestor and on his
sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian people some
handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you.
Lastly, grant Telemakhos and myself a happy issue, in respect of the

<p><milestone n="62" unit="line"/>When she had thus made an end of
praying, she handed the cup to Telemakhos and he prayed likewise. By
and by, when the outer meats were roasted and had been taken off the
spits, the carvers gave every man his portion and they all made an
excellent dinner. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,
Nestor, horseman of Gerene, began to speak.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="69">
<p><milestone n="69" unit="line"/>"Now," said he, "that our guests
have done their dinner, it will be best to ask them who they are.
Who, then, sir strangers, are you, and from what port have you
sailed? Are you traders? Or do you sail the seas as rovers with your
hand against every man, and every man's hand against
you?"</p>

<p><milestone n="75" unit="line"/>Telemakhos answered boldly, for
Athena had given him courage to ask about his father and get himself
a good name [<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>].</p>

<p><milestone n="79" unit="line"/>"Nestor," said he, "son of Neleus,
honor to the Achaean name, you ask whence we come, and I will tell
you. We come from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> under Neritum, and the matter about which I
would speak is of private not public import. I seek news
[<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] of my unhappy father Odysseus, who is said to
have sacked the town of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> in company with yourself. We know what
fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, but as
regards Odysseus heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he
is dead at all, for no one can certify us in what place he perished,
nor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost at sea
amid the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant at your knees,
if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end, whether
you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveler,
for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any
pity for me, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my
brave father Odysseus ever did you loyal service, either by word or
deed, when you Achaeans were harassed at the district
[<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>] of the Trojans, bear it in mind now as
in my favor and tell me truly all."</p>

<p><milestone n="102" unit="line"/>"My friend," answered Nestor,
"you recall a time of much sorrow to my mind, for the brave Achaeans
suffered much both at sea, while privateering under Achilles, and in
that district [<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>] when fighting before the
great city of king Priam. Our best men all of them fell there - Ajax,
Achilles, Patroklos peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son
Antilokhos, a man singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But
we suffered much more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell
the whole story? Though you were to stay here and question me for
five years, or even six, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans
suffered, and you would turn homeward weary of my tale before it
ended. Nine long years did we try every kind of stratagem, but the
hand of heaven was against us; during all this time there was no one
who could compare with your father in subtlety - if indeed you are
his son. I can hardly believe my eyes - and you talk just like him
too - no one would say that people of such different ages could speak
so much alike. He and I never had any kind of difference from first
to last neither in camp nor council, but in singleness of heart and
purpose [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] we advised the Argives how all might be
ordered for the best.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="130">
<p><milestone n="130" unit="line"/>"When however, we had sacked the
city of Priam, and were setting sail in our ships as heaven had
dispersed us, then Zeus saw fit to vex the Argives on their homeward
voyage [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]; for they had not all been either wise
or just [<term lang="xgreek">dikaios</term>], and hence many came to a bad end
through the displeasure [<term lang="xgreek">m&ecirc;nis</term>] of Zeus'
daughter Athena, who brought about a quarrel between the two sons of
Atreus.</p>

<p><milestone n="137" unit="line"/>"The sons of Atreus called a
meeting which was not according to <term lang="xgreek">kosmos</term>, for it was sunset
and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they explained why they
had called the people together, it seemed that Menelaos was for
sailing homeward [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] at once, and this displeased
Agamemnon, who thought that we should wait till we had offered
hecatombs to appease the anger of Athena. Fool that he was, he might
have known that he would not prevail with her, for when the gods have
made up their minds [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] they do not change them
lightly. So the two stood bandying hard words, whereon the Achaeans
sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the air, and were of two
minds as to what they should do.</p>

<p><milestone n="151" unit="line"/>"That night we rested and nursed
our anger, for Zeus was hatching mischief against us. But in the
morning some of us drew our ships into the water and put our goods
with our women on board, while the rest, about half in number, stayed
behind with Agamemnon. We - the other half - embarked and sailed; and
the ships went well, for heaven had smoothed the sea. When we reached
<placeName key="perseus,Tenedos">Tenedos</placeName> we offered sacrifices to the gods, for we were longing to get
home [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]; cruel Zeus, however, did not yet mean
that we should do so, and raised a second quarrel in the course of
which some among us turned their ships back again, and sailed away
under Odysseus to make their peace with Agamemnon; but I, and all the
ships that were with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was
brewing. The son of Tydeus went on also with me, and his crews with
him. Later on Menelaos joined us at <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName>, and found us making up
our minds about our course - for we did not know whether to go
outside <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName> by the island of Psyra, keeping this to our left, or
inside <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>, over against the stormy headland of Mimas. So we asked
heaven [<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term>] for a sign, and were shown one
to the effect that we should be soonest out of danger if we headed
our ships across the open sea to <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>. This we therefore did, and a
fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage during the night to
<placeName key="perseus,Geraistos">Geraistos</placeName>, where we offered many sacrifices to Poseidon for having
helped us so far on our way. Four days later Diomedes and his men
stationed their ships in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, but I held on for <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, and the wind
never fell light from the day when heaven first made it fair for
me.</p>

<p><milestone n="184" unit="line"/>"Therefore, my dear young friend,
I returned without hearing anything about the others. I know neither
who got home safely nor who were lost but, as in duty bound, I will
give you without reserve the reports that have reached me since I
have been here in my own house. They say the Myrmidons returned home
safely under Achilles' son Neoptolemos; so also did the valiant
son of Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again, lost no men at sea, and
all his followers who escaped death in the field got safe home with
him to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>. No matter how far out of the world you live, you will
have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands of
Aigisthos - and a fearful reckoning did Aigisthos presently pay. See
what a good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as
Orestes did, who killed false Aigisthos the murderer of his noble
father. You too, then - for you are a tall, smart-looking young man -
show your mettle and make yourself a name in story."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="201">
<p><milestone n="201" unit="line"/>"Nestor son of Neleus," answered
Telemakhos, "honor to the Achaean name, the Achaeans will bear the
<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term> of Orestes in song even to future generations, for he
has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might grant me to do
like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors, who are ill
treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have no such happiness
[<term lang="xgreek">olbos</term>] in store for me and for my father, so we must
bear it as best we may."</p>

<p><milestone n="210" unit="line"/>"My friend," said Nestor, "now
that you remind me, I remember to have heard that your mother has
many suitors, who are ill disposed towards you and are making havoc
of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely, or are the people of
the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>, following the voice of a god, against you?
Who knows but that Odysseus may come back after all, and pay these
scoundrels in full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans
behind him? If Athena were to take as great a liking to you as she
did to Odysseus when we were fighting in the Trojan <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos
</term> (for I never yet saw the gods so openly fond of any one as
Athena then was of your father), if she would take as good care of
you as she did of him, these wooers would soon some of them forget
their wooing."</p>

<p><milestone n="225" unit="line"/>Telemakhos answered, "I can
expect nothing of the kind; it would be far too much to hope for. I
dare not let myself think of it. Even though the gods themselves
willed it no such good fortune could befall me."</p>

<p><milestone n="229" unit="line"/>On this Athena said, "Telemakhos,
what are you talking about? Heaven has a long arm if it is minded to
save a man; and if it were me, I should not care how much I suffered
before getting home, provided I could be safe when I was once there.
I would rather this, than get home quickly, and then be killed in my
own house as Agamemnon was by the treachery of Aigisthos and his
wife. Still, death is certain, and when a man's hour is come,
not even the gods can save him, no matter how fond they are of
him."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="240">
<p><milestone n="240" unit="line"/>"Mentor," answered Telemakhos,
"do not let us talk about it any more. There is no chance of my
father's ever coming back [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]; the gods have
long since counseled his destruction. There is something else,
however, about which I should like to ask Nestor, for he knows much
more than any one else does. They say he has reigned for three
generations so that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell me,
therefore, Nestor, and tell me true
[<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;th&ecirc;s</term>]; how did Agamemnon come to die
in that way? What was Menelaos doing? And how came false Aigisthos to
kill so far better a man than himself? Was Menelaos away from Achaean
Argos, voyaging elsewhere among humankind, that Aigisthos took heart
and killed Agamemnon?"</p>

<p><milestone n="254" unit="line"/>"I will tell you truly
[<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;th&ecirc;s</term>]," answered Nestor, "and indeed
you have yourself divined how it all happened. If Menelaos when he
got back from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> had found Aigisthos still alive in his house,
there would have been no grave marker heaped up for him, not even
when he was dead, but he would have been thrown outside the city to
dogs and vultures, and not a woman would have mourned him, for he had
done a deed of great wickedness; but we were over there, fighting
hard [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>] at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and Aigisthos who was taking
his ease quietly in the heart of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, cajoled Agamemnon's wife
Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.</p>

<p><milestone n="265" unit="line"/>"At first she would have nothing
to do with his wicked scheme, for she was of a good natural
disposition; moreover there was a singer with her, to whom Agamemnon
had given strict orders on setting out for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, that he was to keep
guard over his wife; but when heaven had counseled her destruction,
Aigisthos led this bard off to a desert island and left him there for
crows and seagulls to batten upon - after which she went willingly
enough to the house of Aigisthos. Then he offered many burnt
sacrifices to the gods, and decorated many temples with tapestries
and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his
expectations.</p>

<p><milestone n="276" unit="line"/>"Meanwhile Menelaos and I were on
our way home from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, on good terms with one another. When we got
to <placeName key="perseus,Sounion">Sounion</placeName>, which is the point of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, Apollo with his painless
shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of Menelaos' ship (and
never man knew better how to handle a vessel in rough weather) so
that he died then and there with the helm in his hand, and Menelaos,
though very anxious to press forward, had to wait in order to bury
his comrade and give him his due funeral rites. Presently, when he
too could put to sea again, and had sailed on as far as the Malean
heads, Zeus counseled evil against him and made it blow hard till the
waves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and took the one
half towards <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> where the Cydonians dwell round about the waters
of the river Iardanos. There is a high headland hereabouts stretching
out into the sea from a place called <placeName key="perseus,Gortyn">Gortyn</placeName>, and all along this part
of the coast as far as <placeName key="perseus,Phaistos">Phaistos</placeName> the sea runs high when there is a
south wind blowing, but past <placeName key="perseus,Phaistos">Phaistos</placeName> the coast is more protected,
for a small headland can make a great shelter. Here this part of the
fleet was driven on to the rocks and wrecked; but the crews just
managed to save themselves. As for the other five ships, they were
taken by winds and seas to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, where Menelaos gathered much gold
and substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aigisthos
here at home plotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had
killed Agamemnon he ruled in <placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>, and the people were obedient
under him, but in the eighth year Orestes came back from <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> to be
his bane, and killed the murderer of his father. Then he celebrated
the funeral rites of his mother and of false Aigisthos by a banquet
to the people of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and on that very day Menelaos came home, with
as much treasure as his ships could carry.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="313">
<p><milestone n="313" unit="line"/>"Take my advice then, and do not
go traveling about for long so far from home, nor leave your property
with such dangerous people in your house; they will eat up everything
you have among them, and you will have been on a fool's errand.
Still, I should advise you by all means to go and visit Menelaos, who
has lately come off a voyage among such distant peoples as no man
could ever hope to get back from, when the winds had once carried him
so far out of his reckoning; even birds cannot fly the distance in a
twelvemonth, so vast and terrible are the seas that they must cross.
Go to him, therefore, by sea, and take your own men with you; or if
you would rather travel by land you can have a chariot, you can have
horses, and here are my sons who can escort you to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> where
Menelaos lives. Beg of him to speak the truth, and he will tell you
no lies, for he is an excellent person."</p>

<p><milestone n="329" unit="line"/>As he spoke the sun set and it
came on dark, whereon Athena said, "Sir, all that you have said is
well; now, however, order the tongues of the victims to be cut, and
mix wine that we may make drink-offerings to Poseidon, and the other
immortals, and then go to bed, for it is bed time
[<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>]. People should go away early and not keep
late hours at a religious festival."</p>

<p><milestone n="337" unit="line"/>Thus spoke the daughter of Zeus,
and they obeyed her saying. Men servants poured water over the hands
of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and
water, and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering;
then they threw the tongues of the victims into the fire, and stood
up to make their drink-offerings. When they had made their offerings
and had drunk each as much as he was minded, Athena and Telemakhos
were for going on board their ship, but Nestor caught them up at once
and stayed them.</p>

<p><milestone n="346" unit="line"/>"Heaven and the immortal gods,"
he exclaimed, "forbid that you should leave my house to go on board
of a ship. Do you think I am so poor and short of clothes, or that I
have so few cloaks and as to be unable to find comfortable beds both
for myself and for my guests? Let me tell you I have store both of
rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit the son of my old friend
Odysseus to camp down on the deck of a ship - not while I live - nor
yet will my sons after me, but they will keep open house as I have
done."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="356">
<p><milestone n="356" unit="line"/>Then Athena answered, "Sir, you
have spoken well, and it will be much better that Telemakhos should
do as you have said; he, therefore, shall return with you and sleep
at your house, but I must go back to give orders to my crew, and keep
them in good heart. I am the only older person among them; the rest
are all young men of Telemakhos' own age, who have taken this
voyage out of friendship; so I must return to the ship and sleep
there. Moreover tomorrow I must go to the Cauconians where I have a
large sum of wealth long owed to me. As for Telemakhos, now that he
is your guest, send him to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> in a chariot, and let one of
your sons go with him. Be pleased also to provide him with your best
and fleetest horses."</p>

<p><milestone n="371" unit="line"/>When she had thus spoken, she
flew away in the form of an eagle, and all marveled as they beheld
it. Nestor was astonished, and took Telemakhos by the hand. "My
friend," said he, "I see that you are going to be a great hero some
day, since the gods wait upon you thus while you are still so young.
This can have been none other of those who dwell in heaven than
Zeus' redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, who showed such
favor towards your brave father among the Argives." "Holy queen," he
continued, "agree to send down noble <term lang="xgreek">kleos</term> upon myself, my
good wife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in sacrifice
a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought
by man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up
to you in sacrifice."</p>

<p><milestone n="385" unit="line"/>Thus did he pray, and Athena
heard his prayer. He then led the way to his own house, followed by
his sons and sons-in-law. When they had got there and had taken their
places on the benches and seats, he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine
that was eleven years old when the housekeeper took the lid off the
jar that held it. As he mixed the wine, he prayed much and made
drink-offerings to Athena, daughter of Aegis-bearing Zeus. Then, when
they had made their drink-offerings and had drunk each as much as he
was minded, the others went home to bed each in his own abode; but
Nestor put Telemakhos to sleep in the room that was over the gateway
along with Peisistratos, who was the only unmarried son now left him.
As for himself, he slept in an inner room of the house, with the
queen his wife by his side.</p>

<p><milestone n="404" unit="line"/>Now when the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Nestor left his couch and took his seat
on the benches of white and polished marble that stood in front of
his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of gods in counsel, but he
was now dead, and had gone to the house of Hades; so Nestor sat in
his seat, scepter in hand, as guardian of the public weal. His sons
as they left their rooms gathered round him, Echephron, Stratios,
Perseus, Aretos, and Thrasymedes; the sixth son was Peisistratos, and
when Telemakhos joined them they made him sit with them. Nestor then
addressed them.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="418">
<p><milestone n="418" unit="line"/>"My sons," said he, "make haste
to do as I shall bid you. I wish first and foremost to propitiate the
great goddess Athena, who manifested herself visibly to me during
yesterday's festivities. Go, then, one or other of you to the
plain, tell the stockman to look me out a heifer, and come on here
with it at once. Another must go to Telemakhos' ship, and invite
all the crew, leaving two men only in charge of the vessel. Some one
else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith to gild the horns of
the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you are; tell the maids
in the house to prepare an excellent dinner, and to fetch seats, and
logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also to bring me some
clear spring water."</p>

<p><milestone n="430" unit="line"/>On this they hurried off on their
several errands. The heifer was brought in from the plain, and
Telemakhos' crew came from the ship; the goldsmith brought the
anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he worked his gold, and Athena
herself came to the sacrifice. Nestor gave out the gold, and the
smith gilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess might have
pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratios and Echephron brought her in
by the horns; Aretos fetched water from the house in a ewer that had
a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand he held a basket of
barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a sharp axe, ready to
strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket. Then Nestor began
with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley meal, and he offered
many a prayer to Athena as he threw a lock from the heifer's
head upon the fire.</p>

<p><milestone n="447" unit="line"/>When they had done praying and
sprinkling the barley meal Thrasymedes dealt his blow, and brought
the heifer down with a stroke that cut through the tendons at the
base of her neck, whereon the daughters and daughters-in-law of
Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice (she was eldest daughter to
Klymenos) screamed with delight. Then they lifted the heifer's
head from off the ground, and Peisistratos cut her throat. When she
had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut her up. They cut out
the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them round in two layers
of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then
Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them, while
the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands.
When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward meats,
they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on the spits
and toasted them over the fire.</p>

<p><milestone n="464" unit="line"/>Meanwhile lovely Polykaste,
Nestor's youngest daughter, washed Telemakhos. When she had
washed him and anointed him with oil, she brought him a fair mantle
and shirt, and he looked like a god as he came from the bath and took
his seat by the side of Nestor. When the outer meats were done they
drew them off the spits and sat down to dinner where they were waited
upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept pouring them out their wine in
cups of gold. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Nestor
said, "Sons, put Telemakhos' horses to the chariot that he may
start at once."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="477">
<p><milestone n="477" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak, and they did
even as he had said, and yoked the fleet horses to the chariot. The
housekeeper packed them up a provision of bread, wine, and sweetmeats
fit for the sons of princes. Then Telemakhos got into the chariot,
while Peisistratos gathered up the reins and took his seat beside
him. He lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loath into
the open country, leaving the high citadel of <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> behind them. All
that day did they travel, swaying the yoke upon their necks till the
sun went down and darkness was over all the land. Then they reached
<placeName key="perseus,Pherai">Pherai</placeName> where Diokles lived, who was son to Ortilokhos and grandson to
Alpheus. Here they passed the night and Diokles entertained them
hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn; appeared,
they again yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under
the echoing gatehouse. Peisistratos lashed the horses on and they
flew forward nothing loath; presently they came to the wheat lands of
the open country, and in the course of time completed their journey,
so well did their steeds take them.</p>

<p><milestone n="497" unit="line"/>Now when the sun had set and
darkness was over the land,</p>
</div2></div1>

<div1 type="Book" n="4">
<head>Scroll 4</head>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>They reached the low lying city of
<placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, where they drove straight to the halls of Menelaos. They
found him in his own house, feasting with his many clansmen in honor
of the wedding of his son, and also of his daughter, whom he was
marrying to the son of that valiant warrior Achilles. He had given
his consent and promised her to him while he was still at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and
now the gods were bringing the marriage about; so he was sending her
with chariots and horses to the city of the Myrmidons over whom
Achilles&rsquo; son was reigning. For his only son he had found a
bride from <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, daughter of Alektor. This son, Megapenthes, was
born to him of a bondwoman, for heaven granted Helen no more children
after she had borne Hermione, who was fair as golden Aphrodite
herself.</p>

<p><milestone n="15" unit="line"/>So the neighbors and kinsmen of
Menelaos were feasting and making merry in his house. There was a
singer also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two tumblers
went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck up
with his tune.</p>

<p><milestone n="20" unit="line"/>Telemakhos and the son of Nestor
stayed their horses at the gate, whereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaos
came out, and as soon as he saw them ran hurrying back into the house
to tell his Master. He went close up to him and said, "Menelaos,
there are some strangers come here, two men, who look like sons of
Zeus. What are we to do? Shall we take their horses out, or tell them
to find friends elsewhere as they best can?"</p>

<p><milestone n="30" unit="line"/>Menelaos was very angry and said,
"Eteoneus, son of Boethoos, you never used to be a fool, but now you
talk like a simpleton. Take their horses out, of course, and show the
strangers in that they may have supper; you and I have stayed often
enough at other people's houses before we got back here, where
heaven grant that we may rest in peace henceforward."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="37">
<p><milestone n="37" unit="line"/>So Eteoneus bustled back and bade
other servants come with him. They took their sweating hands from
under the yoke, made them fast to the mangers, and gave them a feed
of oats and barley mixed. Then they leaned the chariot against the
end wall of the courtyard, and led the way into the house. Telemakhos
and Peisistratos were astonished when they saw it, for its splendor
was as that of the sun and moon; then, when they had admired
everything to their heart's content, they went into the bath
room and washed themselves.</p>

<p><milestone n="49" unit="line"/>When the servants had washed them
and anointed them with oil, they brought them woolen cloaks and
shirts, and the two took their seats by the side of Menelaos. A
maidservant brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured
it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and she drew a
clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread, and
offered them many good things of what there was in the house, while
the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of
gold by their side.</p>

<p><milestone n="59" unit="line"/>Menelaos then greeted them saying,
"Eat up, and welcome; when you have finished supper I shall ask who
you are, for the lineage of such men as you cannot have been lost.
You must be descended from a line of scepter-bearing kings, for poor
people do not have such sons as you are."</p>

<p><milestone n="65" unit="line"/>On this he handed them a piece of
fat roast loin, which had been set near him as being a prime part,
and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them;
as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Telemakhos said to
the son of Nestor, with his head so close that no one might hear,
"Look, Peisistratos, man after my own heart, see the gleam of bronze
and gold - of amber, ivory, and silver. Everything is so splendid
that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian Zeus. I am lost in
admiration."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="76">
<p><milestone n="76" unit="line"/>Menelaos overheard him and said,
"No one, my sons, can hold his own with Zeus, for his house and
everything about him is immortal; but among mortal men - well, there
may be another who has as much wealth as I have, or there may not;
but at all events I have traveled much and have undergone much
hardship, for it was nearly eight years before I could get home with
my fleet. I went to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName> and the Egyptians; I went also
to the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the Erembians, and to <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>
where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born, and the sheep
bear lambs three times a year. Every one in that country, whether
master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good milk, for the
ewes yield all the year round. But while I was traveling and getting
great riches among these people, my brother was secretly and
shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife, so that I
have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth. Whoever your
parents may be they must have told you about all this, and of my
heavy loss in the ruin of a stately mansion fully and magnificently
furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have so that I
had stayed at home, and all those were living who perished on the
plain of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, far from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>. I often grieve, as I sit here in my
house, for one and all of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but
presently I leave off again, for crying is cold comfort and one soon
tires of it. Yet grieve for these as I may, I do so for one man more
than for them all. I cannot even think of him without loathing both
food and sleep, so miserable does he make me, for no one of all the
Achaeans worked so hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing
by it, and has left a legacy of sorrow [<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>] to
myself, for he has been gone a long time, and we know not whether he
is alive or dead. His old father, his long-suffering wife Penelope,
and his son Telemakhos, whom he left behind him an infant in arms,
are plunged in grief on his account."</p>

<p><milestone n="113" unit="line"/>Thus spoke Menelaos, and the
heart of Telemakhos yearned as he bethought him of his father. Tears
fell from his eyes as he heard him thus mentioned, so that he held
his cloak before his face with both hands. When Menelaos saw this he
doubted whether to let him choose his own time for speaking, or to
ask him at once and find what it was all about.</p>

<p><milestone n="120" unit="line"/>While he was thus in two minds
Helen came down from her high-vaulted and perfumed room, looking as
lovely as Artemis herself. Adraste brought her a seat, Alkippe a soft
woolen rug, while Phylo fetched her the silver work-box which
Alkandra wife of Polybos had given her. Polybos lived in Egyptian
Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world; he gave
Menelaos two baths, both of pure silver, two tripods, and ten talents
of gold; besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful
presents, to wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work-box that ran on
wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed this
by her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with
violet colored wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her
seat, put her feet upon the footstool, and began to question her
husband.</p>

<p><milestone n="138" unit="line"/>"Do we know, Menelaos," said she,
"the names of these strangers who have come to visit us? Shall I
guess right or wrong? But I cannot help saying what I think. Never
yet have I seen either man or woman so like somebody else (indeed
when I look at him I hardly know what to think) as this young man is
like Telemakhos, whom Odysseus left as a baby behind him, when you
Achaeans went to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> with battle in your hearts, on account of my
most shameless self."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="147">
<p><milestone n="147" unit="line"/>"My dear wife," replied Menelaos,
"I see the likeness just as you do. His hands and feet are just like
Odysseus&rsquo; so is his hair, with the shape of his head and the
expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was talking about Odysseus,
and saying how much he had suffered on my account, tears fell from
his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle."</p>

<p><milestone n="155" unit="line"/>Then Peisistratos said,
"Menelaos, son of Atreus, you are right in thinking that this young
man is Telemakhos, but he is very modest, and is ashamed to come here
and begin opening up discourse with one whose conversation is so
divinely interesting as your own. My father, Nestor, sent me to
escort him hither, for he wanted to know whether you could give him
any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble at home when his
father has gone away leaving him without supporters; and this is how
Telemakhos is now placed, for his father is absent, and there is no
one among his own <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> to stand by him."</p>

<p><milestone n="168" unit="line"/>"Bless my heart," replied
Menelaos; "then I am receiving a visit from the son of a very dear
friend, who suffered much hardship [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>] for my
sake. I had always hoped to entertain him with most marked
distinction when heaven had granted us a safe return
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] from beyond the seas. I should have founded a
city for him in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and built him a house. I should have made him
leave <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> with his goods, his son, and all his people, and should
have sacked for them some one of the neighboring cities that are
subject to me. We should thus have seen one another continually, and
nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an
intercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such good
fortune, for it has prevented the poor man from ever getting home at
all."</p>

<p><milestone n="183" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak, and his words
set them all to weeping. Helen wept, Telemakhos wept, and so did
Menelaos, nor could Peisistratos keep his eyes from filling, when he
remembered his dear brother Antilokhos whom the son of bright Dawn
had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaos,</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="190">
<p><milestone n="190" unit="line"/>"Sir, my father Nestor, when we
used to talk about you at home, told me you were a person of rare and
excellent understanding. If, then, it be possible, do as I would urge
you. I am not fond of crying while I am getting my supper. Morning
will come in due course, and in the forenoon I care not how much I
cry for those that are dead and gone. This is all we can do for the
poor things. We can only shave our heads for them and wring the tears
from our cheeks. I had a brother who died at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>; he was by no means
the worst man there; you are sure to have known him - his name was
Antilokhos; I never set eyes upon him myself, but they say that he
was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant."</p>

<p><milestone n="203" unit="line"/>"Your discretion, my friend,"
answered Menelaos, "is beyond your years. It is plain you take after
your father. One can soon see when a man is son to one whom Zeus
grants blessedness [<term lang="xgreek">olbos</term>] both as regards wife and
offspring - and he has blessed Nestor from first to last all his
days, giving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about
him who are both well disposed and valiant. We will put an end
therefore to all this weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let
water be poured over our hands. Telemakhos and I can talk with one
another fully in the morning."</p>

<p><milestone n="216" unit="line"/>On this Asphalion, one of the
servants, poured water over their hands and they laid their hands on
the good things that were before them.</p>

<p><milestone n="219" unit="line"/>Then Zeus&rsquo; daughter Helen
bethought her of another matter. She drugged the wine with the herb
<term lang="xgreek">n&ecirc;penthes</term> [= anti-<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>], which
banishes all care, sorrow, and anger. Whoever drinks wine thus
drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest of the day, not even
though his father and mother both of them drop down dead, or he sees
a brother or a son hewn in pieces before his very eyes. This drug, of
such sovereign power and virtue, had been given to Helen by Polydamna
wife of <placeName key="tgn,1130814">Thon</placeName>, a woman of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, where there grow all sorts of herbs,
some good to put into the mixing-bowl and others poisonous. Moreover,
every one in the whole country is a skilled physician, for they are
of the race of Paieon. When Helen had put this drug in the bowl, and
had told the servants to serve the wine round, she said:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="235">
<p><milestone n="235" unit="line"/>"Menelaos, son of Atreus, and you
my good friends, sons of honorable men (which is as Zeus wills, for
he is the giver both of good and evil, and can do what he chooses),
feast here as you will, and listen while I tell you a tale in season.
I cannot indeed name every single one of the exploits
[<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>] of Odysseus, but I can say what he did when
he was in the Trojan <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>, and you Achaeans were in all
sorts of difficulties. He covered himself with wounds and bruises,
dressed himself all in rags, and entered the enemy's city
looking like a menial or a beggar, quite different from how he looked
when he was among his own people. In this disguise he entered the
city of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and no one said anything to him. I alone recognized him
and began to question him, but he was too cunning for me. When,
however, I had washed and anointed him and had given him clothes, and
after I had sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the Trojans till
he had got safely back to his own camp and to the ships, he explained
to me the whole <term lang="xgreek">noos</term> of the Achaeans. He killed many Trojans
and got much information before he reached the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> camp, for all
which things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I
was glad, for my heart was beginning to long after my home, and I was
unhappy about the wrong [<term lang="xgreek">at&ecirc;</term>] that Aphrodite had
done me in taking me over there, away from my country, my girl, and
my lawful wedded husband, who is indeed by no means deficient either
in looks or understanding."</p>

<p><milestone n="265" unit="line"/>Then Menelaos said, "All that you
have been saying, my dear wife, is true. I have traveled much, and
have learned the plans and <term lang="xgreek">noos</term> of many a hero, but I have
never seen such another man as Odysseus. What endurance too, and what
courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the bravest
of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and destruction upon
the Trojans. At that moment you came up to us; some
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> who wished well to the Trojans must have set you
on to it and you had Deiphobos with you. Three times did you go all
round our hiding place and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his
own name, and mimicked all our wives. Diomedes, Odysseus, and I from
our seats inside heard what a noise you made. Diomedes and I could
not make up our minds whether to spring out then and there, or to
answer you from inside, but Odysseus held us all in check, so we sat
quite still, all except Antiklos, who was beginning to answer you,
when Odysseus clapped his two brawny hands over his mouth, and kept
them there. It was this that saved us all, for he muzzled Antiklos
till Athena took you away again."</p>

<p><milestone n="290" unit="line"/>"How sad," exclaimed Telemakhos,
"that all this was of no avail to save him, nor yet his own iron
courage. But now, sir, be pleased to send us all to bed, that we may
lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep."</p>

<p><milestone n="296" unit="line"/>On this Helen told the maid
servants to set beds in the room that was in the gatehouse, and to
make them with good red rugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them
with woolen cloaks for the guests to wear. So the maids went out,
carrying a torch, and made the beds, to which a man-servant presently
conducted the strangers. Thus, then, did Telemakhos and Peisistratos
sleep there in the forecourt, while the son of Atreus lay in an inner
room with lovely Helen by his side.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="306">
<p><milestone n="306" unit="line"/>When the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Menelaos rose and dressed himself. He
bound his sandals on to his comely feet, girded his sword about his
shoulders, and left his room looking like an immortal god. Then,
taking a seat near Telemakhos he said:</p>

<p><milestone n="312" unit="line"/>"And what, Telemakhos, has led
you to take this long sea voyage to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>? Are you on public or
private business? Tell me all about it."</p>

<p><milestone n="315" unit="line"/>"I have come, sir replied
Telemakhos, "to see if you can tell me anything about my father. I am
being eaten out of house and home; my fair estate is being wasted,
and my house is full of miscreants who in overweening <term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>
keep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretense of
wooing my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your knees if haply
you may tell me about my father's melancholy end, whether you
saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveler; for
he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity
for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my
brave father Odysseus ever did you loyal service either by word or
deed, when you Achaeans were harassed in the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of
the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in my favor and tell me truly
all."</p>

<p><milestone n="332" unit="line"/>Menelaos on hearing this was very
much shocked. "So," he exclaimed, "these cowards would usurp a brave
man's bed? A hind might as well lay her new born young in the
lair of a lion, and then go off to feed in the forest or in some
grassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his lair will make short
work with the pair of them - and so will Odysseus with these suitors.
By father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, if Odysseus is still the man that
he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName>, and threw him
so heavily that all the Achaeans cheered him - if he is still such
and were to come near these suitors, they would have a swift doom and
a sorry wedding. As regards your questions, however, I will not
prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without concealment
all that the old man of the sea told me.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="351">
<p><milestone n="351" unit="line"/>"I was trying to come on here,
but the gods detained me in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, for my hecatombs had not given
them full satisfaction, and the gods are very strict about having
their dues. Now off <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, about as far as a ship can sail in a day
with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an island called Pharos
- it has a good harbor from which vessels can get out into open sea
when they have taken in water - and the gods becalmed me twenty days
without so much as a breath of fair wind to help me forward. We
should have run clean out of provisions and my men would have
starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and saved me in the
person of Eidothea, daughter to Proteus, the old man of the sea, for
she had taken a great fancy to me.</p>

<p><milestone n="367" unit="line"/>"She came to me one day when I
was by myself, as I often was, for the men used to go with their
barbed hooks, all over the island in the hope of catching a fish or
two to save them from the pangs of hunger. &lsquo;Stranger,&rsquo; said
she, &lsquo;it seems to me that you like starving in this way - at any
rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you stick here day after
day, without even trying to get away though your men are dying by
inches.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="375" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Let me tell you,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;whichever of the goddesses you may happen to be, that I
am not staying here of my own accord, but must have offended the gods
that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods know
everything: which of the immortals it is that is hindering me in this
way, and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach my home
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]?&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="382" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Stranger,&rsquo; replied
she, &lsquo;I will make it all quite clear to you. There is an old
immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name is
Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is
Poseidon's head man and knows every inch of ground all over the
bottom of the sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will
tell you about your voyage, what courses you are to take, and how you
are to sail the sea so as to reach your home [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>].
He will also tell you, if you so will, all that has been going on at
your house both good and bad, while you have been away on your long
and dangerous journey.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="394">
<p><milestone n="394" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Can you show me,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;some strategy by means of which I may catch this old
god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a

man.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="398" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Stranger,&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;I will make it all quite clear to you. About the time when the
sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of the sea comes up
from under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs the water
over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and goes to
sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals - (Halosydne's
chickens as they call them) - come up also from the gray sea, and go
to sleep in shoals all round him; and a very strong and fish-like
smell do they bring with them. Early tomorrow morning I will take you
to this place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out
[<term lang="xgreek">kr&icirc;n&ocirc;</term>], therefore, the three best men you
have in your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the old
man will play you.</p>

<p><milestone n="411" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;First he will look over
all his seals, and count them; then, when he has seen them and
tallied them on his five fingers, he will go to sleep among them, as
a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he is asleep
seize him; put forth all your strength [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] and
hold him fast, for he will do his very utmost to get away from you.
He will turn himself into every kind of creature that goes upon the
earth, and will become also both fire and water; but you must hold
him fast and grip him tighter and tighter, till he begins to talk to
you and comes back to what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then
you may slacken your hold [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] and let him go;
and you can ask him which of the gods it is that is angry with you,
and what you must do to reach your home [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] over
the fishy sea.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="425" unit="line"/>"Having so said she dived under
the waves, whereon I turned back to the place where my ships were
ranged upon the shore; and my heart was clouded with care as I went
along. When I reached my ship we got supper ready, for night was
falling, and camped down upon the beach.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="431">
<p><milestone n="431" unit="line"/>"When the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I took the three men on whose prowess
of all kinds I could most rely, and went along by the sea-side,
praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the goddess fetched me up four
seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all of them just skinned, for
she meant to play a trick upon her father. Then she dug four pits for
us to lie in, and sat down to wait till we should come up. When we
were close to her, she made us lie down in the pits one after the
other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our ambuscade would
have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy seals was most
distressing - who would go to bed with a sea monster if he could help
it?-but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of something
that gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under each
man's nostrils, which was so fragrant that it killed the smell
of the seals.</p>

<p><milestone n="447" unit="line"/>"We waited the whole morning and
made the best of it, watching the seals come up in hundreds to bask
upon the sea shore, till at noon the old man of the sea came up too,
and when he had found his fat seals he went over them and counted
them. We were among the first he counted, and he never suspected any
guile, but laid himself down to sleep as soon as he had done
counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and seized him; on
which he began at once with his old tricks, and changed himself first
into a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he became a
dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was running water,
and then again directly he was a tree, but we stuck to him and never
lost hold, till at last the cunning old creature became distressed,
and said, Which of the gods was it, Son of Atreus, that hatched this
plot with you for snaring me and seizing me against my will? What do
you want?&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="464" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;You know that yourself,
old man,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;You will gain nothing by trying to
put me off. It is because I have been kept so long in this island,
and see no sign of my being able to get away. I am losing all heart;
tell me, then, for you gods know everything, which of the immortals
it is that is hindering me, and tell me also how I may sail the sea
so as to reach my home [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]?&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="471" unit="line"/>"Then,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if
you would finish your voyage and get home quickly, you must offer
sacrifices to Zeus and to the rest of the gods before embarking; for
it is decreed that you shall not get back to your friends, and to
your own house, till you have returned to the heaven-fed stream of

heaven. When you have done this they will let you finish your

laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell me true, whether all the
Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we set sail from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>
have got home safely, or whether any one of them came to a bad end
either on board his own ship or among his friends when the days of
his fighting were done.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="491" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Son of Atreus,&rsquo; he
answered, &lsquo;why ask me? You had better not know my <term lang="xgreek">noos</term>,
for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard my story. Many of
those about whom you ask are dead and gone, but many still remain,
and only two of the chief men among the Achaeans perished during
their return home. As for what happened on the field of battle - you
were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still at sea, alive,
but hindered from returning [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]. Ajax was
wrecked, for Poseidon drove him on to the great rocks of Gyrae;
nevertheless, he let him get safe out of the water, and in spite of
all Athena's hatred he would have escaped death, if he had not
ruined himself by boasting. He said the gods could not drown him even
though they had tried to do so, and when Poseidon heard this large
talk, he seized his trident in his two brawny hands, and split the
rock of Gyrae in two pieces. The base remained where it was, but the
part on which Ajax was sitting fell headlong into the sea and carried
Ajax with it; so he drank salt water and was drowned.</p>

<p><milestone n="512" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Your brother and his ships
escaped, for Hera protected him, but when he was just about to reach
the high promontory of Malea, he was caught by a heavy gale which
carried him out to sea again sorely against his will, and drove him
to the foreland where Thyestes used to dwell, but where Aigisthos was
then living. By and by, however, it seemed as though he was to return
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] safely after all, for the gods backed the
wind into its old quarter and they reached home; whereon Agamemnon
kissed his native soil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in
his own country.</p>

<p><milestone n="524" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Now there was a watchman
whom Aigisthos kept always on the watch, and to whom he had promised
two talents of gold. This man had been looking out for a whole year
to make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the slip and prepare
war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon go by, he went and told
Aigisthos who at once began to lay a plot for him. He picked
[<term lang="xgreek">kr&icirc;n&ocirc;</term>] twenty of his bravest warriors
from the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> and placed them in ambuscade on one side
the room, while on the opposite side he prepared a banquet. Then he
sent his chariots and horsemen to Agamemnon, and invited him to the
feast, but he meant foul play. He got him there, all unsuspicious of
the doom that was awaiting him, and killed him when the banquet was
over as though he were butchering an ox in the shambles; not one of
Agamemnon's followers was left alive, nor yet one of
Aigisthos&rsquo;, but they were all killed there in the
cloisters.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="538">
<p><milestone n="538" unit="line"/>"Thus spoke Proteus, and I was
broken hearted as I heard him. I sat down upon the sands and wept; I
felt as though I could no longer bear to live nor look upon the light
of the sun. Presently, when I had had my fill of weeping and writhing
upon the ground, the old man of the sea said, &lsquo;Son of Atreus, do
not waste any more time in crying so bitterly; it can do no manner of
good; find your way home as fast as ever you can, for Aigisthos be
still alive, and even though Orestes anticipates you in killing him,
you may yet come in for his funeral.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="548" unit="line"/>"On this I took comfort in spite
of all my sorrow, and said, &lsquo;I know, then, about these two; tell
me, therefore, about the third man of whom you spoke; is he still
alive, but at sea, and unable to get home? Or is he dead? Tell me, no
matter how much it may grieve me.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="554" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;The third man,&rsquo; he
answered, &lsquo;is Odysseus who dwells in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. I can see him in an
island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph Calypso, who is
keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home for he has no
ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. As for your own end,
Menelaos, you shall not die in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, but the gods will take you to
the Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world. There
fair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life than any
where else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not rain, nor
hail, nor snow, but Okeanos breathes ever with a West wind that sings
softly from the sea, and gives fresh life to all men. This will
happen to you because you have married Helen, and are Zeus&rsquo;
son-in-law.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="570" unit="line"/>"As he spoke he dived under the
waves, whereon I turned back to the ships with my companions, and my
heart was clouded with care as I went along. When we reached the
ships we got supper ready, for night was falling, and camped down
upon the beach. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn
appeared, we drew our ships into the water, and put our masts and
sails within them; then we went on board ourselves, took our seats on
the benches, and smote the gray sea with our oars. I again stationed
my ships in the heaven-fed stream of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, and offered hecatombs
that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased heaven's
anger, I raised a tomb to the memory of Agamemnon that his
<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term> might be inextinguishable, after which I had a quick
passage home, for the gods sent me a fair wind.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="587">
<p><milestone n="587" unit="line"/>"And now for yourself - stay here
some ten or twelve days longer, and I will then speed you on your
way. I will make you a noble present of a chariot and three horses. I
will also give you a beautiful chalice that so long as you live you
may think of me whenever you make a drink-offering to the immortal
gods."</p>

<p><milestone n="593" unit="line"/>"Son of Atreus," replied
Telemakhos, "do not press me to stay longer; I should be contented to
remain with you for another twelve months; I find your conversation
so delightful that I should never once wish myself at home with my
parents; but my crew whom I have left at <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> are already impatient,
and you are detaining me from them. As for any present you may be
disposed to make me, I had rather that it should he a piece of plate.
I will take no horses back with me to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, but will leave them to
adorn your own stables, for you have much flat ground in your kingdom
where lotus thrives, as also meadowsweet and wheat and barley, and
oats with their white and spreading ears; whereas in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> we have
neither open fields nor racecourses, and the country is more fit for
goats than horses, and I like it the better for that. None of our
islands have much level ground, suitable for horses, and <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> least
of all."</p>

<p><milestone n="609" unit="line"/>Menelaos smiled and took
Telemakhos&rsquo; hand within his own. "What you say," said he, "shows
that you come of good family. I both can, and will, make this
exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most precious piece of
plate in all my house. It is a mixing-bowl by Hephaistos&rsquo; own
hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold.
Phaidimos, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a visit
which I paid him when I returned there on my homeward journey. I will
make you a present of it."</p>

<p><milestone n="620" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse as guests
kept coming to the king's house. They brought sheep and wine,
while their wives had put up bread for them to take with them; so
they were busy cooking their dinners in the courts.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="625">
<p><milestone n="625" unit="line"/>Meanwhile the suitors were
throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark on the leveled ground
in front of Odysseus&rsquo; house, and were behaving with all their
old <term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>. Antinoos and Eurymakhos, who were their
ringleaders and much the foremost in <term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term> among them
all, were sitting together when Noemon son of Phronios came up and
said to Antinoos,</p>

<p><milestone n="632" unit="line"/>"Have we any idea, Antinoos, on
what day Telemakhos returns from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>? He has a ship of mine, and I
want it, to cross over to <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>: I have twelve brood mares there with
yearling mule foals by their side not yet broken in, and I want to
bring one of them over here and break him."</p>

<p><milestone n="638" unit="line"/>They were astounded when they
heard this, for they had made sure that Telemakhos had not gone to
the city of Neleus. They thought he was only away somewhere on the
farms, and was with the sheep, or with the swineherd; so Antinoos
said, "When did he go? Tell me truly, and what young men did he take
with him? Were they freemen or his own bondsmen - for he might manage
that too? Tell me also, did you let him have the ship of your own
free will because he asked you, or did he take it by force
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] without your leave?"</p>

<p><milestone n="648" unit="line"/>"I lent it him," answered Noemon.
"What else could I do when a man of his position said he was in a
difficulty and asked me to oblige him? I could not possibly refuse.
As for those who went with him they were the best young men we have
in the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>, and I saw Mentor go on board as leader -
or some god who was exactly like him. I cannot understand it, for I
saw Mentor here myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting
out for <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="657">
<p><milestone n="657" unit="line"/>Noemon then went back to his
father's house, but Antinoos and Eurymakhos were very angry.
They told the others to leave off competing [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>],
and to come and sit down along with themselves. When they came,
Antinoos son of Eupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with
rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said:</p>

<p><milestone n="663" unit="line"/>"Good heavens, this voyage of
Telemakhos is a very serious matter; we had made sure that it would
come to nothing, but the young man has got away in spite of us, and
with a crew picked [<term lang="xgreek">kr&icirc;n&ocirc;</term>] from the best
of the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>, too. He will be giving us trouble
presently; may Zeus destroy him with violence
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] before he is full grown. Find me a ship,
therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie in wait for him
in the straits between <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>; he will then rue the day
that he set out to try and get news of his father."</p>

<p><milestone n="673" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak, and the others
applauded his saying; they then all of them went inside the
buildings.</p>

<p><milestone n="675" unit="line"/>It was not long ere Penelope came
to know what the suitors were plotting; for a man servant, Medon,
overheard them from outside the outer court as they were laying their
schemes within, and went to tell his mistress. As he crossed the
threshold of her room Penelope said: "Medon, what have the suitors
sent you here for? Is it to tell the maids to leave their
master's business and cook dinner for them? I wish they may
neither woo nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere else,
but let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of my
son's estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were
children how good Odysseus had been to them - never doing anything
high-handed, nor speaking harshly to anybody in the
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>? Such is the justice [<term lang="xgreek">dik&ecirc;</term>]
of divine kings: they may take a fancy to one man and dislike
another, but Odysseus never did an unjust thing by anybody - which
shows what bad hearts you have, and that there is no such thing as
gratitude [<term lang="xgreek">kharis</term>] left in this world."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="696">
<p><milestone n="696" unit="line"/>Then Medon said, "I wish, my
lady, that this were all; but they are plotting something much more
dreadful now - may heaven frustrate their design. They are going to
try and murder Telemakhos as he is coming home from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> and
<placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, where he has been to get news of his father."</p>

<p><milestone n="703" unit="line"/>Then Penelope's heart sank
within her, and for a long time she was speechless; her eyes filled
with tears, and she could find no utterance. At last, however, she
said, "Why did my son leave me? What business had he to go sailing
off in ships that make long voyages over the ocean like sea-horses?
Does he want to die without leaving any one behind him to keep up his
name?"</p>

<p><milestone n="711" unit="line"/>"I do not know," answered Medon,
"whether some god set him on to it, or whether he went on his own
impulse to see if he could find out if his father was dead, or alive
and on his way home [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]."</p>

<p><milestone n="715" unit="line"/>Then he went downstairs again,
leaving Penelope in an agony of grief [<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>]. There
were plenty of seats in the house, but she had no heart for sitting
on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor of her
own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house, both old and
young, gathered round her and began to cry too, till at last in a
transport of sorrow she exclaimed,</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="722">
<p><milestone n="722" unit="line"/>"My dears, heaven has been
pleased to try me with more affliction than any other woman of my age
and country. First I lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had
every good quality [<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>] under heaven, and
whose <term lang="xgreek">kleos</term> was great over all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> and middle <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>; and
now my darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my
having heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there was
not one of you would so much as think of giving me a call out of my
bed, though you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If I
had known he meant taking this voyage, he would have had to give it
up, no matter how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse
behind him - one or other. Now, however, go some of you and call old
Dolios, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who is my
gardener. Bid him go at once and tell everything to <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, who may
be able to hit on some plan for enlisting public sympathy on our
side, as against those who are trying to exterminate his own race and
that of Odysseus."</p>

<p><milestone n="742" unit="line"/>Then the dear old nurse Eurykleia
said, "You may kill me, my lady, or let me live on in your house,
whichever you please, but I will tell you the real truth. I knew all
about it, and gave him everything he wanted in the way of bread and
wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I would not tell you
anything for some ten or twelve days, unless you asked or happened to
hear of his having gone, for he did not want you to spoil your beauty
by crying. And now, my lady, wash your face, change your dress, and
go upstairs with your maids to offer prayers to Athena, daughter of
Aegis-bearing Zeus, for she can save him even though he be in the
jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes: he has trouble enough already.
Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate the race of the son of
Arceisius so much, but there will be a son left to come up after him,
and inherit both the house and the fair fields that lie far all round
it."</p>

<p><milestone n="758" unit="line"/>With these words she made her
mistress leave off crying, and dried the tears from her eyes.
Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, and went upstairs with
her maids. She then put some bruised barley into a basket and began
praying to Athena.</p>

<p><milestone n="762" unit="line"/>"Hear me," she cried, "Daughter
of Aegis-bearing Zeus, unweariable. If ever Odysseus while he was
here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or heifer, bear it in mind
now as in my favor, and save my darling son from the villainy of the
suitors."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="767">
<p><milestone n="767" unit="line"/>She cried aloud as she spoke, and
the goddess heard her prayer; meanwhile the suitors were clamorous
throughout the covered room, and one of them said:</p>

<p><milestone n="770" unit="line"/>"The queen is preparing for her
marriage with one or other of us. Little does she dream that her son
has now been doomed to die."</p>

<p><milestone n="772" unit="line"/>This was what they said, but they
did not know what was going to happen. Then Antinoos said, "Comrades,
let there be no loud talking, lest some of it get carried inside. Let
us be up and do that in silence, about which we are all of a
mind."</p>

<p><milestone n="778" unit="line"/>He then chose
[<term lang="xgreek">kr&icirc;n&ocirc;</term>] twenty men, and they went down to
their ship and to the sea side; they drew the vessel into the water
and got her mast and sails inside her; they bound the oars to the
thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due course, and
spread the white sails aloft, while their fine servants brought them
their armor. Then they made the ship fast a little way out, came on
shore again, got their suppers, and waited till night should
fall.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="787">
<p><milestone n="787" unit="line"/>But Penelope lay in her own room
upstairs unable to eat or drink, and wondering whether her brave son
would escape, or be overpowered by the wicked suitors. Like a lioness
caught in the toils with huntsmen hemming her in on every side she
thought and thought till she sank into a slumber, and lay on her bed
bereft of thought and motion.</p>

<p><milestone n="795" unit="line"/>Then Athena bethought her of
another matter, and made a vision in the likeness of Penelope's
sister Iphthime daughter of Ikarios who had married Eumelos and lived
in <placeName key="perseus,Pherai">Pherai</placeName>. She told the vision to go to the house of Odysseus, and to
make Penelope leave off crying, so it came into her room by the hole
through which the thong went for pulling the door to, and hovered
over her head, saying,</p>

<p><milestone n="804" unit="line"/>"You are asleep, Penelope: the
gods who live at ease will not suffer you to weep and be so sad. Your
son has done them no wrong, so he will yet come back to
you."</p>

<p><milestone n="808" unit="line"/>Penelope, who was sleeping
sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered, "Sister, why have you
come here? You do not come very often, but I suppose that is because
you live such a long way off. Am I, then, to leave off crying and
refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me? I, who have lost
my brave and lion-hearted husband, who had every good quality
[<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>] under heaven, and whose <term lang="xgreek">kleos</term> was
great over all <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> and middle <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>; and now my darling son has
gone off on board of a ship - a foolish man who has never been used
to undergoing ordeals [<term lang="xgreek">ponos</term>], nor to going about
among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about him than about
my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him, lest something
should happen to him, either from the people in the
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> where he has gone, or at sea, for he has many
enemies who are plotting against him, and are bent on killing him
before he can return home."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="824">
<p><milestone n="824" unit="line"/>Then the vision said, "Take
heart, and be not so much dismayed. There is one gone with him whom
many a man would be glad enough to have stand by his side, I mean
Athena; it is she who has compassion upon you, and who has sent me to
bear you this message."</p>

<p><milestone n="830" unit="line"/>"Then," said Penelope, "if you
are a god or have been sent here by divine commission, tell me also
about that other unhappy one - is he still alive, or is he already
dead and in the house of Hades?"</p>

<p><milestone n="835" unit="line"/>And the vision said, "I shall not
tell you for certain whether he is alive or dead, and there is no use
in idle conversation."</p>

<p><milestone n="838" unit="line"/>Then it vanished through the
thong-hole of the door and was dissipated into thin air; but Penelope
rose from her sleep refreshed and comforted, so vivid had been her
dream.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="842">
<p><milestone n="842" unit="line"/>Meantime the suitors went on
board and sailed their ways over the sea, intent on murdering
Telemakhos. Now there is a rocky islet called Asteris, of no great
size, in mid channel between <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>, and there is a harbor
on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here then the Achaeans
placed themselves in ambush.</p>
</div2></div1>

<div1 type="Book" n="5">
<head>Scroll 5</head>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>And now, as Dawn rose from her
couch beside Tithonos - harbinger of light alike to mortals and
immortals - the gods met in council and with them, Zeus the lord of
thunder, who is their king. Thereon Athena began to tell them of the
many sufferings of Odysseus, for she pitied him away there in the
house of the nymph Calypso.</p>

<p><milestone n="7" unit="line"/>"Father Zeus," said she, "and all
you other gods that live in everlasting bliss, I hope there may never
be such a thing as a kind and well-disposed ruler any more, nor one
who will govern equitably. I hope they will be all henceforth cruel
and unjust, for there is not one of his subjects who has not
forgotten Odysseus, who ruled them as though he were their father.
There he is, lying in great pain in an island where dwells the nymph
Calypso, who will not let him go; and he cannot get back to his own
country, for he can find neither ships nor sailors to take him over
the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying to murder his only
son Telemakhos, who is coming home from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, where
he has been to see if he can get news of his father."</p>

<p><milestone n="21" unit="line"/>"What, my dear, are you talking
about?" replied her father. "Did you not send him there yourself,
because you thought [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] it would help Odysseus to
get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to
protect Telemakhos, and to see him safely home again, while the
suitors have to come hurrying back without having killed
him."</p>

<p><milestone n="28" unit="line"/>When he had thus spoken, he said
to his son Hermes, "Hermes, you are our messenger, go therefore and
tell Calypso we have decreed that poor Odysseus is to return home
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]. He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor
men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to
reach fertile <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Scheria</placeName>, the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of
kin to the gods, and will honor him as though he were one of
ourselves. They will send him in a ship to his own country, and will
give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought
back from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, if he had had all his prize wealth and had got home
without disaster. This is how we have settled that he shall return to
his country and his friends."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="43">
<p><milestone n="43" unit="line"/>Thus he spoke, and Hermes, guide
and guardian, slayer of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, did as he was told. Forthwith he bound
on his glittering golden sandals with which he could fly like the
wind over land and sea. He took the wand with which he seals
men's eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he pleases, and flew
holding it in his hand over <placeName key="tgn,7002729">Pieria</placeName>; then he swooped down through the
firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose waves he
skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and corner of
the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray. He flew and
flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got to the island
which was his journey's end, he left the sea and went on by land
till he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.</p>

<p><milestone n="58" unit="line"/>He found her at home. There was a
large fire burning on the hearth, and one could smell from far the
fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal wood. As for herself, she
was busy at her loom, shooting her golden shuttle through the warp
and singing beautifully. Round her cave there was a thick wood of
alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees, wherein all kinds of
great birds had built their nests - owls, hawks, and chattering
sea-crows that have their business in the waters. A vine loaded with
grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of the cave;
there were also four running rills of water in channels cut pretty
close together, and turned here and there so as to irrigate the beds
of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed. Even a god
could not help being charmed with such a lovely spot, so Hermes stood
still and looked at it; but when he had admired it sufficiently he
went inside the cave.</p>

<p><milestone n="77" unit="line"/>Calypso knew him at once - for the
gods all know each other, no matter how far they live from one
another - but Odysseus was not within; he was on the sea-shore as
usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears in his eyes,
groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso gave Hermes a
seat and said: "Why have you come to see me, Hermes - honored, and
ever welcome - for you do not visit me often? Say what you want; I
will do it for you at once if I can, and if it can be done at all;
but come inside, and let me set refreshment before you.</p>

<p><milestone n="92" unit="line"/>As she spoke she drew a table
loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed him some red nectar, so
Hermes ate and drank till he had had enough, and then
said:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="97">
<p><milestone n="97" unit="line"/>"We are speaking god and goddess
to one another, one another, and you ask me why I have come here, and
I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Zeus sent me; it was
no doing of mine; who could possibly want to come all this way over
the sea where there are no cities full of people to offer me
sacrifices or choice hecatombs? Nevertheless I had to come, for none
of us other gods can cross Zeus, nor transgress his orders [his
<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>]. He says that you have here the most ill-starred of
all those who fought nine years before the city of King Priam and
sailed home in the tenth year after having sacked it. On their way
home [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] they erred against Athena, who raised
both wind and waves against them, so that all his brave companions
perished, and he alone was carried here by wind and tide. Zeus says
that you are to let this by man go at once, for it is decreed that he
shall not perish here, far from his own people, but shall return to
his house and country and see his friends again."</p>

<p><milestone n="116" unit="line"/>Calypso trembled with rage when
she heard this, "You gods," she exclaimed, "ought to be ashamed of
yourselves. You are always jealous and hate seeing a goddess take a
fancy to a mortal man, and live with him in open matrimony. So when
rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion, you precious gods were all of
you furious till Artemis went and killed him in Ortygia. So again
when Demeter fell in love with Iasion, and yielded to him in a thrice
ploughed fallow field, Zeus came to hear of it before so long and
killed Iasion with his thunder-bolts. And now you are angry with me
too because I have a man here. I found the poor creature sitting all
alone astride of a keel, for Zeus had struck his ship with lightning
and sunk it in mid ocean, so that all his crew were drowned, while he
himself was driven by wind and waves on to my island. I got fond of
him and cherished him, and had set my heart on making him immortal,
so that he should never grow old all his days; still I cannot cross
Zeus, nor bring his counsels [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] to nothing;
therefore, if he insists upon it, let the man go beyond the seas
again; but I cannot send him anywhere myself for I have neither ships
nor men who can take him. Nevertheless I will readily give him such
advice, in all good faith, as will be likely to bring him safely to
his own country."</p>

<p><milestone n="145" unit="line"/>"Then send him away," said
Hermes, "and fear the <term lang="xgreek">m&ecirc;nis</term> of Zeus, lest he grow angry
and punish you"&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="148" unit="line"/>On this he took his leave, and
Calypso went out to look for Odysseus, for she had heard Zeus&rsquo;
message. She found him sitting upon the beach with his eyes ever
filled with tears, his sweet life wasting away as he mourned his
<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>; for he had got tired of Calypso, and though he was
forced to sleep with her in the cave by night, it was she, not he,
that would have it so. As for the daytime, he spent it on the rocks
and on the sea-shore, weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and
always looking out upon the sea. Calypso then went close up to him
said:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="160">
<p><milestone n="160" unit="line"/>"My poor man, you shall not stay
here grieving and fretting your life out any longer. I am going to
send you away of my own free will; so go, cut some beams of wood, and
make yourself a large raft with an upper deck that it may carry you
safely over the sea. I will put bread, wine, and water on board to
save you from starving. I will also give you clothes, and will send
you a fair wind to take you home, if the gods in heaven so will it -
for they know more about these things, and can settle them better
than I can."</p>

<p><milestone n="171" unit="line"/>Odysseus shuddered as he heard
her. "Now goddess," he answered, "there is something behind all this;
you cannot be really meaning to help me home when you bid me do such
a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft. Not even a well-found ship
with a fair wind could venture on such a distant voyage: nothing that
you can say or do shall make me go on board a raft unless you first
solemnly swear that you mean me no mischief."</p>

<p><milestone n="180" unit="line"/>Calypso smiled at this and
caressed him with her hand: "You know a great deal," said she, "but
you are quite wrong here. May heaven above and earth below be my
witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx - and this is the most
solemn oath which a blessed god can take - that I mean you no sort of
harm, and am only advising you to do exactly what I should do myself
in your place. My <term lang="xgreek">noos</term> is favorable towards you; my heart is
not made of iron, and I am very sorry for you."</p>

<p><milestone n="192" unit="line"/>When she had thus spoken she led
the way rapidly before him, and Odysseus followed in her steps; so
the pair, goddess and man, went on and on till they came to
Calypso's cave, where Odysseus took the seat that Hermes had
just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of the food that
mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar for herself,
and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.
When they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink, Calypso
spoke, saying:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="203">
<p><milestone n="203" unit="line"/>"Odysseus, noble son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>,
so you would start home to your own land at once? Good luck go with
you, but if you could only know how much suffering is in store for
you before you get back to your own country, you would stay where you
are, keep house along with me, and let me make you immortal, no
matter how anxious you may be to see this wife of yours, of whom you
are thinking all the time, day after day; yet I flatter myself that I
am no whit less tall or well-looking than she is, for it is not to be
expected that a mortal woman should compare in beauty with an
immortal."</p>

<p><milestone n="214" unit="line"/>"Goddess," replied Odysseus, "do
not be angry with me about this. I am quite aware that my wife
Penelope is nothing like so tall or so beautiful as yourself. She is
only a woman, whereas you are an immortal. Nevertheless, I want to
get home, and can think of nothing else. If some god wrecks me when I
am on the sea, I will bear it and make the best of it. I have had
infinite trouble both by land and sea already, so let this go with
the rest."</p>

<p><milestone n="225" unit="line"/>Presently the sun set and it
became dark, whereon the pair retired into the inner part of the cave
and went to bed.</p>

<p><milestone n="228" unit="line"/>When the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Odysseus put on his shirt and cloak,
while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer fabric, very fine
and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about her waist and a
veil to cover her head. She at once set herself to think how she
could speed Odysseus on his way. So she gave him a great bronze axe
that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and had a
beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it. She also gave him
a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of the island where
the largest trees grew - alder, poplar and pine, that reached the sky
- very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for him in the
water. Then, when she had shown him where the best trees grew,
Calypso went home, leaving him to cut them, which he soon finished
doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth,
squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso
came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted
the timbers together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad
as a skilled shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he
filed a deck on top of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He
also made a mast with a yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. He
fenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a protection against
the waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood. By and by Calypso
brought him some linen to make the sails, and he made these too,
excellently, making them fast with braces and sheets. Last of all,
with the help of levers, he drew the raft down into the
water.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="262">
<p><milestone n="262" unit="line"/>In four days he had completed the
whole work, and on the fifth Calypso sent him from the island after
washing him and giving him some clean clothes. She gave him a goat
skin full of black wine, and another larger one of water; she also
gave him a wallet full of provisions, and found him in much good
meat. Moreover, she made the wind fair and warm for him, and gladly
did Odysseus spread his sail before it, while he sat and guided the
raft skillfully by means of the rudder. He never closed his eyes, but
kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on late-setting Bo&ouml;tes, and on
the Bear - which men also call the Wain, and which turns round and
round where it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping into the
stream of Okeanos - for Calypso had told him to keep this to his
left. Seventeen days did he sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth
the dim outlines of the mountains on the nearest part of the
Phaeacian coast appeared, rising like a shield on the
horizon.</p>

<p><milestone n="282" unit="line"/>But lord Poseidon, who was
returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight of Odysseus a long way
off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could see him sailing upon
the sea, and it made him very angry, so he wagged his head and
muttered to himself, saying, heavens, so the gods have been changing
their minds about Odysseus while I was away in <placeName key="tgn,7000489">Ethiopia</placeName>, and now he
is close to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is decreed that he
shall escape from the calamities that have befallen him. Still, he
shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done with
it."</p>

<p><milestone n="291" unit="line"/>Thereon he gathered his clouds
together, grasped his trident, stirred it round in the sea, and
roused the rage of every wind that blows till earth, sea, and sky
were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of the heavens.
Winds from East, South, North, and West fell upon him all at the same
time, and a tremendous sea got up, so that Odysseus&rsquo; heart began
to fail him. "Alas," he said to himself in his dismay, "what ever
will become of me? I am afraid Calypso was right when she said I
should have trouble by sea before I got back home. It is all coming
true. How black is Zeus making heaven with his clouds, and what a sea
the winds are raising from every quarter at once. I am now safe to
perish. Blest and thrice blest were those Danaans who fell before
<placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> in the cause of [<term lang="xgreek">kharis</term>] the sons of Atreus.
Would that had been killed on the day when the Trojans were pressing
me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for then I should have
had due burial and the Achaeans would have honored my name
[<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>]; but now it seems that I shall come to a most
pitiable end."</p>

<p><milestone n="313" unit="line"/>As he spoke a sea broke over him
with such terrific fury that the raft reeled again, and he was
carried overboard a long way off. He let go the helm, and the force
of the wind was so great that it broke the mast half way up, and both
sail and yard went over into the sea. For a long time Odysseus was
under water, and it was all he could do to rise to the surface again,
for the clothes Calypso had given him weighed him down; but at last
he got his head above water and spat out the bitter brine that was
running down his face in streams. In spite of all this, however, he
did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast as he could towards
it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again so as to escape
drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn winds
whirl thistledown round and round upon a road. (It was as though the
South, North, East, and West winds were all at once tossing it back
and forth.)</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="333">
<p><milestone n="333" unit="line"/>When he was in this plight, Ino
daughter of Cadmus, also called Leukothea, saw him. She had formerly
been a mere mortal, but had been since raised to the rank of a marine
goddess. Seeing in what great distress Odysseus now was, she had
compassion upon him, and, rising like a sea-gull from the waves, took
her seat upon the raft.</p>

<p><milestone n="339" unit="line"/>"My poor good man," said she,
"why is Poseidon so furiously angry with you? He is giving you a
great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster he will not kill you.
You seem to be a sensible person, do then as I bid you; strip, leave
your raft to drive before the wind, and swim to the Phaeacian coast
where better luck awaits you. And here, take my veil and put it round
your chest; it is enchanted, and you can come to no harm so long as
you wear it. As soon as you touch land take it off, throw it back as
far as you can into the sea, and then go away again." With these
words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then she dived down
again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the seething dark
waters.</p>

<p><milestone n="354" unit="line"/>But Odysseus did not know what to
think. "Alas," he said to himself in his dismay, "this is only some
one or other of the gods who is luring me to ruin by advising me to
will quit my raft. At any rate I will not do so at present, for the
land where she said I should be quit of all troubles seemed to be
still a good way off. I know what I will do - I am sure it will be
best - no matter what happens I will stick to the raft as long as her
timbers hold together, but when the sea breaks her up I will swim for
it; I do not see how I can do any better than this."</p>

<p><milestone n="365" unit="line"/>While he was thus in two minds,
Poseidon sent a terrible great wave that seemed to rear itself above
his head till it broke right over the raft, which then went to pieces
as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed about by a whirlwind.
Odysseus got astride of one plank and rode upon it as if he were on
horseback; he then took off the clothes Calypso had given him, bound
Ino's veil under his arms, and plunged into the sea - meaning to
swim on shore. King Poseidon watched him as he did so, and wagged his
head, muttering to himself and saying, "&lsquo;There now, swim up and
down as you best can till you fall in with well-to-do people. I do
not think you will be able to say that I have let you off too
lightly." On this he lashed his horses and drove to <placeName key="tgn,5004273">Aigai</placeName> where his
palace is.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="382">
<p><milestone n="382" unit="line"/>But Athena resolved to help
Odysseus, so she bound the ways of all the winds except one, and made
them lie quite still; but she roused a good stiff breeze from the
North that should lay the waters till Odysseus reached the land of
the Phaeacians where he would be safe.</p>

<p><milestone n="388" unit="line"/>Thereon he floated about for two
nights and two days in the water, with a heavy swell on the sea and
death staring him in the face; but when the third day broke, the wind
fell and there was a dead calm without so much as a breath of air
stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked eagerly ahead, and could
see land quite near. Then, as children rejoice when their dear father
begins to get better after having for a long time borne sore
affliction sent him by some angry spirit, but the gods deliver him
from evil, so was Odysseus thankful when he again saw land and trees,
and swam on with all his strength that he might once more set foot
upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot, he began to
hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the swell still
broke against them with a terrific roar. Everything was enveloped in
spray; there were no harbors where a ship might ride, nor shelter of
any kind, but only headlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain
tops.</p>

<p><milestone n="406" unit="line"/>Odysseus&rsquo; heart now began to
fail him, and he said despairingly to himself, "Alas, Zeus has let me
see land after swimming so far that I had given up all hope, but I
can find no landing place, for the coast is rocky and surf-beaten,
the rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the sea, with deep water
close under them so that I cannot climb out for want of foothold. I
am afraid some great wave will lift me off my legs and dash me
against the rocks as I leave the water - which would give me a sorry
landing. If, on the other hand, I swim further in search of some
shelving beach or harbor, a wind may carry me out to sea again sorely
against my will, or heaven may send some great monster of the deep to
attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that Poseidon
is very angry with me."</p>

<p><milestone n="424" unit="line"/>While he was thus in two minds a
wave caught him and took him with such force against the rocks that
he would have been smashed and torn to pieces if Athena had not shown
him what to do. He caught hold of the rock with both hands and clung
to it groaning with pain till the wave retired, so he was saved that
time; but presently the wave came on again and carried him back with
it far into the sea- tearing his hands as the suckers of a octopus
are torn when some one plucks it from its bed, and the stones come up
along with it- even so did the rocks tear the skin from his strong
hands, and then the wave drew him deep down under the
water.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="436">
<p><milestone n="436" unit="line"/>Here poor Odysseus would have
certainly perished even in spite of his own destiny, if Athena had
not helped him to keep his wits about him. He swam seaward again,
beyond reach of the surf that was beating against the land, and at
the same time he kept looking towards the shore to see if he could
find some haven, or a spit that should take the waves aslant. By and
by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of a river, and here he
thought would be the best place, for there were no rocks, and it
afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there was a current, so
he prayed inwardly and said:</p>

<p><milestone n="445" unit="line"/>"Hear me, O King, whoever you may
be, and save me from the anger of the sea-god Poseidon, for I
approach you prayerfully. Anyone who has lost his way has at all
times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my distress I draw
near to your stream, and cling to the knees of your riverhood. Have
mercy upon me, O king, for I declare myself your
suppliant."</p>

<p><milestone n="451" unit="line"/>Then the god stayed his stream
and stilled the waves, making all calm before him, and bringing him
safely into the mouth of the river. Here at last Odysseus&rsquo; knees
and strong hands failed him, for the sea had completely broken him.
His body was all swollen, and his mouth and nostrils ran down like a
river with sea-water, so that he could neither breathe nor speak, and
lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently, when he had got his
breath and came to himself again, he took off the scarf that Ino had
given him and threw it back into the salt stream of the river,
whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave that bore it
towards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down among the
rushes, and kissed the bounteous earth.</p>

<p><milestone n="464" unit="line"/>"Alas," he cried to himself in
his dismay, "what ever will become of me, and how is it all to end?
If I stay here upon the river bed through the long watches of the
night, I am so exhausted that the bitter cold and damp may make an
end of me - for towards sunrise there will be a keen wind blowing
from off the river. If, on the other hand, I climb the hill side,
find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some thicket, I may escape
the cold and have a good night's rest, but some savage beast may
take advantage of me and devour me."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="474">
<p><milestone n="474" unit="line"/>In the end he deemed it best to
take to the woods, and he found one upon some high ground not far
from the water. There he crept beneath two shoots of olive that grew
from a single stock - the one ungrafted, while the other had been
grafted. No wind, however squally, could break through the cover they
afforded, nor could the sun's rays pierce them, nor the rain get
through them, so closely did they grow into one another. Odysseus
crept under these and began to make himself a bed to lie on, for
there was a great litter of dead leaves lying about - enough to make
a covering for two or three men even in hard winter weather. He was
glad enough to see this, so he laid himself down and heaped the
leaves all round him. Then, as one who lives alone in the country,
far from any neighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed in the ashes to
save himself from having to get a light elsewhere, even so did
Odysseus cover himself up with leaves; and Athena shed a sweet sleep
upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose all memories of
his sorrows <milestone n="493" unit="line"/>.</p>
</div2></div1>

<div1 type="Book" n="6">
<head>Scroll 6</head>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>So here Odysseus slept, overcome by
sleep and toil; but Athena went off to the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> and
city of the Phaeacians - a people who used to live in the fair town
of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes were
stronger in force [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] than they and plundered
them, so their king Nausithoos moved them thence and settled them in
<placeName key="tgn,7010886">Scheria</placeName>, far from all other people. He surrounded the city with a
wall, built houses and temples, and divided the lands among his
people; but he was dead and gone to the house of Hades, and King
Alkinoos, whose counsels were inspired of heaven, was now reigning.
To his house, then, did Athena go in furtherance of the return
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] of Odysseus.</p>

<p><milestone n="15" unit="line"/>She went straight to the
beautifully decorated bedroom in which there slept a girl who was as
lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter to King Alkinoos. Two maid
servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty, one on either side
of the doorway, which was closed with well-made folding doors. Athena
took the form of the famous sea leader Dymas&rsquo; daughter, who was
a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age; then, coming up to
the girl's bedside like a breath of wind, she hovered over her
head and said:</p>

<p><milestone n="25" unit="line"/>"Nausicaa, what can your mother
have been about, to have such a lazy daughter? Here are your clothes
all lying in disorder, yet you are going to be married almost
immediately, and should not only be well dressed yourself, but should
find good clothes for those who attend you. This is the way to get
yourself a good name, and to make your father and mother proud of
you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a washing day, and start at
daybreak. I will come and help you so that you may have everything
ready as soon as possible, for all the best young men throughout your
own <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> are courting you, and you are not going to
remain a young girl much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to have
a wagon and mules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes,
and belts; and you can ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for
you than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some way from the
town."</p>

<p><milestone n="41" unit="line"/>When she had said this Athena went
away to <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, which they say is the everlasting home of the gods.
Here no wind beats roughly, and neither rain nor snow can fall; but
it abides in everlasting sunshine and in a great peacefulness of
light, wherein the blessed gods are illumined for ever and ever. This
was the place to which the goddess went when she had given
instructions to the girl.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="48">
<p><milestone n="48" unit="line"/>By and by morning came and woke
Nausicaa, who began wondering about her dream; she therefore went to
the other end of the house to tell her father and mother all about
it, and found them in their own room. Her mother was sitting by the
fireside spinning her purple yarn with her maids around her, and she
happened to catch her father just as he was going out to attend a
meeting of the town council, which the Phaeacian aldermen had
convened. She stopped him and said:</p>

<p><milestone n="57" unit="line"/>"Papa dear, could you manage to
let me have a good big wagon? I want to take all our dirty clothes to
the river and wash them. You are the chief man here, so it is only
right that you should have a clean shirt when you attend meetings of
the council. Moreover, you have five sons at home, two of them
married, while the other three are good-looking bachelors; you know
they always like to have clean linen when they go to a dance
[<term lang="xgreek">khoros</term>], and I have been thinking about all
this."</p>

<p><milestone n="66" unit="line"/>She did not say a word about her
own wedding, for she did not like to, but her father knew and said,
"You shall have the mules, my love, and whatever else you have a mind
for. Be off with you, and the men shall get you a good strong wagon
with a body to it that will hold all your clothes."</p>

<p><milestone n="71" unit="line"/>On this he gave his orders to the
servants, who got the wagon out, harnessed the mules, and put them
to, while the girl brought the clothes down from the linen room and
placed them on the wagon. Her mother prepared her a basket of
provisions with all sorts of good things, and a goat skin full of
wine; the girl now got into the wagon, and her mother gave her also a
golden cruse of oil, that she and her women might anoint themselves.
Then she took the whip and reins and lashed the mules on, whereon
they set off, and their hoofs clattered on the road. They pulled
without flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa and her wash of
clothes, but the maids also who were with her.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="85">
<p><milestone n="85" unit="line"/>When they reached the water side
they went to the washing-cisterns, through which there ran at all
times enough pure water to wash any quantity of linen, no matter how
dirty. Here they unharnessed the mules and turned them out to feed on
the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the water side. They took the
clothes out of the wagon, put them in the water, and vied with one
another in treading them in the pits to get the dirt out. After they
had washed them and got them quite clean, they laid them out by the
sea side, where the waves had raised a high beach of shingle, and set
about washing themselves and anointing themselves with olive oil.
Then they got their dinner by the side of the stream, and waited for
the sun to finish drying the clothes. When they had done dinner they
threw off the veils that covered their heads and began to play at
ball, while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Artemis goes
forth upon the mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars
or deer, and the wood-nymphs, daughters of Aegis-bearing Zeus, take
their sport along with her (then is Leto proud at seeing her daughter
stand a full head taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest
amid a whole bevy of beauties), even so did the girl outshine her
handmaids.</p>

<p><milestone n="110" unit="line"/>When it was time for them to
start home, and they were folding the clothes and putting them into
the wagon, Athena began to consider how Odysseus should wake up and
see the handsome girl who was to conduct him to the city of the
Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball at one of the maids,
which missed her and fell into deep water. On this they all shouted,
and the noise they made woke Odysseus, who sat up in his bed of
leaves and began to wonder what it might all be.</p>

<p><milestone n="119" unit="line"/>"Alas," said he to himself, "what
kind of people have I come amongst? Are they cruel, savage, and
uncivilized [not <term lang="xgreek">dikaios</term>], or hospitable and endowed
with a god-fearing <term lang="xgreek">noos</term>? I seem to hear the voices of young
women, and they sound like those of the nymphs that haunt
mountaintops, or springs of rivers and meadows of green grass. At any
rate I am among a race of men and women. Let me try if I cannot
manage to get a look at them."</p>

<p><milestone n="127" unit="line"/>As he said this he crept from
under his bush, and broke off a bough covered with thick leaves to
hide his nakedness. He looked like some lion of the wilderness that
stalks about exulting in his strength and defying both wind and rain;
his eyes glare as he prowls in quest of oxen, sheep, or deer, for he
is famished, and will dare break even into a well-fenced homestead,
trying to get at the sheep - even such did Odysseus seem to the young
women, as he drew near to them all naked as he was, for he was in
great want. On seeing one so unkempt and so begrimed with salt water,
the others scampered off along the spits that jutted out into the
sea, but the daughter of Alkinoos stood firm, for Athena put courage
into her heart and took away all fear from her. She stood right in
front of Odysseus, and he doubted whether he should go up to her,
throw himself at her feet, and embrace her knees as a suppliant, or
stay where he was and entreat her to give him some clothes and show
him the way to the town. In the end he deemed it best to entreat her
from a distance in case the girl should take offense at his coming
near enough to clasp her knees, so he addressed her in honeyed and
persuasive language.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="149">
<p><milestone n="149" unit="line"/>"O queen," he said, "I implore
your aid - but tell me, are you a goddess or are you a mortal woman?
If you are a goddess and dwell in heaven, I can only conjecture that
you are Zeus&rsquo; daughter Artemis, for your face and figure
resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are a mortal and
live on earth, thrice happy are your father and mother - thrice
happy, too, are your brothers and sisters; how proud and delighted
they must feel when they see so fair a scion as yourself going out to
a dance [<term lang="xgreek">khoros</term>]; most happy, however, of all will he
be whose wedding gifts have been the richest, and who takes you to
his own home. I never yet saw any one so beautiful, neither man nor
woman, and am lost in admiration as I behold you. I can only compare
you to a young palm tree which I saw when I was at <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> growing near
the altar of Apollo - for I was there, too, with many people after
me, when I was on that journey which has been the source of all my
troubles. Never yet did such a young plant shoot out of the ground as
that was, and I admired and wondered at it exactly as I now admire
and wonder at yourself. I dare not clasp your knees, but I am in
great distress [<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>]; yesterday made the twentieth
day that I had been tossing about upon the sea. The winds and waves
have taken me all the way from the Ogygian island, and now a
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> has flung me upon this coast that I may endure
still further suffering; for I do not think that I have yet come to
the end of it, but rather that the gods have still much evil in store
for me.</p>

<p><milestone n="175" unit="line"/>"And now, O queen, have pity upon
me, for you are the first person I have met, and I know no one else
in this country. Show me the way to your town, and let me have
anything that you may have brought here to wrap your clothes in. May
heaven grant you in all things your heart's desire - husband,
house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing better in
this world than that man and wife should be of one mind in a house.
It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their friends glad,
and they themselves know more about it than any one."</p>

<p><milestone n="186" unit="line"/>To this Nausicaa answered,
"Stranger, you appear to be a sensible, well-disposed person. There
is no accounting for luck; Zeus gives prosperity
[<term lang="xgreek">olbos</term>] to rich and poor just as he chooses, so you
must take what he has seen fit to send you, and make the best of it.
Now, however, that you have come to this our country, you shall not
want for clothes nor for anything else that a foreigner in distress
may reasonably look for. I will show you the way to the town, and
will tell you the name of our people: we are called Phaeacians, and I
am daughter to Alkinoos, in whom the whole strength and power
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] of the state is vested."</p>

<p><milestone n="198" unit="line"/>Then she called her maids and
said, "Stay where you are, you girls. Can you not see a man without
running away from him? Do you take him for a robber or a murderer?
Neither he nor any one else can come here to do us Phaeacians any
harm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on a land's
end that juts into the sounding sea, and have nothing to do with any
other people. This is only some poor man who has lost his way, and we
must be kind to him, for strangers and foreigners in distress are
under Zeus&rsquo; protection, and will take what they can get and be
thankful; so, girls, give the poor man something to eat and drink,
and wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered from the
wind."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="211">
<p><milestone n="211" unit="line"/>On this the maids left off
running away and began calling one another back. They made Odysseus
sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told them, and brought him a
shirt and cloak. They also brought him the little golden cruse of
oil, and told him to go wash in the stream. But Odysseus said, "Young
women, please to stand a little on one side that I may wash the brine
from my shoulders and anoint myself with oil, for it is long enough
since my skin has had a drop of oil upon it. I cannot wash as long as
you all keep standing there. I am ashamed to strip before a number of
good-looking young women."</p>

<p><milestone n="223" unit="line"/>Then they stood on one side and
went to tell the girl, while Odysseus washed himself in the stream
and scrubbed the brine from his back and from his broad shoulders.
When he had thoroughly washed himself, and had got the brine out of
his hair, he anointed himself with oil, and put on the clothes which
the girl had given him; Athena then made him look taller and stronger
than before, she also made the hair grow thick on the top of his
head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she poured down
gracefulness [<term lang="xgreek">kharis</term>] over his head and shoulders as a
skillful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Hephaistos
and Athena enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it - and his
work is full of beauty. Then he went and sat down a little way off
upon the beach, looking quite young and handsome
[<term lang="xgreek">kharis</term>], and the girl gazed on him with admiration;
then she said to her maids:</p>

<p><milestone n="239" unit="line"/>"Hush, my dears, for I want to
say something. I believe the gods who live in heaven have sent this
man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw him I thought him plain, but
now his appearance is like that of the gods who dwell in heaven. I
should like my future husband to be just such another as he is, if he
would only stay here and not want to go away. However, give him
something to eat and drink."</p>

<p><milestone n="247" unit="line"/>They did as they were told, and
set food before Odysseus, who ate and drank ravenously, for it was
long since he had had food of any kind. Meanwhile, Nausicaa bethought
her of another matter. She got the linen folded and placed in the
wagon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she took her seat, she
called Odysseus:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="255">
<p><milestone n="255" unit="line"/>"Stranger," said she, "rise and
let us be going back to the town; I will introduce you at the house
of my excellent father, where I can tell you that you will meet all
the best people among the Phaeacians. But be sure and do as I bid
you, for you seem to be a sensible person. As long as we are going
past the fields - and farm lands, follow briskly behind the wagon
along with the maids and I will lead the way myself. Presently,
however, we shall come to the town, where you will find a high wall
running all round it, and a good harbor on either side with a narrow
entrance into the city, and the ships will be drawn up by the road
side, for every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You will
see the market place with a temple of Poseidon in the middle of it,
and paved with large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in
ship's gear of all kinds, such as cables and sails, and here,
too, are the places where oars are made, for the Phaeacians are not a
nation of archers; they know nothing about bows and arrows, but are a
sea-faring folk, and pride themselves on their masts, oars, and
ships, with which they travel far over the sea.</p>

<p><milestone n="273" unit="line"/>"I am afraid of the gossip and
scandal that may be set on foot against me later on; for the people
in the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> here are very ill-natured, and some lowly
person, if he met us, might say, &lsquo;Who is this fine-looking
stranger that is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I
suppose she is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor
whom she has taken from some foreign vessel, for we have no
neighbors; or some god has at last come down from heaven in answer to
her prayers, and she is going to live with him all the rest of her
life. It would be a better thing if she would take herself away and
find a husband somewhere else, for she will not look at one of the
many excellent young Phaeacians in the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> who woo
her.&rsquo; This is the kind of disparaging remark that would be made
about me, and I could not complain, for I should myself be
scandalized at seeing any other girl do the like, and go about with
men in spite of everybody, while her father and mother were still
alive, and without having been married in the face of all the
world.</p>

<p><milestone n="289" unit="line"/>"If, therefore, you want my
father to give you an escort and to help you home
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>], do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful
grove of poplars by the road side dedicated to Athena; it has a well
in it and a meadow all round it. Here my father has a field of
fertile garden ground, about as far from the town as a man's
voice will carry. Sit down there and wait for a while till the rest
of us can get into the town and reach my father's house. Then,
when you think we must have done this, come into the town and ask the
way to the house of my father Alkinoos. You will have no difficulty
in finding it; any child will point it out to you, for no one else in
the whole town has anything like such a fine house as he has. When
you have got past the gates and through the outer court, go right
across the inner court till you come to my mother. You will find her
sitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by firelight. It is
a fine sight to see her as she leans back against one of the
bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind her. Close to her seat
stands that of my father, on which he sits and topes like an immortal
god. Never mind him, but go up to my mother, and lay your hands upon
her knees if you would get home quickly. If you can win her over, you
may hope to see your own country again, no matter how distant it may
be."</p>

<p><milestone n="316" unit="line"/>So saying she lashed the mules
with her whip and they left the river. The mules drew well and their
hoofs went up and down upon the road. She was careful not to go too
fast for Odysseus and the maids who were following on foot along with
the wagon, so she plied her whip with judgment [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>].
As the sun was going down they came to the sacred grove of Athena,
and there Odysseus sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter of
Zeus.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="324">
<p><milestone n="324" unit="line"/>"Hear me," he cried, "daughter of
Aegis-bearing Zeus, unweariable, hear me now, for you gave no heed to
my prayers when Poseidon was wrecking me. Now, therefore, have pity
upon me and grant that I may find friends and be hospitably received
by the Phaeacians."</p>

<p><milestone n="328" unit="line"/>Thus did he pray, and Athena
heard his prayer, but she would not show herself to him openly, for
she was afraid of her uncle Poseidon, who was still furious in his
endeavors to prevent Odysseus from getting home.
<milestone n="331" unit="line"/></p>
</div2></div1>

<div1 type="Book" n="7">
<head>Scroll 7</head>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Thus, then, did Odysseus wait and
pray; but the girl drove on to the town. When she reached her
father's house she drew up at the gateway, and her brothers -
comely as the gods - gathered round her, took the mules out of the
wagon, and carried the clothes into the house, while she went to her
own room, where an old servant, Eurymedousa of Apeira, lit the fire
for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira, and had
been chosen as a prize for Alkinoos because he was king over the
Phaeacians, and the people in the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> obeyed him as
though he were a god. She had been nurse to Nausicaa, and had now lit
the fire for her, and brought her supper for her into her own
room.</p>

<p><milestone n="14" unit="line"/>Presently Odysseus got up to go
towards the town; and Athena shed a thick mist all round him to hide
him in case any of the proud Phaeacians who met him should be rude to
him, or ask him who he was. Then, as he was just entering the town,
she came towards him in the likeness of a little girl carrying a
pitcher. She stood right in front of him, and Odysseus
said:</p>

<p><milestone n="22" unit="line"/>"My dear, will you be so kind as
to show me the house of king Alkinoos? I am an unfortunate foreigner
in distress, and do not know one in your town and
country."</p>

<p><milestone n="27" unit="line"/>Then Athena said, "Yes, father
stranger, I will show you the house you want, for Alkinoos lives
quite close to my own father. I will go before you and show the way,
but say not a word as you go, and do not look at any man, nor ask him
questions; for the people here cannot abide strangers, and do not
like men who come from some other place. They are a sea-faring folk,
and sail the seas by the grace of Poseidon in ships that glide along
like thought, or as a bird in the air."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="37">
<p><milestone n="37" unit="line"/>On this she led the way, and
Odysseus followed in her steps; but not one of the Phaeacians could
see him as he passed through the city in the midst of them; for the
great goddess Athena in her good will towards him had hidden him in a
thick cloud of darkness. He admired their harbors, ships, places of
assembly, and the lofty walls of the city, which, with the palisade
on top of them, were very striking, and when they reached the
king's house Athena said:</p>

<p><milestone n="48" unit="line"/>"This is the house, father
stranger, which you would have me show you. You will find a number of
great people sitting at table, but do not be afraid; go straight in,
for the bolder a man is the more likely he is to carry his point,
even though he is a stranger. First find the queen. Her name is
Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband Alkinoos. They
both descend originally from Poseidon, who was father to Nausithoos
by Periboia, a woman of great beauty. Periboia was the youngest
daughter of Eurymedon, who at one time reigned over the giants, but
he ruined his ill-fated people and lost his own life to
boot.</p>

<p><milestone n="61" unit="line"/>"Poseidon, however, lay with his
daughter, and she had a son by him, the great Nausithoos, who reigned
over the Phaeacians. Nausithoos had two sons Rhexenor and Alkinoos;
Apollo killed the first of them while he was still a bridegroom and
without male issue; but he left a daughter Arete, whom Alkinoos
married, and honors as no other woman is honored of all those that
keep house along with their husbands.</p>

<p><milestone n="69" unit="line"/>"Thus she both was, and still is,
respected beyond measure by her children, by Alkinoos himself, and by
the whole people, who look upon her as a goddess, and greet her
whenever she goes about the city, for she is a thoroughly good woman
both in head [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] and heart, and when any women are
friends of hers, she will help their husbands also to settle their
disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope of
seeing your friends again, and getting safely back to your home and
country."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="78">
<p><milestone n="78" unit="line"/>Then Athena left <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Scheria</placeName> and went
away over the sea. She went to Marathon and to the spacious streets
of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, where she entered the abode of Erechtheus; but Odysseus
went on to the house of Alkinoos, and he pondered much as he paused a
while before reaching the threshold of bronze, for the splendor of
the palace was like that of the sun or moon. The walls on either side
were of bronze from end to end, and the cornice was of blue enamel.
The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of silver that rose from a
floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver and the hook of the door
was of gold.</p>

<p><milestone n="91" unit="line"/>On either side there stood gold
and silver mastiffs which Hephaistos, with his consummate skill, had
fashioned expressly to keep watch over the palace of king Alkinoos;
so they were immortal and could never grow old. Seats were ranged all
along the wall, here and there from one end to the other, with
coverings of fine woven work which the women of the house had made.
Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used to sit and eat and
drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there were golden
figures of young men with lighted torches in their hands, raised on
pedestals, to give light by night to those who were at table. There
are fifty maid servants in the house, some of whom are always
grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the
loom, or sit and spin, and their shuttles go, backwards and forwards
like the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen is so closely
woven that it will turn oil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors
in the world, so their women excel all others in weaving, for Athena
has taught them all manner of useful arts, and they are very
intelligent.</p>

<p><milestone n="112" unit="line"/>Outside the gate of the outer
court there is a large garden of about four acres with a wall all
round it. It is full of beautiful trees - pears, pomegranates, and
the most delicious apples. There are luscious figs also, and olives
in full growth. The fruits never rot nor fail all the year round,
neither winter nor summer, for the air is so soft that a new crop
ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on pear, apple on
apple, and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for there is an
excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this, the grapes
are being made into raisins; in another part they are being gathered;
some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on have shed
their blossom and are beginning to show fruit, others again are just
changing color. In the furthest part of the ground there are
beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year
round. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts throughout
the whole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the
outer court to the house itself, and the town's people draw
water from it. Such, then, were the splendors with which the gods had
endowed the house of king Alkinoos.</p>

<p><milestone n="133" unit="line"/>So here Odysseus stood for a
while and looked about him, but when he had looked long enough he
crossed the threshold and went within the precincts of the house.
There he found all the chief people among the Phaeacians making their
drink-offerings to Hermes, which they always did the last thing
before going away for the night. He went straight through the court,
still hidden by the cloak of darkness in which Athena had enveloped
him, till he reached Arete and King Alkinoos; then he laid his hands
upon the knees of the queen, and at that moment the miraculous
darkness fell away from him and he became visible. Every one was
speechless with surprise at seeing a man there, but Odysseus began at
once with his petition.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="146">
<p><milestone n="146" unit="line"/>"Queen Arete," he exclaimed,
"daughter of great Rhexenor, in my distress I humbly pray you, as
also your husband and these your guests (whom may heaven prosper with
long life and happiness [<term lang="xgreek">olbos</term>], and may they leave
their possessions to their children, and all the honors conferred
upon them by the state [<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>]) to help me home
to my own country as soon as possible; for I have been long in
trouble and away from my friends."</p>

<p><milestone n="153" unit="line"/>Then he sat down on the hearth
among the ashes and they all held their peace, till presently the old
hero Echeneus, who was an excellent speaker and an elder among the
Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty addressed them
thus:</p>

<p><milestone n="159" unit="line"/>"Alkinoos," said he, "it is not
creditable to you that a stranger should be seen sitting among the
ashes of your hearth; every one is waiting to hear what you are about
to say; tell him, then, to rise and take a seat on a stool inlaid
with silver, and bid your servants mix some wine and water that we
may make a drink-offering to Zeus the lord of thunder, who takes all
well-disposed suppliants under his protection; and let the
housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever there may be in the
house."</p>

<p><milestone n="167" unit="line"/>When Alkinoos heard this he took
Odysseus by the hand, raised him from the hearth, and bade him take
the seat of Laodamas, who had been sitting beside him, and was his
favorite son. A maid servant then brought him water in a beautiful
golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for him to wash his
hands, and she drew a clean table beside him; an upper servant
brought him bread and offered him many good things of what there was
in the house, and Odysseus ate and drank. Then Alkinoos said to one
of the servants, "Pontonoos, mix a cup of wine and hand it round that
we may make drink-offerings to Zeus the lord of thunder, who is the
protector of all well-disposed suppliants."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="182">
<p><milestone n="182" unit="line"/>Pontonoos then mixed wine and
water, and handed it round after giving every man his drink-offering.
When they had made their offerings, and had drunk each as much as he
was minded, Alkinoos said:</p>

<p><milestone n="186" unit="line"/>"Aldermen and town councilors of
the Phaeacians, hear my words. You have had your supper, so now go
home to bed. Tomorrow morning I shall invite a still larger number of
aldermen, and will give a sacrificial banquet in honor of our guest;
we can then discuss the question of his escort, and consider how we
may at once send him back rejoicing to his own country without toil
[<term lang="xgreek">ponos</term>] or inconvenience to himself, no matter how
distant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm while on his
homeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have to take
the luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It
is possible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals who
has come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods are
departing from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made
themselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them
hecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our
selves, and if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one
or other of them, they affect no concealment, for we are as near of
kin to the gods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants
are."</p>

<p><milestone n="207" unit="line"/>Then Odysseus said: "Pray,
Alkinoos, do not take any such notion into your head. I have nothing
of the immortal about me, neither in body nor mind, and most resemble
those among you who are the most afflicted. Indeed, were I to tell
you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me, you would say that I
was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless, let me sup in spite
of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very importunate thing, and
thrusts itself on a man's notice no matter how dire is his
distress [<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>]. I am in great distress
[<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>], yet it insists that I shall eat and drink,
bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only on the due
replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, do as you propose, and at
break of day set about helping me to get home. I shall be content to
die if I may first once more behold my property, my bondsmen, and all
the greatness of my house."</p>

<p><milestone n="226" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak. Every one
approved his saying, and agreed that he should have his escort
inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when they had made their
drink-offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded they
went home to bed every man in his own abode, leaving Odysseus in the
room with Arete and Alkinoos while the servants were taking the
things away after supper. Arete was the first to speak, for she
recognized the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Odysseus was
wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said,
"Stranger, before we go any further, there is a question I should
like to ask you. Who, and whence are you, and who gave you those
clothes? Did you not say you had come here from beyond the
sea?"</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="240">
<p><milestone n="240" unit="line"/>And Odysseus answered, "It would
be a long story, Lady, were I to relate in full the tale of my
misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been laid heavy upon me; but
as regards your question, there is an island far away in the sea
which is called &lsquo;the Ogygian.&rsquo; Here dwells the cunning and
powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by herself far
from all neighbors human or divine. A <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term>, however,
led me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for Zeus struck my ship
with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave
comrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and
was carried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at
last during the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to
the Ogygian island where the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me
in and treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make
me immortal that I might never grow old, but she could not persuade
me to let her do so.</p>

<p><milestone n="259" unit="line"/>"I stayed with Calypso seven
years straight on end, and watered the good clothes she gave me with
my tears during the whole time; but at last when the eighth year came
round she bade me depart of her own free will, either because Zeus
had told her she must, or because she had changed her mind
[<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>]. She sent me from her island on a raft, which
she provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave
me good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and
fair. Seventeen days did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I
caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast -
and glad indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was
still much trouble in store for me, for at this point Poseidon would
let me go no further, and raised a great storm against me; the sea
was so terribly high that I could no longer keep to my raft, which
went to pieces under the fury of the gale, and I had to swim for it,
till wind and current brought me to your shores.</p>

<p><milestone n="278" unit="line"/>"There I tried to land, but could
not, for it was a bad place and the waves dashed me against the
rocks, so I again took to the sea and swam on till I came to a river
that seemed the most likely landing place, for there were no rocks
and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then, I got out of the
water and gathered my senses together again. Night was coming on, so
I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I covered myself all
over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off into a very deep
sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the leaves all night,
and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke as the sun was
westering, and saw your daughter's maid servants playing upon
the beach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I
besought her aid, and she proved to be of an excellent disposition,
much more so than could be expected from so young a person - for
young people are apt to be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread
and wine, and when she had had me washed in the river she also gave
me the clothes in which you see me. Now, therefore, though it has
pained me to do so, I have told you the whole truth
[<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;theia</term>]."</p>

<p><milestone n="298" unit="line"/>Then Alkinoos said, "Stranger, it
was very wrong of my daughter not to bring you on at once to my house
along with the maids, seeing that she was the first person whose aid
you asked."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="302">
<p><milestone n="302" unit="line"/>"Pray do not scold her," replied
Odysseus; "she is not to blame. She did tell me to follow along with
the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid, for I thought you might
perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every human being is sometimes a
little suspicious and irritable."</p>

<p><milestone n="308" unit="line"/>"Stranger," replied Alkinoos, "I
am not the kind of man to get angry about nothing; it is always
better to be reasonable; but by Father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, now
that I see what kind of person you are, and how much you think as I
do, I wish you would stay here, marry my daughter, and become my
son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you a house and an estate,
but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here against your own wish,
and that you may be sure of this I will attend tomorrow to the matter
of your escort. You can sleep during the whole voyage if you like,
and the men shall sail you over smooth waters either to your own
home, or wherever you please, even though it be a long way further
off than <placeName key="tgn,7002677">Euboea</placeName>, which those of my people who saw it when they took
yellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of Gaia, tell me is
the furthest of any place - and yet they did the whole voyage in a
single day without distressing themselves, and came back again
afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships excel all others, and
what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are."</p>

<p><milestone n="329" unit="line"/>Then was Odysseus glad and prayed
aloud saying, "Father Zeus, grant that Alkinoos may do all as he has
said, for so he will win an imperishable <term lang="xgreek">kleos</term> among
humankind, and at the same time I shall return to my
country."</p>

<p><milestone n="334" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse. Then
Arete told her maids to set a bed in the room that was in the
gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to spread coverlets on
the top of them with woolen cloaks for Odysseus to wear. The maids
thereon went out with torches in their hands, and when they had made
the bed they came up to Odysseus and said, "Rise, sir stranger, and
come with us for your bed is ready," and glad indeed was he to go to
his rest.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="344">
<p><milestone n="344" unit="line"/>So Odysseus slept in a bed placed
in a room over the echoing gateway; but Alkinoos lay in the inner
part of the house, with the queen his wife by his side.
<milestone n="347" unit="line"/></p>
</div2></div1>

<div1 type="Book" n="8">

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Now when the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alkinoos and Odysseus both rose, and
Alkinoos led the way to the Phaeacian place of assembly, which was
near the ships. When they got there they sat down side by side on a
seat of polished stone, while Athena took the form of one of
Alkinoos&rsquo; servants, and went round the town in order to contrive
<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term> for great-hearted Odysseus. She went up to the
citizens, man by man, and said, "Aldermen and town councilors of the
Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to the
stranger who has just come off a long voyage to the house of King
Alkinoos; he looks like an immortal god."</p>

<p><milestone n="15" unit="line"/>With these words she made them all
want to come, and they flocked to the assembly till seats and
standing room were alike crowded. Every one was struck with the
appearance of Odysseus, for Athena had beautified
[<term lang="xgreek">kharis</term>] him about the head and shoulders, making him
look taller and stouter than he really was, that he might impress the
Phaeacians favorably as being a very remarkable man, and might come
off well in the many trials [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>] of skill to which
they would challenge him. Then, when they were got together, Alkinoos
spoke:</p>

<p><milestone n="26" unit="line"/>"Hear me," said he, "aldermen and
town councilors of the Phaeacians, that I may speak even as I am
minded. This stranger, whoever he may be, has found his way to my
house from somewhere or other either East or West. He wants an escort
and wishes to have the matter settled. Let us then get one ready for
him, as we have done for others before him; indeed, no one who ever
yet came to my house has been able to complain of me for not speeding
on his way soon enough. Let us draw a ship into the sea - one that
has never yet made a voyage - and man her with two and fifty of our
choicest [<term lang="xgreek">kr&icirc;n&ocirc;</term>] young sailors in the
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos.</term> Then when you have made fast your oars each by
his own seat, leave the ship and come to my house to prepare a feast.
I will provide you with everything. I am giving these instructions to
the young men who will form the crew, for as regards you aldermen and
town councilors, you will join me in entertaining our guest in the
cloisters. I can take no excuses, and we will have Demodokos to sing
to us; for there is no bard like him whatever he may choose to sing
about."</p>

<p><milestone n="46" unit="line"/>Alkinoos then led the way, and the
others followed after, while a servant went to fetch Demodokos. The
fifty-two picked [<term lang="xgreek">kr&icirc;n&ocirc;</term>] oarsmen went to
the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they
drew the ship into the water, got her mast and sails inside her,
bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all
in due course, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the
vessel a little way out from land, and then came on shore and went to
the house of King Alkinoos. The outhouses, yards, and all the
precincts were filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old
and young; and Alkinoos killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown
pigs, and two oxen. These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a
magnificent banquet.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="62">
<p><milestone n="62" unit="line"/>A servant presently led in the
famous bard Demodokos, whom the muse had dearly loved, but to whom
she had given both good and evil, for though she had endowed him with
a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of his eyesight. Pontonoos
set a seat for him among the guests, leaning it up against a
bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his head, and
showed him where he was to feel for it with his hands. He also set a
fair table with a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup of wine
from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed.</p>

<p><milestone n="71" unit="line"/>The company then laid their hands
upon the good things that were before them, but as soon as they had
had enough to eat and drink, the muse inspired Demodokos to sing the
feats [<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] of heroes, and most especially a matter
whose <term lang="xgreek">kleos</term> at that time reached wide heaven, to wit, the
quarrel [<term lang="xgreek">neikos</term>] between Odysseus and Achilles, and
the fierce words that they heaped on one another as they sat together
at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad in his <term lang="xgreek">noos</term> when he heard
his chieftains quarreling with one another, for Apollo had foretold
him this at <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName> when he crossed the stone floor to consult the
oracle. Here the beginning of the evil started rolling down, by the
will of Zeus, toward both Danaans and Trojans.</p>

<p><milestone n="83" unit="line"/>Thus sang the bard, but Odysseus
drew his purple mantle over his head and covered his face, for he was
ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that he was weeping. When the bard
left off singing he wiped the tears from his eyes, uncovered his
face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering to the gods; but
when the Phaeacians pressed Demodokos to sing further, for they
delighted in his lays, then Odysseus again drew his mantle over his
head and wept bitterly. No one noticed his distress except Alkinoos,
who was sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that he was
heaving. So he at once said, "Aldermen and town councilors of the
Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast, and of the
minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore to
the athletic sports [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>], so that our guest on his
return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass all
other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners."</p>

<p><milestone n="104" unit="line"/>With these words he led the way,
and the others followed after. A servant hung Demodokos&rsquo; lyre on
its peg for him, led him out of the room, and set him on the same way
as that along which all the chief men of the Phaeacians were going to
see the sports; a crowd of several thousand people followed them, and
there were many excellent competitors for all the prizes. Akroneos,
Okyalos, Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, Anchialos, Eretmeus, Ponteus,
Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineos, and Amphialos son of Polyneos son of
Tekton. There was also Euryalos son of Naubolos, who was like Ares
himself, and was the best looking man among the Phaeacians except
Laodamas. Three sons of Alkinoos, Laodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus,
competed also.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="120">
<p><milestone n="120" unit="line"/>The foot races came first. The
course was set out for them from the starting post, and they raised a
dust upon the plain as they all flew forward at the same moment.
Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he left every one else behind
him by the length of the furrow that a couple of mules can plough in
a fallow field. They then turned to the painful art of wrestling, and
here Euryalos proved to be the best man. Amphialos excelled all the
others in jumping, while at throwing the disc there was no one who
could approach Elatreus. Alkinoos&rsquo; son Laodamas was the best
boxer, and he it was who presently said, when they had all been
diverted with the games [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>], "Let us ask the
stranger whether he excels in any of these sports
[<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>]; he seems very powerfully built; his thighs,
calves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength, nor is he at all
old, but he has suffered much lately, and there is nothing like the
sea for making havoc with a man, no matter how strong he
is."</p>

<p><milestone n="140" unit="line"/>"You are quite right, Laodamas,"
replied Euryalos, "go up to your guest and speak to him about it
yourself."</p>

<p><milestone n="143" unit="line"/>When Laodamas heard this he made
his way into the middle of the crowd and said to Odysseus, "I hope,
sir, that you will enter yourself in some one or other of our
competitions [<term lang="xgreek">athloi</term>] if you are skilled in any of
them - for you seem to know of <term lang="xgreek">athloi</term> . There is no greater
<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term> for a man all his life long as the showing himself good
with his hands and feet. Have a try therefore at something, and
banish all sorrow from your mind. Your return home will not be long
delayed, for the ship is already drawn into the water, and the crew
is found."</p>

<p><milestone n="152" unit="line"/>Odysseus answered, "Laodamas, why
do you taunt me in this way? My mind is set rather on cares than
contests <term lang="xgreek">athloi</term>; I have been through infinite trouble, and am
come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king and
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> to further me on my return home
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="158">
<p><milestone n="158" unit="line"/>Then Euryalos reviled him
outright and said, "I gather, then, that you are unskilled in any of
the many sports <term lang="xgreek">athloi</term> that men generally delight in. I
suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships
as captains or merchants, and who think of nothing but of their
outward freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to be much
of the athlete [<term lang="xgreek">athl&ecirc;t&ecirc;s</term>] about
you."</p>

<p><milestone n="165" unit="line"/>"For shame, sir," answered
Odysseus, fiercely, "you are an insolent man - so true is it that the
gods do not grace all men alike in speech, person, and understanding.
One man may be of weak presence, but heaven has adorned this with
such a good conversation that he charms every one who sees him; his
honeyed moderation [<term lang="xgreek">aid&ocirc;s</term>] carries his hearers
with him so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows, and
wherever he goes he is looked up to. Another may be as handsome as a
god, but his good looks are not crowned with verbal grace
[<term lang="xgreek">kharis</term>]. This is your case. No god could make a finer
looking man than you are, but you are empty with respect to
<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>. Your ill-judged remarks [contrary to
<term lang="xgreek">kosmos</term>] have made me exceedingly angry, for I excel in a
great many athletic exercises [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>]; indeed, so
long as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of
the age. Now, however, I am worn out by labor and sorrow, for I have
gone through much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the
weary sea; still, in spite of all this I will compete
[<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>], for your taunts have stung me to the
quick."</p>

<p><milestone n="186" unit="line"/>So he hurried up without even
taking his cloak off, and seized a disc, larger, more massive and
much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians when disc-throwing
among themselves. Then, swinging it back, he threw it from his brawny
hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he did so. The
Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it sped
gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark
[<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>] that had been made yet. Athena, in the
form of a man, came and marked the place where it had fallen. "A
blind man, sir," said she, "could easily tell your mark
[<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>] by groping for it - it is so far ahead of
any other. You may make your mind easy about this contest
[<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>], for no Phaeacian can come near to such a
throw as yours."</p>

<p><milestone n="199" unit="line"/>Odysseus was glad when he found
he had a friend among the lookers-on, so he began to speak more
pleasantly. "Young men," said he, "come up to that throw if you can,
and I will throw another disc as heavy or even heavier. If anyone
wants to have a bout with me let him come on, for I am exceedingly
angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I do not care what it is, with
any man of you all except Laodamas, but not with him because I am his
guest, and one cannot compete with one's own personal friend. At
least I do not think it a prudent or a sensible thing for a guest to
challenge his host's family at any game [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>],
especially when he is in a foreign <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>. He will cut
the ground from under his own feet if he does; but I make no
exception as regards any one else, for I want to have the matter out
and know which is the best man. I am a good hand at every kind of
athletic sport [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>] known among humankind. I am an
excellent archer. In battle I am always the first to bring a man down
with my arrow, no matter how many more are taking aim at him
alongside of me. Philoctetes was the only man who could shoot better
than I could when we Achaeans were before the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of
the Trojans. I far excel every one else in the whole world, of those
who still eat bread upon the face of the earth, but I should not like
to shoot against the mighty dead, such as Herakles, or Eurytos the
Cechalian- men who could shoot against the gods themselves. This in
fact was how Eurytos came prematurely by his end, for Apollo was
angry with him and killed him because he challenged him as an archer.
I can throw a dart farther than any one else can shoot an arrow.
Running is the only point in respect of which I am afraid some of the
Phaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought down very low at
sea; my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still
weak."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="234">
<p><milestone n="234" unit="line"/>They all held their peace except
King Alkinoos, who began, "Sir, we have had much pleasure in hearing
all that you have told us, from which I understand that you are
willing to show your prowess [<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>], as having
been displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made to you
by one of our athletes, and which could never have been uttered by
any one who knows how to talk with propriety. I hope you will
apprehend my meaning, and will explain to any one of your chief men
who may be dining with yourself and your family when you get home,
that we have an hereditary aptitude [<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>] for
accomplishments of all kinds. We are not particularly remarkable for
our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are singularly fleet of foot
and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of good dinners,
music, and dancing [<term lang="xgreek">khoros</term>]; we also like frequent
changes of linen, warm baths, and good beds; so now, please, some of
you who are the best dancers set about dancing, that our guest on his
return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass all
other nations as sailors, runners, dancers, minstrels. Demodokos has
left his lyre at my house, so run some one or other of you and fetch
it for him."</p>

<p><milestone n="256" unit="line"/>On this a servant hurried off to
bring the lyre from the king's house, and the nine men who had
been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was their business to
manage everything connected with the sports, so they made the ground
smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers
[<term lang="xgreek">khoros</term>]. Presently the servant came back with
Demodokos&rsquo; lyre, and he took his place in the midst of them,
whereon the best young dancers [<term lang="xgreek">khoros</term>] in the town
began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Odysseus was delighted with
the merry twinkling of their feet.</p>

<p><milestone n="266" unit="line"/>Meanwhile the bard began to sing
the loves of Ares and Aphrodite, and how they first began their
intrigue in the house of Hephaistos. Ares made Aphrodite many
presents, and defiled lord Hephaistos&rsquo; marriage bed, so the sun,
who saw what they were about, told Hephaistos. Hephaistos was very
angry when he heard such dreadful news, so he went to his smithy
brooding mischief, got his great anvil into its place, and began to
forge some chains which none could either unloose or break, so that
they might stay there in that place. When he had finished his snare
he went into his bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with
chains like cobwebs; he also let many hang down from the great beam
of the ceiling. Not even a god could see them, so fine and subtle
were they. As soon as he had spread the chains all over the bed, he
made as though he were setting out for the fair state of <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>,
which of all places in the world was the one he was most fond of. But
Ares kept no blind look out, and as soon as he saw him start, hurried
off to his house, burning with love for Aphrodite.</p>

<p><milestone n="289" unit="line"/>Now Aphrodite was just come in
from a visit to her father Zeus, and was about sitting down when Ares
came inside the house, and said as he took her hand in his own, "Let
us go to the couch of Hephaistos: he is not at home, but is gone off
to <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName> among the Sintians, whose speech is barbarous."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="295">
<p><milestone n="295" unit="line"/>She was not unwilling, so they
went to the couch to take their rest, whereon they were caught in the
toils which cunning Hephaistos had spread for them, and could neither
get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too late that they were in a
trap. Then Hephaistos came up to them, for he had turned back before
reaching <placeName key="tgn,7011173">Lemnos</placeName>, when his scout the sun told him what was going on.
He was in a furious passion, and stood in the vestibule making a
dreadful noise as he shouted to all the gods.</p>

<p><milestone n="306" unit="line"/>"Father Zeus," he cried, "and all
you other blessed gods who live for ever, come here and see the
ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I will show you. Zeus&rsquo;
daughter Aphrodite is always dishonoring me because I am lame. She is
in love with Ares, who is handsome and clean built, whereas I am a
cripple - but my parents are responsible [<term lang="xgreek">aitioi</term>] for
that, not I; they ought never to have begotten me. Come and see the
pair together asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at them.
They are very fond of one another, but I do not think they will lie
there longer than they can help, nor do I think that they will sleep
much; there, however, they shall stay till her father has repaid me
the sum I gave him for his baggage of a daughter, who is fair but not
honest."</p>

<p><milestone n="321" unit="line"/>On this the gods gathered to the
house of Hephaistos. Earth-encircling Poseidon came, and Hermes the
bringer of luck, and lord Apollo, but the goddesses stayed at home
all of them for shame. Then the givers of all good things stood in
the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with inextinguishable
laughter, as they saw how cunning Hephaistos had been, whereon one
would turn towards his neighbor saying:</p>

<p><milestone n="329" unit="line"/>"Ill deeds do not bring
<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>, and the weak confound the strong. See how limping
Hephaistos, lame as he is, has caught Ares who is the fleetest god in
heaven; and now Ares will be cast in heavy damages."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="333">
<p><milestone n="333" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse, but lord
Apollo said to Hermes, "Messenger Hermes, giver of good things, you
would not care how strong the chains were, would you, if you could
sleep with Aphrodite?"</p>

<p><milestone n="338" unit="line"/>"King Apollo," answered Hermes,
"I only wish I might get the chance, though there were three times as
many chains - and you might look on, all of you, gods and goddesses,
but I would sleep with her if I could."</p>

<p><milestone n="343" unit="line"/>The immortal gods burst out
laughing as they heard him, but Poseidon took it all seriously, and
kept on imploring Hephaistos to set Ares free again. "Let him go," he
cried, "and I will undertake, as you require, that he shall pay you
all the damages that are held reasonable among the immortal
gods."</p>

<p><milestone n="349" unit="line"/>"Do not," replied Hephaistos,
"ask me to do this; a bad man's bond is bad security; what
remedy could I enforce against you if Ares should go away and leave
his debts behind him along with his chains?"</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="354">
<p><milestone n="354" unit="line"/>"Hephaistos," said Poseidon, "if
Ares goes away without paying his damages, I will pay you myself." So
Hephaistos answered, "In this case I cannot and must not refuse
you."</p>

<p><milestone n="359" unit="line"/>Thereon he loosed the bonds that
bound them, and as soon as they were free they scampered off, Ares to
<placeName key="tgn,7002756">Thrace</placeName> and laughter-loving Aphrodite to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> and to <placeName key="tgn,7002373">Paphos</placeName>, where
is her grove and her altar fragrant with burnt offerings. Here the
Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil of ambrosia such as the
immortal gods make use of, and they clothed her in raiment of the
most enchanting beauty.</p>

<p><milestone n="367" unit="line"/>Thus sang the bard, and both
Odysseus and the seafaring Phaeacians were charmed as they heard
him.</p>

<p><milestone n="370" unit="line"/>Then Alkinoos told Laodamas and
Halios to dance alone, for there was no one to compete with them. So
they took a red ball which Polybos had made for them, and one of them
bent himself backwards and threw it up towards the clouds, while the
other jumped from off the ground and caught it with ease before it
came down again. When they had done throwing the ball straight up
into the air they began to dance, and at the same time kept on
throwing it backwards and forwards to one another, while all the
young men in the ring applauded and made a great stamping with their
feet. Then Odysseus said:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="382">
<p><milestone n="382" unit="line"/>"King Alkinoos, you said your
people were the nimblest dancers in the world, and indeed they have
proved themselves to be so. I was astonished as I saw
them."</p>

<p><milestone n="385" unit="line"/>The king was delighted at this,
and exclaimed to the Phaeacians "Aldermen and town councilors, our
guest seems to be a person of singular judgment; let us give him such
proof of our hospitality as he may reasonably expect. There are
twelve chief men throughout the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>, and counting
myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean cloak, a
shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in a lump
down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so with a
light heart. As for Euryalos, he will have to make a formal apology
and a present too, for he has been rude."</p>

<p><milestone n="398" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak. The others all
of them applauded his saying, and sent their servants to fetch the
presents. Then Euryalos said, "King Alkinoos, I will give the
stranger all the satisfaction you require. He shall have sword, which
is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is of silver. I will also give
him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into which it fits. It will be
worth a great deal to him."</p>

<p><milestone n="406" unit="line"/>As he spoke he placed the sword
in the hands of Odysseus and said, "Good luck to you, father
stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the winds blow it away
with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return, for I understand
you have been long away from home, and have gone through much
hardship."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="412">
<p><milestone n="412" unit="line"/>To which Odysseus answered, "Good
luck to you too my friend, and may the gods grant you every happiness
[<term lang="xgreek">olbos</term>]. I hope you will not miss the sword you have
given me along with your apology."</p>

<p><milestone n="416" unit="line"/>With these words he girded the
sword about his shoulders and towards sundown the presents began to
make their appearance, as the servants of the donors kept bringing
them to the house of King Alkinoos; here his sons received them, and
placed them under their mother's charge. Then Alkinoos led the
way to the house and bade his guests take their seats.</p>

<p><milestone n="424" unit="line"/>"Wife," said he, turning to Queen
Arete, "Go, fetch the best chest we have, and put a clean cloak and
shirt in it. Also, set a copper on the fire and heat some water; our
guest will take a warm bath; see also to the careful packing of the
presents that the noble Phaeacians have made him; he will thus better
enjoy both his supper and the singing that will follow. I shall
myself give him this golden goblet - which is of exquisite
workmanship - that he may be reminded of me for the rest of his life
whenever he makes a drink-offering to Zeus, or to any of the
gods."</p>

<p><milestone n="433" unit="line"/>Then Arete told her maids to set
a large tripod upon the fire as fast as they could, whereon they set
a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire; they threw on sticks
to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played about
the belly of the tripod. Meanwhile Arete brought a magnificent chest
her own room, and inside it she packed all the beautiful presents of
gold and raiment which the Phaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a
cloak and a good shirt from Alkinoos, and said to
Odysseus:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="443">
<p><milestone n="443" unit="line"/>"See to the lid yourself, and
have the whole bound round at once, for fear any one should rob you
by the way when you are asleep in your ship."</p>

<p><milestone n="446" unit="line"/>When Odysseus heard this he put
the lid on the chest and made it fast with a bond that Circe had
taught him. He had done so before an upper servant told him to come
to the bath and wash himself. He was very glad of a warm bath, for he
had had no one to wait upon him ever since he left the house of
Calypso, who as long as he remained with her had taken as good care
of him as though he had been a god. When the servants had done
washing and anointing him with oil, and had given him a clean cloak
and shirt, he left the bath room and joined the guests who were
sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the
bearing-posts supporting the roof of the room, and admired him as she
saw him pass. "Farewell stranger," said she, "do not forget me when
you are safe at home again, for it is to me first that you owe a
ransom for having saved your life."</p>

<p><milestone n="463" unit="line"/>And Odysseus said, "Nausicaa,
daughter of great Alkinoos, may Zeus the mighty husband of Hera,
grant that I may reach my home and see my day of <term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>; so
shall I bless you as a goddess all my days, for it was you who saved
me."</p>

<p><milestone n="469" unit="line"/>When he had said this, he seated
himself beside Alkinoos. Supper was then served, and the wine was
mixed for drinking. A servant led in the favorite bard Demodokos, and
set him in the midst of the company, near one of the bearing-posts
supporting the room, that he might lean against it. Then Odysseus cut
off a piece of roast pork with plenty of fat (for there was abundance
left on the joint) and said to a servant, "Take this piece of pork
over to Demodokos and tell him to eat it; for all the pain his lays
may cause me I will salute him none the less; bards get honor and
respect [<term lang="xgreek">aid&ocirc;s</term>] throughout the world, for the
Muse teaches them their songs and loves them."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="482">
<p><milestone n="482" unit="line"/>The servant carried the pork in
his fingers over to Demodokos, who took it and was very much pleased.
They then laid their hands on the good things that were before them,
and as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Odysseus said to
Demodokos, "Demodokos, there is no one in the world whom I praise
with admiration more than I do you. You must have studied under the
Muse, Zeus&rsquo; daughter, and under Apollo, - with such a sense of
order [<term lang="xgreek">kosmos</term>] do you sing the return of the Achaeans
with all their sufferings and adventures. If you were not there
yourself, you must have heard it all from some one who was. Now,
however, change your song and tell us of the construction
[<term lang="xgreek">kosmos</term>] of the wooden horse which Epeios made with
the assistance of Athena, and which Odysseus got by stratagem into
the fort of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> after freighting it with the men who afterwards
sacked the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will tell all
the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you."</p>

<p><milestone n="499" unit="line"/>The bard, inspired by a god, lit
up the picture of his story, starting at the point where some of the
Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while others, hidden
within the horse, were waiting with Odysseus in the Trojan place of
assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into their
fortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it, and
were in three minds as to what they should do. Some were for breaking
it up then and there; others would have it dragged to the top of the
rock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the precipice;
while yet others were for letting it remain as an offering and
propitiation for the gods. And this was how they settled it in the
end, for the city was doomed when it took in that horse, within which
were all the bravest of the Argives waiting to bring death and
destruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans
issued from the horse, and sacked the town, breaking out from their
ambuscade. He sang how they overran the city here and there and
ravaged it, and how Odysseus went raging like Ares along with
Menelaos to the house of Deiphobos. It was there that the fight raged
most furiously, nevertheless by Athena's help he was
victorious.</p>

<p><milestone n="521" unit="line"/>All this he told, but Odysseus
was overcome as he heard him, and his cheeks were wet with tears. He
wept as a woman weeps when she throws herself on the body of her
husband who has fallen before his own city and people, fighting
bravely in defense of his home and children. She screams aloud and
flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for breath and dying,
but her enemies beat her from behind about the back and shoulders,
and carry her off into slavery, to a life of labor
[<term lang="xgreek">ponos</term>] and sorrow, and the beauty fades from her
cheeks - even so piteously did Odysseus weep, but none of those
present perceived his tears except Alkinoos, who was sitting near
him, and could hear the sobs and sighs that he was heaving. The king,
therefore, at once rose and said:</p>

<p><milestone n="536" unit="line"/>"Aldermen and town councilors of
the Phaeacians, let Demodokos cease his song, for there are those
present who do not seem to like it. From the moment that we had done
supper and Demodokos began to sing, our guest has been all the time
groaning and lamenting. He is evidently in great distress
[<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>], so let the bard leave off, that we may all
enjoy ourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it
should be, for all these festivities, with the escort and the
presents that we are making with so much good will, are wholly in his
honor, and any one with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows
that he ought to treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his
own brother.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="548">
<p><milestone n="548" unit="line"/>"Therefore, sir, do you on your
part affect no more concealment nor reserve in the matter about which
I shall ask you; it will be more polite in you to give me a plain
answer; tell me the name by which your father and mother over yonder
used to call you, and by which you were known among your neighbors
and fellow-citizens. There is no one, neither rich nor poor, who is
absolutely without any name whatever, for people's fathers and
mothers give them names as soon as they are born. Tell me also your
country, nation <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>, and city, that our ships may
shape their purpose accordingly and take you there. For the
Phaeacians have no pilots; their vessels have no rudders as those of
other nations have, but the ships themselves understand what it is
that we are thinking about and want; they know all the cities and
countries in the whole world, and can traverse the sea just as well
even when it is covered with mist and cloud, so that there is no
danger of being wrecked or coming to any harm. Still I do remember
hearing my father say that Poseidon was angry with us for being too
easy-going in the matter of giving people escorts. He said that one
of these days he should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from
having escorted some one, and envelop our city with a high mountain.
This is what the old man used to say, but whether the god will carry
out his threat or no is a matter which he will decide for
himself.</p>

<p><milestone n="572" unit="line"/>And now, tell me and tell me
true. Where have you been wandering, and in what countries have you
traveled? Tell us of the peoples themselves, and of their cities -
who were hostile, savage and uncivilized [not
<term lang="xgreek">dikaios</term>], and who, on the other hand, hospitable and
endowed with a god-fearing <term lang="xgreek">noos</term>. Tell us also why you are made
unhappy on hearing about the return of the Argive Danaans from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.
The gods arranged all this, and sent them their misfortunes in order
that future generations might have something to sing about. Did you
lose some brave kinsman of your wife's when you were before
<placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>? A son-in-law or father-in-law - which are the nearest relations
a man has outside his own flesh and blood? Or was it some brave and
kindly-natured comrade - for a good friend is as dear to a man as his
own brother?" <milestone n="586" unit="line"/></p>

Alkinoos, it is a good thing to hear a bard with such a divine voice
as this man has. There is nothing better or more delightful than when
merriment [<term lang="xgreek">euphrosun&ecirc;</term>] prevails over a whole
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>, with the guests sitting orderly to listen, while
the table is loaded with bread and meats, and the cup-bearer draws
wine and fills his cup for every man. This is indeed as fair a sight
as a man can see. Now, however, since you are inclined to ask the
story of my sorrows, and rekindle my own sad memories in respect of
them, I do not know how to begin, nor yet how to continue and
conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon
me.</p>

<p><milestone n="16" unit="line"/>"Firstly, then, I will tell you my
name that you too may know it, and that one day, if I outlive this
time of sorrow, I may become a guest-friend to you, though I live so
far away from all of you. I am Odysseus son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, renowned
among humankind for all manner of subtlety, so that my <term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>
ascends to heaven. I live in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, where there is a high mountain
called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from it there is a
group of islands very near to one another - Dulichium, Same, and the
wooded island of <placeName key="tgn,7011374">Zacynthus</placeName>. It lies squat on the horizon, all highest
up in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie away from it
towards dawn. It is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my
eyes know none that they better love to look upon. The goddess
Calypso kept me with her in her cave, and wanted me to marry her, as
did also the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they could neither of
them persuade me, for there is nothing dearer to a man than his own
country and his parents, and however splendid a home he may have in a
foreign country, if it be far from father or mother, he does not care
about it. Now, however, I will tell you of the many hazardous
adventures which by Zeus&rsquo; will I met with on my return
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>.</p>

<p><milestone n="39" unit="line"/>"When I had set sail thence the
wind took me first to Ismaros, which is the city of the Kikones.
There I sacked the town and put the people to the sword. We took
their wives and also much booty, which we divided equitably amongst
us, so that none might have reason to complain. I then said that we
had better make off at once, but my men very foolishly would not obey
me, so they stayed there drinking much wine and killing great numbers
of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the Kikones cried out
for help to other Kikones who lived inland. These were more in
number, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of war,
for they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the occasion
served; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as leaves and
bloom in summertime [<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>], and the hand of
heaven was against us, so that we were hard pressed. They set the
battle in array near the ships, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod
spears at one another. So long as the day waxed and it was still
morning, we held our own against them, though they were more in
number than we; but as the sun went down, towards the time when men
loose their oxen, the Kikones got the better of us, and we lost half
a dozen men from every ship we had; so we got away with those that
were left.</p>

<p><milestone n="62" unit="line"/>"Thence we sailed onward with
sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we had
lost our comrades, nor did we leave till we had thrice invoked each
one of the poor men who had perished by the hands of the Kikones.
Then Zeus raised the North wind against us till it blew a blast of
wind, so that land and sky were hidden in thick clouds, and night
sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships run before the
gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters, so we took
them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest towards the
land. There we lay two days and two nights suffering much alike from
toil and distress of mind, but on the morning of the third day we
again raised our masts, set sail, and took our places, letting the
wind and steersmen direct our ship. I should have got home at that
time unharmed had not the North wind and the currents been against me
as I was doubling Cape Malea, and set me off my course hard by the
island of <placeName key="tgn,7010869">Cythera</placeName>.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="82">
<p><milestone n="82" unit="line"/>"I was driven thence by foul winds
for a space of nine days upon the sea, but on the tenth day we
reached the land of the Lotus-eaters, who live on a food that comes
from a kind of flower. Here we landed to take in fresh water, and our
crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near the ships. When they
had eaten and drunk I chose [<term lang="xgreek">krin&ocirc;</term>] two of my
company to go see what manner of men the people of the place might
be, and they had a third man under them. They started at once, and
went about among the Lotus-eaters, who did them no harm, but gave
them to eat of the lotus, which was so delicious that those who ate
of it left off caring about home, and did not even want to go back
and say what had happened to them, but were for staying and munching
lotus with the Lotus-eaters without thinking further of their
<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>; nevertheless, though they wept bitterly I forced them
back to the ships and made them fast under the benches. Then I told
the rest to go on board at once, lest any of them should taste of the
lotus and leave off wanting to achieve a homecoming
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>], so they took their places and smote the gray
sea with their oars.</p>

<p><milestone n="105" unit="line"/>"We sailed hence, always in much
distress, till we came to the land of the lawless and inhuman
Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither plant nor plough, but trust in
providence, and live on such wheat, barley, and grapes as grow wild
without any kind of tillage, and their wild grapes yield them wine as
the sun and the rain may grow them. They have no laws nor assemblies
of the people, but live in caves on the tops of high mountains; each
is lord and master in his family, and they take no account of their
neighbors.</p>

<p><milestone n="116" unit="line"/>"Now off their harbor there lies
a wooded and fertile island not quite close to the land of the
Cyclopes, but still not far. It is overrun with wild goats, that
breed there in great numbers and are never disturbed by foot of man;
for sportsmen - who as a rule will suffer so much hardship in forest
or among mountain precipices - do not go there, nor yet again is it
ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a wilderness untilled and
unsown from year to year, and has no living thing upon it but only
goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships, nor yet shipwrights who could
make ships for them; they cannot therefore go from city to city, or
sail over the sea to one another's country as people who have
ships can do; if they had had these they would have colonized the
island, for it is a very good one, and would yield everything in due
season. There are meadows that in some places come right down to the
sea shore, well watered and full of luscious grass; grapes would do
there excellently; there is level land for ploughing, and it would
always yield heavily at harvest time [<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>], for
the soil is deep. There is a good harbor where no cables are wanted,
nor yet anchors, nor need a ship be moored, but all one has to do is
to beach one's vessel and stay there till the wind becomes fair
for putting out to sea again. At the head of the harbor there is a
spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and there are poplars
growing all round it.</p>

<p><milestone n="142" unit="line"/>"Here we entered, but so dark was
the night that some god must have brought us in, for there was
nothing whatever to be seen. A thick mist hung all round our ships;
the moon was hidden behind a mass of clouds so that no one could have
seen the island if he had looked for it, nor were there any breakers
to tell us we were close in shore before we found ourselves upon the
land itself; when, however, we had beached the ships, we took down
the sails, went ashore and camped upon the beach till
daybreak.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="152">
<p><milestone n="152" unit="line"/>"When the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we admired the island and wandered all
over it, while the nymphs, Zeus&rsquo; daughters, roused the wild
goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On this we fetched
our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and dividing ourselves
into three bands began to shoot the goats. Heaven sent us excellent
sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got nine goats,
while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day to the going
down of the sun we ate and drank our fill, - and we had plenty of
wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full when we sacked
the city of the Kikones, and this had not yet run out. While we were
feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of the Cyclopes,
which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble fires. We could
almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of their sheep
and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped
down upon the beach, and next morning I called a council.</p>

<p><milestone n="172" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Stay here, my brave
men,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;all the rest of you, while I go with my ship
and make trial of these people myself: I want to see if they are
uncivilized [not <term lang="xgreek">dikaios</term>] savages, or a race
hospitable and endowed with a god-fearing
<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="177" unit="line"/>"I went on board, bidding my men
to do so also and loose the hawsers; so they took their places and
smote the gray sea with their oars. When we got to the land, which
was not far, there, on the face of a cliff near the sea, we saw a
great cave overhung with laurels. It was a station for a great many
sheep and goats, and outside there was a large yard, with a high wall
round it made of stones built into the ground and of trees both pine
and oak. This was the abode of a huge monster who was then away from
home shepherding his flocks. He would have nothing to do with other
people, but led the life of an outlaw. He was a horrid creature, not
like a human being at all, but resembling rather some crag that
stands out boldly against the sky on the top of a high
mountain.</p>

<p><milestone n="193" unit="line"/>"I told my men to draw the ship
ashore, and stay where they were, all but the twelve best
[<term lang="xgreek">kr&icirc;n&ocirc;</term>] among them, who were to go along
with myself. I also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had
been given me by Maron, Apollo son of Euanthes, who was priest of
Apollo the patron god of Ismaros, and lived within the wooded
precincts of the temple. When we were sacking the city we respected
him, and spared his life, as also his wife and child; so he made me
some presents of great value - seven talents of fine gold, and a bowl
of silver, with twelve jars of sweet wine, unblended, and of the most
exquisite flavor. Not a man nor maid in the house knew about it, but
only himself, his wife, and one housekeeper: when he drank it he
mixed twenty parts of water to one of wine, and yet the fragrance
from the mixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was impossible to
refrain from drinking. I filled a large skin with this wine, and took
a wallet full of provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that I
might have to deal with some savage who would be of great strength,
and would respect neither right [<term lang="xgreek">dik&ecirc;</term>] nor
law.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="216">
<p><milestone n="216" unit="line"/>"We soon reached his cave, but he
was out shepherding, so we went inside and took stock of all that we
could see. His cheese-racks were loaded with cheeses, and he had more
lambs and kids than his pens could hold. They were kept in separate
flocks; first there were the hoggets, then the oldest of the younger
lambs and lastly the very young ones all kept apart from one another;
as for his dairy, all the vessels, bowls, and milk pails into which
he milked, were swimming with whey. When they saw all this, my men
begged me to let them first steal some cheeses, and make off with
them to the ship; they would then return, drive down the lambs and
kids, put them on board and sail away with them. It would have been
indeed better if we had done so but I would not listen to them, for I
wanted to see the owner himself, in the hope that he might give me a
present. When, however, we saw him my poor men found him ill to deal
with.</p>

<p><milestone n="231" unit="line"/>"We lit a fire, offered some of
the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others of them, and then sat waiting
till the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> should come in with his sheep. When he came, he
brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood to light the fire for
his supper, and this he flung with such a noise on to the floor of
his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far end of the cavern.
Meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside, as well as the she-goats that
he was going to milk, leaving the males, both rams and he-goats,
outside in the yards. Then he rolled a huge stone to the mouth of the
cave - so huge that two and twenty strong four-wheeled wagons would
not be enough to draw it from its place against the doorway. When he
had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats, all in due
course, and then let each of them have her own young. He curdled half
the milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the other half he
poured into bowls that he might drink it for his supper. When he had
got through with all his work, he lit the fire, and then caught sight
of us, whereon he said:</p>

<p><milestone n="252" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Strangers, who are you?
Where do sail from? Are you traders, or do you sail the sea as
rovers, with your hands against every man, and every man's hand
against you?&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="256" unit="line"/>"We were frightened out of our
senses by his loud voice and monstrous form, but I managed to say,
&lsquo;We are Achaeans on our way home from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, but by the will of
Zeus, and stress of weather, we have been driven far out of our
course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, who has won
infinite <term lang="xgreek">kleos</term> throughout the whole world, by sacking so great
a city and killing so many people. We therefore humbly pray you to
show us some hospitality, and otherwise make us such presents as
visitors may reasonably expect. May your excellency give reverence
[<term lang="xgreek">aid&ocirc;s</term>] to the gods, for we are your suppliants,
and Zeus takes all respectable travelers under his protection, for he
is the avenger of all suppliants and foreigners in
distress.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="272">
<p><milestone n="272" unit="line"/>"To this he gave me but a
pitiless answer, &lsquo;Stranger,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you are a fool,
or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me, indeed, about
fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do not care
about Zeus or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever so much
stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your
companions out of any regard for Zeus, unless I am in the humor for
doing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came
on shore. Was it round the point, or is she lying straight off the
land?&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="281" unit="line"/>"He said this to draw me out, but
I was too cunning to be caught in that way, so I answered with a lie;
&lsquo;Poseidon,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;sent my ship on to the rocks at
the far end of your country, and wrecked it. We were driven on to
them from the open sea, but I and those who are with me escaped the
jaws of death.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="287" unit="line"/>"The cruel wretch granted me not
one word of answer, but with a sudden clutch he gripped up two of my
men at once and dashed them down upon the ground as though they had
been puppies. Their brains were shed upon the ground, and the earth
was wet with their blood. Then he tore them limb from limb and supped
upon them. He gobbled them up like a lion in the wilderness, flesh,
bones, marrow, and entrails, without leaving anything uneaten. As for
us, we wept and lifted up our hands to heaven on seeing such a horrid
sight, for we did not know what else to do; but when the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> had
filled his huge paunch, and had washed down his meal of human flesh
with a drink of neat milk, he stretched himself full length upon the
ground among his sheep, and went to sleep. I was at first inclined to
seize my sword, draw it, and drive it into his vitals, but I
reflected that if I did we should all certainly be lost, for we
should never be able to shift the stone which the monster had put in
front of the door. So we stayed sobbing and sighing where we were
till morning came.</p>

<p><milestone n="307" unit="line"/>"When the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, he again lit his fire, milked his goats
and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let each have her own young
one; as soon as he had got through with all his work, he clutched up
two more of my men, and began eating them for his morning's
meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone away from
the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back again -
as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on to a quiver
full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted, and cried
&lsquo;Shoo, shoo,&rsquo; after his sheep to drive them on to the
mountain; so I was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge and
covering myself with glory.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="318">
<p><milestone n="318" unit="line"/>"In the end I deemed it would be
the best plan to do as follows. The <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> had a great club which
was lying near one of the sheep pens; it was of green olive wood, and
he had cut it intending to use it for a staff as soon as it should be
dry. It was so huge that we could only compare it to the mast of a
twenty-oared merchant vessel of large burden, and able to venture out
into open sea. I went up to this club and cut off about six feet of
it; I then gave this piece to the men and told them to fine it evenly
off at one end, which they proceeded to do, and lastly I brought it
to a point myself, charring the end in the fire to make it harder.
When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was lying about all
over the cave, and told the men to cast lots which of them should
venture along with myself to lift it and bore it into the
monster's eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very
four whom I should have chosen, and I myself made five. In the
evening the wretch came back from shepherding, and drove his flocks
into the cave - this time driving them all inside, and not leaving
any in the yards; I suppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god
must have prompted him to do so. As soon as he had put the stone back
to its place against the door, he sat down, milked his ewes and his
goats all quite rightly, and then let each have her own young one;
when he had got through with all this work, he gripped up two more of
my men, and made his supper off them. So I went up to him with an
ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands:</p>

<p><milestone n="347" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Look here, <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>,&rsquo;
said I, 'you have been eating a great deal of man's flesh, so
take this and drink some wine, that you may see what kind of liquor
we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as a
drink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion upon me
and further me on my way home, whereas all you do is to go on ramping
and raving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamed yourself; how
can you expect people to come see you any more if you treat them in
this way?&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="353" unit="line"/>"He then took the cup and drank.
He was so delighted with the taste of the wine that he begged me for
another bowl full. &lsquo;Be so kind,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;as to give
me some more, and tell me your name at once. I want to make you a
present that you will be glad to have. We have wine even in this
country, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them, but this
drinks like nectar and ambrosia all in one.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="360" unit="line"/>"I then gave him some more; three
times did I fill the bowl for him, and three times did he drain it
without thought or heed; then, when I saw that the wine had got into
his head, I said to him as plausibly as I could: &lsquo;<placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, you
ask my name and I will tell it you; give me, therefore, the present
you promised me; my name is Noman; this is what my father and mother
and my friends have always called me.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="368">
<p><milestone n="368" unit="line"/>"But the cruel wretch said,
&lsquo;Then I will eat all Noman's comrades before Noman himself,
and will keep Noman for the last. This is the present that I will
make him.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="371" unit="line"/>As he spoke he reeled, and fell
sprawling face upwards on the ground. His great neck hung heavily
backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon him. Presently he turned
sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets of human flesh on which
he had been gorging, for he was very drunk. Then I thrust the beam of
wood far into the embers to heat it, and encouraged my men lest any
of them should turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green though it
was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat,
and my men gathered round me, for a <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> had filled
their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam into
the monster's eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept
turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a
ship's plank with an auger, which two men with a wheel and strap
can keep on turning as long as they choose. Even thus did we bore the
red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled all over it
as we worked it round and round, so that the steam from the burning
eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of the eye
sputtered in the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into
cold water to temper it - for it is this that gives strength to the
iron - and it makes a great hiss as he does so, even thus did the
<placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>&rsquo; eye hiss round the beam of olive wood, and his hideous
yells made the cave ring again. We ran away in a fright, but he
plucked the beam all besmirched with gore from his eye, and hurled it
from him in a frenzy of rage and pain, shouting as he did so to the
other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak headlands near him; so they
gathered from all quarters round his cave when they heard him crying,
and asked what was the matter with him.</p>

<p><milestone n="403" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;What ails you,
Polyphemus,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;that you make such a noise,
breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being
able to sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no
man is trying to kill you either by fraud or by force
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>]?</p>

<p><milestone n="407" unit="line"/>"But Polyphemus shouted to them
from inside the cave, &lsquo;Noman is killing me by fraud! Noman is
killing me by force [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>]!&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="409">
<p><milestone n="409" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said they,
&lsquo;if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when Zeus makes
people ill, there is no help for it, and you had better pray to your
father Poseidon.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="413" unit="line"/>"Then they went away, and I
laughed inwardly at the success of my clever stratagem, but the
<placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, groaning and in an agony of pain, felt about with his hands
till he found the stone and took it from the door; then he sat in the
doorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch anyone going
out with the sheep, for he thought I might be foolish enough to
attempt this.</p>

<p><milestone n="420" unit="line"/>"As for myself I kept on puzzling
to think how I could best save my own life
[<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] and those of my companions; I schemed
and schemed, as one who knows that his life depends upon it, for the
danger was very great. In the end I deemed that this plan would be
the best. The male sheep were well grown, and carried a heavy black
fleece, so I bound them noiselessly in threes together, with some of
the withies on which the wicked monster used to sleep. There was to
be a man under the middle sheep, and the two on either side were to
cover him, so that there were three sheep to each man. As for myself
there was a ram finer than any of the others, so I caught hold of him
by the back, ensconced myself in the thick wool under his belly, and
hung on patiently to his fleece, face upwards, keeping a firm hold on
it all the time.</p>

<p><milestone n="436" unit="line"/>"Thus, then, did we wait in great
fear of mind till morning came, but when the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep hurried out to feed,
while the ewes remained bleating about the pens waiting to be milked,
for their udders were full to bursting; but their master in spite of
all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they stood upright,
without being sharp enough to find out that the men were underneath
their bellies. As the ram was going out, last of all, heavy with its
fleece and with the weight of my crafty self; Polyphemus laid hold of
it and said:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="447">
<p><milestone n="447" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;My good ram, what is it
that makes you the last to leave my cave this morning? You are not
wont to let the ewes go before you, but lead the mob with a run
whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are the first to
come home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is it because
you know your master has lost his eye, and are sorry because that
wicked Noman and his horrid crew have got him down in his drink and
blinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you could understand
and talk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would
dash his brains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave. I
should thus have some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman
has done me.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="461" unit="line"/>"As spoke he drove the ram
outside, but when we were a little way out from the cave and yards, I
first got from under the ram's belly, and then freed my
comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by constantly
heading them in the right direction we managed to drive them down to
the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who had
escaped death, but wept for the others whom the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> had killed.
However, I made signs to them by nodding and frowning that they were
to hush their crying, and told them to get all the sheep on board at
once and put out to sea; so they went aboard, took their places, and
smote the gray sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out
as my voice would reach, I began to jeer at the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>.</p>

<p><milestone n="475" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;<placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;you should have taken better measure of your man before eating
up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, do you intend by violence
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] to eat up your visitors in your own cave?
You might have known that your derangement would find you out, and
now Zeus and the other gods have punished you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="480" unit="line"/>"He got more and more furious as
he heard me, so he tore the top from off a high mountain, and flung
it just in front of my ship so that it was within a little of hitting
the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell into it, and
the wash of the wave it raised carried us back towards the mainland,
and forced us towards the shore. But I snatched up a long pole and
kept the ship off, making signs to my men by nodding my head, that
they must row for their lives, whereon they laid out with a will.
When we had got twice as far as we were before, I was for jeering at
the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> again, but the men begged and prayed of me to hold my
tongue.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="494">
<p><milestone n="494" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Do not,&rsquo; they
exclaimed, &lsquo;be mad enough to provoke this savage creature
further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us back
again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death of us;
if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have
pounded our heads and our ship's timbers into a jelly with the
rugged rocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long
way.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="500" unit="line"/>"But I would not listen to them,
and shouted out to him in my rage, &lsquo;<placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>, if any one asks you
who it was that put your eye out and spoiled your beauty, say it was
the valiant warrior Odysseus, son of Laertes, who lives in
<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="506" unit="line"/>"On this he groaned, and cried
out, &lsquo;Alas, alas, then the old prophecy about me is coming true.
There was a seer [<term lang="xgreek">mantis</term>] here, at one time, a man
both brave and of great stature, Telemos son of Eurymos, who was an
excellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he
grew old; he told me that all this would happen to me some day, and
said I should lose my sight by the hand of Odysseus. I have been all
along expecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman
strength, whereas he turns out to be a little insignificant weakling,
who has managed to blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my
drink; come here, then, Odysseus, that I may make you presents to
show my hospitality, and urge Poseidon to help you forward on your
journey - for Poseidon and I are father and son. He, if he so will,
shall heal me, which no one else neither god nor man can
do.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="522" unit="line"/>"Then I said, &lsquo;I wish I
could be as sure of killing you outright and sending you down, bereft
of your <term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>, to the house of Hades, as I am that it
will take more than Poseidon to cure that eye of
yours.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="526">
<p><milestone n="526" unit="line"/>"On this he lifted up his hands
to the firmament of heaven and prayed, saying, &lsquo;Hear me, great
Poseidon; if I am indeed your own true-begotten son, grant that
Odysseus may never reach his home alive; or if he must get back to
his friends at last, let him do so late and in sore plight after
losing all his men let him reach his home in another man's ship
and find trouble in his house.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="536" unit="line"/>"Thus did he pray, and Poseidon
heard his prayer. Then he picked up a rock much larger than the
first, swung it aloft and hurled it with prodigious force. It fell
just short of the ship, but was within a little of hitting the end of
the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of
the wave it raised drove us onwards on our way towards the shore of
the island.</p>

<p><milestone n="543" unit="line"/>"When at last we got to the
island where we had left the rest of our ships, we found our comrades
lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our return. We ran our vessel
upon the sands and got out of her on to the sea shore; we also landed
the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName>&rsquo; sheep, and divided them equitably amongst us so
that none might have reason to complain. As for the ram, my
companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share; so I
sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones to Zeus,
who is the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only
thought how he might destroy my ships and my comrades.</p>

<p><milestone n="556" unit="line"/>"Thus through the livelong day to
the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and drink, but
when the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped upon the beach.
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I bade my
men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they took their places and
smote the gray sea with their oars; so we sailed on with sorrow in
our hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we had lost our
comrades. <milestone n="566" unit="line"/></p>

<div1 type="Book" n="10">

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Thence we went on to the Aeolian
island where lives Aeolus son of Hippotas, dear to the immortal gods.
It is an island that floats (as it were) upon the sea, iron bound
with a wall that girds it. Now, Aeolus has six daughters and six sons
in the bloom of youth, so he made the sons marry the daughters, and
they all live with their dear father and mother, feasting and
enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long the
atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savor of roasting meats
till it groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their
well-made bedsteads, each with his own wife between the blankets.
These were the people among whom we had now come.</p>

<p><milestone n="14" unit="line"/>"Aeolus entertained me for a whole
month asking me questions all the time about <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, the <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> fleet,
and the return [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] of the Achaeans. I told him
exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I must go, and
asked him to further me on my way, he made no sort of difficulty, but
set about doing so at once. Moreover, he flayed me a prime ox-hide to
hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut up in the hide as
in a sack - for Zeus had made him captain over the winds, and he
could stir or still each one of them according to his own pleasure.
He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly with a
silver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind could blow from
any quarter. The West wind which was fair for us did he alone let
blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing, for we were lost
through our own folly.</p>

<p><milestone n="28" unit="line"/>"Nine days and nine nights did we
sail, and on the tenth day our native land showed on the horizon. We
got so close in that we could see the stubble fires burning, and I,
being then dead tired, fell into a light sleep, for I had never let
the rudder out of my own hands, that we might get home the faster. On
this the men fell to talking among themselves, and said I was
bringing back gold and silver in the sack that Aeolus had given me.
&lsquo;Bless my heart,&rsquo; would one turn to his neighbor, saying,
&lsquo;how this man gets honored and makes friends in whatever city or
country he may go. See what fine prizes he is taking home from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,
while we, who have traveled just as far as he has, come back with
hands as empty as we set out with - and now Aeolus has given him ever
so much more. Quick - let us see what it all is, and how much gold
and silver there is in the sack he gave him.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="46" unit="line"/>"Thus they talked and evil
counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack, whereupon the wind flew
howling forth and raised a storm that carried us weeping out to sea
and away from our own country. Then I awoke, and knew not whether to
throw myself into the sea or to live on and make the best of it; but
I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down in the ship, while the men
lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our fleet back to the
Aeolian island.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="56">
<p><milestone n="56" unit="line"/>"When we reached it we went ashore
to take in water, and dined hard by the ships. Immediately after
dinner I took a herald and one of my men and went straight to the
house of Aeolus, where I found him feasting with his wife and family;
so we sat down as suppliants on the threshold. They were astounded
when they saw us and said, &lsquo;Odysseus, what brings you here? What
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> has been ill-treating you? We took great pains to
further you on your way home to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, or wherever it was that you
wanted to go to.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="67" unit="line"/>"Thus did they speak, but I
answered sorrowfully, &lsquo;My men have undone me; they, and cruel
sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend me this mischief, for you can
if you will.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="70" unit="line"/>"I spoke as movingly as I could,
but they said nothing, till their father answered, &lsquo;Vilest of
humankind, get you gone at once out of the island; him whom heaven
hates will I in no wise help. Be off, for you come here as one
abhorred of heaven.' And with these words he sent me sorrowing from
his door.</p>

<p><milestone n="77" unit="line"/>"Thence we sailed sadly on till
the men were worn out with long and fruitless rowing, for there was
no longer any wind to help them. Six days, night and day did we toil,
and on the seventh day we reached the rocky stronghold of <placeName key="perseus,Lamos">Lamos</placeName> -
Telepylos, the city of the Laestrygonians, where the shepherd who is
driving in his sheep and goats [to be milked] salutes him who
is driving out his flock [to feed] and this last answers the
salute. In that country a man who could do without sleep might earn
double wages, one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a shepherd,
for they work much the same by night as they do by day.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="87">
<p><milestone n="87" unit="line"/>"When we reached the harbor we
found it land-locked under steep cliffs, with a narrow entrance
between two headlands. My captains took all their ships inside, and
made them fast close to one another, for there was never so much as a
breath of wind inside, but it was always dead calm. I kept my own
ship outside, and moored it to a rock at the very end of the point;
then I climbed a high rock to reconnoiter, but could see no sign
neither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising from the ground. So
I sent two of my company with an attendant to find out what sort of
people the inhabitants were.</p>

<p><milestone n="103" unit="line"/>"The men when they got on shore
followed a level road by which the people draw their firewood from
the mountains into the town, till presently they met a young woman
who had come outside to fetch water, and who was daughter to a
Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was going to the fountain Artacia
from which the people bring in their water, and when my men had come
close up to her, they asked her who the king of that country might
be, and over what kind of people he ruled; so she directed them to
her father's house, but when they got there they found his wife
to be a giantess as huge as a mountain, and they were horrified at
the sight of her.</p>

<p><milestone n="114" unit="line"/>"She at once called her husband
Antiphates from the place of assembly, and forthwith he set about
killing my men. He snatched up one of them, and began to make his
dinner of him then and there, whereon the other two ran back to the
ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates raised a hue and cry
after them, and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians sprang up from
every quarter - ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks at us from the
cliffs as though they had been mere stones, and I heard the horrid
sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and the death
cries of my men, as the Laestrygonians speared them like fishes and
took them home to eat them. While they were thus killing my men
within the harbor I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own ship, and
told my men to row with all their might if they too would not fare
like the rest; so they laid out for their lives, and we were thankful
enough when we got into open water out of reach of the rocks they
hurled at us. As for the others there was not one of them
left.</p>

<p><milestone n="133" unit="line"/>"Thence we sailed sadly on, glad
to have escaped death, though we had lost our comrades, and came to
the Aeaean island, where Circe lives, a great and cunning goddess who
is own sister to the magician Aietes - for they are both children of
the sun by Perse, who is daughter to Okeanos. We brought our ship
into a safe harbor without a word, for some god guided us there, and
having landed we stayed there for two days and two nights, worn out
in body and mind. When the morning of the third day came I took my
spear and my sword, and went away from the ship to reconnoiter, and
see if I could discover signs of human handiwork, or hear the sound
of voices. Climbing to the top of a high look-out I espied the smoke
of Circe's house rising upwards amid a dense forest of trees,
and when I saw this I doubted whether, having seen the smoke, I would
not go on at once and find out more, but in the end I deemed it best
to go back to the ship, give the men their dinners, and send some of
them instead of going myself.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="156">
<p><milestone n="156" unit="line"/>"When I had nearly got back to
the ship some god took pity upon my solitude, and sent a fine
antlered stag right into the middle of my path. He was coming down
his pasture in the forest to drink of the river, for the heat of the
sun drove him, and as he passed I struck him in the middle of the
back; the bronze point of the spear went clean through him, and he
lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of him. Then I set
my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound, and laid it down; I
also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted them into a fathom
or so of good stout rope, with which I bound the four feet of the
noble creature together; having so done I hung him round my neck and
walked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, for the stag was much
too big for me to be able to carry him on my shoulder, steadying him
with one hand. As I threw him down in front of the ship, I called the
men and spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them. &lsquo;Look here
my friends,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;we are not going to die so much
before our time after all, and at any rate we will not starve so long
as we have got something to eat and drink on board.&rsquo; On this
they uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag,
for he was indeed a splendid man. Then, when they had feasted their
eyes upon him sufficiently, they washed their hands and began to cook
him for dinner.</p>

<p><milestone n="183" unit="line"/>"Thus through the livelong day to
the going down of the sun we stayed there eating and drinking our
fill, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we camped upon
the sea shore. When the child of morning, fingered Dawn, appeared, I
called a council and said, &lsquo;My friends, we are in very great
difficulties; listen therefore to me. We have no idea where the sun
either sets or rises, so that we do not even know East from West. I
see no way out of it; nevertheless, we must try and find one. We are
certainly on an island, for I went as high as I could this morning,
and saw the sea reaching all round it to the horizon; it lies low,
but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out of a thick forest
of trees.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="198" unit="line"/>"Their hearts sank as they heard
me, for they remembered how they had been treated by the
Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage ogre Polyphemus. They
wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was nothing to be got by
crying, so I divided them into two companies and set a leader over
each; I gave one company to Eurylokhos, while I took command of the
other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and the lot fell upon
Eurylokhos; so he set out with his twenty-two men, and they wept, as
also did we who were left behind.</p>

<p><milestone n="210" unit="line"/>"When they reached Circe's
house they found it built of cut stones, on a site that could be seen
from far, in the middle of the forest. There were wild mountain
wolves and lions prowling all round it - poor bewitched creatures
whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged into subjection.
They did not attack my men, but wagged their great tails, fawned upon
them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against them. As hounds crowd
round their master when they see him coming from dinner - for they
know he will bring them something - even so did these wolves and
lions with their great claws fawn upon my men, but the men were
terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures. Presently they
reached the gates of the goddess&rsquo; house, and as they stood there
they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as she worked
at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling
colors as no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I
valued and trusted more than any other of my men, said, &lsquo;There
is some one inside working at a loom and singing most beautifully;
the whole place resounds with it, let us call her and see whether she
is woman or goddess.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="229">
<p><milestone n="229" unit="line"/>"They called her and she came
down, unfastened the door, and bade them enter. They, thinking no
evil, followed her, all except Eurylokhos, who suspected mischief and
stayed outside. When she had got them into her house, she set them
upon benches and seats and mixed them a drink with cheese, honey,
meal, and Pramnian wine but she drugged it with wicked poisons to
make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she turned them
into pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in her pigsties.
They were like pigs- head, hair, and all, and they grunted just as
pigs do; but their senses [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] were the same as
before, and they remembered everything.</p>

<p><milestone n="241" unit="line"/>"Thus then were they shut up
squealing, and Circe threw them some acorns and beech masts such as
pigs eat, but Eurylokhos hurried back to tell me about the sad fate
of our comrades. He was so overcome with dismay that though he tried
to speak he could find no words to do so; his eyes filled with tears
and he could only sob and sigh, till at last we forced his story out
of him, and he told us what had happened to the others.</p>

<p><milestone n="251" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;We went,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;as you told us, through the forest, and in the middle of it
there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place that could be
seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she was a goddess,
working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to her
and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened the door, and
invited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief so they
followed her into the house, but I stayed where I was, for I thought
there might be some treachery. From that moment I saw them no more,
for not one of them ever came out, though I sat a long time watching
for them.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="261" unit="line"/>"Then I took my sword of bronze
and slung it over my shoulders; I also took my bow, and told
Eurylokhos to come back with me and show me the way. But he laid hold
of me with both his hands and spoke piteously, saying, &lsquo;Sir, do
not force me to go with you, but let me stay here, for I know you
will not bring one of them back with you, nor even return alive
yourself; let us rather see if we cannot escape at any rate with the
few that are left us, for we may still save our
lives.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="270">
<p><milestone n="270" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Stay where you are,
then,&rsquo; answered I, &lsquo;eating and drinking at the ship, but I
must go, for I am most urgently bound to do so.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="274" unit="line"/>"With this I left the ship and
went up inland. When I got through the charmed grove, and was near
the great house of the enchantress Circe, I met Hermes with his
golden wand, disguised as a young man in the hey-day of his youth and
beauty with the down just coming upon his face. He came up to me and
took my hand within his own, saying, &lsquo;My poor unhappy man,
whither are you going over this mountain top, alone and without
knowing the way? Your men are shut up in Circe's pigsties, like
so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not fancy that you
can set them free? I can tell you that you will never get back and
will have to stay there with the rest of them. But never mind, I will
protect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which
is one of great virtue, and keep it about you when you go to
Circe's house, it will be a talisman to you against every kind
of mischief.</p>

<p><milestone n="289" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;And I will tell you of all
the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try to practice upon you. She
will mix a potion for you to drink, and she will drug the meal with
which she makes it, but she will not be able to charm you, for the
virtue of the herb that I shall give you will prevent her spells from
working. I will tell you all about it. When Circe strikes you with
her wand, draw your sword and spring upon her as though you were
goings to kill her. She will then be frightened and will desire you
to go to bed with her; on this you must not point blank refuse her,
for you want her to set your companions free, and to take good care
also of yourself, but you make her swear solemnly by all the blessed
that she will plot no further mischief against you, or else when she
has got you naked she will unman you and make you fit for
nothing.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="302" unit="line"/>"As he spoke he pulled the herb
out of the ground an showed me what it was like. The root was black,
while the flower was as white as milk; the gods call it Moly, and
mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods can do whatever they
like.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="307">
<p><milestone n="307" unit="line"/>"Then Hermes went back to high
<placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> passing over the wooded island; but I fared onward to the
house of Circe, and my heart was clouded with care as I walked along.
When I got to the gates I stood there and called the goddess, and as
soon as she heard me she came down, opened the door, and asked me to
come in; so I followed her - much troubled in my mind. She set me on
a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver, there was a footstool
also under my feet, and she mixed a mess in a golden goblet for me to
drink; but she drugged it, for she meant me mischief. When she had
given it me, and I had drunk it without its charming me, she struck
me with her wand. &lsquo;There now,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;be off to
the pigsty, and make your lair with the rest of
them.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="321" unit="line"/>"But I rushed at her with my
sword drawn as though I would kill her, whereon she fell with a loud
scream, clasped my knees, and spoke piteously, saying, &lsquo;Who and
whence are you? From what place and people have you come? How can it
be that my drugs have no power to charm you? Never yet was any man
able to stand so much as a taste of the herb I gave you; you must
have some sort of spell-proof <term lang="xgreek">noos</term>; surely you can be none
other than the bold hero Odysseus, who Hermes always said would come
here some day with his ship while on his way home from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>; so be it
then; sheathe your sword and let us go to bed, that we may make
friends and learn to trust each other.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="336" unit="line"/>"And I answered, &lsquo;Circe, how
can you expect me to be friendly with you when you have just been
turning all my men into pigs? And now that you have got me here
myself, you mean me mischief when you ask me to go to bed with you,
and will unman me and make me fit for nothing. I shall certainly not
consent to go to bed with you unless you will first take your solemn
oath to plot no further harm against me.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="345" unit="line"/>"So she swore at once as I had
told her, and when she had completed her oath then I went to bed with
her.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="348">
<p><milestone n="348" unit="line"/>"Meanwhile her four servants, who
are her housemaids, set about their work. They are the children of
the groves and fountains, and of the holy waters that run down into
the sea. One of them spread a fair purple cloth over a seat, and laid
a carpet underneath it. Another brought tables of silver up to the
seats, and set them with baskets of gold. A third mixed some sweet
wine with water in a silver bowl and put golden cups upon the tables,
while the fourth brought in water and set it to boil in a large
cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted. When the water in
the cauldron was boiling, she poured cold into it till it was just as
I liked it, and then she set me in a bath and began washing me from
the cauldron about the head and shoulders, to take the tire and
stiffness out of my limbs. As soon as she had done washing me and
anointing me with oil, she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and
led me to a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a
footstool also under my feet. A maid servant then brought me water in
a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to
wash my hands, and she drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant
brought me bread and offered me many things of what there was in the
house, and then Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without
heeding what was before me, still moody and suspicious.</p>

<p><milestone n="375" unit="line"/>"When Circe saw me sitting there
without eating, and in great grief [<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>], she came
to me and said, &lsquo;Odysseus, why do you sit like that as though
you were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and
drink? Is it that you are still suspicious? You ought not to be, for
I have already sworn solemnly that I will not hurt
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="382" unit="line"/>"And I said, &lsquo;Circe, no man
with any sense of what is right can think of either eating or
drinking in your house until you have set his friends free and let
him see them. If you want me to eat and drink, you must free my men
and bring them to me that I may see them with my own
eyes.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="388" unit="line"/>"When I had said this she went
straight through the court with her wand in her hand and opened the
pigsty doors. My men came out like so many prime hogs and stood
looking at her, but she went about among them and anointed each with
a second drug, whereon the bristles that the bad drug had given them
fell off, and they became men again, younger than they were before,
and much taller and better looking. They knew me at once, seized me
each of them by the hand, and wept for joy till the whole house was
filled with the sound of their wailing, and Circe herself was so
sorry for them that she came up to me and said, &lsquo;Odysseus, noble
son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, go back at once to the sea where you have left your
ship, and first draw it on to the land. Then, hide all your
ship's gear and property in some cave, and come back here with
your men.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="406">
<p><milestone n="406" unit="line"/>"I agreed to this, so I went back
to the sea shore, and found the men at the ship weeping and wailing
most piteously. When they saw me the silly blubbering men began
frisking round me as calves break out and gambol round their mothers,
when they see them coming home to be milked after they have been
feeding all day, and the homestead resounds with their lowing. They
seemed as glad to see me as though they had got back to their own
rugged <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, where they had been born and bred. &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo;
said the affectionate creatures, &lsquo;we are as glad to see you back
as though we had got safe home to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>; but tell us all about the
fate of our comrades.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="422" unit="line"/>"I spoke comfortingly to them and
said, &lsquo;We must draw our ship on to the land, and hide the
ship's gear with all our property in some cave; then come with
me all of you as fast as you can to Circe's house, where you
will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great
abundance.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="428" unit="line"/>"On this the men would have come
with me at once, but Eurylokhos tried to hold them back and said,
&lsquo;Alas, poor wretches that we are, what will become of us? Rush
not on your ruin by going to the house of Circe, who will turn us all
into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall have to keep guard over
her house. Remember how the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> treated us when our comrades went
inside his cave, and Odysseus with them. It was all through his sheer
folly that those men lost their lives.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="438" unit="line"/>"When I heard him I was in two
minds whether or no to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy
thigh and cut his head off in spite of his being a near relation of
my own; but the men interceded for him and said, &lsquo;Sir, if it may
so be, let this man stay here and mind the ship, but take the rest of
us with you to Circe's house.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="446">
<p><milestone n="446" unit="line"/>"On this we all went inland, and
Eurylokhos was not left behind after all, but came on too, for he was
frightened by the severe reprimand that I had given him.</p>

<p><milestone n="449" unit="line"/>"Meanwhile Circe had been seeing
that the men who had been left behind were washed and anointed with
olive oil; she had also given them woolen cloaks and shirts, and when
we came we found them all comfortably at dinner in her house. As soon
as the men saw each other face to face and knew one another, they
wept for joy and cried aloud till the whole palace rang again.
Thereon Circe came up to me and said, &lsquo;Odysseus, noble son of
<placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, tell your men to leave off crying; I know how much you have
all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you have fared among cruel
savages on the mainland, but that is over now, so stay here, and eat
and drink till you are once more as strong and hearty as you were
when you left <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>; for at present you are weakened both in body
and mind; you keep all the time thinking of the hardships - you have
suffered during your travels, so that you have no more cheerfulness
left in you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="466" unit="line"/>"Thus did she speak and we
assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole twelvemonth feasting upon
an untold quantity both of meat and wine. But when the year had
passed, and the seasons [<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;rai</term>] had turned
round, and the waning of moons and the long days had begun, my men
called me apart and said, &lsquo;Sir, it is time you began to think
about going home, if so be you are to be spared to see your house and
native country at all.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="475" unit="line"/>"Thus did they speak and I
assented. Thereon through the livelong day to the going down of the
sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but when the sun went down
and it came on dark the men laid themselves down to sleep in the
covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got into bed with Circe,
besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened to what I had got
to say. &lsquo;Circe,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;please keep the promise you
made me about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want to get back
and so do my men, they are always pestering me with their complaints
as soon as ever your back is turned.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="487">
<p><milestone n="487" unit="line"/>"And the goddess answered,
&lsquo;Odysseus, noble son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, you shall none of you stay here
any longer if you do not want to, but there is another journey which
you have got to take before you can sail homewards. You must go to
the house of Hades and of dread Persephone to consult the ghost
[<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of the blind Theban seer
[<term lang="xgreek">mantis</term>] Teiresias whose mind [<term lang="xgreek">phrenes</term>]
is still in place within him. To him alone has Persephone left his
consciousness [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] even in death, but the other
ghosts flit about aimlessly.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="496" unit="line"/>"I was dismayed when I heard
this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would gladly have lived no longer
to see the light of the sun, but presently when I was tired of
weeping and tossing myself about, I said, &lsquo;And who shall guide
me upon this voyage - for the house of Hades is a port that no ship
can reach.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="504" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;You will want no
guide,&rsquo; she answered; &lsquo;raise you mast, set your white
sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there of
itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Okeanos, you will
reach the fertile shore of Persephone's country with its groves
of tall poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here
beach your ship upon the shore of Okeanos, and go straight on to the
dark abode of Hades. You will find it near the place where the rivers
Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow
into Acheron, and you will see a rock near it, just where the two
roaring rivers run into one another.</p>

<p><milestone n="516" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;When you have reached this
spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a cubit or so in length,
breadth, and depth, and pour into it as a drink-offering to all the
dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then wine, and in the third place
water-sprinkling white barley meal over the whole. Moreover you must
offer many prayers to the poor feeble ghosts, and promise them that
when you get back to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> you will sacrifice a barren heifer to
them, the best you have, and will load the pyre with good things.
More particularly you must promise that Teiresias shall have a black
sheep all to himself, the finest in all your flocks.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="526">
<p><milestone n="526" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;When you shall have thus
besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer them a ram and a black
ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus; but yourself turn away from
them as though you would make towards the river. On this, many dead
men's ghosts [<term lang="xgreek">psukhai</term>] will come to you, and you
must tell your men to skin the two sheep that you have just killed,
and offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades and to
Persephone. Then draw your sword and sit there, so as to prevent any
other poor ghost from coming near the spilt blood before Teiresias
shall have answered your questions. The seer [<term lang="xgreek">mantis</term>]
will presently come to you, and will tell you about your voyage -
what stages you are to make, and how you are to sail the sea so as to
reach your home [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>].&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="541" unit="line"/>"It was day-break by the time she
had done speaking, so she dressed me in my shirt and cloak. As for
herself she threw a beautiful light gossamer fabric over her
shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle round her waist, and she
covered her head with a mantle. Then I went about among the men
everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly to each of them man
by man: &lsquo;You must not lie sleeping here any longer,&rsquo; said I
to them, &lsquo;we must be going, for Circe has told me all about
it.&rsquo; And this they did as I bade them.</p>

<p><milestone n="551" unit="line"/>"Even so, however, I did not get
them away without misadventure. We had with us a certain youth named
Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense or courage, who had got drunk
and was lying on the house-top away from the rest of the men, to
sleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard the noise of the men
bustling about, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot all about coming
down by the main staircase, so he tumbled right off the roof and
broke his neck, and his soul [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] went down
to the house of Hades.</p>

<p><milestone n="561" unit="line"/>"When I had got the men together
I said to them, &lsquo;You think you are about to start home again,
but Circe has explained to me that instead of this, we have got to go
to the house of Hades and Persephone to consult the ghost of the
Theban seer Teiresias.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="566">
<p><milestone n="566" unit="line"/>"The men were broken-hearted as
they heard me, and threw themselves on the ground groaning and
tearing their hair, but they did not mend matters by crying. When we
reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting our fate, Circe brought
the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard by the ship. She
passed through the midst of us without our knowing it, for who can
see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does not wish to be
seen? <milestone n="574" unit="line"/></p>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Then, when we had got down to the
sea shore we drew our ship into the water and got her mast and sails
into her; we also put the sheep on board and took our places, weeping
and in great distress of mind. Circe, that great and cunning goddess,
sent us a fair wind that blew dead aft and stayed steadily with us
keeping our sails all the time well filled; so we did whatever wanted
doing to the ship's gear and let her go as the wind and helmsman
headed her. All day long her sails were full as she held her course
over the sea, but when the sun went down and darkness was over all
the earth, we got into the deep waters of the river Okeanos, where
lie the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> and city of the Cimmerians who live
enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never
pierce neither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of the
heavens, but the poor wretches live in one long melancholy night.
When we got there we beached the ship, took the sheep out of her, and
went along by the waters of Okeanos till we came to the place of
which Circe had told us.</p>

<p><milestone n="23" unit="line"/>"Here Perimedes and Eurylokhos
held the victims, while I drew my sword and dug the trench a cubit
each way. I made a drink-offering to all the dead, first with honey
and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with water, and I sprinkled
white barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly to the poor
feckless ghosts, and promising them that when I got back to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> I
would sacrifice a barren heifer for them, the best I had, and would
load the pyre with good things. I also particularly promised that
Teiresias should have a black sheep to himself, the best in all my
flocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the dead, I cut the throats
of the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench, whereon the
ghosts [<term lang="xgreek">psukhai</term>] came trooping up from Erebus -
brides, young bachelors, old men worn out with toil, maids who had
been crossed in love, and brave men who had been killed in battle,
with their armor still smirched with blood; they came from every
quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange kind of screaming
sound that made me turn pale with fear. When I saw them coming I told
the men to be quick and flay the carcasses of the two dead sheep and
make burnt offerings of them, and at the same time to repeat prayers
to Hades and to Persephone; but I sat where I was with my sword drawn
and would not let the poor feckless ghosts come near the blood till
Teiresias should have answered my questions.</p>

<p><milestone n="51" unit="line"/>"The first ghost
[<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] that came was that of my comrade
Elpenor, for he had not yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left
his body unwaked and unburied in Circe's house, for other labor
[<term lang="xgreek">ponos</term>] was pressing us. I was very sorry for him, and
cried when I saw him: &lsquo;Elpenor,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;how did you
come down here into this gloom and darkness? You have here on foot
quicker than I have with my ship.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="60" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; he answered with
a groan, &lsquo;it was all bad luck of a <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term>, and my
own unspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of
Circe's house, and never thought of coming down again by the
great staircase, but fell right off the roof and broke my neck, so my
soul [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] went down to the house of Hades.
And now I beseech you by all those whom you have left behind you,
though they are not here, by your wife, by the father who brought you
up when you were a child, and by Telemakhos who is the one hope of
your house, do what I shall now ask you. I know that when you leave
this limbo you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean island. Do
not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you, or I may
bring the gods' anger upon you; but burn me with whatever armor I
have, build a grave marker [<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>] for me on the
sea shore that may tell people in days to come what a poor unlucky
man I was, and plant over my grave the oar I used to row with when I
was yet alive and with my messmates.&rsquo; And I said, &lsquo;My poor
man, I will do all that you have asked of me.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="81">
<p><milestone n="81" unit="line"/>"Thus, then, did we sit and hold
sad talk with one another, I on the one side of the trench with my
sword held over the blood, and the ghost of my comrade saying all
this to me from the other side. Then came the ghost
[<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of my dead mother Antikleia, daughter
to Autolykos. I had left her alive when I set out for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and was
moved to tears when I saw her, but even so, for all my sorrow I would
not let her come near the blood till I had asked my questions of
Teiresias.</p>

<p><milestone n="90" unit="line"/>"Then came also the ghost
[<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of Theban Teiresias, with his golden
scepter in his hand. He knew me and said, &lsquo;Odysseus, noble son
of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, why, poor man, have you left the light of day and come
down to visit the dead in this sad place? Stand back from the trench
and withdraw your sword that I may drink of the blood and answer your
questions truly.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="97" unit="line"/>"So I drew back, and sheathed my
sword, whereon when he had drank of the blood he began with his
prophecy [<term lang="xgreek">mantis</term>].</p>

<p><milestone n="100" unit="line"/>"You want to know,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;about your return home [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>], but heaven will
make this hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the eye
of Poseidon, who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for
having blinded his son. Still, after much suffering you may get home
if you can restrain yourself and your companions when your ship
reaches the Thrinacian island, where you will find the sheep and
cattle belonging to the sun, who sees and gives ear to everything. If
you leave these flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of getting
home [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>], you may yet after much hardship reach
<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>; but if you harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction
both of your ship and of your men. Even though you may yourself
escape, you will return in bad plight after losing all your men, in
another man's ship, and you will find trouble in your house,
which will be overrun by high-handed people, who are devouring your
substance under the pretext of paying court and making presents to
your wife.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="118">
<p><milestone n="118" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;When you get home you will
take your revenge on these suitors; and after you have killed them by
force [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] or fraud in your own house, you must
take a well-made oar and carry it on and on, till you come to a
country where the people have never heard of the sea and do not even
mix salt with their food, nor do they know anything about ships, and
oars that are as the wings of a ship. I will give you this certain
token [<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>] which cannot escape your notice. A
wayfarer will meet you and will say it must be a winnowing shovel
that you have got upon your shoulder; on this you must fix the oar in
the ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Poseidon. Then
go home and offer hecatombs to the gods in heaven one after the
other. As for yourself, death shall come to you from the sea, and
your life shall ebb away very gently when you are full of years and
peace of mind, and your people shall be prosperous

true.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="138" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;This,&rsquo; I answered,
&lsquo;must be as it may please heaven, but tell me and tell me true,
I see my poor mother's ghost [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] close
by us; she is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though
I am her own son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me,
Sir, how I can make her know me.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="145" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;That,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;I can soon do. Any ghost that you let taste of the blood will
talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you do not let them
have any blood they will go away again.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="150" unit="line"/>"On this the ghost
[<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of Teiresias went back to the house of
Hades, for his prophecies had now been spoken, but I sat still where
I was until my mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me
at once and spoke fondly to me, saying, &lsquo;My son, how did you
come down to this abode of darkness while you are still alive? It is
a hard thing for the living to see these places, for between us and
them there are great and terrible waters, and there is Okeanos, which
no man can cross on foot, but he must have a good ship to take him.
Are you all this time trying to find your way home from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and
have you never yet got back to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> nor seen your wife in your own

<div2 type="card" n="163">
<p><milestone n="163" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;I was forced to come here to consult the ghost
[<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of the Theban seer Teiresias. I have
never yet been near the Achaean land nor set foot on my native
country, and I have had nothing but one long series of misfortunes
from the very first day that I set out with Agamemnon for <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilion</placeName>, the
land of noble steeds, to fight the Trojans. But tell me, and tell me
true, in what way did you die? Did you have a long illness, or did
heaven grant you a gentle easy passage to eternity? Tell me also
about my father, and the son whom I left behind me; is my property
still in their hands, or has some one else got hold of it, who thinks
that I shall not return to claim it? Tell me again what my wife
intends doing, and in what mind [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] she is; does
she live with my son and guard my estate securely, or has she made
the best match she could and married again?&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="180" unit="line"/>"My mother answered, &lsquo;Your
wife still remains in your house, but she is in great distress of
mind and spends her whole time in tears both night and day. No one as
yet has got possession of your fine property, and Telemakhos still
holds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain largely, as of
course he must, considering his position as a magistrate, and how
every one invites him; your father remains at his old place in the
country and never goes near the town. He has no comfortable bed nor
bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in front of the fire
with the men and goes about all in rags, but in summer, when the warm
weather comes on again, he lies out in the vineyard on a bed of vine
leaves thrown anyhow upon the ground, in grief
[<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>]. He is in continual distress
[<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>] about your never having achieved a
homecoming [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>], and suffers more and more as he
grows older. As for my own end it was in this wise: heaven did not
take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house, nor was I attacked by
any illness such as those that generally wear people out and kill
them, but my longing to know what you were doing and the force of my
affection for you - this it was that was the death of
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="204" unit="line"/>"Then I tried to find some way of
embracing my mother's ghost [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>].
Thrice I sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms, but
each time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom,
and being touched to the quick I said to her, &lsquo;Mother, why do
you not stay still when I would embrace you? If we could throw our
arms around one another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of
our sorrows [<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>] even in the house of Hades; does
Persephone want to lay a still further load of grief upon me by
mocking me with a phantom only?&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="215" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;My son,&rsquo; she
answered, &lsquo;most ill-fated of all humankind, it is not Persephone
that is beguiling you, but all people are like this when they are
dead. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together; these
perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has left
the body, and the soul [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] flits away as
though it were a dream. Now, however, go back to the light of day as
soon as you can, and note all these things that you may tell them to
your wife hereafter.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="225">
<p><milestone n="225" unit="line"/>"Thus did we converse, and anon
Persephone sent up the ghosts of the wives and daughters of all the
most famous men. They gathered in crowds about the blood, and I
considered how I might question them severally. In the end I deemed
that it would be best to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy
thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood at once. So they
came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned her told me
her race and lineage.</p>

<p><milestone n="235" unit="line"/>"The first I saw was Tyro. She
was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of Cretheus the son of Aeolus. She
fell in love with the river Enipeus who is much the most beautiful
river in the whole world. Once when she was taking a walk by his side
as usual, Poseidon, disguised as her lover, lay with her at the mouth
of the river, and a huge seething wave arched itself like a mountain
over them to hide both woman and god, whereon he loosed her virgin
girdle and laid her in a deep slumber. When the god had accomplished
the deed of love, he took her hand in his own and said, &lsquo;Tyro,
rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the gods are not fruitless,
and you will have fine twins about this time twelve months. Take
great care of them. I am Poseidon, so now go home, but hold your
tongue and do not tell any one.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="253" unit="line"/>"Then he dived under the sea, and
she in due course bore Pelias and Neleus, who both of them served
Zeus with all their might. Pelias was a great breeder of sheep and
lived in Iolkos, but the other lived in <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>. The rest of her
children were by Cretheus, namely, Aison, Pheres, and Amythaon, who

<p><milestone n="260" unit="line"/>"Next to her I saw Antiope,
daughter to Asopos, who could boast of having slept in the arms of
even Zeus himself, and who bore him two sons Amphion and Zethos.
These founded <placeName key="tgn,7011071">Thebes</placeName> with its seven gates, and built a wall all round
it; for strong though they were they could not hold <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> till they
had walled it.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="266">
<p><milestone n="266" unit="line"/>"Then I saw Alkmene, the wife of
Amphitryon, who also bore to Zeus indomitable Herakles; and Megara
who was daughter to great King Kreon, and married the redoubtable son
of Amphitryon.</p>

<p><milestone n="271" unit="line"/>"I also saw fair Epikaste mother
of king Oedipus whose awful lot it was to marry her own son without
suspecting it in her <term lang="xgreek">noos</term>. He married her after having killed
his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to the world;
whereon he remained king of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, in great grief for the spite the
gods had borne him; but Epikaste went to the house of the mighty
gatekeeper Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the avenging
spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother - to his ruing bitterly
thereafter.</p>

<p><milestone n="281" unit="line"/>"Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus
married for her beauty, having given priceless presents for her. She
was youngest daughter to Amphion son of <placeName key="perseus,Iasos">Iasos</placeName> and king of Minyan
Orkhomenos, and was Queen in <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>. She bore Nestor, Chromios, and
Periklymenos, and she also bore that marvelously lovely woman Pero,
who was wooed by all the country round; but Neleus would only give
her to him who should raid the cattle of Iphikles from the grazing
grounds of Phylake, and this was a hard task. The only man who would
undertake to raid them was a certain excellent seer
[<term lang="xgreek">mantis</term>], but the will of heaven was against him, for
the rangers of the cattle caught him and put him in prison;
nevertheless when a full year had passed and the same season
[<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>] came round again, Iphikles set him at
liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven. Thus,
then, was the will of Zeus accomplished.</p>

<p><milestone n="298" unit="line"/>"And I saw Leda the wife of
Tyndarus, who bore him two famous sons, Castor breaker of horses, and
Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these heroes are lying under the earth,
though they are still alive, for by a special dispensation of Zeus,
they die and come to life again, each one of them every other day
throughout all time, and they have the rank of gods.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="305">
<p><milestone n="305" unit="line"/>"After her I saw Iphimedeia wife
of Aloeus who boasted the embrace of Poseidon. She bore two sons Otus
and Ephialtes, but both were short lived. They were the finest
children that were ever born in this world, and the best looking,
Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they were nine fathoms
high, and measured nine cubits round the chest. They threatened to
make war with the gods in <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, and tried to set Mount Ossa on the
top of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Mount Olympus</placeName>, and Mount Pelion on the top of Ossa, that they
might scale heaven itself, and they would have done it too if they
had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed both of them,
before they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks or
chin.</p>

<p><milestone n="321" unit="line"/>"Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris,
and fair Ariadne daughter of the magician Minos, whom Theseus was
carrying off from <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, but he did not enjoy her, for
before he could do so Artemis killed her in the island of Dia on
account of what Bacchus had said against her.</p>

<p><milestone n="326" unit="line"/>"I also saw <placeName key="tgn,1126692">Maira</placeName> and Klymene and
hateful Eriphyle, who sold her own husband for gold. But it would
take me all night if I were to name every single one of the wives and
daughters of heroes whom I saw, and it is time
[<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>] for me to go to bed, either on board ship
with my crew, or here. As for my escort, heaven and yourselves will
see to it."</p>

<p><milestone n="333" unit="line"/>Here he ended, and the guests sat
all of them enthralled and speechless throughout the covered room.
Then Arete said to them:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="336">
<p><milestone n="336" unit="line"/>"What do you think of this man, O
Phaeacians? Is he not tall and good looking, and is he not clever?
True, he is my own guest, but all of you share in the distinction. Do
not be in a hurry to send him away, nor be withholding in the
presents you make to one who is in such great need, for heaven has
blessed all of you with great abundance."</p>

<p><milestone n="342" unit="line"/>Then spoke the aged hero Echeneus
who was one of the oldest men among them, "My friends," said he,
"what our august queen has just said to us is both reasonable and to
the purpose, therefore be persuaded by it; but the decision whether
in word or deed rests ultimately with King Alkinoos."</p>

<p><milestone n="347" unit="line"/>"The thing shall be done,"
exclaimed Alkinoos, "as surely as I still live and reign over the
Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious to get home
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>], still we must persuade him to remain with us
until tomorrow, by which time I shall be able to get together the
whole sum that I mean to give him. As regards his escort it will be a
matter for you all, and mine above all others as the chief person in
the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>."</p>

<p><milestone n="354" unit="line"/>And Odysseus answered, "King
Alkinoos, if you were to bid me to stay here for a whole twelve
months, and then speed me on my way, loaded with your noble gifts, I
should obey you gladly and it would redound greatly to my advantage,
for I should return fuller-handed to my own people, and should thus
be more respected and beloved by all who see me when I get back to
<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="362">
<p><milestone n="362" unit="line"/>"Odysseus," replied Alkinoos,
"not one of us who sees you has any idea that you are a charlatan or
a swindler. I know there are many people going about who tell such
plausible stories that it is very hard to see through them, but there
is a style about your language which assures me of your good
disposition. Moreover you have told the story of your own
misfortunes, and those of the Argives, as though you were a practiced
bard; but tell me, and tell me true, whether you saw any of the
mighty heroes who went to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> at the same time with yourself, and
perished there. The evenings are still at their longest, and it is
not yet bed time [<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>] - go on, therefore, with
your divine story, for I could stay here listening till tomorrow
morning, so long as you will continue to tell us of your
adventures."</p>

<p><milestone n="377" unit="line"/>"Alkinoos," answered Odysseus,
"there is a time [<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>] for making speeches, and
a time [<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>] for going to bed; nevertheless,
since you so desire, I will not refrain from telling you the still
sadder tale of those of my comrades who did not fall fighting with
the Trojans, but perished on their return [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>],
through the treachery of a wicked woman.</p>

<p><milestone n="385" unit="line"/>"When Persephone had dismissed
the female ghosts [<term lang="xgreek">psukhai</term>] in all directions, the
ghost [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of Agamemnon son of Atreus came
sadly up to me, surrounded by those who had perished with him in the
house of Aigisthos. As soon as he had tasted the blood he knew me,
and weeping bitterly stretched out his arms towards me to embrace me;
but he had no strength nor substance any more, and I too wept and
pitied him as I beheld him. &lsquo;How did you come by your
death,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;King Agamemnon? Did Poseidon raise his
winds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies
make an end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or
sheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in defense of their wives
and city?&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="404" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Odysseus,&rsquo; he
answered, &lsquo;noble son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, I was not lost at sea in any
storm of Poseidon's raising, nor did my foes dispatch me upon
the mainland, but Aigisthos and my wicked wife were the death of me
between them. He asked me to his house, feasted me, and then
butchered me most miserably as though I were a fat beast in a
slaughter house, while all around me my comrades were slain like
sheep or pigs for the wedding breakfast, or dinner-party, or gourmet
feast of some great nobleman. You must have seen numbers of men
killed either in a general engagement, or in single combat, but you
never saw anything so truly pitiable as the way in which we fell in
that room, with the mixing-bowl and the loaded tables lying all
about, and the ground reeking with our blood. I heard Priam's
daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her close beside me.
I lay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body, and raised my
hands to kill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped away from me;
she would not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was dying, for
there is nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as a woman
when she has fallen into such guilt as hers was. Fancy murdering her
own husband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home by my children
and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought disgrace on
herself and all women who shall come after - even on the good
ones.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="435">
<p><milestone n="435" unit="line"/>"And I said, &lsquo;In truth Zeus
has hated the house of Atreus from first to last in the matter of
their women's counsels. See how many of us fell for Helen's
sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief against you
too during your absence.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="441" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Be sure, therefore,&rsquo;
continued Agamemnon, &lsquo;and not be too friendly even with your own
wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly well yourself. Tell
her a part only, and keep your own counsel about the rest. Not that
your wife, Odysseus, is likely to murder you, for Penelope is a very
admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We left her a young
bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. This
child no doubt is now grown up happily [<term lang="xgreek">olbios</term>] to
man's estate, and he and his father will have a joyful meeting
and embrace one another as it is right they should do, whereas my
wicked wife did not even allow me the happiness of looking upon my
son, but killed me ere I could do so. Furthermore I say - and lay my
saying to your heart - do not tell people when you are bringing your
ship to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, but steal a march upon them, for after all this there
is no trusting women. But now tell me, and tell me true, can you give
me any news of my son Orestes? Is he in <placeName key="tgn,7011034">Orkhomenos</placeName>, or at <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, or
is he at <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> with Menelaos - for I presume that he is still
living.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="462" unit="line"/>"And I said, &lsquo;Agamemnon, why
do you ask me? I do not know whether your son is alive or dead, and
it is not right to talk when one does not know.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="465" unit="line"/>"As we two sat weeping and
talking thus sadly with one another the ghost
[<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of Achilles came up to us with
Patroklos, Antilokhos, and Ajax who was the finest and goodliest man
of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus. The <term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;
</term>of the fleet descendant of Aiakos knew me and spoke piteously,
saying, &lsquo;Odysseus, noble son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, what deed of daring
will you undertake next, that you venture down to the house of Hades
among us silly dead, who are but the ghosts of them that can labor no
more?&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="477">
<p><milestone n="477" unit="line"/>"And I said, &lsquo;Achilles, son
of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, I came to consult
Teiresias, and see if he could advise me about my return home to
<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, for I have never yet been able to get near the Achaean land,
nor to set foot in my own country, but have been in trouble all the
time. As for you, Achilles, no one was ever yet so fortunate as you
have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored by all us Argives as
long as you were alive, and now that you are here you are a great
prince among the dead. Do not, therefore, take it so much to heart
even if you are dead.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="487" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Say not a word,&rsquo; he
answered, &lsquo;in death's favor; I would rather be a paid
servant in a poor man's house and be above ground than king of
kings among the dead. But give me news about son; is he gone to the
wars and will he be a great warrior, or is this not so? Tell me also
if you have heard anything about my father Peleus - does he still
rule among the Myrmidons, or do they show him no respect throughout
<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Phthia">Phthia</placeName> now that he is old and his limbs fail him? Could I
but stand by his side, in the light of day, with the same strength
that I had when I killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of
<placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> - could I but be as I then was and go even for a short time to
my father's house, any one who tried to do him violence or
supersede him would soon feel my strength and invincible
hands.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="504" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;I have heard
nothing,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;of Peleus, but I can tell you the
truth [<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;theia</term>] about your son Neoptolemos, for
I took him in my own ship from <placeName key="tgn,1009188">Skyros</placeName> with the Achaeans. In our
councils of war before <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> he was always first to speak, and his
judgment was unerring. Nestor and I were the only two who could
surpass him; and when it came to fighting on the plain of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, he
would never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on far in
front, foremost of them all in valor. Many a man did he kill in
battle - I cannot name every single one of those whom he slew while
fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say how he killed
that valiant hero Eurypylos son of Telephus, who was the handsomest
man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also of the Ceteians fell
around him by reason of a woman's bribes. Moreover, when all the
bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeios had made,
and it was left to me to settle when we should either open the door
of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other leaders and chief
men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking in every
limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek;
he was all the time urging me to break out from the horse - grasping
the handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury
against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his
handsome share of the prize wealth and went on board (such is the
fortune of war) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear
nor in close combat, for the rage of Ares is a matter of great
chance.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="538" unit="line"/>"When I had told him this, the
ghost [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of Achilles strode off across a
meadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the
prowess of his son.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="541">
<p><milestone n="541" unit="line"/>"The ghosts
[<term lang="xgreek">psukhai</term>] of other dead men stood near me and told me
each his own melancholy tale; but the <term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term> of Ajax son
of Telamon alone held aloof - still angry with me for having won the
cause in our dispute about the armor of Achilles. Thetis had offered
it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners and Athena were the judges.
Would that I had never gained the day in such a contest
[<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>], for it cost the life of Ajax, who was
foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in stature
and prowess.</p>

<p><milestone n="552" unit="line"/>"When I saw him I tried to pacify
him and said, &lsquo;Ajax, will you not forget and forgive even in
death, but must the judgment about that hateful armor still rankle
with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to lose such a tower of
strength as you were to us. We mourned you as much as we mourned
Achilles son of Peleus himself, nor can the blame
[<term lang="xgreek">aitios</term>] be laid on anything but on the spite which
Zeus bore against the Danaans, for it was this that made him counsel
your destruction - come here, therefore, bring your proud spirit into
subjection, and hear what I can tell you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="563" unit="line"/>"He would not answer, but turned
away to Erebus and to the other ghosts [<term lang="xgreek">psukhai</term>];
nevertheless, I should have made him talk to me in spite of his being
so angry, or I should have gone talking to him, only that there were
still others among the dead whom I desired to see.</p>

<p><milestone n="568" unit="line"/>"Then I saw Minos son of Zeus
with his golden scepter in his hand sitting in judgment on the dead,
and the ghosts were gathered sitting and standing round him in the
spacious house of Hades, to learn his sentences
[<term lang="xgreek">dikai</term>] upon them.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="572">
<p><milestone n="572" unit="line"/>"After him I saw huge Orion in a
meadow full of asphodel driving the ghosts of the wild beasts that he
had killed upon the mountains, and he had a great bronze club in his
hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.</p>

<p><milestone n="576" unit="line"/>"And I saw Tityus son of Gaia
stretched upon the plain and covering some nine acres of ground. Two
vultures on either side of him were digging their beaks into his
liver, and he kept on trying to beat them off with his hands, but
could not; for he had violated Zeus&rsquo; mistress Leto as she was
going through Panopeus on her way to <placeName key="tgn,7010770">Pytho</placeName>.</p>

<p><milestone n="582" unit="line"/>"I saw also the dreadful fate of
Tantalus, who stood in a lake that reached his chin; he was dying to
quench his thirst, but could never reach the water, for whenever the
poor creature stooped to drink, it dried up and vanished, so that
there was nothing but dry ground - parched by a <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term>.
There were tall trees, moreover, that shed their fruit over his head
- pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet figs and juicy olives, but
whenever the poor creature stretched out his hand to take some, the
wind tossed the branches back again to the clouds.</p>

<p><milestone n="593" unit="line"/>"And I saw Sisyphus at his
endless task raising his prodigious stone with both his hands. With
hands and feet he tried to roll it up to the top of the hill, but
always, just before he could roll it over on to the other side, its
weight would be too much for him, and the pitiless stone would come
thundering down again on to the plain. Then he would begin trying to
push it up hill again, and the sweat ran off him and the steam rose
after him.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="601">
<p><milestone n="601" unit="line"/>"After him I saw mighty Herakles,
but it was his phantom only, for he is feasting ever with the
immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe to wife, who is daughter of Zeus
and Hera. The ghosts were screaming round him like scared birds
flying in all directions. He looked black as night with his bare bow
in his hands and his arrow on the string, glaring around as though
ever on the point of taking aim. About his breast there was a
wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvelous fashion with
bears, wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes; there was also war,
battle, and death. The man who made that belt, do what he might,
would never be able to make another like it. Herakles knew me at once
when he saw me, and spoke piteously, saying, &lsquo;My poor Odysseus,
noble son of Laertes, are you too leading the same sorry kind of life
that I did when I was above ground? I was son of Zeus, but I went
through an infinity of suffering, for I became bondsman to one who
was far beneath me - a lowly man who set me all manner of labors
[<term lang="xgreek">athloi</term>]. He once sent me here to fetch the hell-hound
- for he did not think he could find any <term lang="xgreek">athlos</term> harder for me
than this, but I got the hound out of Hades and brought him to him,
for Hermes and Athena helped me.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="627" unit="line"/>"On this Herakles went down again
into the house of Hades, but I stayed where I was in case some other
of the mighty dead should come to me. And I should have seen still
other of them that are gone before, whom I would fain have seen -
Theseus and Peirithoos glorious children of the gods, but so many
thousands of ghosts came round me and uttered such appalling cries,
that I was panic stricken lest Persephone should send up from the
house of Hades the head of that awful monster Gorgon. On this I
hastened back to my ship and ordered my men to go on board at once
and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took their places,
whereon the ship went down the stream of the river Okeanos. We had to
row at first, but presently a fair wind sprang up.

</div2></div1>

<div1 type="Book" n="12">
<head>Scroll 12</head>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>"After we were clear of the river
Okeanos, and had got out into the open sea, we went on till we
reached the Aeaean island where there is dawn and sunrise as in other
places. We then drew our ship on to the sands and disembarked onto
the shore, where we went to sleep and waited till day should
break.</p>

<p><milestone n="8" unit="line"/>"Then, when the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I sent some men to Circe's house
to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut firewood from a wood where the
headland jutted out into the sea, and after we had wept over him and
lamented him we performed his funeral rites. When his body and armor
had been burned to ashes, we raised a cairn, set a stone over it, and
at the top of the cairn we fixed the oar that he had been used to row
with.</p>

<p><milestone n="16" unit="line"/>"While we were doing all this,
Circe, who knew that we had got back from the house of Hades, dressed
herself and came to us as fast as she could; and her maid servants
came with her bringing us bread, meat, and wine. Then she stood in
the midst of us and said, &lsquo;You have done a bold thing in going
down alive to the house of Hades, and you will have died twice, to
other people's once; now, then, stay here for the rest of the
day, feast your fill, and go on with your voyage at daybreak tomorrow
morning. In the meantime I will tell Odysseus about your course, and
will explain everything to him so as to prevent your suffering from
misadventure either by land or sea.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="28" unit="line"/>"We agreed to do as she had said,
and feasted through the livelong day to the going down of the sun,
but when the sun had set and it came on dark, the men laid themselves
down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship. Then Circe took me by
the hand and bade me be seated away from the others, while she
reclined by my side and asked me all about our adventures.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="37">
<p><milestone n="37" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;So far so good,&rsquo; said
she, when I had ended my story, &lsquo;and now pay attention to what I
am about to tell you - heaven itself, indeed, will recall it to your
recollection. First you will come to the Sirens who enchant all who
come near them. If any one unwarily draws in too close and hears the
singing of the Sirens, his wife and children will never welcome him
home again, for they sit in a green field and warble him to death
with the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap of dead
men's bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting off
them. Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men's ears
with wax that none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen
yourself, for you may get the men to bind you as you stand upright on
a cross-piece half way up the mast, and they must lash the
rope's ends to the mast itself, that you may have the pleasure
of listening. If you beg and pray the men to unloose you, then they
must bind you faster.</p>

<p><milestone n="55" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;When your crew have taken
you past these Sirens, I cannot give you coherent directions as to
which of two courses you are to take; I will lay the two alternatives
before you, and you must consider them for yourself. On the one hand
there are some overhanging rocks against which the seething deep
waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the blessed gods call
these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird may pass, no, not
even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to Father Zeus, but the
sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father Zeus has to
send another to make up their number; no ship that ever yet came to
these rocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds of fire
are freighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only
vessel that ever sailed and got through, was the famous <placeName key="tgn,2136830">Argo</placeName> on her
way from the house of Aietes, and she too would have gone against
these great rocks, only that Hera piloted her past them for the love
she bore to Jason.</p>

<p><milestone n="73" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Of these two rocks the one
reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a dark cloud. This never
leaves it, so that the top is never clear not even in summer and
early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands and twenty feet could
get a foothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer up, as smooth as
though it had been polished. In the middle of it there is a large
cavern, looking West and turned towards Erebus; you must take your
ship this way, but the cave is so high up that not even the stoutest
archer could send an arrow into it. Inside it Scylla sits and yelps
with a voice that you might take to be that of a young hound, but in
truth she is a dreadful monster and no one - not even a god - could
face her without being terror-struck. She has twelve misshapen feet,
and six necks of the most prodigious length; and at the end of each
neck she has a frightful head with three rows of teeth in each, all
set very close together, so that they would crunch any one to death
in a moment, and she sits deep within her shady cell thrusting out
her heads and peering all round the rock, fishing for dolphins or
dogfish or any larger monster that she can catch, of the thousands
with which Amphitrite teems. No ship ever yet got past her without
losing some men, for she shoots out all her heads at once, and
carries off a man in each mouth.</p>

<p><milestone n="101" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;You will find the other
rocks lie lower, but they are so close together that there is not
more than a bowshot between them. [A large fig tree in full leaf
grows upon it], and under it lies the sucking whirlpool of
Charybdis. Three times in the day does she vomit forth her waters,
and three times she sucks them down again; see that you be not there
when she is sucking, for if you are, Poseidon himself could not save
you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as fast as you
can, for you had better lose six men than your whole
crew.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="111">
<p><milestone n="111" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Is there no way,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;of escaping Charybdis, and at the same time keeping
Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="115" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;You dare-devil,&rsquo;
replied the goddess, &lsquo;you are always wanting to fight somebody
or something and to undergo an ordeal [<term lang="xgreek">ponos</term>]; you
will not let yourself be beaten even by the immortals. For Scylla is
not mortal; moreover she is savage, extreme, rude, cruel and
invincible. There is no help for it; your best chance will be to get
by her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle about her rock
while you are putting on your armor, she may catch you with a second
cast of her six heads, and snap up another half dozen of your men; so
drive your ship past her at full speed, and roar out lustily to
Krataiis who is Scylla's dam, bad luck to her; she will then
stop her from making a second raid upon you.</p>

<p><milestone n="127" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;You will now come to the
Thrinacian island, and here you will see many herds of cattle and
flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god - seven herds of cattle and
seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in each flock. They do not
breed, nor do they become fewer in number, and they are tended by the
goddesses Phaethousa and Lampetie, who are children of the sun-god
Hyperion by Neaira. Their mother when she had borne them and had done
suckling them sent them to the Thrinacian island, which was a long
way off, to live there and look after their father's flocks and
herds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and think of nothing but
homecoming [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>], you may yet after much hardship
reach <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName>; but if you harm them, then I forewarn you of the
destruction both of your ship and of your comrades; and even though
you may yourself escape, you will return late, in bad plight, after
losing all your men.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="142" unit="line"/>"Here she ended, and dawn
enthroned in gold began to show in heaven, whereon she returned
inland. I then went on board and told my men to loose the ship from
her moorings; so they at once got into her, took their places, and
began to smite the gray sea with their oars. Presently the great and
cunning goddess Circe befriended us with a fair wind that blew dead
aft, and stayed steadily with us, keeping our sails well filled, so
we did whatever wanted doing to the ship's gear, and let her go
as wind and helmsman headed her.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="153">
<p><milestone n="153" unit="line"/>"Then, being much troubled in
mind, I said to my men, &lsquo;My friends, it is not right that one or
two of us alone should know the prophecies that Circe has made me, I
will therefore tell you about them, so that whether we live or die we
may do so with our eyes open. First she said we were to keep clear of
the Sirens, who sit and sing most beautifully in a field of flowers;
but she said I might hear them myself so long as no one else did.
Therefore, take me and bind me to the crosspiece half way up the
mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a bond so fast that I cannot
possibly break away, and lash the rope's ends to the mast
itself. If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more
tightly still.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="165" unit="line"/>"I had hardly finished telling
everything to the men before we reached the island of the two Sirens,
for the wind had been very favorable. Then all of a sudden it fell
dead calm; there was not a breath of wind nor a ripple upon the
water, so the men furled the sails and stowed them; then taking to
their oars they whitened the water with the foam they raised in
rowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax and cut it up small
with my sword. Then I kneaded the wax in my strong hands till it
became soft, which it soon did between the kneading and the rays of
the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then I stopped the ears of all my men,
and they bound me hands and feet to the mast as I stood upright on
the crosspiece; but they went on rowing themselves. When we had got
within earshot of the land, and the ship was going at a good rate,
the Sirens saw that we were getting in shore and began with their
singing.</p>

<p><milestone n="184" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Come here,&rsquo; they
sang, &lsquo;renowned Odysseus, honor to the Achaean name, and listen
to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without staying to hear
the enchanting sweetness of our song - and he who listens will go on
his way not only charmed, but wiser, for we know all the ills that
the gods laid upon the Argives and Trojans before <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>, and can tell
you everything that is going to happen over the whole
world.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="192" unit="line"/>"They sang these words most
musically, and as I longed to hear them further I made by frowning to
my men that they should set me free; but they quickened their stroke,
and Eurylokhos and Perimedes bound me with still stronger bonds till
we had got out of hearing of the Sirens&rsquo; voices. Then my men
took the wax from their ears and unbound me.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="201">
<p><milestone n="201" unit="line"/>"Immediately after we had got
past the island I saw a great wave from which spray was rising, and I
heard a loud roaring sound. The men were so frightened that they
loosed hold of their oars, for the whole sea resounded with the
rushing of the waters, but the ship stayed where it was, for the men
had left off rowing. I went round, therefore, and exhorted them man
by man not to lose heart.</p>

<p><milestone n="208" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;My friends,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;this is not the first time that we have been in danger, and we
are in nothing like so bad a case as when the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> shut us up in
his cave by forceful violence [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>];
nevertheless, my courage [<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>] and wise
counsel [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] saved us then, and we shall live to
look back on all this as well. Now, therefore, let us all do as I
say, trust in <placeName key="tgn,2786910">Zeus</placeName> and row on with might and main. As for you,
coxswain, these are your orders; attend to them, for the ship is in
your hands; turn her head away from these steaming rapids and hug the
rock, or she will give you the slip and be over yonder before you
know where you are, and you will be the death of us.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="222" unit="line"/>"So they did as I told them; but
I said nothing about the awful monster Scylla, for I knew the men
would not go on rowing if I did, but would huddle together in the
hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe's strict
instructions - I put on my armor. Then seizing two strong spears I
took my stand on the ship's bows, for it was there that I
expected first to see the monster of the rock, who was to do my men
so much harm; but I could not make her out anywhere, though I
strained my eyes with looking the gloomy rock all over and
over.</p>

<p><milestone n="234" unit="line"/>"Then we entered the Straits in
great fear of mind, for on the one hand was Scylla, and on the other
dread <placeName key="tgn,2233588">Charybdis</placeName> kept sucking up the salt water. As she vomited it up,
it was like the water in a cauldron when it is boiling over upon a
great fire, and the spray reached the top of the rocks on either
side. When she began to suck again, we could see the water all inside
whirling round and round, and it made a deafening sound as it broke
against the rocks. We could see the bottom of the whirlpool all black
with sand and mud, and the men were at their wit's ends for
fear. While we were taken up with this, and were expecting each
moment to be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and
violently [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>]<term lang="xgreek"></term> snatched up my six best
men. I was looking at once after both ship and men, and in a moment I
saw their hands and feet ever so high above me, struggling in the air
as Scylla was carrying them off, and I heard them call out my name in
one last despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated, spear in hand, upon
some jutting rock throws bait into the water to deceive the poor
little fishes, and spears them with the ox's horn with which his
spear is shod, throwing them gasping on to the land as he catches
them one by one - even so did Scylla land these panting creatures on
her rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they
screamed and stretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony.
This was the most sickening sight that I saw throughout all my
voyages.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="260">
<p><milestone n="260" unit="line"/>"When we had passed the Wandering
rocks, with Scylla and terrible <placeName key="tgn,2233588">Charybdis</placeName>, we reached the noble
island of the sun-god, where were the goodly cattle and sheep
belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still at sea in my ship I could
bear the cattle lowing as they came home to the yards, and the sheep
bleating. Then I remembered what the blind Theban seer
[<term lang="xgreek">mantis</term>] Teiresias had told me, and how carefully
Aeaean Circe had warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god.
So being much troubled I said to the men, &lsquo;My men, I know you
are hard pressed, but listen while I tell you the prophecy that
Teiresias made me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe warned me to shun
the island of the blessed sun-god, for it was here, she said, that
our worst danger would lie. Head the ship, therefore, away from the
island.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="277" unit="line"/>"The men were in despair at this,
and Eurylokhos at once gave me an insolent answer.
&lsquo;Odysseus,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you are cruel; you are very
strong yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron,
and now, though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep,
you will not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon
this island, but bid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly on
through the watches of the fleeing night. It is by night that the
winds blow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should
one of those sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which
so often wreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious?
Now, therefore, let us obey the call of night and prepare our supper
here hard by the ship; tomorrow morning we will go on board again and
put out to sea.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="294" unit="line"/>"Thus spoke Eurylokhos, and the
men approved his words. I saw that a <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> meant us
mischief and said, &lsquo;You force me to yield, for you are many
against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his solemn
oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep,
he will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either, but will be
satisfied with the food that Circe has given us.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="303" unit="line"/>"They all swore as I bade them,
and when they had completed their oath we made the ship fast in a
harbor that was near a stream of fresh water, and the men went ashore
and cooked their suppers. As soon as they had had enough to eat and
drink, they began talking about their poor comrades whom Scylla had
snatched up and eaten; this set them weeping and they went on crying
till they fell off into a sound sleep.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="312">
<p><milestone n="312" unit="line"/>"In the third watch of the night
when the stars had shifted their places, Zeus raised a great gale of
wind that flew a gale so that land and sea were covered with thick
clouds, and night sprang forth out of the heavens. When the child of
morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, we brought the ship to land
and drew her into a cave wherein the sea-nymphs hold their courts and
dances [<term lang="xgreek">khoros</term>], and I called the men together in
council.</p>

<p><milestone n="320" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;My friends,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;we have meat and drink in the ship, let us mind, therefore, and
not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it; for these cattle and
sheep belong to the mighty sun, who sees and gives ear to everything.
And again they promised that they would obey.</p>

<p><milestone n="325" unit="line"/>"For a whole month the wind blew
steadily from the South, and there was no other wind, but only South
and East. As long as grain and wine held out the men did not touch
the cattle when they were hungry; when, however, they had eaten all
there was in the ship, they were forced to go further afield, with
hook and line, catching birds, and taking whatever they could lay
their hands on; for they were starving. One day, therefore, I went up
inland that I might pray heaven to show me some means of getting
away. When I had gone far enough to be clear of all my men, and had
found a place that was well sheltered from the wind, I washed my
hands and prayed to all the gods in <placeName key="tgn,2109778">Olympus</placeName> till by and by they sent
me off into a sweet sleep.</p>

<p><milestone n="339" unit="line"/>"Meanwhile Eurylokhos had been
giving evil counsel to the men, &lsquo;Listen to me,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;my poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but there is none
so bad as famine. Why should not we drive in the best of these cows
and offer them in sacrifice to the immortal gods? If we ever get back
to <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName>, we can build a fine temple to the sun-god and enrich it
with every kind of ornament; if, however, he is determined to sink
our ship out of revenge for these horned cattle, and the other gods
are of the same mind, I for one would rather drink salt water once
for all and have done with it, than be starved to death by inches in
such a desert island as this is.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="352">
<p><milestone n="352" unit="line"/>"Thus spoke Eurylokhos, and the
men approved his words. Now the cattle, so fair and goodly, were
feeding not far from the ship; the men, therefore drove in the best
of them, and they all stood round them saying their prayers, and
using young oak-shoots instead of barley-meal, for there was no
barley left. When they had done praying they killed the cows and
dressed their carcasses; they cut out the thigh bones, wrapped them
round in two layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on top of
them. They had no wine with which to make drink-offerings over the
sacrifice while it was cooking, so they kept pouring on a little
water from time to time while the inward meats were being grilled;
then, when the thigh bones were burned and they had tasted the inward
meats, they cut the rest up small and put the pieces upon the
spits.</p>

<p><milestone n="366" unit="line"/>"By this time my deep sleep had
left me, and I turned back to the ship and to the sea shore. As I
drew near I began to smell hot roast meat, so I groaned out a prayer
to the immortal gods. &lsquo;Father Zeus,&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;and
all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss, you have done me a
cruel mischief [<term lang="xgreek">at&ecirc;</term>] by the sleep into which you
have sent me; see what fine work these men of mine have been making
in my absence.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="374" unit="line"/>"Meanwhile Lampetie went straight
off to the sun and told him we had been killing his cows, whereon he
flew into a great rage, and said to the immortals, &lsquo;Father Zeus,
and all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss, I must have
vengeance on the crew of Odysseus&rsquo; ship: they have had the
insolence to kill my cows, which were the one thing I loved to look
upon, whether I was going up heaven or down again. If they do not
square accounts with me about my cows, I will go down to Hades and
shine there among the dead.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="384" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Sun,&rsquo; said Zeus,
&lsquo;go on shining upon us gods and upon humankind over the fruitful
earth. I will shiver their ship into little pieces with a bolt of
white lightning as soon as they get out to sea.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="389">
<p><milestone n="389" unit="line"/>"I was told all this by Calypso,
who said she had heard it from the mouth of Hermes.</p>

<p><milestone n="391" unit="line"/>"As soon as I got down to my ship
and to the sea shore I rebuked each one of the men separately, but we
could see no way out of it, for the cows were dead already. And
indeed the gods began at once to show signs and wonders among us, for
the hides of the cattle crawled about, and the joints upon the spits
began to low like cows, and the meat, whether cooked or raw, kept on
making a noise just as cows do.</p>

<p><milestone n="397" unit="line"/>"For six days my men kept driving
in the best cows and feasting upon them, but when Zeus the son of
Kronos had added a seventh day, the fury of the gale abated; we
therefore went on board, raised our masts, spread sail, and put out
to sea. As soon as we were well away from the island, and could see
nothing but sky and sea, the son of Kronos raised a black cloud over
our ship, and the sea grew dark beneath it. We did not get on much
further, for in another moment we were caught by a terrific squall
from the West that snapped the forestays of the mast so that it fell
aft, while all the ship's gear tumbled about at the bottom of
the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in the
ship's stern, so that the bones of his head were crushed to
pieces, and he fell overboard as though he were diving, with no more
life left in him.</p>

<p><milestone n="415" unit="line"/>"Then Zeus let fly with his
thunderbolts, and the ship went round and round, and was filled with
fire and brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men all fell into
the sea; they were carried about in the water round the ship, looking
like so many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all
chance of getting home again [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>].</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="420">
<p><milestone n="420" unit="line"/>"I stuck to the ship till the sea
knocked her sides from her keel (which drifted about by itself) and
struck the mast out of her in the direction of the keel; but there
was a backstay of stout ox-thong still hanging about it, and with
this I lashed the mast and keel together, and getting astride of them
was carried wherever the winds chose to take me.</p>

<p><milestone n="426" unit="line"/>"The gale from the West had now
spent its force, and the wind got into the South again, which
frightened me lest I should be taken back to the terrible whirlpool
of Charybdis. This indeed was what actually happened, for I was borne
along by the waves all night, and by sunrise had reached the rock of
Scylla, and the whirlpool. She was then sucking down the salt sea
water, but I was carried aloft toward the fig tree, which I caught
hold of and clung on to like a bat. I could not plant my feet
anywhere so as to stand securely, for the roots were a long way off
and the boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were too high, too
vast, and too far apart for me to reach them; so I hung patiently on,
waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and raft again - and a
very long while it seemed. A juryman
[<term lang="xgreek">kr&icirc;n&ocirc;</term>] is not more glad to get home to
supper, after having been long detained in court by troublesome
cases, than I was to see my raft beginning to work its way out of the
whirlpool again. At last I let go with my hands and feet, and fell
heavily into the sea, hard by my raft on to which I then got, and
began to row with my hands. As for Scylla, the father of gods and men
would not let her get further sight of me - otherwise I should have
certainly been lost.</p>

<p><milestone n="447" unit="line"/>"Hence I was carried along for
nine days till on the tenth night the gods stranded me on the Ogygian
island, where dwells the great and powerful goddess Calypso. She took
me in and was kind to me, but I need say no more about this, for I
told you and your noble wife all about it yesterday, and it is
hateful [<term lang="xgreek">ekhthron</term>] for me to say the same thing over
and over again." <milestone n="453" unit="line"/></p>

<div1 type="Book" n="13">

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak, and they all
held their peace throughout the covered room, enthralled by the charm
of his story, till presently Alkinoos began to speak.</p>

<p><milestone n="3" unit="line"/>"Odysseus," said he, "now that you
have reached my house I doubt not you will get home without further
misadventure no matter how much you have suffered in the past. To you
others, however, who come here night after night to drink my choicest
wine and listen to my bard, I would insist as follows. Our guest has
already packed up the clothes, wrought gold, and other valuables
which you have brought for his acceptance; let us now, therefore,
present him further, each one of us, with a large tripod and a
cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy of a general rate
throughout the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>; for private individuals cannot be
expected to bear the burden of such a handsome present."</p>

<p><milestone n="16" unit="line"/>Every one approved of this, and
then they went home to bed each in his own abode. When the child of
morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they hurried down to the ship
and brought their cauldrons with them. Alkinoos went on board and saw
everything so securely stowed under the ship's benches that
nothing could break adrift and injure the rowers. Then they went to
the house of Alkinoos to get dinner, and he sacrificed a bull for
them in honor of Zeus who is the lord of all. They set the meats to
grill and made an excellent dinner, after which the inspired bard,
Demodokos, who was a favorite with every one, sang to them; but
Odysseus kept on turning his eyes towards the sun, as though to
hasten his setting, for he was longing to be on his way. As one who
has been all day ploughing a fallow field with a couple of oxen keeps
thinking about his supper and is glad when night comes that he may go
and get it, for it is all his legs can do to carry him, even so did
Odysseus rejoice when the sun went down, and he at once said to the
Phaeacians, addressing himself more particularly to King
Alkinoos:</p>

<p><milestone n="38" unit="line"/>"Sir, and all of you, farewell.
Make your drink-offerings and send me on my way rejoicing, for you
have fulfilled my heart's desire by giving me an escort, and
making me presents, which heaven grant that I may turn to good
account [<term lang="xgreek">olbios</term>]; may I find my admirable wife living
in peace among friends, and may you whom I leave behind me give
satisfaction to your wives and children; may heaven grant you every
good grace [<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>], and may no evil thing come
among your people."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="47">
<p><milestone n="47" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak. His hearers all
of them approved his saying and agreed that he should have his escort
inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Alkinoos therefore said to his
servant, "Pontonoos, mix some wine and hand it round to everybody,
that we may offer a prayer to father Zeus, and speed our guest upon
his way."</p>

<p><milestone n="53" unit="line"/>Pontonoos mixed the wine and
handed it to every one in turn; the others each from his own seat
made a drink-offering to the blessed gods that live in heaven, but
Odysseus rose and placed the double cup in the hands of queen
Arete.</p>

<p><milestone n="59" unit="line"/>"Farewell, queen," said he,
"henceforward and for ever, till age and death, the common lot of
humankind, lay their hands upon you. I now take my leave; be happy in
this house with your children, your people, and with king
Alkinoos."</p>

<p><milestone n="63" unit="line"/>As he spoke he crossed the
threshold, and Alkinoos sent a man to conduct him to his ship and to
the sea shore. Arete also sent some maid servants with him - one with
a clean shirt and cloak, another to carry his strong-box, and a third
with grain and wine. When they got to the water side the crew took
these things and put them on board, with all the meat and drink; but
for Odysseus they spread a rug and a linen sheet on deck that he
might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship. Then he too went on
board and lay down without a word, but the crew took every man his
place in order [<term lang="xgreek">kosmos</term>] and loosed the hawser from the
pierced stone to which it had been bound. Thereon, when they began
rowing out to sea, Odysseus fell into a deep, sweet, and almost
deathlike slumber.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="81">
<p><milestone n="81" unit="line"/>The ship bounded forward on her
way as a four in hand chariot flies over the course when the horses
feel the whip. Her prow curved as it were the neck of a stallion, and
a great wave of dark seething water boiled in her wake. She held
steadily on her course, and even a falcon, swiftest of all birds,
could not have kept pace with her. Thus, then, she cut her way
through the water. carrying one who was as cunning as the gods, but
who was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of all that he had
suffered both on the field of battle and by the waves of the weary
sea.</p>

<p><milestone n="93" unit="line"/>When the bright star that heralds
the approach of dawn began to show. the ship drew near to land. Now
there is in the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName> a haven of the Old One
of the Sea, Phorkys, which lies between two points that break the
line of the sea and shut the harbor in. These shelter it from the
storms of wind and sea that rage outside, so that, when once within
it, a ship may lie without being even moored. At the head of this
harbor there is a large olive tree, and at no distance a fine
overarching cavern sacred to the nymphs who are called Naiads. There
are mixing-bowls within it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hive
there. Moreover, there are great looms of stone on which the nymphs
weave their robes of sea purple - very curious to see - and at all
times there is water within it. It has two entrances, one facing
North by which mortals can go down into the cave, while the other
comes from the South and is more mysterious; mortals cannot possibly
get in by it, it is the way taken by the gods.</p>

<p><milestone n="113" unit="line"/>Into this harbor, then, they took
their ship, for they knew the place, She had so much way upon her
that she ran half her own length on to the shore; when, however, they
had landed, the first thing they did was to lift Odysseus with his
rug and linen sheet out of the ship, and lay him down upon the sand
still fast asleep. Then they took out the presents which Athena had
persuaded the Phaeacians to give him when he was setting out on his
voyage homewards. They put these all together by the root of the
olive tree, away from the road, for fear some passer by might come
and steal them before Odysseus awoke; and then they made the best of
their way home again.</p>

<p><milestone n="125" unit="line"/>But Poseidon did not forget the
threats with which he had already threatened Odysseus, so he took
counsel with Zeus. "Father Zeus," said he, "I shall no longer be held
in any sort of respect among you gods, if mortals like the
Phaeacians, who are my own flesh and blood, show such small regard
for me. I said I would get Odysseus home when he had suffered
sufficiently. I did not say that he should never have a homecoming
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] at all, for I knew you had already nodded
your head about it, and promised that he should do so; but now they
have brought him over the sea in a ship fast asleep and have landed
him in <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName> after loading him with more magnificent presents of
bronze, gold, and raiment than he would ever have brought back from
<placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>, if he had had his share of the spoil and got home without
misadventure."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="139">
<p><milestone n="139" unit="line"/>And Zeus answered, "What, O Lord
of the Earthquake, are you talking about? The gods are by no means
wanting in respect for you. It would be monstrous were they to insult
one so old and honored as you are. As regards mortals, however, if
any of them is indulging in insolence [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] and
treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself to
deal with him as you may think proper, so do just as you
please."</p>

<p><milestone n="146" unit="line"/>"I should have done so at once,"
replied Poseidon, "if I were not anxious to avoid anything that might
displease you; now, therefore, I should like to wreck the Phaeacian
ship as it is returning from its escort. This will stop them from
escorting people in future; and I should also like to envelop their
city under a huge mountain."</p>

<p><milestone n="153" unit="line"/>"My good friend," answered Zeus,
"I should recommend you at the very moment when the people from the
city are watching the ship on her way, to turn it into a rock near
the land and looking like a ship. This will astonish everybody, and
you can then envelop their city under the mountain."</p>

<p><milestone n="159" unit="line"/>When earth-encircling Poseidon
heard this he went to <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Scheria</placeName> where the Phaeacians live, and stayed
there till the ship, which was making rapid way, had got close-in.
Then he went up to it, turned it into stone, and drove it down with
the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground. After this he
went away.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="165">
<p><milestone n="165" unit="line"/>The Phaeacians then began talking
among themselves, and one would turn towards his neighbor, saying,
"Who is it that can have rooted the ship in the sea just as she was
getting into port? We could see the whole of her only a moment
ago."</p>

<p><milestone n="170" unit="line"/>This was how they talked, but
they knew nothing about it; and Alkinoos said, "I remember now the
old prophecy of my father. He said that Poseidon would be angry with
us for taking every one so safely over the sea, and would one day
wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning from an escort, and
envelop our city with a high mountain. This was what my old father
used to say, and now it is all coming true. Now therefore let us all
do as I say; in the first place we must leave off giving people
escorts when they come here, and in the next let us sacrifice twelve
picked [<term lang="xgreek">krin&ocirc;</term>] bulls to Poseidon that he may
have mercy upon us, and not envelop our city with the high mountain."
When the people heard this they were afraid and got ready the
bulls.</p>

<p><milestone n="185" unit="line"/>Thus did the chiefs and rulers of
the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of the Phaeacians to king Poseidon, standing
round his altar; and at the same time Odysseus woke up once more upon
his own soil. He had been so long away that he did not know it again;
moreover, Zeus&rsquo; daughter Athena had made it a foggy day, so that
people might not know of his having come, and that she might tell him
everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens and friends
recognizing him until he had taken his revenge upon the wicked
suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to him - the
long straight tracks, the harbors, the precipices, and the goodly
trees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his
native land. So he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and
cried aloud despairingly.</p>

<p><milestone n="200" unit="line"/>"Alas," he exclaimed, "among what
manner of people am I fallen? Are they savage and uncivilized
[not <term lang="xgreek">dikaios</term>] or hospitable and endowed with
god-fearing <term lang="xgreek">noos</term>? Where shall I put all this treasure, and
which way shall I go? I wish I had stayed over there with the
Phaeacians; or I could have gone to some other great chief who would
have been good to me and given me an escort. As it is I do not know
where to put my treasure, and I cannot leave it here for fear
somebody else should get hold of it. In good truth the chiefs and
rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly
[<term lang="xgreek">dikaios</term>] by me, and have left me in the wrong
country; they said they would take me back to <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName> and they have
not done so: may Zeus the protector of suppliants chastise them, for
he watches over everybody and punishes those who do wrong. Still, I
suppose I must count my goods and see if the crew have gone off with
any of them."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="217">
<p><milestone n="217" unit="line"/>He counted his goodly coppers and
cauldrons, his gold and all his clothes, but there was nothing
missing; still he kept grieving about not being in his own country,
and wandered up and down by the shore of the sounding sea bewailing
his hard fate. Then Athena came up to him disguised as a young
shepherd of delicate and princely mien, with a good cloak folded
double about her shoulders; she had sandals on her comely feet and
held a javelin in her hand. Odysseus was glad when he saw her, and
went straight up to her.</p>

<p><milestone n="228" unit="line"/>"My friend," said he, "you are
the first person whom I have met with in this country; I salute you,
therefore, and beg you to be well disposed in <term lang="xgreek">noos</term> towards me.
Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your knees and
pray to you as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell me
truly, what land and country [<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>] is this?
Who are its inhabitants? Am I on an island, or is this the sea board
of some continent?"</p>

<p><milestone n="236" unit="line"/>Athena answered, "Stranger, you
must be very simple, or must have come from somewhere a long way off,
not to know what country this is. It is a very celebrated place, and
everybody knows it East and West. It is rugged and not a good driving
country, but it is by no means a bad island for what there is of it.
It grows any quantity of grain and also wine, for it is watered both
by rain and dew; it breeds cattle also and goats; all kinds of timber
grow here, and there are watering places where the water never runs
dry; so, sir, the name of <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName> is known even as far as <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>, which
I understand to be a long way off from this Achaean
country."</p>

<p><milestone n="250" unit="line"/>Odysseus was glad at finding
himself, as Athena told him, in his own country, and he began to
answer, but he did not speak the truth
[<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;th&ecirc;s</term>], and made up a lying story in
the instinctive wiliness of his <term lang="xgreek">noos</term>.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="256">
<p><milestone n="256" unit="line"/>"I heard of <placeName key="tgn,7013803">Ithaca</placeName>," said he,
"when I was in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> beyond the seas, and now it seems I have reached
it with all these treasures. I have left as much more behind me for
my children, but am fleeing because I killed Orsilokhos son of
Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>. I killed him because he
wanted to rob me of the spoils I had got from <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName> with so much
trouble and danger both on the field of battle and by the waves of
the weary sea; he said I had not served his father loyally in the
Trojan <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> as vassal, but had set myself up as an
independent ruler, so I lay in wait for him and with one of my
followers by the road side, and speared him as he was coming into
town from the country. It was a very dark night and nobody saw us; it
was not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but as soon as I had
done so I went to a ship and besought the owners, who were
Phoenicians, to take me on board and set me in <placeName key="tgn,7011036">Pylos</placeName> or in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> where
the Epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them. They
meant no guile, but the wind drove them off their course, and we
sailed on till we came hither by night. It was all we could do to get
inside the harbor, and none of us said a word about supper though we
wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as we
were. I was very tired and fell asleep directly, so they took my
goods out of the ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying
upon the sand. Then they sailed away to Sidonia, and I was left here
in great distress of mind."</p>

<p><milestone n="287" unit="line"/>Such was his story, but Athena
smiled and caressed him with her hand. Then she took the form of a
woman, fair, stately, and wise, "He must be indeed a shifty and
deceitful person," said she, "who could surpass you in all manner of
craft [<term lang="xgreek">kerdos</term>] even though you had a god for your
antagonist. Daring that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit
[<term lang="xgreek">apat&ecirc;</term>], can you not drop your tricks and your
instinctive falsehood, even now that you are in your own country
again? We will say no more, however, about this, for we both of us
know craftiness [<term lang="xgreek">kerdos</term>] upon occasion - you are the
best counselor and orator among all humankind, while I for diplomacy
and crafty ways [<term lang="xgreek">kerdea</term>] have fame
[<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] among the gods. Did you not know Zeus&rsquo;
daughter Athena - me, who have been ever with you, who kept watch
over you in all your ordeals [<term lang="xgreek">ponoi</term>], and who made the
Phaeacians take so great a liking to you? And now, again, I am come
here to talk things over with you, and help you to hide the treasure
I made the Phaeacians give you; I want to tell you about the troubles
that await you in your own house; you have got to face them, but tell
no one, neither man nor woman, that you have come home again. Bear
everything, and put up with every man's violent insolence
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>], without a word."</p>

<p><milestone n="311" unit="line"/>And Odysseus answered, "A man,
goddess, may know a great deal, but you are so constantly changing
your appearance that when he meets you it is a hard matter for him to
know whether it is you or not. This much, however, I know exceedingly
well; you were very kind to me as long as we Achaeans were fighting
before <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, but from the day on which we went on board ship after
having sacked the city of Priam, and heaven dispersed us - from that
day, Athena, I saw no more of you, and cannot ever remember your
coming to my ship to help me in a difficulty; I had to wander on sick
and sorry till the gods delivered me from evil and I reached the
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and
took me into the town. And now, I beseech you in your father's
name, tell me the truth, for I do not believe I am really back in
<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. I am in some other country and you are mocking me and
deceiving me in all you have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I
really got back to my own country?"</p>

<p><milestone n="329" unit="line"/>"You are always taking something
of that sort into your head," replied Athena, "and that is why I
cannot desert you in your afflictions; you are so plausible, shrewd
and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning from so long a voyage
would at once have gone home to see his wife and children, but you do
not seem to care about asking after them or hearing any news about
them till you have made trial of your wife, who remains at home
vainly grieving for you, and having no peace night or day for the
tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming near you, I was
never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back safely
though you would lose all your men, and I did not wish to quarrel
with my uncle Poseidon, who never forgave you for having blinded his
son. I will now, however, point out to you the lie of the land, and
you will then perhaps believe me. This is the haven of the Old One of
the Sea, Phorkys, and here is the olive tree that grows at the head
of it; [near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;] here too
is the overarching cavern in which you have offered many an
acceptable hecatomb to the nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain
Neritum."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="352">
<p><milestone n="352" unit="line"/>As she spoke the goddess
dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then Odysseus rejoiced at
finding himself again in his own land, and kissed the bounteous soil;
he lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs, saying, "Naiad
nymphs, daughters of Zeus, I made sure that I was never again to see
you, now therefore I greet you with all loving salutations, and I
will bring you offerings as in the old days, if Zeus&rsquo;
redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my son to
manhood."</p>

<p><milestone n="362" unit="line"/>"Take heart, and do not trouble
yourself about that," rejoined Athena, "let us rather set about
stowing your things at once in the cave, where they will be quite
safe. Let us see how we can best manage it all."</p>

<p><milestone n="366" unit="line"/>Therewith she went down into the
cave to look for the safest hiding places, while Odysseus brought up
all the treasure of gold, bronze, and good clothing which the
Phaeacians had given him. They stowed everything carefully away, and
Athena set a stone against the door of the cave. Then the two sat
down by the root of the great olive, and consulted how to compass the
destruction of the wicked suitors.</p>

<p><milestone n="375" unit="line"/>"Odysseus," said Athena, "noble
son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, think how you can lay hands on these disreputable
people who have been lording it in your house these three years,
courting your wife and making wedding presents to her, while she does
nothing but mourning your <term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>, giving hope and sending
encouraging messages to every one of them, but meaning [in her
<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] the very opposite of all she says."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="382">
<p><milestone n="382" unit="line"/>And Odysseus answered, "In good
truth, goddess, it seems I should have come to much the same bad end
in my own house as Agamemnon did, if you had not given me such timely
information. Advise me how I shall best avenge myself. Stand by my
side and put your courage into my heart as on the day when we loosed
<placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>'s fair diadem from her brow. Help me now as you did then,
and I will fight three hundred men, if you, goddess, will be with
me."</p>

<p><milestone n="393" unit="line"/>"Trust me for that," said she, "I
will not lose sight of you when once we set about it, and I would
imagine that some of those who are devouring your substance will then
bespatter the pavement with their blood and brains. I will begin by
disguising you so that no human being shall know you; I will cover
your body with wrinkles; you shall lose all your yellow hair; I will
clothe you in a garment that shall fill all who see it with loathing;
I will blear your fine eyes for you, and make you an unseemly object
in the sight of the suitors, of your wife, and of the son whom you
left behind you. Then go at once to the swineherd who is in charge of
your pigs; he has been always well affected towards you, and is
devoted to Penelope and your son; you will find him feeding his pigs
near the rock that is called Raven by the fountain Arethusa, where
they are fattening on beechmast and spring water after their manner.
Stay with him and find out how things are going, while I proceed to
<placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and see your son, who is with Menelaos at <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, where he
has gone to try and find a report [<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] on whether
you are still alive."</p>

<p><milestone n="416" unit="line"/>"But why," said Odysseus, "did
you not tell him, for you knew all about it? Did you want him too to
go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship while others are eating
up his estate?"</p>

<p><milestone n="420" unit="line"/>Athena answered, "Never mind
about him, I sent him that he might be well spoken
[<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] of for having gone. He is in no sort of
difficulty [<term lang="xgreek">ponos</term>], but is staying quite comfortably
with Menelaos, and is surrounded with abundance of every kind. The
suitors have put out to sea and are lying in wait for him, for they
mean to kill him before he can get home. I do not much think they
will succeed, but rather that some of those who are now eating up
your estate will first find a grave themselves."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="429">
<p><milestone n="429" unit="line"/>As she spoke Athena touched him
with her wand and covered him with wrinkles, took away all his yellow
hair, and withered the flesh over his whole body; she bleared his
eyes, which were naturally very fine ones; she changed his clothes
and threw an old rag of a wrap about him, and a tunic, tattered,
filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she also gave him an undressed deer
skin as an outer garment, and furnished him with a staff and a wallet
all in holes, with a twisted thong for him to sling it over his
shoulder.</p>

<p><milestone n="439" unit="line"/>When the pair had thus laid their
plans they parted, and the goddess went straight to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> to
fetch Telemakhos. <milestone n="440" unit="line"/></p>
</div2></div1>

<div1 type="Book" n="14">
<head>Scroll 14</head>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Odysseus now left the haven, and
took the rough track up through the wooded country and over the crest
of the mountain till he reached the place where Athena had said that
he would find the swineherd, who was the most thrifty servant he had.
He found him sitting in front of his hut, which was by the yards that
he had built on a site which could be seen from far. He had made them
spacious and fair to see, with a free ran for the pigs all round
them; he had built them during his master's absence, of stones
which he had gathered out of the ground, without saying anything to
Penelope or <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, and he had fenced them on top with thorn bushes.
Outside the yard he had run a strong fence of oaken posts, split, and
set pretty close together, while inside lie had built twelve sties
near one another for the sows to lie in. There were fifty pigs
wallowing in each sty, all of them breeding sows; but the boars slept
outside and were much fewer in number, for the suitors kept on eating
them, and the swineherd had to send them the best he had continually.
There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the herdsman's
four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always with them.
The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of sandals from a
good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding the pigs in one
place or another, and he had sent the fourth to town with a boar that
he had been forced to send the suitors that they might sacrifice it
and have their fill of meat.</p>

<p><milestone n="29" unit="line"/>When the hounds saw Odysseus they
set up a furious barking and flew at him, but Odysseus was cunning
enough to sit down and loose his hold of the stick that he had in his
hand: still, he would have been torn by them in his own homestead had
not the swineherd dropped his ox hide, rushed full speed through the
gate of the yard and driven the dogs off by shouting and throwing
stones at them. Then he said to Odysseus, "Old man, the dogs were
likely to have made short work of you, and then you would have got me
into trouble. The gods have given me quite enough worries without
that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am in continual grief
on his account. I have to attend swine for other people to eat, while
he, if he yet lives to see the light of day, is starving in some
distant <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>. But come inside, and when you have had
your fill of bread and wine, tell me where you come from, and all
about your misfortunes."</p>

<p><milestone n="48" unit="line"/>On this the swineherd led the way
into the hut and bade him sit down. He strewed a good thick bed of
rushes upon the floor, and on the top of this he threw the shaggy
chamois skin - a great thick one - on which he used to sleep by
night. Odysseus was pleased at being made thus welcome, and said "May
Zeus, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you your heart's
desire in return for the kind way in which you have received
me."</p>

<p><milestone n="55" unit="line"/>To this you answered, O swineherd
Eumaios, "Stranger, though a still poorer man should come here, it
would not be right for me to insult him, for all strangers and
beggars are from Zeus. You must take what you can get and be
thankful, for servants live in fear when they have young lords for
their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for heaven has hindered
the return [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] of him who would have been always
good to me and given me something of my own - a house, a piece of
land, a good looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows
a servant who has worked hard for him, and whose labor the gods have
prospered as they have mine in the situation which I hold. If my
master had grown old here he would have done great things by me, but
he is gone, and I wish that Helen's whole race were utterly
destroyed, for she has been the death of many a good man. It was this
matter that took my master to <placeName key="tgn,7002329">Ilion</placeName>, the land of noble steeds, to
fight the Trojans in the cause of king Agamemnon."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="72">
<p><milestone n="72" unit="line"/>As he spoke he bound his belt
round him and went to the sties where the young sucking pigs were
penned. He picked out two which he brought back with him and
sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted on them; when
the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it before Odysseus,
hot and still on the spit, whereon Odysseus sprinkled it over with
white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of
ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Odysseus told him to
begin.</p>

<p><milestone n="80" unit="line"/>"Fall to, stranger," said he, "on
a dish of servant's pork. The fat pigs have to go to the
suitors, who eat them up without shame or scruple; but the blessed
gods love not such shameful doings, and respect those who do what is
lawful and right [<term lang="xgreek">dik&ecirc;</term>]. Even the fierce
free-booters who go raiding on other people's land, and Zeus
gives them their spoil - even they, when they have filled their ships
and got home again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for
judgment; but some god seems to have told these people that Odysseus
is dead and gone; they will not, therefore, go back to their own
homes and make their offers of marriage in the proper way
[<term lang="xgreek">dikaios</term>], but waste his estate by force, without fear
or stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they sacrifice
not one victim nor two only, and they take the run of his wine, for
he was exceedingly rich. No other great man either in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> or on
the mainland is as rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men put
together. I will tell you what he had. There are twelve herds of
cattle upon the mainland, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also
twelve droves of pigs, while his own men and hired strangers feed him
twelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> he runs even
large flocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in
the charge of excellent goatherds. Each one of these sends the
suitors the best goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in
charge of the pigs that you see here, and I have to keep picking
[<term lang="xgreek">krin&ocirc;</term>] out the best I have and sending it to
them."</p>

<p><milestone n="109" unit="line"/>This was his story, but Odysseus
went on eating and drinking ravenously without a word, brooding his
revenge. When he had eaten enough and was satisfied, the swineherd
took the bowl from which he usually drank, filled it with wine, and
gave it to Odysseus, who was pleased, and said as he took it in his
hands, "My friend, who was this master of yours that bought you and
paid for you, so rich and so powerful as you tell me? You say he
perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell me who he was, in case
I may have met with such a person. Zeus and the other gods know, but
I may be able to give you news of him, for I have traveled
much."</p>

<p><milestone n="121" unit="line"/>Eumaios answered, "Old man, no
traveler who comes here with news will get Odysseus&rsquo; wife and
son to believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in want of a lodging
keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a word of truth
[<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;th&ecirc;s</term>]; every one who finds his way to
the Ithacan <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> goes to my mistress and tells her
falsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes much of them, and asks
them all manner of questions, crying all the time as women will when
they have lost their husbands. And you too, old man, for a shirt and
a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty story. But the wolves
and birds of prey have long since torn Odysseus to pieces, and his
<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term> left him behind; or the fishes of the sea have
eaten him, and his bones are lying buried deep in sand upon some
foreign shore; he is dead and gone, and a bad business it is for all
his friends - for me especially; go where I may I shall never find so
good a master, not even if I were to go home to my mother and father
where I was bred and born. I do not so much care, however, about my
parents now, though I should dearly like to see them again in my own
country; it is the loss of Odysseus that grieves me most; I cannot
speak of him without reverence though he is here no longer, for he
was very fond of me, and took such care of me that wherever he may be
I shall always honor his memory."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="148">
<p><milestone n="148" unit="line"/>"My friend," replied Odysseus,
"you are very positive, and very hard of belief about your
master's coming home again, nevertheless I will not merely say,
but will swear, that he is coming. Do not give me anything for my
news till he has actually come, you may then give me a shirt and
cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I will not
take anything at all till then, for hateful [<term lang="xgreek">ekhthros</term>]
is the man, as hateful as Hades, who lets his poverty tempt him into
lying. I swear by king Zeus, by the rites of hospitality, and by that
hearth of Odysseus to which I have now come, that all will surely
happen as I have said it will. Odysseus will return in this self same
year; with the end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will
be here to do vengeance on all those who are ill treating his wife
and son."</p>

<p><milestone n="165" unit="line"/>To this you answered, O swineherd
Eumaios, "Old man, you will neither get paid for bringing good news,
nor will Odysseus ever come home; drink you wine in peace, and let us
talk about something else. Do not keep on reminding me of all this;
it always pains me when any one speaks about my honored master. As
for your oath we will let it alone, but I only wish he may come, as
do Penelope, his old father <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, and his son Telemakhos. I am
terribly unhappy too about this same boy of his; he was running up
fast into manhood, and bade fare to be no worse man, face and figure,
than his father, but some one, either god or man, has been unsettling
his mind, so he has gone off to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> to try and get news of his
father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is coming
home, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a name in
<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. But let us say no more about him, and leave him to be taken,
or else to escape if the son of Kronos holds his hand over him to
protect him. And now, old man, tell me your own story; tell me also,
for I want to know, who you are and where you come from. Tell me of
your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, what crew
brought you to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and from what country they professed to come -
for you cannot have come by land."</p>

<p><milestone n="191" unit="line"/>And Odysseus answered, "I will
tell you all about it. If there were meat and wine enough, and we
could stay here in the hut with nothing to do but to eat and drink
while the others go to their work, I could easily talk on for a whole
twelve months without ever finishing the story of the sorrows with
which it has pleased heaven to visit me.</p>

<p><milestone n="199" unit="line"/>"I am by birth a Cretan; my
father was a well-to-do man, who had many sons born in marriage,
whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had purchased for a
concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax (whose lineage
I claim, and who was held in the highest honor in the
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of the Cretans for his wealth, prosperity
[<term lang="xgreek">olbos</term>], and the valor of his sons) put me on the same
level with my brothers who had been born in wedlock. When, however,
death took him to the house of Hades, his sons divided his estate and
cast lots for their shares, but to me they gave a holding and little
else; nevertheless, my valor [<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>] enabled me
to marry into a rich family, for I was not given to bragging, or
shirking on the field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you
look at the straw you can see what the ear was, for I have had
trouble enough and to spare. Ares and Athena made me doughty in war;
when I had picked [<term lang="xgreek">krin&ocirc;</term>] my men to surprise the
enemy with an ambuscade I never gave death so much as a thought, but
was the first to leap forward and spear all whom I could overtake.
Such was I in battle, but I did not care about farm work, nor the
frugal home life of those who would bring up children. My delight was
in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows - things that most men
shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing and another another,
and this was what I was most naturally inclined to. Before the
Achaeans went to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, nine times was I in command of men and ships
on foreign service, and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the
spoil in the first instance, and much more was allotted to me later
on.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="233">
<p><milestone n="233" unit="line"/>"My house grew apace and I became
a great man among the Cretans, but when Zeus counseled that terrible
expedition, in which so many perished, the people required me and
Idomeneus to lead their ships to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and there was no way out of
it, for the judgment of the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> insisted on our doing
so. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked
the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then
it was that Zeus devised evil against me. I spent but one month
happily with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived
the idea of making a descent on <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, so I fitted out a fine fleet
and manned it. I had nine ships, and the people flocked to fill them.
For six days I and my men made feast, and I found them many victims
both for sacrifice to the gods and for themselves, but on the seventh
day we went on board and set sail from <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> with a fair North wind
behind us though we were going down a river. Nothing went ill with
any of our ships, and we had no sickness on board, but sat where we
were and let the ships go as the wind and steersmen took them. On the
fifth day we reached the river Aigyptos; there I stationed my ships
in the river, bidding my men stay by them and keep guard over them
while I sent out scouts to reconnoiter from every point of
vantage.</p>

<p><milestone n="262" unit="line"/>"But the men in their insolence
[<term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>] disobeyed my orders, took to their own
devices, and ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and
taking their wives and children captive. The alarm was soon carried
to the city, and when they heard the war cry, the people came out at
daybreak till the plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers
and with the gleam of armor. Then Zeus spread panic among my men, and
they would no longer face the enemy, for they found themselves
surrounded. The Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive
to do forced labor for them. Zeus, however, put it in my mind to do
thus - and I wish I had died then and there in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> instead, for
there was much sorrow in store for me - I took off my helmet and
shield and dropped my spear from my hand; then I went straight up to
the king's chariot, clasped his knees and kissed them, whereon
he spared my life, bade me get into his chariot, and took me weeping
to his own home. Many made at me with their ashen spears and tried to
kill me in their fury, but the king protected me, for he feared the
<term lang="xgreek">m&ecirc;nis</term> of Zeus the protector of strangers, who punishes
those who do evil.</p>

<p><milestone n="285" unit="line"/>"I stayed there for seven years
and got together much wealth among the Egyptians, for they all gave
me something; but when it was now going on for eight years there came
a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who had already committed all
sorts of villainy, and this man talked me over into going with him to
<placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>, where his house and his possessions lay. I stayed there
for a whole twelve months, but at the end of that time when months
and days had gone by till the same season [<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>]
had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound for <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>, on a
pretense that I was to take a cargo along with him to that place, but
really that he might sell me as a slave and take the wealth I
fetched. I suspected his intention, but went on board with him, for I
could not help it.</p>

<p><milestone n="299" unit="line"/>"The ship ran before a fresh
North wind till we had reached the sea that lies between <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> and
<placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName>; there, however, Zeus counseled their destruction, for as soon
as we were well out from <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> and could see nothing but sea and sky,
he raised a black cloud over our ship and the sea grew dark beneath
it. Then Zeus let fly with his thunderbolts and the ship went round
and round and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning
struck it. The men fell all into the sea; they were carried about in
the water round the ship looking like so many sea-gulls, but the god
presently deprived them of all chance of homecoming
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] again. I was all dismayed; Zeus, however,
sent the ship's mast within my reach, which saved my life, for I
clung to it, and drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I
drift but in the darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on
to the Thesprotian coast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotians
entertained me hospitably without charging me anything at all, for
his son found me when I was nearly dead with cold and fatigue,
whereon he raised me by the hand, took me to his father's house
and gave me clothes to wear.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="321">
<p><milestone n="321" unit="line"/>"There it was that I heard news
of Odysseus, for the king told me he had entertained him, and shown
him much hospitality while he was on his homeward journey. He showed
me also the treasure of gold, and wrought iron that Odysseus had got
together. There was enough to keep his family for ten generations, so
much had he left in the house of king Pheidon. But the king said
Odysseus had gone to <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> that he might learn Zeus&rsquo; mind from
the god's high oak tree, and know whether after so long an
absence he should return to the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> openly,
or in secret. Moreover the king swore in my presence, making
drink-offerings in his own house as he did so, that the ship was by
the water side, and the crew found, that should take him to his own
country. He sent me off however before Odysseus returned, for there
happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing
island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge of her to be sure
and take me safely to King Akastos.</p>

<p><milestone n="337" unit="line"/>"These men hatched a plot against
me that would have reduced me to the very extreme of misery, for when
the ship had got some way out from land they resolved on selling me
as a slave. They stripped me of the shirt and cloak that I was
wearing, and gave me instead the tattered old clouts in which you now
see me; then, towards nightfall, they reached the tilled lands of
<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and there they bound me with a strong rope fast in the ship,
while they went on shore to get supper by the sea side. But the gods
soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn my rags over my head I
slid down the rudder into the sea, where I struck out and swam till I
was well clear of them, and came ashore near a thick wood in which I
lay concealed. They were very angry at my having escaped and went
searching about for me, till at last they thought it was no further
use and went back to their ship. The gods, having hidden me thus
easily, then took me to a good man's door - for it seems that I
am not to die yet awhile."</p>

<p><milestone n="360" unit="line"/>To this you answered, O swineherd
Eumaios, "Poor unhappy stranger, I have found the story of your
misfortunes extremely interesting, but that part about Odysseus is
not right [<term lang="xgreek">kosmos</term>]; and you will never get me to
believe it. Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this
way? I know all about the return [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] of my
master. The gods one and all of them detest him, or they would have
taken him before <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, or let him die with friends around him when
the days of his fighting were done; for then the Achaeans would have
built a mound over his ashes and his son would have been heir to his
<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>, but now the storm winds have spirited him away we know
not where.</p>

<p><milestone n="372" unit="line"/>"As for me I live out of the way
here with the pigs, and never go to the town unless when Penelope
sends for me on the arrival of some news about Odysseus. Then they
all sit round and ask questions, both those who grieve over the
king's absence, and those who rejoice at it because they can eat
up his property without paying for it. For my own part I have never
cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was taken in by
an Aetolian, who had killed a man and come a long way till at last he
reached my station, and I was very kind to him. He said he had seen
Odysseus with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting his ships which
had been damaged in a gale. He said Odysseus would return in the
following summer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back
much wealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man, since a
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> has brought you to my door, do not try to flatter
me in this way with vain hopes. It is not for any such reason that I
shall treat you kindly, but only out of respect for Zeus the god of
hospitality, as fearing him and pitying you."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="390">
<p><milestone n="390" unit="line"/>Odysseus answered, "I see that
you are of an unbelieving mind; I have given you my oath, and yet you
will not credit me; let us then make a bargain, and call all the gods
in heaven to witness it. If your master comes home, give me a cloak
and shirt of good wear, and send me to Dulichium where I want to go;
but if he does not come as I say he will, set your men on to me, and
tell them to throw me from yonder precipice, as a warning to tramps
not to go about the country telling lies."</p>

<p><milestone n="401" unit="line"/>"And <term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term> famed
among men would be mine<term lang="xgreek"></term> " replied Eumaios, "both now and
hereafter, if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut and
showing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good
earnest if I did; but it is just supper time
[<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>] and I hope my men will come in directly,
that we may cook something savory for supper."</p>

<p><milestone n="409" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse, and
presently the swineherds came up with the pigs, which were then shut
up for the night in their sties, and a tremendous squealing they made
as they were being driven into them. But Eumaios called to his men
and said, "Bring in the best pig you have, that I may sacrifice for
this stranger, and we will take toll of him ourselves. We have had
trouble enough this long time feeding pigs, while others reap the
fruit of our labor."</p>

<p><milestone n="418" unit="line"/>On this he began chopping
firewood, while the others brought in a fine fat five year old boar
pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaios did not forget the gods, for he
was a man of good principles, so the first thing he did was to cut
bristles from the pig's face and throw them into the fire,
praying to all the gods as he did so that Odysseus might return home
again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which he had kept
back when he was chopping the firewood, and its <term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;
</term>left it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they
cut it up, and Eumaios began by putting raw pieces from each joint on
to some of the fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid
upon the embers; they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the
pieces upon the spits and roasted them till they were done; when they
had taken them off the spits they threw them on to the dresser in a
heap. The swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then stood up to
give every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he set
apart for Hermes the son of <placeName key="tgn,1049816">Maia</placeName> and the nymphs, praying to them as
he did so; the others he dealt out to the men man by man. He gave
Odysseus some slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark of
especial honor, and Odysseus was much pleased. "I hope, Eumaios,"
said he, "that Zeus will be as well disposed towards you as I am, for
the respect you are showing to an outcast like myself."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="441">
<p><milestone n="441" unit="line"/>To this you answered, O swineherd
Eumaios, "Eat, my good fellow, and enjoy your supper, such as it is.
A god grants this, and withholds that, just as he thinks right, for
he can do whatever he chooses."</p>

<p><milestone n="446" unit="line"/>As he spoke he cut off the first
piece and offered it as a burnt sacrifice to the immortal gods; then
he made them a drink-offering, put the cup in the hands of Odysseus,
and sat down to his own portion. Mesaulios brought them their bread;
the swineherd had bought this man on his own account from among the
Taphians during his master's absence, and had paid for him with
his own wealth without saying anything either to his mistress or
<placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>. They then laid their hands upon the good things that were
before them, and when they had had enough to eat and drink, Mesaulios
took away what was left of the bread, and they all went to bed after
having made a hearty supper.</p>

<p><milestone n="457" unit="line"/>Now the night came on stormy and
very dark, for there was no moon. It poured without ceasing, and the
wind blew strong from the West, which is a wet quarter, so Odysseus
thought he would see whether Eumaios, in the excellent care he took
of him, would take off his own cloak and give it him, or make one of
his men give him one. "Listen to me," said he, "Eumaios and the rest
of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell you something. It is
the wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will make even a wise
man fall to singing; it will make him chuckle and dance and say many
a word that he had better leave unspoken; still, as I have begun, I
will go on. Would that I were still young and strong
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] as when we got up an ambuscade before
<placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. Menelaos and Odysseus were the leaders, but I was in command
also, for the other two would have it so. When we had come up to the
wall of the city we crouched down beneath our armor and lay there
under cover of the reeds and thick brush-wood that grew about the
swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the snow fell
small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick
with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept
comfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders, but I
had carelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I should be
too cold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and shield. When
the night was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted their
places, I nudged Odysseus who was close to me with my elbow, and he
at once gave me his ear.</p>

<p><milestone n="486" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Odysseus,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;this cold will be the death of me, for I have no cloak; some
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my
shirt, and I do not know what to do.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="490">
<p><milestone n="490" unit="line"/>"Odysseus, who was as crafty as
he was valiant, hit upon the following plan
[<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>]:</p>

<p><milestone n="493" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;Keep still,&rsquo; said he
in a low voice, &lsquo;or the others will hear you.&rsquo; Then he
raised his head on his elbow.</p>

<p><milestone n="495" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;My friends,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We are a long way
from the ships; I wish some one would go down and tell Agamemnon to
send us up more men at once.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="499" unit="line"/>"On this Thoas son of Andraimon
threw off his cloak and set out running to the ships, whereon I took
the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough till morning. Would that I
were still young and strong [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] as I was in
those days, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak
both out of good will and for the respect
[<term lang="xgreek">aid&ocirc;s</term>] due to a brave warrior; but now people
look down upon me because my clothes are shabby."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="507">
<p><milestone n="507" unit="line"/>And Eumaios answered, "Old man,
you have told us an excellent story [<term lang="xgreek">ainos</term>], and have
said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the present,
therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else that a
stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but tomorrow morning you
have to shake your own old rags about your body again, for we have
not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has only one.
When Odysseus&rsquo; son comes home again he will give you both cloak
and shirt, and send you wherever you may want to go."</p>

<p><milestone n="518" unit="line"/>With this he got up and made a
bed for Odysseus by throwing some goatskins and sheepskins on the
ground in front of the fire. Here Odysseus lay down, and Eumaios
covered him over with a great heavy cloak that he kept for a change
in case of extraordinarily bad weather.</p>

<p><milestone n="523" unit="line"/>Thus did Odysseus sleep, and the
young men slept beside him. But the swineherd did not like sleeping
away from his pigs, so he got ready to go and Odysseus was glad to
see that he looked after his property during his master's
absence. First he slung his sword over his brawny shoulders and put
on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He also took the skin of a
large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of attack from men or
dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where the pigs were camping
under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from the North wind.

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>But Athena went to the fair city of
<placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> to tell Odysseus&rsquo; son that he was to return
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] at once. She found him and Peisistratos
sleeping in the forecourt of Menelaos&rsquo; house; Peisistratos was
fast asleep, but Telemakhos could get no rest all night for thinking
of his unhappy father, so Athena went close up to him and
said:</p>

<p><milestone n="10" unit="line"/>"Telemakhos, you should not remain
so far away from home any longer, nor leave your property with such
dangerous people in your house; they will eat up everything you have
among them, and you will have been on a fool's errand. Ask
Menelaos to send you home at once if you wish to find your excellent
mother still there when you get back. Her father and brothers are
already urging her to marry Eurymakhos, who has given her more than
any of the others, and has been greatly increasing his wedding
presents. I hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the house
in spite of you, but you know what women are - they always want to do
the best they can for the man who marries them, and never give
another thought to the children of their first husband, nor to their
father either when he is dead and done with. Go home, therefore, and
put everything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that
you have, until it shall please heaven to send you a wife of your
own. Let me tell you also of another matter which you had better
attend to. The chief men among the suitors are lying in wait for you
in the Strait between <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002673">Samos</placeName>, and they mean to kill you
before you can reach home. I do not much think they will succeed; it
is more likely that some of those who are now eating up your property
will find a grave themselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship
well away from the islands; the god who watches over you and protects
you will send you a fair wind. As soon as you get to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> send your
ship and men on to the town, but yourself go straight to the
swineherd who has charge your pigs; he is well disposed towards you,
stay with him, therefore, for the night, and then send him to
Penelope to tell her that you have got back safe from
<placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>."</p>

<p><milestone n="43" unit="line"/>Then she went back to <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>; but
Telemakhos stirred Peisistratos with his heel to rouse him, and said,
"Wake up Peisistratos, and yoke the horses to the chariot, for we
must set off home."</p>

<p><milestone n="48" unit="line"/>But Peisistratos said, "No matter
what hurry we are in we cannot drive in the dark. It will be morning
soon; wait till Menelaos has brought his presents and put them in the
chariot for us; and let him say good-bye to us in the usual way. So
long as he lives a guest should never forget a host who has shown him
kindness."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="56">
<p><milestone n="56" unit="line"/>As he spoke day began to break,
and Menelaos, who had already risen, leaving Helen in bed, came
towards them. When Telemakhos saw him he put on his shirt as fast as
he could, threw a great cloak over his shoulders, and went out to
meet him. "Menelaos," said he, "let me go back now to my own country,
for I want to get home [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]."</p>

<p><milestone n="67" unit="line"/>And Menelaos answered,
"Telemakhos, if you insist on going I will not detain you. I do not
like to see a host either too fond of his guest or too rude to him.
Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a man go when he
wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he would like to
stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is in the house and
speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait, then, till I can get your
beautiful presents into your chariot, and till you have yourself seen
them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient dinner for you of
what there may be in the house; it will be at once more proper and
cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out on such a long
journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a tour in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>
or in the <placeName key="tgn,7017076">Peloponnese</placeName>, I will yoke my horses, and will conduct you
myself through all our principal cities. No one will send us away
empty handed; every one will give us something - a bronze tripod, a
couple of mules, or a gold cup."</p>

<p><milestone n="86" unit="line"/>"Menelaos," replied Telemakhos, "I
want to go home at once, for when I came away I left my property
without protection, and fear that while looking for my father I shall
come to ruin myself, or find that something valuable has been stolen
during my absence."</p>

<p><milestone n="92" unit="line"/>When Menelaos heard this he
immediately told his wife and servants to prepare a sufficient dinner
from what there might be in the house. At this moment Eteoneus joined
him, for he lived close by and had just got up; so Menelaos told him
to light the fire and cook some meat, which he at once did. Then
Menelaos went down into his fragrant store room, not alone, but Helen
went too, with Megapenthes. When he reached the place where the
treasures of his house were kept, he selected a double cup, and told
his son Megapenthes to bring also a silver mixing-bowl. Meanwhile
Helen went to the chest where she kept the lovely dresses which she
had made with her own hands, and took out one that was largest and
most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered like a star,
and lay at the very bottom of the chest. Then they all came back
through the house again till they got to Telemakhos, and Menelaos
said, "Telemakhos, may Zeus, the mighty husband of Hera, bring you
safely home [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] according to your desire. I will
now present you with the finest and most precious piece of plate in
all my house. It is a mixing-bowl of pure silver, except the rim,
which is inlaid with gold, and it is the work of Hephaistos.
Phaidimos king of the Sidonians made me a present of it in the course
of a visit that I paid him while I was on my return home. I should
like to give it to you."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="120">
<p><milestone n="120" unit="line"/>With these words he placed the
double cup in the hands of Telemakhos, while Megapenthes brought the
beautiful mixing-bowl and set it before him. Hard by stood lovely
Helen with the robe ready in her hand.</p>

<p><milestone n="125" unit="line"/>"I too, my son," said she, "have
something for you as a keepsake from the hand of Helen; it is for
your bride to wear upon her wedding day [<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>].
Till then, get your dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go
back rejoicing to your own country and to your home."</p>

<p><milestone n="130" unit="line"/>So saying she gave the robe over
to him and he received it gladly. Then Peisistratos put the presents
into the chariot, and admired them all as he did so. Presently
Menelaos took Telemakhos and Peisistratos into the house, and they
both of them sat down to table. A maid servant brought them water in
a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it into a silver basin for them
to wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside them; an upper
servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of what
there was in the house. Eteoneus carved the meat and gave them each
their portions, while Megapenthes poured out the wine. Then they laid
their hands upon the good things that were before them, but as soon
as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemakhos and Peisistratos
yoked the horses, and took their places in the chariot. They drove
out through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the
outer court, and Menelaos came after them with a golden goblet of
wine in his right hand that they might make a drink-offering before
they set out. He stood in front of the horses and pledged them,
saying, "Farewell to both of you; see that you tell Nestor how I have
treated you, for he was as kind to me as any father could be while we
Achaeans were fighting before <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>."</p>

<p><milestone n="154" unit="line"/>"We will be sure, sir," answered
Telemakhos, "to tell him everything as soon as we see him. I wish I
were as certain of finding Odysseus returned when I get back to
<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, that I might tell him of the very great kindness you have
shown me and of the many beautiful presents I am taking with
me."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="160">
<p><milestone n="160" unit="line"/>As he was thus speaking a bird
flew on his right hand - an eagle with a great white goose in its
talons which it had carried off from the farm yard - and all the men
and women were running after it and shouting. It came quite close up
to them and flew away on their right hands in front of the horses.
When they saw it they were glad, and their hearts took comfort within
them, whereon Peisistratos said, "Tell me, Menelaos, has heaven sent
this omen for us or for you?"</p>

<p><milestone n="169" unit="line"/>Menelaos was thinking what would
be the most proper answer for him to make, but Helen was too quick
for him and said, "I will read this matter as heaven has put it in my
heart, and as I doubt not that it will come to pass. The eagle came
from the mountain where it was bred and has its nest, and in like
manner Odysseus, after having traveled far and suffered much, will
return to take his revenge - if indeed he is not back already and
hatching mischief for the suitors."</p>

<p><milestone n="179" unit="line"/>"May Zeus so grant it," replied
Telemakhos; "if it should prove to be so, I will make vows to you as
though you were a god, even when I am at home."</p>

<p><milestone n="182" unit="line"/>As he spoke he lashed his horses
and they started off at full speed through the town towards the open
country. They swayed the yoke upon their necks and traveled the whole
day long till the sun set and darkness was over all the land. Then
they reached <placeName key="perseus,Pherai">Pherai</placeName>, where Diokles lived who was son of Ortilokhos,
the son of Alpheus. There they passed the night and were treated
hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,
they again yoked their horses and their places in the chariot. They
drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse
of the outer court. Then Peisistratos lashed his horses on and they
flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, and then
Telemakhos said:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="195">
<p><milestone n="195" unit="line"/>"Peisistratos, I hope you will
promise to do what I am going to ask you. You know our fathers were
old friends before us; moreover, we are both of an age, and this
journey has brought us together still more closely; do not,
therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me there, for if I go to
your father's house he will try to keep me in the warmth of his
good will towards me, and I must go home at once."</p>

<p><milestone n="202" unit="line"/>Peisistratos thought how he
should do as he was asked, and in the end he deemed it best to turn
his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaos&rsquo; beautiful
presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then he
said, "Go on board at once and tell your men to do so also before I
can reach home to tell my father. I know how obstinate he is, and am
sure he will not let you go; he will come down here to fetch you, and
he will not go back without you. But he will be very
angry."</p>

<p><milestone n="215" unit="line"/>With this he drove his goodly
steeds back to the city of the Pylians and soon reached his home, but
Telemakhos called the men together and gave his orders. "Now, my
men," said he, "get everything in order on board the ship, and let us
set out home."</p>

<p><milestone n="220" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak, and they went
on board even as he had said. But as Telemakhos was thus busied,
praying also and sacrificing to Athena in the ship's stern,
there came to him a man from a distant <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>, a seer
[<term lang="xgreek">mantis</term>], who was fleeing from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> because he had
killed a man. He was descended from Melampos, who used to live in
<placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, the land of sheep; he was rich and owned a great house, but he
was driven into exile by the great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus
seized violently [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] his goods and held them
for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in the house
of king Phylakos, and in much distress of mind both on account of the
daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrow
[<term lang="xgreek">at&ecirc;</term>] that dread Erinyes had laid upon him. In
the end, however, he escaped with his life, drove the cattle from
Phylake to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, avenged the wrong that had been done him, and gave
the daughter of Neleus to his brother. Then he left the
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> and went to <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, where it was ordained that he
should reign over many people. There he married, established himself,
and had two famous sons Antiphates and Mantios. Antiphates became
father of Oikleus, and Oikleus of Amphiaraos, who was dearly loved
both by Zeus and by Apollo, but he did not live to old age, for he
was killed in <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> by reason of a woman's gifts. His sons were
Alkmaion and Amphilokhos. Mantios, the other son of Melampos, was
father to Polypheides and Kleitos. Aurora, throned in gold, carried
off Kleitos for his beauty's sake, that he might dwell among the
immortals, but Apollo made Polypheides the greatest seer
[<term lang="xgreek">mantis</term>] in the whole world now that Amphiaraos was
dead. He quarreled with his father and went to live in <placeName key="perseus,Hyperesia">Hyperesia</placeName>,
where he remained and prophesied for all men.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="256">
<p><milestone n="256" unit="line"/>His son, Theoklymenos, it was who
now came up to Telemakhos as he was making drink-offerings and
praying in his ship. "Friend&rsquo;" said he, "now that I find you
sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your sacrifices
themselves, and by the <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> to whom you make them, I
pray you also by your own head and by those of your followers, tell
me the truth and nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell
me also of your town and parents."</p>

<p><milestone n="265" unit="line"/>Telemakhos said, "I will answer
you quite truly. I am from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and my father is &lsquo;Odysseus,
as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come to some miserable
end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew together to see
if I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a long
time."</p>

<p><milestone n="271" unit="line"/>"I too," answered Theoklymenos,
am an exile, for I have killed a man of my own race. He has many
brothers and kinsmen in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, and they have great power among the
Argives. I am fleeing to escape death at their hands, and am thus
doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the earth. I am your
suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship that they may not
kill me, for I know they are in pursuit."</p>

<p><milestone n="279" unit="line"/>"I will not refuse you," replied
Telemakhos, "if you wish to join us. Come, therefore, and in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>
we will treat you hospitably according to what we have."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="282">
<p><milestone n="282" unit="line"/>On this he received
Theoklymenos&rsquo; spear and laid it down on the deck of the ship. He
went on board and sat in the stern, bidding Theoklymenos sit beside
him; then the men let go the hawsers. Telemakhos told them to catch
hold of the ropes, and they made all haste to do so. They set the
mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and made it fast
with the forestays, and they hoisted their white sails with sheets of
twisted ox hide. Athena sent them a fair wind that blew fresh and
strong to take the ship on her course as fast as possible. Thus then
they passed by Krounoi and <placeName key="tgn,7010882">Khalkis</placeName>.</p>

<p><milestone n="296" unit="line"/>Presently the sun set and
darkness was over all the land. The vessel made a quick passage to
<placeName key="perseus,Pherai">Pherai</placeName> and thence on to <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>, where the Epeans rule. Telemakhos then
headed her for the flying islands, wondering within himself whether
he should escape death or should be taken prisoner.</p>

<p><milestone n="301" unit="line"/>Meanwhile Odysseus and the
swineherd were eating their supper in the hut, and the men supped
with them. As soon as they had had to eat and drink, Odysseus began
trying to prove the swineherd and see whether he would continue to
treat him kindly, and ask him to stay on at the station or pack him
off to the city; so he said:</p>

<p><milestone n="307" unit="line"/>"Eumaios, and all of you,
tomorrow I want to go away and begin begging about the town, so as to
be no more trouble to you or to your men. Give me your advice
therefore, and let me have a good guide to go with me and show me the
way. I will go the round of the city begging as I needs must, to see
if any one will give me a drink and a piece of bread. I should like
also to go to the house of Odysseus and bring news of her husband to
queen Penelope. I could then go about among the suitors and see if
out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner. I should soon
make them an excellent servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and
believe when I tell you that by the blessing of Hermes who gives
grace [<term lang="xgreek">kharis</term>] and good name to the works of all men,
there is no one living who would make a more handy servant than I
should - to put fresh wood on the fire, chop fuel, carve, cook, pour
out wine, and do all those services that poor men have to do for
their betters."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="325">
<p><milestone n="325" unit="line"/>The swineherd was very much
disturbed when he heard this. "Heaven help me," he exclaimed, "what
ever can have put such a notion as that into your head? If you go
near the suitors you will be undone to a certainty, for their
overweening pride [<term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>] and violent insolence
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] reach the very heavens. They would never
think of taking a man like you for a servant. Their servants are all
young men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and shirts, with well
looking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables are kept quite
clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay where you are,
then; you are not in anybody's way; I do not mind your being
here, no more do any of the others, and when Telemakhos comes home he
will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you want
to go."</p>

<p><milestone n="340" unit="line"/>Odysseus answered, "I hope you
may be as dear to the gods as you are to me, for having saved me from
going about and getting into trouble; there is nothing worse than
being always ways on the tramp; still, when men have once got low
down in the world they will go through a great deal on behalf of
their miserable bellies. Since however you press me to stay here and
await the return of Telemakhos, tell about Odysseus&rsquo; mother, and
his father whom he left on the threshold of old age when he set out
for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. Are they still living or are they already dead and in the
house of Hades?"</p>

<p><milestone n="351" unit="line"/>"I will tell you all about them,"
replied Eumaios, "<placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> is still living and prays heaven to let him
depart peacefully his own house, for he is terribly distressed about
the absence of his son, and also about the death of his wife, which
grieved him greatly and aged him more than anything else did. She
came to an unhappy end through sorrow for her son: may no friend or
neighbor who has dealt kindly by me come to such an end as she did.
As long as she was still living, though she was always grieving, I
used to like seeing her and asking her how she did, for she brought
me up along with her daughter Ktimene, the youngest of her children;
we were boy and girl together, and she made little difference between
us. When, however, we both grew up, they sent Ktimene to Same and
received a splendid dowry for her. As for me, my mistress gave me a
good shirt and cloak with a pair of sandals for my feet, and sent me
off into the country, but she was just as fond of me as ever. This is
all over now. Still it has pleased heaven to prosper my work in the
situation which I now hold. I have enough to eat and drink, and can
find something for any respectable stranger who comes here; but there
is no getting a kind word or deed out of my mistress, for the house
has fallen into the hands of wicked people. Servants want sometimes
to see their mistress and have a talk with her; they like to have
something to eat and drink at the house, and something too to take
back with them into the country. This is what will keep servants in a
good humor."</p>

<p><milestone n="380" unit="line"/>Odysseus answered, "Then you must
have been a very little fellow, Eumaios, when you were taken so far
away from your home and parents. Tell me, and tell me true, was the
city in which your father and mother lived sacked and pillaged, or
did some enemies carry you off when you were alone tending sheep or
cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for whatever your master gave
them?"</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="389">
<p><milestone n="389" unit="line"/>"Stranger," replied Eumaios, "as
regards your question: sit still, make yourself comfortable, drink
your wine, and listen to me. The nights are now at their longest;
there is plenty of time both for sleeping and sitting up talking
together; you ought not to go to bed till bed time
[<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>], too much sleep is as bad as too little;
if any one of the others wishes to go to bed let him leave us and do
so; he can then take my master's pigs out when he has done
breakfast in the morning. We two will sit here eating and drinking in
the hut, and telling one another stories about our misfortunes; for
when a man has suffered much, and been buffeted about in the world,
he takes pleasure in recalling the memory of sorrows that have long
gone by. As regards your question, then, my tale is as
follows:</p>

<p><milestone n="403" unit="line"/>"You may have heard of an island
called <placeName key="tgn,7011190">Syra</placeName> that lies over above Ortygia, where the land begins to
turn round and look in another direction. It is not very thickly
peopled, but the soil is good, with much pasture fit for cattle and
sheep, and it abounds with wine and wheat. Dearth never comes there,
nor are the people [<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>] plagued by any
sickness, but when they grow old Apollo comes with Artemis and kills
them with his painless shafts. It contains two communities, and the
whole country is divided between these two. My father Ktesios son of
Ormenus, a man comparable to the gods, reigned over both.</p>

<p><milestone n="415" unit="line"/>"Now to this place there came
some cunning traders from <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName> (for the Phoenicians are great
mariners) in a ship which they had freighted with trinkets of all
kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in my father's
house, very tall and comely, and an excellent servant; these
scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing near their
ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that no woman can resist,
no matter how good she may be by nature. The man who had seduced her
asked her who she was and where she came from, and on this she told
him her father's name. &lsquo;I come from <placeName key="tgn,7002861">Sidon</placeName>,&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;and am daughter to Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as
I was coming into the town from the country some Taphian pirates
seized me and took me here over the sea, where they sold me to the
man who owns this house, and he gave them their price for
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="430" unit="line"/>"The man who had seduced her then
said, &lsquo;Would you like to come along with us to see the house of
your parents and your parents themselves? They are both alive and are
said to be well off.&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="434">
<p><milestone n="434" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;I will do so gladly,&rsquo;
answered she, &lsquo;if you men will first swear me a solemn oath that
you will do me no harm by the way.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="437" unit="line"/>"They all swore as she told them,
and when they had completed their oath the woman said, &lsquo;Hush;
and if any of your men meets me in the street or at the well, do not
let him speak to me, for fear some one should go and tell my master,
in which case he would suspect something. He would put me in prison,
and would have all of you murdered; keep your own counsel therefore;
buy your merchandise as fast as you can, and send me word when you
have done loading. I will bring as much gold as I can lay my hands
on, and there is something else also that I can do towards paying my
fare. I am nurse to the son of the good man of the house, a funny
little fellow just able to run about. I will carry him off in your
ship, and you will get a great deal of wealth for him if you take him
and sell him in foreign parts.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="454" unit="line"/>"On this she went back to the
house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole year till they had loaded their
ship with much precious merchandise, and then, when they had got
freight enough, they sent to tell the woman. Their messenger, a very
cunning fellow, came to my father's house bringing a necklace of
gold with amber beads strung among it; and while my mother and the
servants had it in their hands admiring it and bargaining about it,
he made a sign quietly to the woman and then went back to the ship,
whereon she took me by the hand and led me out of the house. In the
fore part of the house she saw the tables set with the cups of guests
who had been feasting with my father, as being in attendance on him;
these were now all gone to a meeting of the population
[<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>] assembly, so she snatched up three cups
and carried them off in the bosom of her dress, while I followed her,
for I knew no better. The sun was now set, and darkness was over all
the land, so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the
harbor, where the Phoenician ship was lying. When they had got on
board they sailed their ways over the sea, taking us with them, and
Zeus sent then a fair wind; six days did we sail both night and day,
but on the seventh day Artemis struck the woman and she fell heavily
down into the ship's hold as though she were a sea gull
alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the seals and
fishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the winds
and waves took the ship to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, where <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> gave sundry of his
chattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon
this country."</p>

<p><milestone n="485" unit="line"/>Odysseus answered, "Eumaios, I
have heard the story of your misfortunes with the most lively
interest and pity, but Zeus has given you good as well as evil, for
in spite of everything you have a good master, who sees that you
always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead a good life,
whereas I am still going about begging my way from city to
city."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="493">
<p><milestone n="493" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse, and they
had only a very little time left for sleep, for it was soon daybreak.
In the meantime Telemakhos and his crew were nearing land, so they
loosed the sails, took down the mast, and rowed the ship into the
harbor. They cast out their mooring stones and made fast the hawsers;
they then got out upon the sea shore, mixed their wine, and got
dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink
Telemakhos said, "Take the ship on to the town, but leave me here,
for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my farms. In the
evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to the city,
and tomorrow morning in return for your trouble I will give you all a
good dinner with meat and wine."</p>

<p><milestone n="508" unit="line"/>Then Theoklymenos said, &lsquo;And
what, my dear young friend, is to become of me? To whose house, among
all your chief men, am I to repair? Or shall I go straight to your
own house and to your mother?"</p>

<p><milestone n="512" unit="line"/>"At any other time," replied
Telemakhos, "I should have bidden you go to my own house, for you
would find no want of hospitality; at the present moment, however,
you would not be comfortable there, for I shall be away, and my
mother will not see you; she does not often show herself even to the
suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in an upper chamber, out of
their way; but I can tell you a man whose house you can go to - I
mean Eurymakhos the son of Polybos, who is held in the highest
estimation by every one in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. He is much the best man and the
most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying court to my mother
and trying to take Odysseus&rsquo; place. Zeus, however, in heaven
alone knows whether or not they will come to a bad end before the
marriage takes place."</p>

<p><milestone n="525" unit="line"/>As he was speaking a bird flew by
upon his right hand - a hawk, Apollo's messenger. It held a dove
in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore them off, fell to the
ground midway between Telemakhos and the ship. On this Theoklymenos
called him apart and caught him by the hand. "Telemakhos," said he,
"that bird did not fly on your right hand without having been sent
there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew it was an omen; it
means that you will remain powerful and that there will be no house
in the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> more royal than your
own."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="535">
<p><milestone n="535" unit="line"/>"I wish it may prove so,"
answered Telemakhos. "If it does, I will show you so much good will
and give you so many presents that all who meet you will congratulate
you."</p>

<p><milestone n="539" unit="line"/>Then he said to his friend
Peiraios, "Peiraios, son of Klytios, you have throughout shown
yourself the most willing to serve me of all those who have
accompanied me to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>; I wish you would take this stranger to your
own house and entertain him hospitably till I can come for
him."</p>

<p><milestone n="544" unit="line"/>And Peiraios answered,
"Telemakhos, you may stay away as long as you please, but I will look
after him for you, and he shall find no lack of
hospitality."</p>

<p><milestone n="547" unit="line"/>As he spoke he went on board, and
bade the others do so also and loose the hawsers, so they took their
places in the ship. But Telemakhos bound on his sandals, and took a
long and doughty spear with a head of sharpened bronze from the deck
of the ship. Then they loosed the hawsers, thrust the ship off from
land, and made on towards the city as they had been told to do, while
Telemakhos strode on as fast as he could, till he reached the
homestead where his countless herds of swine were feeding, and where
dwelt the excellent swineherd, who was so devoted a servant to his
master. <milestone n="557" unit="line"/></p>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Meanwhile Odysseus and the
swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and were getting breakfast ready
at daybreak for they had sent the men out with the pigs. When
Telemakhos came up, the dogs did not bark, but fawned upon him, so
Odysseus, hearing the sound of feet and noticing that the dogs did
not bark, said to Eumaios:</p>

<p><milestone n="8" unit="line"/>"Eumaios, I hear footsteps; I
suppose one of your men or some one of your acquaintance is coming
here, for the dogs are fawning upon him and not barking."</p>

<p><milestone n="11" unit="line"/>The words were hardly out of his
mouth before his son stood at the door. Eumaios sprang to his feet,
and the bowls in which he was mixing wine fell from his hands, as he
made towards his master. He kissed his head and both his beautiful
eyes, and wept for joy. A father could not be more delighted at the
return of an only son, the child of his old age, after ten
years&rsquo; absence in a foreign country and after having gone
through much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as though
he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly to him
saying:</p>

<p><milestone n="23" unit="line"/>"So you are come, Telemakhos,
light of my eyes that you are. When I heard you had gone to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> I
made sure I was never going to see you any more. Come in, my dear
child, and sit down, that I may have a good look at you now you are
home again; it is not very often you come into the country to see us
herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the town generally. I suppose you
think it better to keep an eye on what the suitors are
doing."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="30">
<p><milestone n="30" unit="line"/>"So be it, old friend," answered
Telemakhos, "but I am come now because I want to see you, and to
learn whether my mother is still at her old home or whether some one
else has married her, so that the bed of Odysseus is without bedding
and covered with cobwebs."</p>

<p><milestone n="36" unit="line"/>"She is still at the house,"
replied Eumaios, "grieving and breaking her heart, and doing nothing
but weep, both night and day continually."</p>

<p><milestone n="40" unit="line"/>As spoke he took Telemakhos&rsquo;
spear, whereon he crossed the stone threshold and came inside.
Odysseus rose from his seat to give him place as he entered, but
Telemakhos checked him; "Sit down, stranger." said he, "I can easily
find another seat, and there is one here who will lay it for
me."</p>

<p><milestone n="46" unit="line"/>Odysseus went back to his own
place, and Eumaios strewed some green brushwood on the floor and
threw a sheepskin on top of it for Telemakhos to sit upon. Then the
swineherd brought them platters of cold meat, the remains from what
they had eaten the day before, and he filled the bread baskets with
bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine also in bowls of ivy-wood,
and took his seat facing Odysseus. Then they laid their hands on the
good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had enough
to eat and drink Telemakhos said to Eumaios, "Old friend, where does
this stranger come from? How did his crew bring him to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and
who were they?-for assuredly he did not come here by
land"&rsquo;</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="60">
<p><milestone n="60" unit="line"/>To this you answered, O swineherd
Eumaios, "My son, I will tell you the real truth
[<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;th&ecirc;s</term>]. He says he is a Cretan, and
that he has been a great traveler. At this moment he is running away
from a Thesprotian ship, and has refuge at my station, so I will put
him into your hands. Do whatever you like with him, only remember
that he is your suppliant."</p>

<p><milestone n="68" unit="line"/>"I am very much distressed," said
Telemakhos, "by what you have just told me. How can I take this
stranger into my house? I am as yet young, and am not strong enough
to hold my own if any man attacks me. My mother cannot make up her
mind whether to stay where she is and look after the house out of
respect for public [<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>] opinion and the
memory of her husband, or whether the time is now come for her to
take the best man of those who are wooing her, and the one who will
make her the most advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come
to your station I will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with
a sword and sandals, and will send him wherever he wants to go. Or if
you like you can keep him here at the station, and I will send him
clothes and food that he may be no burden on you and on your men; but
I will not have him go near the suitors, for they are very insolent
[<term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>], and are sure to ill-treat him in a way that
would greatly grieve [<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>] me; no matter how valiant
a man may be he can do nothing against numbers, for they will be too
strong for him."</p>

<p><milestone n="90" unit="line"/>Then Odysseus said, "Sir, it is
right that I should say something myself. I am much shocked about
what you have said about the insolent way in which the suitors are
behaving in despite of such a man as you are. Tell me, do you submit
to such treatment tamely, or do the people of your
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>, following the voice of some god, hate
[<term lang="xgreek">ekhthros</term>] you? May you not complain of your brothers
- for it is to these that a man may look for support, however great
his quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you are and in my
present mind; if I were son to Odysseus, or, indeed, Odysseus
himself, I would rather some one came and cut my head off, but I
would go to the house and be the bane of every one of these men. If
they were too many for me - I being single-handed - I would rather
die fighting in my own house than see such disgraceful sights day
after day, strangers grossly maltreated, and men dragging the women
servants about the house in an unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly,
and bread wasted all to no purpose for an end that shall never be
accomplished."</p>

<p><milestone n="112" unit="line"/>And Telemakhos answered, "I will
tell you truly everything. There is no enmity between me and my
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>, nor can I complain of brothers, to whom a man may
look for support however great his quarrel may be. Zeus has made us a
race of only sons. <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> was the only son of Arceisius, and
Odysseus only son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>. I am myself the only son of Odysseus
who left me behind him when he went away, so that I have never been
of any use to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the hands of
numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the neighboring
islands, Dulichium, Same, <placeName key="tgn,7011374">Zacynthus</placeName>, as also all the principal men of
<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying
court to my mother, who will neither say point blank that she will
not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, so they are making havoc
of my estate, and before long will do so with myself into the
bargain. The issue, however, rests with heaven. But do you, old
friend Eumaios, go at once and tell Penelope that I am safe and have
returned from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>. Tell it to herself alone, and then come back
here without letting any one else know, for there are many who are
plotting mischief against me."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="135">
<p><milestone n="135" unit="line"/>"I understand and heed you,"
replied Eumaios; "you need instruct me no further, only I am going
that way say whether I had not better let poor <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> know that you
are returned. He used to superintend the work on his farm in spite of
his bitter sorrow about Odysseus, and he would eat and drink at will
along with his servants; but they tell me that from the day on which
you set out for <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> he has neither eaten nor drunk as he ought to
do, nor does he look after his farm, but sits weeping and wasting the
flesh from off his bones."</p>

<p><milestone n="146" unit="line"/>"More's the pity," answered
Telemakhos, "I am sorry for him, but we must leave him to himself
just now. If people could have everything their own way, the first
thing I should choose would be the return of my father; but go, and
give your message; then make haste back again, and do not turn out of
your way to tell <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>. Tell my mother to send one of her women
secretly with the news at once, and let him hear it from
her."</p>

<p><milestone n="154" unit="line"/>Thus did he urge the swineherd;
Eumaios, therefore, took his sandals, bound them to his feet, and
started for the town. Athena watched him well off the station, and
then came up to it in the form of a woman - fair, stately, and wise.
She stood against the side of the entry, and revealed herself to
Odysseus, but Telemakhos could not see her, and knew not that she was
there, for the gods do not let themselves be seen by everybody.
Odysseus saw her, and so did the dogs, for they did not bark, but
went scared and whining off to the other side of the yards. She
nodded her head and motioned to Odysseus with her eyebrows; whereon
he left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall of the
yards. Then she said to him:</p>

<p><milestone n="167" unit="line"/>"Odysseus, noble son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>,
it is now time for you to tell your son: do not keep him in the dark
any longer, but lay your plans for the destruction of the suitors,
and then make for the town. I will not be long in joining you, for I
too am eager for the fray."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="172">
<p><milestone n="172" unit="line"/>As she spoke she touched him with
her golden wand. First she threw a fair clean shirt and cloak about
his shoulders; then she made him younger and of more imposing
presence; she gave him back his color, filled out his cheeks, and let
his beard become dark again. Then she went away and Odysseus came
back inside the hut. His son was astounded when he saw him, and
turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking upon a
god.</p>

<p><milestone n="181" unit="line"/>"Stranger," said he, "how
suddenly you have changed from what you were a moment or two ago. You
are dressed differently and your color is not the same. Are you some
one or other of the gods that live in heaven? If so, be propitious to
me till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings of wrought gold.
Have mercy upon me."</p>

<p><milestone n="186" unit="line"/>And Odysseus said, "I am no god,
why should you take me for one? I am your father, on whose account
you grieve and suffer so much at the hands of violent
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] men."</p>

<p><milestone n="190" unit="line"/>As he spoke he kissed his son,
and a tear fell from his cheek on to the ground, for he had
restrained all tears till now. but Telemakhos could not yet believe
that it was his father, and said:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="194">
<p><milestone n="194" unit="line"/>"You are not my father, but some
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> is flattering me with vain hopes that I may
grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself contrive
with his <term lang="xgreek">noos</term> to do as you have been doing, and make yourself
old and young at a moment's notice, unless a god were with him.
A second ago you were old and all in rags, and now you are like some
god come down from heaven."</p>

<p><milestone n="201" unit="line"/>Odysseus answered, "Telemakhos,
you ought not to be so immeasurably astonished at my being really
here. There is no other Odysseus who will come hereafter. Such as I
am, it is I, who after long wandering and much hardship have got home
in the twentieth year to my own country. What you wonder at is the
work of the redoubtable goddess Athena, who does with me whatever she
will, for she can do what she pleases. At one moment she makes me
like a beggar, and the next I am a young man with good clothes on my
back; it is an easy matter for the gods who live in heaven to make
any man look either rich or poor."</p>

<p><milestone n="213" unit="line"/>As he spoke he sat down, and
Telemakhos threw his arms about his father and wept. They were both
so much moved that they cried aloud like eagles or vultures with
crooked talons that have been robbed of their half fledged young by
peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and the sun would have gone
down upon their mourning if Telemakhos had not suddenly said, "In
what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>? Of what
nation did they declare themselves to be - for you cannot have come
by land?"</p>

<p><milestone n="226" unit="line"/>"I will tell you the truth
[<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;theia</term>], my son," replied Odysseus. "It was
the Phaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are
in the habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts.
They took me over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in
<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, after giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment.
These things by heaven's mercy are lying concealed in a cave,
and I am now come here on the suggestion of Athena that we may
consult about killing our enemies. First, therefore, give me a list
of the suitors, with their number, that I may learn who, and how
many, they are. I can then turn the matter over in my mind, and see
whether we two can fight the whole body of them ourselves, or whether
we must find others to help us."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="240">
<p><milestone n="240" unit="line"/>To this Telemakhos answered,
"Father, I have always heard of your renown [<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>]
both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a very
great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot stand
against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor
twice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at
once. There are fifty-two chosen [<term lang="xgreek">kr&icirc;n&ocirc;</term>]
youths from Dulichium, and they have six servants; from Same there
are twenty-four; twenty young Achaeans from <placeName key="tgn,7011374">Zacynthus</placeName>, and twelve
from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself, all of them well born. They have with them a
servant Medon, a bard, and two men who can carve at table. If we face
such numbers as this, you may have bitter cause to rue your coming,
and your violent revenge [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>]. See whether you
cannot think of some one who would be willing to come and help
us."</p>

<p><milestone n="257" unit="line"/>"Listen to me," replied Odysseus,
"and think whether Athena and her father Zeus may seem sufficient, or
whether I am to try and find some one else as well."</p>

<p><milestone n="262" unit="line"/>"Those whom you have named,"
answered Telemakhos, "are a couple of good allies, for though they
dwell high up among the clouds they have power over both gods and
men."</p>

<p><milestone n="266" unit="line"/>"These two," continued Odysseus,
"will not keep long out of the fray, when the suitors and we join
fight in my house. Now, therefore, return home early tomorrow
morning, and go about among the suitors as before. Later on the
swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a miserable old
beggar. If you see them ill-treating me, steel your heart against my
sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of the house,
or throw things at me, look on and do nothing beyond gently trying to
make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to you,
for the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and lay
my saying to your heart, when Athena shall put it in my mind, I will
nod my head to you, and on seeing me do this you must collect all the
armor that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room. Make
some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say
that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as
it is no longer what it was when Odysseus went away, but has become
soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you
are afraid Zeus may set them on to quarrel over their wine, and that
they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and
wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use them.
But leave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me, and a
couple oxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any moment;
Zeus and Athena will then soon quiet these people. There is also
another matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs in your
veins, let no one know that Odysseus is within the house - neither
<placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, nor yet the swineherd, nor any of the servants, nor even
Penelope herself. Let you and me make trial the women alone, and let
us also make trial of some other of the men servants, to see who is
on our side and whose hand is against us."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="308">
<p><milestone n="308" unit="line"/>"Father," replied Telemakhos,
"you will come to know me by and by, and when you do you will find
that I can keep your counsel. I do not think, however, the plan you
propose will be a gain [<term lang="xgreek">kerdos</term>] for either of us.
Think it over. It will take us a long time to go the round of the
farms and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will be
wasting your estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the
women by all means, to see who are disloyal and who guiltless, but I
am not in favor of going round and trying the men. We can attend to
that later on, if you really have some sign from Zeus that he will
support you."</p>

<p><milestone n="321" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse, and
meanwhile the ship which had brought Telemakhos and his crew from
<placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> had reached the town of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. When they had come inside the
harbor they drew the ship on to the land; their servants came and
took their armor from them, and they left all the presents at the
house of Klytios. Then they sent a servant to tell Penelope that
Telemakhos had gone into the country, but had sent the ship to the
town to prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy. This servant
and Eumaios happened to meet when they were both on the same errand
of going to tell Penelope. When they reached the House, the servant
stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the waiting women,
"Your son, my lady, is now returned from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>"; but Eumaios went
close up to Penelope, and said privately that her son had given
bidden him tell her. When he had given his message he left the house
with its outbuildings and went back to his pigs again.</p>

<p><milestone n="342" unit="line"/>The suitors were surprised and
angry at what had happened, so they went outside the great wall that
ran round the outer court, and held a council near the main entrance.
Eurymakhos, son of Polybos, was the first to speak.</p>

<p><milestone n="346" unit="line"/>"My friends," said he, "this
voyage of Telemakhos&rsquo; is a very serious matter; we had made sure
that it would come to nothing. Now, however, let us draw a ship into
the water, and get a crew together to send after the others and tell
them to come back as fast as they can."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="351">
<p><milestone n="351" unit="line"/>He had hardly done speaking when
Amphinomos turned in his place and saw the ship inside the harbor,
with the crew lowering her sails, and putting by their oars; so he
laughed, and said to the others, "We need not send them any message,
for they are here. Some god must have told them, or else they saw the
ship go by, and could not overtake her.</p>

<p><milestone n="358" unit="line"/>On this they rose and went to the
water side. The crew then drew the ship on shore; their servants took
their armor from them, and they went up in a body to the place of
assembly, but they would not let any one old or young sit along with
them, and Antinoos, son of Eupeithes, spoke first.</p>

<p><milestone n="364" unit="line"/>"Good heavens," said he, "see how
the gods have saved this man from destruction. We kept a succession
of scouts upon the headlands all day long, and when the sun was down
we never went on shore to sleep, but waited in the ship all night
till morning in the hope of capturing and killing him; but some
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> has conveyed him home in spite of us. Let us
consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape us; our
affair is never likely to come off while is alive, for he is very
shrewd in <term lang="xgreek">noos</term>, and public feeling is by no means all on our
side. We must make haste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly;
he will lose no time in doing so, for he will be furious with us, and
will tell all the world how we plotted to kill him, but failed to
take him. The people will not like this when they come to know of it;
we must see that they do us no hurt, nor drive us from our own
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> into exile. Let us try and lay hold of him either
on his farm away from the town, or on the road hither. Then we can
divide up his property amongst us, and let his mother and the man who
marries her have the house. If this does not please you, and you wish
Telemakhos to live on and hold his father's property, then we
must not gather here and eat up his goods in this way, but must make
our offers to Penelope each from his own house, and she can marry the
man who will give the most for her, and whose lot it is to win
her."</p>

<p><milestone n="393" unit="line"/>They all held their peace until
Amphinomos rose to speak. He was the son of Nisus, who was son to
king Aretias, and he was foremost among all the suitors from the
wheat-growing and well grassed island of Dulichium; his conversation,
moreover, was more agreeable to Penelope than that of any of the
other for he was a man of good natural disposition. "My friends,"
said he, speaking to them plainly and in all honestly, "I am not in
favor of killing Telemakhos. It is a heinous thing to kill one who is
of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of the gods, and if the
oracles of Zeus advise it, I will both help to kill him myself, and
will urge everyone else to do so; but if they dissuade us, I would
have you hold your hands."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="406">
<p><milestone n="406" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak, and his words
pleased them well, so they rose forthwith and went to the house of
Odysseus where they took their accustomed seats.</p>

<p><milestone n="409" unit="line"/>Then Penelope resolved that she
would show herself to the outrageous [<term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>] suitors.
She knew of the plot against Telemakhos, for the servant Medon had
overheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore to
the court attended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors
she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the room
holding a veil before her face, and rebuked Antinoos
saying:</p>

<p><milestone n="417" unit="line"/>"Antinoos, insolent
[<term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>] and wicked schemer, they say you are the best
speaker and counselor of any man your own age in the
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, but you are nothing of the kind.
Madman, why should you try to compass the death of Telemakhos, and
take no heed of suppliants, whose witness is Zeus himself? It is not
right for you to plot thus against one another. Do you not remember
how your father fled to this house in fear of the people
[<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>], who were enraged against him for having
gone with some Taphian pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who
were at peace with us? They wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up
everything he had, but Odysseus stayed their hands although they were
infuriated, and now you devour his property without paying for it,
and break my heart by wooing his wife and trying to kill his son.
Leave off doing so, and stop the others also."</p>

<p><milestone n="434" unit="line"/>To this Eurymakhos son of Polybos
answered, "Take heart, Queen Penelope daughter of Ikarios, and do not
trouble yourself about these matters. The man is not yet born, nor
never will be, who shall lay hands upon your son Telemakhos, while I
yet live to look upon the face of the earth. I say - and it shall
surely be - that my spear shall be reddened with his blood; for many
a time has Odysseus taken me on his knees, held wine up to my lips to
drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands. Therefore Telemakhos is
much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing to fear from the
hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes to him from the gods,
he cannot escape it." He said this to quiet her, but in reality he
was plotting against Telemakhos.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="449">
<p><milestone n="449" unit="line"/>Then Penelope went upstairs again
and mourned her husband till Athena shed sleep over her eyes. In the
evening Eumaios got back to Odysseus and his son, who had just
sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were ready; helping one
another to get supper ready; Athena therefore came up to Odysseus,
turned him into an old man with a stroke of her wand, and clad him in
his old clothes again, for fear that the swineherd might recognize
him and not keep the secret, but go and tell Penelope.</p>

<p><milestone n="460" unit="line"/>Telemakhos was the first to
speak. "So you have got back, Eumaios," said he. "What is the news
[<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] of the town? Have the suitors returned, or are
they still waiting over yonder, to take me on my way
home?"</p>

<p><milestone n="464" unit="line"/>"I did not think of asking about
that," replied Eumaios, "when I was in the town. I thought I would
give my message and come back as soon as I could. I met a man sent by
those who had gone with you to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, and he was the first to tell
the new your mother, but I can say what I saw with my own eyes; I had
just got on to the crest of the hill of Hermes above the town when I
saw a ship coming into harbor with a number of men in her. They had
many shields and spears, and I thought it was the suitors, but I
cannot be sure."</p>

<p><milestone n="476" unit="line"/>On hearing this Telemakhos smiled
to his father, but so that Eumaios could not see him.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="478">
<p><milestone n="478" unit="line"/>Then, when they had finished
their labor [<term lang="xgreek">ponos</term>] and the meal was ready, they ate
it, and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. As
soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, they laid down to rest
and enjoyed the boon of sleep. <milestone n="481" unit="line"/></p>

<head>Scroll 17</head>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>When the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemakhos bound on his sandals and
took a strong spear that suited his hands, for he wanted to go into
the city. "Old friend," said he to the swineherd, "I will now go to
the town and show myself to my mother, for she will never leave off
grieving till she has seen me. As for this unfortunate stranger, take
him to the town and let him beg there of any one who will give him a
drink and a piece of bread. I have trouble enough of my own, and
cannot be burdened with other people. If this makes him angry so much
the worse for him, but I like to tell the truth
[<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;th&ecirc;s</term>]."</p>

<p><milestone n="16" unit="line"/>Then Odysseus said, "Sir, I do not
want to stay here; a beggar can always do better in town than
country, for any one who likes can give him something. I am too old
to care about remaining here at the beck and call of a master.
Therefore let this man do as you have just told him, and take me to
the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire, and the day has
got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly thin, and this
frosty morning I shall be perished with cold, for you say the city is
some way off."</p>

<p><milestone n="26" unit="line"/>On this Telemakhos strode off
through the yards, brooding his revenge upon the When he reached home
he stood his spear against a bearing-post of the room, crossed the
stone floor of the room itself, and went inside.</p>

<p><milestone n="31" unit="line"/>Nurse Eurykleia saw him long
before any one else did. She was putting the fleeces on to the seats,
and she burst out crying as she ran up to him; all the other maids
came up too, and covered his head and shoulders with their kisses.
Penelope came out of her room looking like Artemis or Aphrodite, and
wept as she flung her arms about her son. She kissed his forehead and
both his beautiful eyes, "Light of my eyes," she cried as she spoke
fondly to him, "so you are come home again; I made sure I was never
going to see you any more. To think of your having gone off to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>
without saying anything about it or obtaining my consent. But come,
tell me what you saw."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="45">
<p><milestone n="45" unit="line"/>"Do not scold me, mother,&rsquo;
answered Telemakhos, "nor vex me, seeing what a narrow escape I have
had, but wash your face, change your dress, go upstairs with your
maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if
Zeus will only grant us our revenge upon the suitors. I must now go
to the place of assembly to invite a stranger who has come back with
me from <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>. I sent him on with my crew, and told Peiraios to take
him home and look after him till I could come for him
myself."</p>

<p><milestone n="57" unit="line"/>She heeded her son's words,
washed her face, changed her dress, and vowed full and sufficient
hecatombs to all the gods if they would only grant her revenge upon
the suitors.</p>

<p><milestone n="61" unit="line"/>Telemakhos went through, and out
of, the cloisters spear in hand - not alone, for his two fleet dogs
went with him. Athena endowed him with a presence of such divine
comeliness [<term lang="xgreek">kharis</term>] that all marveled at him as he
went by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in their
mouths and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and went to
sit with Mentor, Antiphos, and Halitherses, old friends of his
father's house, and they made him tell them all that had
happened to him. Then Peiraios came up with Theoklymenos, whom he had
escorted through the town to the place of assembly, whereon
Telemakhos at once joined them. Peiraios was first to speak:
"Telemakhos," said he, "I wish you would send some of your women to
my house to take away the presents Menelaos gave you."</p>

<p><milestone n="77" unit="line"/>"We do not know, Peiraios,"
answered Telemakhos, "what may happen. If the suitors kill me in my
own house and divide my property among them, I would rather you had
the presents than that any of those people should get hold of them.
If on the other hand I manage to kill them, I shall be much obliged
if you will kindly bring me my presents."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="84">
<p><milestone n="84" unit="line"/>With these words he took
Theoklymenos to his own house. When they got there they laid their
cloaks on the benches and seats, went into the baths, and washed
themselves. When the maids had washed and anointed them, and had
given them cloaks and shirts, they took their seats at table. A maid
servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and
poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands; and she
drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread
and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.
Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the
bearing-posts of the room, and spinning. Then they laid their hands
on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had
enough to eat and drink Penelope said:</p>

<p><milestone n="101" unit="line"/>"Telemakhos, I shall go upstairs
and lie down on that sad couch, which I have not ceased to water with
my tears, from the day Odysseus set out for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> with the sons of
Atreus. You failed, however, to make it clear to me before the
suitors came back to the house, whether or not you had been able to
hear anything about the return [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] of your
father."</p>

<p><milestone n="106" unit="line"/>"I will tell you then truth
[<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;theia</term>]," replied her son. "We went to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>
and saw Nestor, who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably
as though I were a son of his own who had just returned after a long
absence; so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word
from any human being about Odysseus, whether he was alive or dead. He
sent me, therefore, with a chariot and horses to Menelaos. There I
saw Helen, for whose sake so many, both Argives and Trojans, were in
heaven's wisdom doomed to suffer. Menelaos asked me what it was
that had brought me to <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName>, and I told him the whole truth
[<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;theia</term>], whereon he said, &lsquo;So, then,
these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? A hind might as
well lay her new-born young in the lair of a lion, and then go off to
feed in the forest or in some grassy dell. The lion, when he comes
back to his lair, will make short work with the pair of them, and so
will Odysseus with these suitors. By father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo,
if Odysseus is still the man that he was when he wrestled with
Philomeleides in <placeName key="tgn,7002672">Lesbos</placeName>, and threw him so heavily that all the Greeks
cheered him - if he is still such, and were to come near these
suitors, they would have a swift doom and a sorry wedding. As regards
your question, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but
what the old man of the sea told me, so much will I tell you in full.
He said he could see Odysseus on an island sorrowing bitterly in the
house of the nymph Calypso, who was keeping him prisoner, and he
could not reach his home, for he had no ships nor sailors to take him
over the sea.&rsquo; This was what Menelaos told me, and when I had
heard his story I came away; the gods then gave me a fair wind and
soon brought me safe home again."</p>

<p><milestone n="150" unit="line"/>With these words he moved the
heart of Penelope. Then Theoklymenos said to her:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="152">
<p><milestone n="152" unit="line"/>"My lady, wife of Odysseus,
Telemakhos does not understand these things; listen therefore to me,
for I can divine them surely, and will hide nothing from you. May
Zeus the king of heaven be my witness, and the rites of hospitality,
with that hearth of Odysseus to which I now come, that Odysseus
himself is even now in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and, either going about the country or
staying in one place, is inquiring into all these evil deeds and
preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I saw an omen when I
was on the ship which meant this, and I told Telemakhos about
it."</p>

<p><milestone n="162" unit="line"/>"May it be even so," answered
Penelope; "if your words come true, you shall have such gifts and
such good will from me that all who see you shall congratulate
you."</p>

<p><milestone n="166" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile
the suitors were throwing discs, or aiming with spears at a mark on
the leveled ground in front of the house, and behaving with all their
old insolence [<term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>]. But when it was now time for
dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come into the town from
all the country round, with their shepherds as usual, then Medon, who
was their favorite servant, and who waited upon them at table, said,
"Now then, my young masters, you have had enough sport
[<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>], so come inside that we may get dinner ready.
Dinner is not a bad thing, at dinner time
[<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>]."</p>

<p><milestone n="177" unit="line"/>They left their sports as he told
them, and when they were within the house, they laid their cloaks on
the benches and seats inside, and then sacrificed some sheep, goats,
pigs, and a heifer, all of them fat and well grown. Thus they made
ready for their meal. In the meantime Odysseus and the swineherd were
about starting for the town, and the swineherd said, "Stranger, I
suppose you still want to go to town to-day, as my master said you
were to do; for my own part I should have liked you to stay here as a
station hand, but I must do as my master tells me, or he will scold
me later on, and a scolding from one's master is a very serious
thing. Let us then be off, for it is now broad day; it will be night
again directly and then you will find it colder."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="192">
<p><milestone n="192" unit="line"/>"I know, and understand you,"
replied Odysseus; "you need say no more. Let us be going, but if you
have a stick ready cut, let me have it to walk with, for you say the
road is a very rough one."</p>

<p><milestone n="197" unit="line"/>As he spoke he threw his shabby
old tattered wallet over his shoulders, by the cord from which it
hung, and Eumaios gave him a stick to his liking. The two then
started, leaving the station in charge of the dogs and herdsmen who
remained behind; the swineherd led the way and his master followed
after, looking like some broken-down old tramp as he leaned upon his
staff, and his clothes were all in rags. When they had got over the
rough steep ground and were nearing the city, they reached the
fountain from which the citizens drew their water. This had been made
by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyktor. There was a grove of water-loving
poplars planted in a circle all round it, and the clear cold water
came down to it from a rock high up, while above the fountain there
was an altar to the nymphs, at which all wayfarers used to sacrifice.
Here Melanthios son of Dolios overtook them as he was driving down
some goats, the best in his flock, for the suitors&rsquo; dinner, and
there were two shepherds with him. When he saw Eumaios and Odysseus
he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language, which made
Odysseus very angry.</p>

<p><milestone n="217" unit="line"/>"There you go," cried he, "and a
precious pair you are. See how heaven brings birds of the same
feather to one another. Where, pray, master swineherd, are you taking
this poor miserable object? It would make any one sick to see such a
creature at table. A fellow like this never won a prize for anything
in his life, but will go about rubbing his shoulders against every
man's door post, and begging, not for swords and cauldrons like
a man, but only for a few scraps not worth begging for. If you would
give him to me for a hand on my station, he might do to clean out the
folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed to the kids, and he could fatten
his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but he has taken to bad
ways and will not go about any kind of work; he will do nothing but
beg victuals all the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> over, to feed his insatiable
belly. I say, therefore and it shall surely be - if he goes near
Odysseus&rsquo; house he will get his head broken by the stools they
will fling at him, till they turn him out."</p>

<p><milestone n="233" unit="line"/>On this, as he passed, he gave
Odysseus a kick on the hip out of pure wantonness, but Odysseus stood
firm, and did not budge from the path. For a moment he doubted
whether or not to fly at Melanthios and kill him with his staff, or
fling him to the ground and beat his brains out; he resolved,
however, to endure it and keep himself in check, but the swineherd
looked straight at Melanthios and rebuked him, lifting up his hands
and praying to heaven as he did so.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="240">
<p><milestone n="240" unit="line"/>"Fountain nymphs," he cried,
"children of Zeus, if ever Odysseus burned you thigh bones covered
with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant my prayer that a
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> may send him home. He would soon put an end to
the swaggering threats with which such men as you go about insulting
people- gadding all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin
through bad shepherding."</p>

<p><milestone n="247" unit="line"/>Then Melanthios the goatherd
answered, "You ill-conditioned cur, what are you talking about? Some
day or other I will put you on board ship and take you to a foreign
country, where I can sell you and keep the wealth you will fetch. I
wish I were as sure that Apollo would strike Telemakhos dead this
very day, or that the suitors would kill him, as I am that Odysseus
will never come home again."</p>

<p><milestone n="254" unit="line"/>With this he left them to come on
at their leisure, while he went quickly forward and soon reached the
house of his master. When he got there he went in and took his seat
among the suitors opposite Eurymakhos, who liked him better than any
of the others. The servants brought him a portion of meat, and an
upper woman servant set bread before him that he might eat. Presently
Odysseus and the swineherd came up to the house and stood by it, amid
a sound of music, for Phemios was just beginning to sing to the
suitors. Then Odysseus took hold of the swineherd's hand, and
said:</p>

<p><milestone n="264" unit="line"/>"Eumaios, this house of Odysseus
is a very fine place. No matter how far you go you will find few like
it. One building keeps following on after another. The outer court
has a wall with battlements all round it; the doors are double
folding, and of good workmanship; it would be a hard matter to take
it by force of arms. I perceive, too, that there are many people
banqueting within it, for there is a smell of roast meat, and I hear
a sound of music, which the gods have made to go along with
feasting."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="272">
<p><milestone n="272" unit="line"/>Then Eumaios said, "You have
perceived aright, as indeed you generally do; but let us think what
will be our best course. Will you go inside first and join the
suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you wait here and let me
go in first? But do not wait long, or some one may you loitering
about outside, and throw something at you. Consider this matter I
pray you."</p>

<p><milestone n="280" unit="line"/>And Odysseus answered, "I
understand and heed. Go in first and leave me here where I am. I am
quite used to being beaten and having things thrown at me. I have
been so much buffeted about in war and by sea that I am
case-hardened, and this too may go with the rest. But a man cannot
hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy which
gives much trouble to all men; it is because of this that ships are
fitted out to sail the seas, and to make war upon other
people."</p>

<p><milestone n="290" unit="line"/>As they were thus talking, a dog
that had been lying asleep raised his head and pricked up his ears.
This was Argos, whom Odysseus had bred before setting out for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,
but he had never had any work out of him. In the old days he used to
be taken out by the young men when they went hunting wild goats, or
deer, or hares, but now that his master was gone he was lying
neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in front of the
stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to manure the
great field; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw Odysseus
standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he could
not get close up to his master. When Odysseus saw the dog on the
other side of the yard, dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaios
seeing it, and said:</p>

<p><milestone n="306" unit="line"/>"Eumaios, what a noble hound that
is over yonder on the manure heap: his build is splendid; is he as
fine a fellow as he looks, or is he only one of those dogs that come
begging about a table, and are kept merely for show?"</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="311">
<p><milestone n="311" unit="line"/>"This hound," answered Eumaios,
"belonged to him who has died in a far country. If he were what he
was when Odysseus left for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, he would soon show you what he could
do. There was not a wild beast in the forest that could get away from
him when he was once on its tracks. But now he has fallen on evil
times, for his master is dead and gone, and the women take no care of
him. Servants never do their work when their master's hand is no
longer over them, for Zeus takes half the goodness
[<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>] out of a man when he makes a slave of
him."</p>

<p><milestone n="324" unit="line"/>As he spoke he went inside the
buildings to the room where the suitors were, but <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> died as soon
as he had recognized his master.</p>

<p><milestone n="328" unit="line"/>Telemakhos saw Eumaios long
before any one else did, and beckoned him to come and sit beside him;
so he looked about and saw a seat lying near where the carver sat
serving out their portions to the suitors; he picked it up, brought
it to Telemakhos&rsquo; table, and sat down opposite him. Then the
servant brought him his portion, and gave him bread from the
bread-basket.</p>

<p><milestone n="336" unit="line"/>Immediately afterwards Odysseus
came inside, looking like a poor miserable old beggar, leaning on his
staff and with his clothes all in rags. He sat down upon the
threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors leading from the outer to
the inner court, and against a bearing-post of cypress-wood which the
carpenter had skillfully planed, and had made to join truly with rule
and line. Telemakhos took a whole loaf from the bread-basket, with as
much meat as he could hold in his two hands, and said to Eumaios,
"Take this to the stranger, and tell him to go the round of the
suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be shamefaced
[<term lang="xgreek">aid&ocirc;s</term>]."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="348">
<p><milestone n="348" unit="line"/>So Eumaios went up to him and
said, "Stranger, Telemakhos sends you this, and says you are to go
the round of the suitors begging, for beggars must not be shamefaced
[<term lang="xgreek">aid&ocirc;s</term>]."</p>

<p><milestone n="353" unit="line"/>Odysseus answered, "May lord Zeus
grant all happiness [<term lang="xgreek">olbos</term>] to Telemakhos, and fulfill
the desire of his heart."</p>

<p><milestone n="356" unit="line"/>Then with both hands he took what
Telemakhos had sent him, and laid it on the dirty old wallet at his
feet. He went on eating it while the bard was singing, and had just
finished his dinner as he left off. The suitors applauded the bard,
whereon Athena went up to Odysseus and prompted him to beg pieces of
bread from each one of the suitors, that he might see what kind of
people they were, and tell the good from the bad; but come what might
she was not going to save a single one of them. Odysseus, therefore,
went on his round, going from left to right, and stretched out his
hands to beg as though he were a real beggar. Some of them pitied
him, and were curious about him, asking one another who he was and
where he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthios said, "Suitors of
my noble mistress, I can tell you something about him, for I have
seen him before. The swineherd brought him here, but I know nothing
about the man himself, nor where he comes from."</p>

<p><milestone n="374" unit="line"/>On this Antinoos began to abuse
the swineherd. "You precious idiot," he cried, "what have you brought
this man to town for? Have we not tramps and beggars enough already
to pester us as we sit at meat? Do you think it a small thing that
such people gather here to waste your master's property and must
you needs bring this man as well?"</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="380">
<p><milestone n="380" unit="line"/>And Eumaios answered, "Antinoos,
your birth is good but your words evil. It was no doing of mine that
he came here. Who is likely to invite a stranger from a foreign
country, unless it be one of those who can do public service as a
seer [<term lang="xgreek">mantis</term>], a healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a
bard who can delight us with his singing. Such men are welcome all
the world over, but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only
worry him. You are always harder on Odysseus&rsquo; servants than any
of the other suitors are, and above all on me, but I do not care so
long as Telemakhos and Penelope are alive and here."</p>

<p><milestone n="392" unit="line"/>But Telemakhos said, "Hush, do
not answer him; Antinoos has the bitterest tongue of all the suitors,
and he makes the others worse."</p>

<p><milestone n="396" unit="line"/>Then turning to Antinoos he said,
"Antinoos, you take as much care of my interests as though I were
your son. Why should you want to see this stranger turned out of the
house? Heaven forbid; take something and give it him yourself; I do
not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind my mother, nor any of
the other servants in the house; but I know you will not do what I
say, for you are more fond of eating things yourself than of giving
them to other people."</p>

<p><milestone n="405" unit="line"/>"What do you mean, Telemakhos,"
replied Antinoos, "by this swaggering talk? If all the suitors were
to give him as much as I will, he would not come here again for
another three months."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="409">
<p><milestone n="409" unit="line"/>As he spoke he drew the stool on
which he rested his dainty feet from under the table, and made as
though he would throw it at Odysseus, but the other suitors all gave
him something, and filled his wallet with bread and meat; he was
about, therefore, to go back to the threshold and eat what the
suitors had given him, but he first went up to Antinoos and
said:</p>

<p><milestone n="415" unit="line"/>"Sir, give me something; you are
not, surely, the poorest man here; you seem to be a chief, foremost
among them all; therefore you should be the better giver, and I will
tell far and wide of your bounty. I too was a rich
[<term lang="xgreek">olbios</term>] man once, and had a fine house of my own; in
those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he
might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all
the other things which people have who live well and are accounted
wealthy, but it pleased Zeus to take all away from me. He sent me
with a band of roving robbers to <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>; it was a long voyage and I
was undone by it. I stationed my ships in the river Aigyptos, and
bade my men stay by them and keep guard over them, while I sent out
scouts to reconnoiter from every point of vantage.</p>

<p><milestone n="431" unit="line"/>"But the men insolently disobeyed
[<term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>] my orders, took to their own devices, and
ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their
wives and children captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city,
and when they heard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till
the plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam
of armor. Then Zeus spread panic among my men, and they would no
longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The
Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive to do forced
labor for them; as for myself, they gave me to a friend who met them,
to take to <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>, Dmetor by name, son of Iasos, who was a great man
in <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName>. Thence I am come hither in a state of great
misery."</p>

<p><milestone n="445" unit="line"/>Then Antinoos said, "What
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> can have sent such a pestilence to plague us
during our dinner? Get out, into the open part of the court, or I
will give you <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000112">Cyprus</placeName> over again for your insolence and
importunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have given
you lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy to
be free with other people's property when there is plenty of
it."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="453">
<p><milestone n="453" unit="line"/>On this Odysseus began to move
off, and said, "Your looks, my fine sir, are better than your
breeding; if you were in your own house you would not spare a poor
man so much as a pinch of salt, for though you are in another
man's, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot find it in you
to give him even a piece of bread."</p>

<p><milestone n="458" unit="line"/>This made Antinoos very angry,
and he scowled at him saying, "You shall pay for this before you get
clear of the court." With these words he threw a footstool at him,
and hit him on the right shoulder-blade near the top of his back.
Odysseus stood firm as a rock and the blow did not even stagger him,
but he shook his head in silence as he brooded on his revenge. Then
he went back to the threshold and sat down there, laying his
well-filled wallet at his feet.</p>

<p><milestone n="468" unit="line"/>"Listen to me," he cried, "you
suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. A
man knows neither ache [<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>] nor pain
[<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>] if he gets hit while fighting for his
wealth, or for his sheep or his cattle; and even so Antinoos has hit
me while in the service of my miserable belly, which is always
getting people into trouble. Still, if the poor have gods and
avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinoos may come to a bad
end before his marriage."</p>

<p><milestone n="477" unit="line"/>"Sit where you are, and eat your
victuals in silence, or be off elsewhere," shouted Antinoos. "If you
say more I will have you dragged hand and foot through the courts,
and the servants shall flay you alive."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="481">
<p><milestone n="481" unit="line"/>The other suitors were much
displeased at this, and one of the young men said, "Antinoos, you did
ill in striking that poor wretch of a tramp: it will be worse for you
if he should turn out to be some god - and we know the gods go about
disguised in all sorts of ways as people from foreign countries, and
travel about the world to see who do amiss [<term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>]
and who righteously."</p>

<p><milestone n="488" unit="line"/>Thus said the suitors, but
Antinoos paid them no heed. Meanwhile Telemakhos was greatly
distressed [<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>] about the blow that had been
given to his father, and though no tear fell from him, he shook his
head in silence and brooded on his revenge.</p>

<p><milestone n="492" unit="line"/>Now when Penelope heard that the
beggar had been struck in the banqueting-room, she said before her
maids, "Would that Apollo would so strike you, Antinoos," and her
waiting woman Eurynome answered, "If our prayers were answered not
one of the suitors would ever again see the sun rise." Then Penelope
said, "Nurse, every single one of them is hateful
[<term lang="xgreek">ekhthroi</term>] to me, for they mean nothing but mischief,
but I hate Antinoos like the darkness of death itself. A poor
unfortunate tramp has come begging about the house for sheer want.
Every one else has given him something to put in his wallet, but
Antinoos has hit him on the right shoulder-blade with a
footstool."</p>

<p><milestone n="505" unit="line"/>Thus did she talk with her maids
as she sat in her own room, and in the meantime Odysseus was getting
his dinner. Then she called for the swineherd and said, "Eumaios, go
and tell the stranger to come here, I want to see him and ask him
some questions. He seems to have traveled much, and he may have seen
or heard something of my unhappy husband."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="512">
<p><milestone n="512" unit="line"/>To this you answered, O swineherd
Eumaios, "If these Achaeans, my lady, would only keep quiet, you
would be charmed with the history of his adventures. I had him three
days and three nights with me in my hut, which was the first place he
reached after running away from his ship, and he has not yet
completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had been the most
heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose lips all hearers
hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed as I sat in my hut
and listened to him. He says there is an old friendship between his
house and that of Odysseus, and that he comes from <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> where the
descendants of Minos live, after having been driven here and there by
every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he has heard of
Odysseus as being alive and near at hand among the Thesprotians
[<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>], and that he is bringing great wealth
home with him."</p>

<p><milestone n="528" unit="line"/>"Call him here, then," said
Penelope, "that I too may hear his story. As for the suitors, let
them take their pleasure indoors or out as they will, for they have
nothing to fret about. Their grain and wine remain unwasted in their
houses with none but servants to consume them, while they keep
hanging about our house day after day sacrificing our oxen, sheep,
and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving so much as a
thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand such
recklessness, for we have now no Odysseus to protect us. If he were
to come again, he and his son would soon have their violent revenge
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>]."</p>

<p><milestone n="541" unit="line"/>As she spoke Telemakhos sneezed
so loudly that the whole house resounded with it. Penelope laughed
when she heard this, and said to Eumaios, "Go and call the stranger;
did you not hear how my son sneezed just as I was speaking? This can
only mean that all the suitors are going to be killed, and that not
one of them shall escape. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to
your heart: if I am satisfied that the stranger is speaking the truth
I shall give him a shirt and cloak of good wear."</p>

<p><milestone n="551" unit="line"/>When Eumaios heard this he went
straight to Odysseus and said, "Father stranger, my mistress
Penelope, mother of Telemakhos, has sent for you; she is in great
grief, but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her about her
husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking the truth, she
will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very things that you
are most in want of. As for bread, you can get enough of that to fill
your belly, by begging about the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>, and letting
those give that will."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="560">
<p><milestone n="560" unit="line"/>"I will tell Penelope," answered
Odysseus, "nothing but what is strictly true. I know all about her
husband, and have been partner with him in affliction, but I am
afraid of passing through this crowd of cruel suitors, for their
overweening pride [<term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>] and violent insolence
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] reach heaven. Just now, moreover, as I was
going about the house without doing any harm, a man gave me a blow
that hurt me very much, but neither Telemakhos nor any one else
defended me. Tell Penelope, therefore, to be patient and wait till
sundown. Let her give me a seat close up to the fire, for my clothes
are worn very thin - you know they are, for you have seen them ever
since I first asked you to help me - she can then ask me about the
return of her husband."</p>

<p><milestone n="574" unit="line"/>The swineherd went back when he
heard this, and Penelope said as she saw him cross the threshold,
"Why do you not bring him here, Eumaios? Is he afraid that some one
will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming inside the house at all?
Beggars should not be shamefaced."</p>

<p><milestone n="579" unit="line"/>To this you answered, O swineherd
Eumaios, "The stranger is quite reasonable. He is avoiding the
outrageous [<term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>] suitors, and is only doing what
any one else would do. He asks you to wait till sundown, and it will
be much better, my lady, that you should have him all to yourself,
when you can hear him and talk to him as you will."</p>

<p><milestone n="585" unit="line"/>"The man is no fool," answered
Penelope, "it would very likely be as he says, for there are no such
abominable people in the whole world as these men are."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="589">
<p><milestone n="589" unit="line"/>When she had done speaking
Eumaios went back to the suitors, for he had explained everything.
Then he went up to Telemakhos and said in his ear so that none could
overhear him, "My dear sir, I will now go back to the pigs, to see
after your property and my own business. You will look to what is
going on here, but above all be careful to keep out of danger, for
there are many who bear you ill will. May Zeus bring them to a bad
end before they do us a mischief."</p>

<p><milestone n="598" unit="line"/>"Very well," replied Telemakhos,
"go home when you have had your dinner, and in the morning come here
with the victims we are to sacrifice for the day. Leave the rest to
heaven and me."</p>

<p><milestone n="602" unit="line"/>On this Eumaios took his seat
again, and when he had finished his dinner he left the courts and the
room with the men at table, and went back to his pigs. As for the
suitors, they presently began to amuse themselves with singing and
dancing, for it was now getting on towards evening.

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Now there came a certain common
tramp who used to go begging all over the city of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and was
notorious as an incorrigible glutton and drunkard. This man had no
strength [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] nor stay in him, but he was a
great hulking fellow to look at; his real name, the one his mother
gave him, was Arnaios, but the young men of the place called him
Iros, because he used to run errands for any one who would send him.
As soon as he came he began to insult Odysseus, and to try and drive
him out of his own house.</p>

<p><milestone n="10" unit="line"/>"Be off, old man," he cried, "from
the doorway, or you shall be dragged out neck and heels. Do you not
see that they are all giving me the wink, and wanting me to turn you
out by force, only I do not like to do so? Get up then, and go of
yourself, or we shall come to blows."</p>

<p><milestone n="14" unit="line"/>Odysseus frowned on him and said,
"My friend, I do you no manner of harm; people give you a great deal,
but I am not jealous. There is room enough in this doorway for the
pair of us, and you need not grudge me things that are not yours to
give. You seem to be just such another tramp as myself, but perhaps
the gods will give us better luck [<term lang="xgreek">olbos</term>] by and by.
Do not, however, talk too much about fighting or you will incense me,
and old though I am, I shall cover your mouth and chest with blood. I
shall have more peace tomorrow if I do, for you will not come to the
house of Odysseus any more."</p>

<p><milestone n="25" unit="line"/>Iros was very angry and answered,
"You filthy glutton, you run on trippingly like an old fish-fag. I
have a good mind to lay both hands about you, and knock your teeth
out of your head like so many boar's tusks. Get ready,
therefore, and let these people here stand by and look on. You will
never be able to fight one who is so much younger than
yourself."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="32">
<p><milestone n="32" unit="line"/>Thus roundly did they rate one
another on the smooth pavement in front of the doorway, and when
Antinoos saw what was going on he laughed heartily and said to the
others, "This is the finest sport that you ever saw; heaven never yet
sent anything like it into this house. The stranger and Iros have
quarreled and are going to fight, let us set them on to do so at
once."</p>

<p><milestone n="40" unit="line"/>The suitors all came up laughing,
and gathered round the two ragged tramps. "Listen to me," said
Antinoos, "there are some goats&rsquo; paunches down at the fire,
which we have filled with blood and fat, and set aside for supper; he
who is victorious and proves himself to be the better man shall have
his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our table and we will not
allow any other beggar about the house at all."</p>

<p><milestone n="50" unit="line"/>The others all agreed, but
Odysseus, to throw them off the scent, said, "Sirs, an old man like
myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold his own against a young
one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on, though I know it can
only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear, however that none
of you will give me a foul blow to favor Iros and secure him the
victory."</p>

<p><milestone n="58" unit="line"/>They swore as he told them, and
when they had completed their oath Telemakhos put in a word and said,
"Stranger, if you have a mind to settle with this fellow, you need
not be afraid of any one here. Whoever strikes you will have to fight
more than one. I am host, and the other chiefs, Antinoos and
Eurymakhos, both of them men of understanding, are of the same mind
as I am."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="66">
<p><milestone n="66" unit="line"/>Every one assented, and Odysseus
girded his old rags about his loins, thus baring his stalwart thighs,
his broad chest and shoulders, and his mighty arms; but Athena came
up to him and made his limbs even stronger still. The suitors were
beyond measure astonished, and one would turn towards his neighbor
saying, "The stranger has brought such a thigh out of his old rags
that there will soon be nothing left of Iros."</p>

<p><milestone n="75" unit="line"/>Iros began to be very uneasy as he
heard them, but the servants girded him by force, and brought him
into the open part of the court in such a fright that his limbs were
all of a tremble. Antinoos scolded him and said, "You swaggering
bully, you ought never to have been born at all if you are afraid of
such an old broken-down creature as this tramp is. I say, therefore -
and it shall surely be - if he beats you and proves himself the
better man, I shall pack you off on board ship to the mainland and
send you to king Echetos, who kills every one that comes near him. He
will cut off your nose and ears, and draw out your entrails for the
dogs to eat."</p>

<p><milestone n="88" unit="line"/>This frightened Iros still more,
but they brought him into the middle of the court, and the two men
raised their hands to fight. Then Odysseus considered whether he
should let drive so hard at Iros as to make his <term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;
</term>leave him there and then as he fell, or whether he should give
him a lighter blow that should only knock him down; in the end he
deemed it best to give the lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should
begin to suspect who he was. Then they began to fight, and Iros hit
Odysseus on the right shoulder; but Odysseus gave Iros a blow on the
neck under the ear that broke in the bones of his skull, and the
blood came gushing out of his mouth; he fell groaning in the dust,
gnashing his teeth and kicking on the ground, but the suitors threw
up their hands and nearly died of laughter, as Odysseus caught hold
of him by the foot and dragged him into the outer court as far as the
gate-house. There he propped him up against the wall and put his
staff in his hands. "Sit here," said he, "and keep the dogs and pigs
off; you are a pitiful creature, and if you try to make yourself king
of the beggars any more you shall fare still worse."</p>

<p><milestone n="108" unit="line"/>Then he threw his dirty old
wallet, all tattered and torn, over his shoulder with the cord by
which it hung, and went back to sit down upon the threshold; but the
suitors went within the cloisters, laughing and saluting him, "May
Zeus, and all the other gods," said they, &lsquo;grant you whatever
you want for having put an end to the importunity of this insatiable
tramp. We will take him over to the mainland presently, to king
Echetos, who kills every one that comes near him."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="117">
<p><milestone n="117" unit="line"/>Odysseus hailed this as of good
omen, and Antinoos set a great goat's paunch before him filled
with blood and fat. Amphinomos took two loaves out of the
bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him as he did so in a
golden goblet of wine. "Good luck to you," he said, "father stranger,
you are very badly off at present, but I hope you will have better
times [<term lang="xgreek">olbos</term>] by and by."</p>

<p><milestone n="124" unit="line"/>To this Odysseus answered,
"Amphinomos, you seem to be a man of good understanding, as indeed
you may well be, seeing whose son you are. I have heard your father
well spoken of [<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>]; he is Nisus of Dulichium, a
man both brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son, and you
appear to be a considerable person; listen, therefore, and take heed
to what I am saying. Man is the vainest of all creatures that have
their being upon earth. As long as the gods grant him <term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;
</term>and his knees are steady, he thinks that he shall come to no harm
hereafter, and even when the blessed gods bring sorrow upon him, he
bears it as he needs must, and makes the best of it; for the father
of gods and men gives men their daily minds [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] day
by day. I know all about it, for I was a rich [<term lang="xgreek">olbios</term>]
man once, and did much wrong in the stubbornness
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&acirc;</term>] of my pride, and in the confidence that my
father and my brothers would support me; therefore let a man be pious
in all things always, and take the good that the gods may see fit to
send him without vainglory. Consider the infamy of what these suitors
are doing; see how they are wasting the estate, and doing dishonor to
the wife, of one who is certain to return some day, and that, too,
not long hence. Nay, he will be here soon; may a <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term>
send you home quietly first that you may not meet with him in the day
of his coming, for once he is here the suitors and he will not part
bloodlessly."</p>

<p><milestone n="151" unit="line"/>With these words he made a
drink-offering, and when he had drunk he put the gold cup again into
the hands of Amphinomos, who walked away serious and bowing his head,
for he foreboded evil. But even so he did not escape destruction, for
Athena had doomed him fall by the hand of Telemakhos. So he took his
seat again at the place from which he had come.</p>

<p><milestone n="158" unit="line"/>Then Athena put it into the mind
of Penelope to show herself to the suitors, that she might make them
still more enamored of her, and win still further honor from her son
and husband. So she feigned a mocking laugh and said, "Eurynome, I
have changed my and have a fancy to show myself to the suitors
although I detest them. I should like also to give my son a hint that
he had better not have anything more to do with them. They speak
fairly enough but they mean mischief."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="169">
<p><milestone n="169" unit="line"/>"My dear child," answered
Eurynome, "all that you have said is true, go and tell your son about
it, but first wash yourself and anoint your face. Do not go about
with your cheeks all covered with tears; it is not right that you
should grieve so incessantly; for Telemakhos, whom you always prayed
that you might live to see with a beard, is already grown
up."</p>

<p><milestone n="177" unit="line"/>"I know, Eurynome," replied
Penelope, "that you mean well, but do not try and persuade me to wash
and to anoint myself, for heaven robbed me of all my beauty on the
day my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell Autonoe and Hippodameia
that I want them. They must be with me when I am in the room; I am
not going among the men alone; it would not be proper for me to do
so."</p>

<p><milestone n="185" unit="line"/>On this the old woman went out of
the room to bid the maids go to their mistress. In the meantime
Athena bethought her of another matter, and sent Penelope off into a
sweet slumber; so she lay down on her couch and her limbs became
heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed grace and beauty over her
that all the Achaeans might admire her. She washed her face with the
ambrosial loveliness that Aphrodite wears when she goes dancing
[<term lang="xgreek">khoros</term>] with the Graces; she made her taller and of a
more commanding figure, while as for her complexion it was whiter
than sawn ivory. When Athena had done all this she went away, whereon
the maids came in from the women's room and woke Penelope with
the sound of their talking.</p>

<p><milestone n="200" unit="line"/>"What an exquisitely delicious
sleep I have been having," said she, as she passed her hands over her
face, "in spite of all my misery. I wish Artemis would let me die so
sweetly now at this very moment, that I might no longer waste in
despair for the loss of my dear husband, who possessed every kind of
good quality [<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>] and was the most
distinguished man among the Achaeans."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="206">
<p><milestone n="206" unit="line"/>With these words she came down
from her upper room, not alone but attended by two of her maidens,
and when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the
bearing-posts supporting the roof of the room, holding a veil before
her face, and with a staid maid servant on either side of her. As
they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and became so
desperately enamored of her, that each one prayed he might win her
for his own bed fellow.</p>

<p><milestone n="214" unit="line"/>"Telemakhos," said she,
addressing her son, "I fear you are no longer so discreet and well
conducted as you used to be. When you were younger you had a subtler
thoughtfulness [<term lang="xgreek">kerdos</term>]; now, however, that you are
grown up, though a stranger to look at you would take you for the son
of a well-to-do [<term lang="xgreek">olbios</term>] father as far as size and
good looks go, your conduct is by no means what it should be. What is
all this disturbance that has been going on, and how came you to
allow a stranger to be so disgracefully ill-treated? What would have
happened if he had suffered serious injury while a suppliant in our
house? Surely this would have been very discreditable to
you."</p>

<p><milestone n="226" unit="line"/>"I am not surprised, my dear
mother, at your displeasure," replied Telemakhos, "I understand all
about it and know when things are not as they should be, which I
could not do when I was younger; I cannot, however, behave with
perfect propriety at all times. First one and then another of these
wicked people here keeps driving me out of my mind, and I have no one
to stand by me. After all, however, this fight between Iros and the
stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant it to do, for the
stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo
would break the neck of every one of these wooers of yours, some
inside the house and some out; and I wish they might all be as limp
as Iros is over yonder in the gate of the outer court. See how he
nods his head like a drunken man; he has had such a thrashing that he
cannot stand on his feet nor get back to his home
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>], wherever that may be, for has no strength
left in him."</p>

<p><milestone n="243" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse.
Eurymakhos then came up and said, "Queen Penelope, daughter of
Ikarios, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos could see you at this
moment, you would have still more suitors in your house by tomorrow
morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the whole world both
as regards personal beauty and strength of understanding."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="250">
<p><milestone n="250" unit="line"/>To this Penelope replied,
"Eurymakhos, heaven robbed me of all my beauty
[<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>] whether of face or figure when the
Argives set sail for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and my dear husband with them. If he were
to return and look after my affairs, I should both be more respected
[<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] and show a better presence to the world. As it
is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions which a
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband foresaw
it all, and when he was leaving home he took my right wrist in his
hand - &lsquo;Wife, &lsquo;he said, &lsquo;we shall not all of us come
safe home from <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, for the Trojans fight well both with bow and
spear. They are excellent also at fighting from chariots, and nothing
decides [<term lang="xgreek">kr&icirc;n&ocirc;</term>] the issue of a fight
sooner than this. I know not, therefore, whether heaven will send me
back to you, or whether I may not fall over there at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>. In the
meantime do you look after things here. Take care of my father and
mother as at present, and even more so during my absence, but when
you see our son growing a beard, then marry whom you will, and leave
this your present home. This is what he said and now it is all coming
true. A night will come when I shall have to yield myself to a
marriage which I detest, for Zeus has taken from me all hope of
happiness [<term lang="xgreek">olbos</term>]. This further grief
[<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>], moreover, cuts me to the very heart. You
suitors are not wooing me after the custom
[<term lang="xgreek">dik&ecirc;</term>] of my country. When men are courting a
woman who they think will be a good wife to them and who is of noble
birth, and when they are each trying to win her for himself, they
usually bring oxen and sheep to feast the friends of the lady, and
they make her magnificent presents, instead of eating up other
people's property without paying for it."</p>

<p><milestone n="281" unit="line"/>This was what she said, and
Odysseus was glad when he heard her trying to get presents out of the
suitors, and flattering them with fair words which he knew she did
not mean in her <term lang="xgreek">noos</term>.</p>

<p><milestone n="284" unit="line"/>Then Antinoos said, "Queen
Penelope, daughter of Ikarios, take as many presents as you please
from any one who will give them to you; it is not well to refuse a
present; but we will not go about our business nor stir from where we
are, till you have married the best man among us whoever he may
be."</p>

<p><milestone n="290" unit="line"/>The others applauded what
Antinoos had said, and each one sent his servant to bring his
present. Antinoos&rsquo; man returned with a large and lovely dress
most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully made brooch
pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymakhos immediately
brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads that gleamed
like sunlight. Eurydamas&rsquo; two men returned with some earrings
fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistened most
beautifully [<term lang="xgreek">kharis</term>]; while king Peisandros son of
Polyktor gave her a necklace of the rarest workmanship, and every one
else brought her a beautiful present of some kind.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="302">
<p><milestone n="302" unit="line"/>Then the queen went back to her
room upstairs, and her maids brought the presents after her.
Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and dancing, and stayed till
evening came. They danced and sang till it grew dark; they then
brought in three braziers to give light, and piled them up with
chopped firewood very and dry, and they lit torches from them, which
the maids held up turn and turn about. Then Odysseus said:</p>

<p><milestone n="313" unit="line"/>"Maids, servants of Odysseus who
has so long been absent, go to the queen inside the house; sit with
her and amuse her, or spin, and pick wool. I will hold the light for
all these people. They may stay till morning, but shall not beat me,
for I can stand a great deal."</p>

<p><milestone n="320" unit="line"/>The maids looked at one another
and laughed, while pretty Melantho began to gibe at him
contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolios, but had been brought up
by Penelope, who used to give her toys to play with, and looked after
her when she was a child; but in spite of all this she showed no
consideration for the sorrows [<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>] of her
mistress, and used to misconduct herself with Eurymakhos, with whom
she was in love.</p>

<p><milestone n="327" unit="line"/>"Poor wretch," said she, "are you
gone clean out of your mind? Go and sleep in some smithy, or place of
public gossips, instead of chattering here. Are you not ashamed of
opening your mouth before your betters - so many of them too? Has the
wine been getting into your head, or do you always babble in this
way? You seem to have lost your wits because you beat the tramp Iros;
take care that a better man than he does not come and cudgel you
about the head till he pack you bleeding out of the
house."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="337">
<p><milestone n="337" unit="line"/>"Vixen," replied Odysseus,
scowling at her, "I will go and tell Telemakhos what you have been
saying, and he will have you torn limb from limb."</p>

<p><milestone n="340" unit="line"/>With these words he scared the
women, and they went off into the body of the house. They trembled
all aver, for they thought he would do what he said was true
[<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;th&ecirc;s</term>]. But Odysseus took his stand
near the burning braziers, holding up torches and looking at the
people - brooding the while on things that should surely come to
pass.</p>

<p><milestone n="346" unit="line"/>But Athena would not let the
suitors for one moment cease their insolence, for she wanted Odysseus
to become even more bitter against them in his grief
[<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>]; she therefore set Eurymakhos son of Polybos
on to gibe at him, which made the others laugh. "Listen to me," said
he, "you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am
minded. It is not for nothing that this man has come to the house of
Odysseus; I believe the light has not been coming from the torches,
but from his own head - for his hair is all gone, every bit of
it."</p>

<p><milestone n="356" unit="line"/>Then turning to Odysseus he said,
"Stranger, will you work as a servant, if I send you to the outer
limits of the field and see that you are well paid? Can you build a
stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year round,
and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then? Not you;
for you have got into bad ways, and do not want to work; you had
rather fill your belly by going round the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>
begging."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="366">
<p><milestone n="366" unit="line"/>"Eurymakhos," answered Odysseus,
"if you and I were to work one against the other in early summer
[<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>] when the days are at their longest - give
me a good scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which
will fast the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when
the mowing grass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let us
each take a yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength and
endurance: turn me into a four acre field, and see whether you or I
can drive the straighter furrow. If, again, war were to break out
this day, give me a shield, a couple of spears and a helmet fitting
well upon my temples - you would find me foremost in the fray, and
would cease your gibes about my belly. You are insolent and your
<term lang="xgreek">noos</term> is cruel, and you think yourself a great man because you
live in a little world, and that a bad one. If Odysseus comes to his
own again, the doors of his house are wide, but you will find them
narrow when you try to flee through them."</p>

<p><milestone n="387" unit="line"/>Eurymakhos was furious at all
this. He scowled at him and cried, "You wretch, I will soon pay you
out for daring to say such things to me, and in public too. Has the
wine been getting into your head or do you always babble in this way?
You seem to have lost your wits because you beat the tramp Iros. With
this he caught hold of a footstool, but Odysseus sought protection at
the knees of Amphinomos of Dulichium, for he was afraid. The stool
hit the cupbearer on his right hand and knocked him down: the man
fell with a cry flat on his back, and his wine-jug fell ringing to
the ground. The suitors in the covered room were now in an uproar,
and one would turn towards his neighbor, saying, "I wish the stranger
had gone somewhere else, bad luck to hide, for all the trouble he
gives us. We cannot permit such disturbance about a beggar; if such
ill counsels are to prevail we shall have no more pleasure at our
banquet."</p>

<p><milestone n="405" unit="line"/>On this Telemakhos came forward
and said, "Sirs, are you mad? Can you not carry your meat and your
liquor decently? Some evil spirit has possessed you. I do not wish to
drive any of you away, but you have had your suppers, and the sooner
you all go home to bed the better."</p>

<p><milestone n="410" unit="line"/>The suitors bit their lips and
marveled at the boldness of his speech; but Amphinomos the son of
Nisus, who was son to Aretias, said, "Do not let us take offense; it
is reasonable [<term lang="xgreek">dikaios</term>], so let us make no answer.
Neither let us do violence to the stranger nor to any of
Odysseus&rsquo; servants. Let the cupbearer go round with the
drink-offerings, that we may make them and go home to our rest. As
for the stranger, let us leave Telemakhos to deal with him, for it is
to his house that he has come."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="422">
<p><milestone n="422" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak, and his saying
pleased them well, so Moulios of Dulichium, servant to Amphinomos,
mixed them a bowl of wine and water and handed it round to each of
them man by man, whereon they made their drink-offerings to the
blessed gods: Then, when they had made their drink-offerings and had
drunk each one as he was minded, they took their several ways each of
them to his own abode. <milestone n="428" unit="line"/></p>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Odysseus was left in the room,
pondering on the means whereby with Athena's help he might be
able to kill the suitors. Presently he said to Telemakhos,
"Telemakhos, we must get the armor together and take it down inside.
Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you have removed it.
Say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke,
inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Odysseus went away, but
has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more
particularly that you are afraid a <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> may set them
on to quarrel over their wine, and that they may do each other some
harm which may disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of
arms sometimes tempts people to use them."</p>

<p><milestone n="14" unit="line"/>Telemakhos approved of what his
father had said, so he called nurse Eurykleia and said, "Nurse, shut
the women up in their room, while I take the armor that my father
left behind him down into the store room. No one looks after it now
my father is gone, and it has got all smirched with soot during my
own boyhood. I want to take it down where the smoke cannot reach
it."</p>

<p><milestone n="21" unit="line"/>"I wish, child," answered
Eurykleia, "that you would take the management of the house into your
own hands altogether, and look after all the property yourself. But
who is to go with you and light you to the store room? The maids
would have so, but you would not let them.</p>

<p><milestone n="26" unit="line"/>"The stranger," said Telemakhos,
"shall show me a light; when people eat my bread they must earn it,
no matter where they come from."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="29">
<p><milestone n="29" unit="line"/>Eurykleia did as she was told, and
bolted the women inside their room. Then Odysseus and his son made
all haste to take the helmets, shields, and spears inside; and Athena
went before them with a gold lamp in her hand that shed a soft and
brilliant radiance, whereon Telemakhos said, "Father, my eyes behold
a great marvel: the walls, with the rafters, crossbeams, and the
supports on which they rest are all aglow as with a flaming fire.
Surely there is some god here who has come down from
heaven."</p>

<p><milestone n="41" unit="line"/>"Hush," answered Odysseus, "hold
your <term lang="xgreek">noos</term> in peace and ask no questions, for this is the
manner [<term lang="xgreek">dik&ecirc;</term>] of the gods. Get you to your bed,
and leave me here to talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother
in her grief will ask me all sorts of questions."</p>

<p><milestone n="47" unit="line"/>On this Telemakhos went by
torch-light to the other side of the inner court, to the room in
which he always slept. There he lay in his bed till morning, while
Odysseus was left in the room pondering on the means whereby with
Athena's help he might be able to kill the suitors.</p>

<p><milestone n="53" unit="line"/>Then Penelope came down from her
room looking like Aphrodite or Artemis, and they set her a seat
inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the fire in her
accustomed place. It had been made by Ikmalios and had a footstool
all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was covered with a
thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came from the
women's room to join her. They set about removing the tables at
which the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away the bread
that was left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied
the embers out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them to
give both light and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Odysseus a
second time and said, "Stranger, do you mean to plague us by hanging
about the house all night and spying upon the women? Be off, you
wretch, outside, and eat your supper there, or you shall be driven
out with a firebrand."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="70">
<p><milestone n="70" unit="line"/>Odysseus scowled at her and
answered, "My good woman, why should you be so angry with me? Is it
because I am not clean, and my clothes are all in rags, and because I
am obliged to go begging about the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> after the
manner of tramps and beggars general? I too was a rich
[<term lang="xgreek">olbios</term>] man once, and had a fine house of my own; in
those days I gave to many a tramp such as I now am, no matter who he
might be nor what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all
the other things which people have who live well and are accounted
wealthy, but it pleased Zeus to take all away from me; therefore,
woman, beware lest you too come to lose that pride and place in which
you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest you get out of
favor with your mistress, and lest Odysseus should come home, for
there is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover, though he be
dead as you think he is, yet by Apollo's will he has left a son
behind him, Telemakhos, who will note anything done amiss by the
maids in the house, for he is now no longer in his
boyhood."</p>

<p><milestone n="89" unit="line"/>Penelope heard what he was saying
and scolded the maid, "Impudent baggage," said she, "I see how
abominably you are behaving, and you shall smart for it. You knew
perfectly well, for I told you myself, that I was going to see the
stranger and ask him about my husband, for whose sake I am in such
continual sorrow."</p>

<p><milestone n="96" unit="line"/>Then she said to her head waiting
woman Eurynome, "Bring a seat with a fleece upon it, for the stranger
to sit upon while he tells his story, and listens to what I have to
say. I wish to ask him some questions."</p>

<p><milestone n="100" unit="line"/>Eurynome brought the seat at once
and set a fleece upon it, and as soon as Odysseus had sat down
Penelope began by saying, "Stranger, I shall first ask you who and
whence are you? Tell me of your town and parents."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="106">
<p><milestone n="106" unit="line"/>"Lady;" answered Odysseus, "who
on the face of the whole earth can dare to chide with you? Your fame
[<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] reaches the firmament of heaven itself; you
are like some blameless king, who upholds righteousness, as the
monarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its wheat
and barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring forth
lambs, and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues, and
his people do good deeds under him. Nevertheless, as I sit here in
your house, ask me some other question and do not seek to know my
race and family, or you will recall memories that will yet more
increase my sorrow. I am full of heaviness, but I ought not to sit
weeping and wailing in another person's house, nor is it well to
be thus grieving continually. I shall have one of the servants or
even yourself complaining of me, and saying that my eyes swim with
tears because I am heavy with wine."</p>

<p><milestone n="123" unit="line"/>Then Penelope answered,
"Stranger, the immortal gods robbed me of all <term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>,
whether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> and my
dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my
affairs I should be both more respected [<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] and
should show a better presence to the world. As it is, I am oppressed
with care, and with the afflictions which a <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> has
seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our islands -
Dulichium, Same, and <placeName key="tgn,7011374">Zacynthus</placeName>, as also from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> itself, are
wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore
show no attention to strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who say
that they are skilled artisans, but am all the time brokenhearted
about Odysseus. They want me to marry again at once, and I have to
invent stratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place a
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> put it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame
in my room, and to begin working upon an enormous piece of fine
needlework. Then I said to them, &lsquo;Sweethearts, Odysseus is
indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry again immediately; wait
- for I would not have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded -
till I have finished making a shroud for the hero <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, to be
ready against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich,
and the women of the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> will talk if he is laid out
without a shroud.&rsquo; This was what I said, and they assented;
whereon I used to keep working at my great web all day long, but at
night I would unpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them
in this way for three years without their finding it out, but as time
[<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>] wore on and I was now in my fourth year,
in the waning of moons, and many days had been accomplished, those
good-for-nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to the suitors, who
broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with me, so I
was forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And now I do not
see how I can find any further shift for getting out of this
marriage. My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my son
chafes at the ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for he
is now old enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able to
look after his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an
excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me who
you are and where you come from - for you must have had father and
mother of some sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a
rock."</p>

<p><milestone n="164" unit="line"/>Then Odysseus answered, "Lady,
wife of Odysseus, since you persist in asking me about my family, I
will answer, no matter what it costs me: people must expect to be
pained [<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>] when they have been exiles as long as I
have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless, as
regards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair
and fruitful island in mid-ocean called <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>; it is thickly peopled
and there are nine cities in it: the people speak many different
languages which overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave
Eteocretans, Dorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is
a great town there, <placeName key="perseus,Knossos">Knossos</placeName>, where Minos reigned who every nine years
had a conference with Zeus himself. Minos was father to Deukalion,
whose son I am, for Deukalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself.
Idomeneus sailed for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and I, who am the younger, am called
Aithon; my brother, however, was at once the older and the more
valiant of the two; hence it was in <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> that I saw Odysseus and
showed him hospitality, for the winds took him there as he was on his
way to <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, carrying him out of his course from cape Malea and
leaving him in <placeName key="perseus,Amnisos">Amnisos</placeName> off the cave of Eileithuia, where the harbors
are difficult to enter and he could hardly find shelter from the
winds that were then raging. As soon as he got there he went into the
town and asked for Idomeneus, claiming to be his old and valued
friend, but Idomeneus had already set sail for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> some ten or
twelve days earlier, so I took him to my own house and showed him
every kind of hospitality, for I had abundance of everything.
Moreover, I fed the men who were with him with barley meal from the
public store, and got subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to
sacrifice to their heart's content. They stayed with me twelve
days, for there was a gale blowing from the North so strong that one
could hardly keep one's feet on land. I suppose some unfriendly
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> had raised it for them, but on the thirteenth day
the wind dropped, and they got away."</p>

<p><milestone n="203" unit="line"/>Many a plausible tale did
Odysseus further tell her, and Penelope wept as she listened, for her
heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon the mountain tops when the
winds from South East and West have breathed upon it and thawed it
till the rivers run bank full with water, even so did her cheeks
overflow with tears for the husband who was all the time sitting by
her side. Odysseus felt for her and was for her, but he kept his eyes
as hard as or iron without letting them so much as quiver, so
cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she had relieved
herself by weeping, she turned to him again and said: "Now, stranger,
I shall put you to the test and see whether or not you really did
entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did. Tell me, then,
how he was dressed, what kind of a man he was to look at, and so also
with his companions."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="220">
<p><milestone n="220" unit="line"/>"Lady," answered Odysseus, "it is
such a long time ago that I can hardly say. Twenty years are come and
gone since he left my home, and went elsewhere; but I will tell you
as well as I can recollect. Odysseus wore a mantle of purple wool,
double lined, and it was fastened by a gold brooch with two catches
for the pin. On the face of this there was a device that showed a dog
holding a spotted fawn between his fore paws, and watching it as it
lay panting upon the ground. Every one marveled at the way in which
these things had been done in gold, the dog looking at the fawn, and
strangling it, while the fawn was struggling convulsively to escape.
As for the shirt that he wore next his skin, it was so soft that it
fitted him like the skin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight
to the admiration of all the women who beheld it. Furthermore I say,
and lay my saying to your heart, that I do not know whether Odysseus
wore these clothes when he left home, or whether one of his
companions had given them to him while he was on his voyage; or
possibly some one at whose house he was staying made him a present of
them, for he was a man of many friends and had few equals among the
Achaeans. I myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful purple
mantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down to his feet, and I
sent him on board his ship with every mark of honor. He had a servant
with him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what he was
like; his shoulders were hunched, he was dark, and he had thick curly
hair. His name was Eurybates, and Odysseus treated him with greater
familiarity than he did any of the others, as being the most
like-minded with himself."</p>

<p><milestone n="249" unit="line"/>Penelope was moved still more
deeply as she heard the indisputable proofs
[<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;mata</term>] that Odysseus laid before her; and when
she had again found relief in tears she said to him, "Stranger, I was
already disposed to pity you, but henceforth you shall be honored and
made welcome in my house. It was I who gave Odysseus the clothes you
speak of. I took them out of the store room and folded them up
myself, and I gave him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament.
Alas! I shall never welcome him home again. It was by an ill fate
that he ever set out for that detested city whose very name I cannot
bring myself even to mention."</p>

<p><milestone n="261" unit="line"/>Then Odysseus answered, "Lady,
wife of Odysseus, do not disfigure yourself further by grieving thus
bitterly for your loss, though I can hardly blame you for doing so. A
woman who has loved her husband and borne him children, would
naturally be grieved at losing him, even though he were a worse man
than Odysseus, who they say was like a god. Still, cease your tears
and listen to what I can tell. I will hide nothing from you, and can
say with perfect truth that I have lately heard of Odysseus as being
alive and on his way home [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]; he is in the
district [<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>] of the Thesprotians, and is
bringing back much valuable treasure that he has begged from one and
another of them; but his ship and all his crew were lost as they were
leaving the Thrinacian island, for Zeus and the sun-god were angry
with him because his men had slaughtered the sun-god's cattle,
and they were all drowned to a man. But Odysseus stuck to the keel of
the ship and was drifted on to the land of the Phaeacians, who are
near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him as though he had
been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to escort him home
safe and sound. In fact Odysseus would have been here long ago, had
he not thought better to go from land to land gathering wealth; for
there is no man living who is so wily [<term lang="xgreek">kerdos</term>] as he
is; there is no one can compare with him. Pheidon king of the
Thesprotians told me all this, and he swore to me - making
drink-offerings in his house as he did so - that the ship was by the
water side and the crew found who would take Odysseus to his own
country. He sent me off first, for there happened to be a Thesprotian
ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, but he showed
me all the treasure Odysseus had got together, and he had enough
lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep his family for ten
generations; but the king said Odysseus had gone to <placeName key="perseus,Dodona">Dodona</placeName> that he
might learn Zeus&rsquo; mind from the high oak tree, and know whether
after so long an absence he should return to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> openly or in
secret. So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is
close at hand and cannot remain away from home much longer;
nevertheless I will confirm my words with an oath, and call Zeus who
is the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, as also that
hearth of Odysseus to which I have now come, that all I have spoken
shall surely come to pass. Odysseus will return in this self same
year; with the end of this moon and the beginning of the next he will
be here."</p>

<p><milestone n="308" unit="line"/>"May it be even so," answered
Penelope; "if your words come true you shall have such gifts and such
good will from me that all who see you shall congratulate you; but I
know very well how it will be. Odysseus will not return, neither will
you get your escort hence, for so surely as that Odysseus ever was,
there are now no longer any such masters in the house as he was, to
receive honorable strangers or to further them on their way home. And
now, you maids, wash his feet for him, and make him a bed on a couch
with rugs and blankets, that he may be warm and quiet till morning.
Then, at day break wash him and anoint him again, that he may sit in
the room and take his meals with Telemakhos. It shall be the worse
for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil to him; like it or
not, he shall have no more to do in this house. For how, sir, shall
you be able to learn whether or no I am superior to others of my sex
both in goodness of heart and understanding [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>], if
I let you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad? Men live but for
a little season; if they are hard, and deal hardly, people wish them
ill so long as they are alive, and speak contemptuously of them when
they are dead, but he that is righteous and deals righteously, the
people tell of his praise [<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] among all lands, and
many shall call him blessed."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="335">
<p><milestone n="335" unit="line"/>Odysseus answered, "Lady, I have
foresworn rugs and blankets from the day that I left the snowy ranges
of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> to go on shipboard. I will lie as I have lain on many a
sleepless night hitherto. Night after night have I passed in any
rough sleeping place, and waited for morning. Nor, again, do I like
having my feet washed; I shall not let any of the young hussies about
your house touch my feet; but, if you have any old and respectable
woman who has gone through as much trouble as I have, I will allow
her to wash them."</p>

<p><milestone n="349" unit="line"/>To this Penelope said, "My dear
sir, of all the guests who ever yet came to my house there never was
one who spoke in all things with such admirable propriety as you do.
There happens to be in the house a most respectable old woman - the
same who received my poor dear husband in her arms the night he was
born, and nursed him in infancy. She is very feeble now, but she
shall wash your feet. Come here," said she, "Eurykleia, and wash your
master's age-mate; I suppose Odysseus&rsquo; hands and feet are
very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages all of us
dreadfully fast."</p>

<p><milestone n="361" unit="line"/>On these words the old woman
covered her face with her hands; she began to weep and made
lamentation saying, "My dear child, I cannot think whatever I am to
do with you. I am certain no one was ever more god-fearing than
yourself, and yet Zeus hates you. No one in the whole world ever
burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs when you
prayed you might come to a green old age yourself and see your son
grow up to take after you; yet see how he has prevented you alone
from ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt the women in
some foreign palace which Odysseus has got to are gibing at him as
all these sluts here have been gibing you. I do not wonder at your
not choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which they have
insulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough, as Penelope
has said that I am to do so; I will wash them both for
Penelope's sake and for your own, for you have raised the most
lively feelings of compassion in my mind; and let me say this
moreover, which pray attend to; we have had all kinds of strangers in
distress come here before now, but I make bold to say that no one
ever yet came who was so like Odysseus in figure, voice, and feet as
you are."</p>

<p><milestone n="382" unit="line"/>"Those who have seen us both,"
answered Odysseus, "have always said we were wonderfully like each
other, and now you have noticed it too.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="386">
<p><milestone n="386" unit="line"/>Then the old woman took the
cauldron in which she was going to wash his feet, and poured plenty
of cold water into it, adding hot till the bath was warm enough.
Odysseus sat by the fire, but ere long he turned away from the light,
for it occurred to him that when the old woman had hold of his leg
she would recognize a certain scar which it bore, whereon the whole
truth would come out. And indeed as soon as she began washing her
master, she at once knew the scar as one that had been given him by a
wild boar when he was hunting on Mount Parnassus with his excellent
grandfather Autolykos - who was the most accomplished thief and
perjurer in the whole world - and with the sons of Autolykos. Hermes
himself had endowed him with this gift, for he used to burn the thigh
bones of goats and kids to him, so he took pleasure in his
companionship. It happened once that Autolykos had gone to the
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> and had found the child of his daughter
just born. As soon as he had done supper Eurykleia set the infant
upon his knees and said, "You must find a name for your grandson; you
greatly wished that you might have one."</p>

<p><milestone n="406" unit="line"/>&lsquo;Son-in-law and daughter,"
replied Autolykos, "call the child thus: I am highly displeased with
a large number of people in one place and another, both men and
women; so name the child &lsquo;Odysseus,&rsquo; or the child of anger.
When he grows up and comes to visit his mother's family on Mount
<placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName>, where my possessions lie, I will make him a present and
will send him on his way rejoicing."</p>

<p><milestone n="413" unit="line"/>Odysseus, therefore, went to
<placeName key="tgn,7011022">Parnassus</placeName> to get the presents from Autolykos, who with his sons shook
hands with him and gave him welcome. His grandmother Amphithea threw
her arms about him, and kissed his head, and both his beautiful eyes,
while Autolykos desired his sons to get dinner ready, and they did as
he told them. They brought in a five year old bull, flayed it, made
it ready and divided it into joints; these they then cut carefully up
into smaller pieces and spitted them; they roasted them sufficiently
and served the portions round. Thus through the livelong day to the
going down of the sun they feasted, and every man had his full share
so that all were satisfied; but when the sun set and it came on dark,
they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep.</p>

<p><milestone n="426" unit="line"/>When the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons of Autolykos went out with
their hounds hunting, and Odysseus went too. They climbed the wooded
slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy upland valleys; but
as the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh-risen from
the slow still currents of Okeanos, they came to a mountain dell. The
dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the beast they were
chasing, and after them came the sons of Autolykos, among whom was
Odysseus, close behind the dogs, and he had a long spear in his hand.
Here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick brushwood, so dense
that the wind and rain could not get through it, nor could the
sun's rays pierce it, and the ground underneath lay thick with
fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men's feet, and
the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to him, so
rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and stood at
bay with fire flashing from his eyes. Odysseus was the first to raise
his spear and try to drive it into the brute, but the boar was too
quick for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him above the knee
with a gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for
the boar, Odysseus hit him on the right shoulder, and the point of
the spear went right through him, so that he fell groaning in the
dust until the life went out of him. The sons of Autolykos busied
themselves with the carcass of the boar, and bound Odysseus&rsquo;
wound; then, after saying a spell to stop the bleeding, they went
home as fast as they could. But when Autolykos and his sons had
thoroughly healed Odysseus, they made him some splendid presents, and
sent him back to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> with much mutual good will. When he got back,
his father and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked him all
about it, and how he had hurt himself to get the scar; so he told
them how the boar had ripped him when he was out hunting with
Autolykos and his sons on Mount Parnassus.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="467">
<p><milestone n="467" unit="line"/>As soon as Eurykleia had got the
scarred limb in her hands and had well hold of it, she recognized it
and dropped the foot at once. The leg fell into the bath, which rang
out and was overturned, so that all the water was spilt on the
ground; Eurykleia's eyes between her joy and her grief filled
with tears, and she could not speak, but she caught Odysseus by the
beard and said, "My dear child, I am sure you must be Odysseus
himself, only I did not know you till I had actually touched and
handled you."</p>

<p><milestone n="476" unit="line"/>As she spoke she looked towards
Penelope, as though wanting to tell her that her dear husband was in
the house, but Penelope was unable to look in that direction and
observe what was going on, for Athena had diverted her attention
[<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>]; so Odysseus caught Eurykleia by the throat
with his right hand and with his left drew her close to him, and
said, "Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who nursed me at
your own breast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at
last come to my own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you
by heaven to recognize me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word
about it any one else in the house, for if you do I tell you - and it
shall surely be - that if heaven grants me to take the lives of these
suitors, I will not spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am
killing the other women."</p>

<p><milestone n="491" unit="line"/>"My child," answered Eurykleia,
"what are you talking about? You know very well that nothing can
either bend or break me. I will hold my tongue like a stone or a
piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and lay my saying to your
heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors into your hand, I will
give you a list of the women in the house who have been ill-behaved,
and of those who are guiltless."</p>

<p><milestone n="499" unit="line"/>And Odysseus answered, "Nurse,
you ought not to speak in that way; I am well able to form my own
opinion about one and all of them; hold your tongue and leave
everything to heaven."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="503">
<p><milestone n="503" unit="line"/>As he said this Eurykleia left
the room to fetch some more water, for the first had been all spilt;
and when she had washed him and anointed him with oil, Odysseus drew
his seat nearer to the fire to warm himself, and hid the scar under
his rags. Then Penelope began talking to him and said:</p>

<p><milestone n="509" unit="line"/>"Stranger, I should like to speak
with you briefly about another matter. It is indeed nearly bed time -
for those, at least, who can sleep in spite of sorrow. As for myself,
a <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> has given me a life of such unmeasurable woe
[<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>], that even by day when I am attending to my
duties and looking after the servants, I am still weeping and
lamenting during the whole time; then, when night comes, and we all
of us go to bed, I lie awake thinking, and my heart becomes prey to
the most incessant and cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale,
daughter of Pandareus, sings in the early spring from her seat in
shadiest covert hid, and with many a plaintive trill pours out the
tale how by mishap she killed her own child Itylos, son of king
Zethos, even so does my mind toss and turn in its uncertainty whether
I ought to stay with my son here, and safeguard my substance, my
bondsmen, and the greatness of my house, out of regard to the opinion
of the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> and the memory of my late husband, or
whether it is not now time for me to go with the best of these
suitors who are wooing me and making me such magnificent presents. As
long as my son was still young, and unable to understand, he would
not hear of my leaving my husband's house, but now that he is
full grown he begs and prays me to do so, being incensed at the way
in which the suitors are eating up his property. Listen, then, to a
dream that I have had and interpret it for me if you can. I have
twenty geese about the house that eat mash out of a trough, and of
which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great eagle came
swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into the neck
of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently he soared off
into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard; whereon I wept
in my room till all my maids gathered round me, so piteously was I
grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he came back
again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with human
voice, and told me to leave off crying. &lsquo;Be of good
courage,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;daughter of Ikarios; this is no dream,
but a vision of good omen that shall surely come to pass. The geese
are the suitors, and I am no longer an eagle, but your own husband,
who am come back to you, and who will bring these suitors to a
disgraceful end.&rsquo; On this I woke, and when I looked out I saw my
geese at the trough eating their mash as usual."</p>

<p><milestone n="554" unit="line"/>"This dream, lady," replied
Odysseus, "can admit but of one interpretation, for had not Odysseus
himself told you how it shall be fulfilled? The death of the suitors
is portended, and not one single one of them will escape."</p>

<p><milestone n="559" unit="line"/>And Penelope answered, "Stranger,
dreams are very curious and unaccountable things, and they do not by
any means invariably come true. There are two gates through which
these insubstantial fancies proceed; the one is of horn, and the
other ivory. Those that come through the gate of ivory are fatuous,
but those from the gate of horn mean something to those that see
them. I do not think, however, that my own dream came through the
gate of horn, though I and my son should be most thankful if it
proves to have done so. Furthermore I say - and lay my saying to your
heart - the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened day that is to
sever me from the house of Odysseus, for I am about to hold a
tournament [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>] of axes. My husband used to set up
twelve axes in the court, one in front of the other, like the stays
upon which a ship is built; he would then go back from them and shoot
an arrow through the whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try to
perform the same feat [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>], and whichever of them
can string the bow most easily, and send his arrow through all the
twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit this house of my lawful
husband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth. But even so, I doubt
not that I shall remember it in my dreams."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="582">
<p><milestone n="582" unit="line"/>Then Odysseus answered, "my lady
wife of Odysseus, you need not defer your tournament
[<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>], for Odysseus will return ere ever they can
string the bow, handle it how they will, and send their arrows
through the iron."</p>

<p><milestone n="588" unit="line"/>To this Penelope said, "As long,
sir, as you will sit here and talk to me, I can have no desire to go
to bed. Still, people cannot do permanently without sleep, and heaven
has appointed us dwellers on earth a time for all things. I will
therefore go upstairs and recline upon that couch which I have never
ceased to flood with my tears from the day Odysseus set out for the
city with a hateful name."</p>

<p><milestone n="600" unit="line"/>She then went upstairs to her own
room, not alone, but attended by her maidens, and when there, she
lamented her dear husband till Athena shed sweet sleep over her
eyelids. <milestone n="604" unit="line"/></p>

<div1 type="Book" n="20">

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Odysseus slept in the room upon an
undressed bullock's hide, on the top of which he threw several
skins of the sheep the suitors had eaten, and Eurynome threw a cloak
over him after he had laid himself down. There, then, Odysseus lay
wakefully brooding upon the way in which he should kill the suitors;
and by and by, the women who had been in the habit of misconducting
themselves with them, left the house giggling and laughing with one
another. This made Odysseus very angry, and he doubted whether to get
up and kill every single one of them then and there, or to let them
sleep one more and last time with the suitors. His heart growled
within him, and as a bitch with puppies growls and shows her teeth
when she sees a stranger, so did his heart growl with anger at the
evil deeds that were being done: but he beat his breast and said,
"Heart, be still, you had worse than this to bear on the day when the
terrible <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in
silence till your cunning got you safe out of the cave, though you
made sure of being killed."</p>

<p><milestone n="22" unit="line"/>Thus he chided with his heart, and
checked it into endurance, but he tossed about as one who turns a
paunch full of blood and fat in front of a hot fire, doing it first
on one side and then on the other, that he may get it cooked as soon
as possible, even so did he turn himself about from side to side,
thinking all the time how, single handed as he was, he should
contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked suitors. But by
and by Athena came down from heaven in the likeness of a woman, and
hovered over his head saying, "My poor unhappy man, why do you lie
awake in this way? This is your house: your wife is safe inside it,
and so is your son who is just such a young man as any father may be
proud of."</p>

<p><milestone n="36" unit="line"/>"Goddess," answered Odysseus, "all
that you have said is true, but I am in some doubt as to how I shall
be able to kill these wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a
number of them there always are. And there is this further
difficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing that with
Zeus&rsquo; and your assistance I succeed in killing them, I must ask
you to consider where I am to escape to from their avengers when it
is all over."</p>

<p><milestone n="44" unit="line"/>"For shame," replied Athena, "why,
any one else would trust a worse ally than myself, even though that
ally were only a mortal and less wise than I am. Am I not a goddess,
and have I not protected you throughout in all your ordeals
[<term lang="xgreek">ponos</term>]? I tell you plainly that even though there
were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us, you
should take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you.
But go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all night, and
you shall be out of your troubles before long."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="54">
<p><milestone n="54" unit="line"/>As she spoke she shed sleep over
his eyes, and then went back to <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>.</p>

<p><milestone n="56" unit="line"/>While Odysseus was thus yielding
himself to a very deep slumber that eased the burden of his sorrows,
his admirable wife awoke, and sitting up in her bed began to cry.
When she had relieved herself by weeping she prayed to Artemis
saying, "Great Goddess Artemis, daughter of Zeus, drive an arrow into
my heart and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch me up and bear me
through paths of darkness till it drop me into the mouths of
overflowing Okeanos, as it did the daughters of Pandareus. The
daughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother, for the gods
killed them, so they were left orphans. But Aphrodite took care of
them, and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Hera taught them
to excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Artemis gave
them an imposing presence, and Athena endowed them with every kind of
accomplishment; but one day when Aphrodite had gone up to <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> to
see Zeus about getting them married (for well does he know both what
shall happen and what not happen to every one) the storm winds came
and spirited them away to become handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even
so I wish that the gods who live in heaven would hide me from mortal
sight, or that fair Artemis might strike me, for I would fain go even
beneath the sad earth if I might do so still looking towards Odysseus
only, and without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was.
Besides, no matter how many people may grieve by day, they can put up
with it so long as they can sleep at night, for when the eyes are
closed in slumber people forget good and ill alike; whereas my
miserable <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> haunts me even in my dreams. This very
night I thought there was one lying by my side who was like Odysseus
as he was when he went away with his host, and I rejoiced, for I
believed that it was no dream, but the very truth itself."</p>

<p><milestone n="91" unit="line"/>On this the day broke, but
Odysseus heard the sound of her weeping, and it puzzled him, for it
seemed as though she already knew him and was by his side. Then he
gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had lain, and set
them on a seat in the room, but he took the bullock's hide out
into the open. He lifted up his hands to heaven, and prayed, saying
"Father Zeus, since you have seen fit to bring me over land and sea
to my own home after all the afflictions you have laid upon me, give
me a sign out of the mouth of some one or other of those who are now
waking within the house, and let me have another sign of some kind
from outside."</p>

<p><milestone n="102" unit="line"/>Thus did he pray. Zeus heard his
prayer and forthwith thundered high up among the from the splendor of
<placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, and Odysseus was glad when he heard it. At the same time
within the house, a miller-woman from hard by in the mill room lifted
up her voice and gave him another sign. There were twelve
miller-women whose business it was to grind wheat and barley which
are the staff of life. The others had ground their task and had gone
to take their rest, but this one had not yet finished, for she was
not so strong as they were, and when she heard the thunder she
stopped grinding and gave the sign [<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>] to her
master. "Father Zeus," said she, "you who rule over heaven and earth,
you have thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it,
and this means something for somebody; answer the prayer, then, of me
your poor servant who calls upon you, and let this be the very last
day that the suitors dine in the house of Odysseus. They have worn me
out with the labor of grinding meal for them, and I hope they may
never have another dinner anywhere at all."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="120">
<p><milestone n="120" unit="line"/>Odysseus was glad when he heard
the omens conveyed to him by the woman's speech, and by the
thunder, for he knew they meant that he should avenge himself on the
suitors.</p>

<p><milestone n="122" unit="line"/>Then the other maids in the house
rose and lit the fire on the hearth; Telemakhos also rose and put on
his clothes. He girded his sword about his shoulder, bound his
sandals on his comely feet, and took a doughty spear with a point of
sharpened bronze; then he went to the threshold of the room and said
to Eurykleia, "Nurse, did you make the stranger comfortable both as
regards bed and board, or did you let him shift for himself? - for my
mother, good woman though she is, has a way of paying great attention
to second-rate people, and of neglecting others who are in reality
much better men."</p>

<p><milestone n="134" unit="line"/>"Do not find fault, child," said
Eurykleia, "when there is no one to find fault with. The stranger sat
and drank his wine as long as he liked: your mother did ask him if he
would take any more bread and he said he would not. When he wanted to
go to bed she told the servants to make one for him, but he said he
was such a wretched outcast that he would not sleep on a bed and
under blankets; he insisted on having an undressed bullock's
hide and some sheepskins put for him in the room and I threw a cloak
over him myself."</p>

<p><milestone n="144" unit="line"/>Then Telemakhos went out of the
court to the place where the Achaeans were meeting in assembly; he
had his spear in his hand, and he was not alone, for his two dogs
went with him. But Eurykleia called the maids and said, "Come, wake
up; set about sweeping the cloisters and sprinkling them with water
to lay the dust; put the covers on the seats; wipe down the tables,
some of you, with a wet sponge; clean out the mixing-jugs and the
cups, and for water from the fountain at once; the suitors will be
here directly; they will be here early, for it is a feast
day."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="157">
<p><milestone n="157" unit="line"/>Thus did she speak, and they did
even as she had said: twenty of them went to the fountain for water,
and the others set themselves busily to work about the house. The men
who were in attendance on the suitors also came up and began chopping
firewood. By and by the women returned from the fountain, and the
swineherd came after them with the three best pigs he could pick out.
These he let feed about the premises, and then he said with good
humor to Odysseus, "Stranger, are the suitors treating you any better
now, or are they as insolent as ever?"</p>

<p><milestone n="169" unit="line"/>"May heaven," answered Odysseus,
"requite to them the wickedness with which they deal high-handedly in
another man's house without any sense of shame
[<term lang="xgreek">aid&ocirc;s</term>]."</p>

<p><milestone n="172" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse; meanwhile
Melanthios the goatherd came up, for he too was bringing in his best
goats for the suitors&rsquo; dinner; and he had two shepherds with
him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse, and then Melanthios
began gibing at Odysseus. "Are you still here, stranger," said he,
"to pester people by begging about the house? Why can you not go
elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an understanding before we
have given each other a taste of our fists. You beg without any sense
of decency [<term lang="xgreek">kosmos</term>]: are there not feasts elsewhere
among the Achaeans, as well as here?"</p>

<p><milestone n="183" unit="line"/>Odysseus made no answer, but
bowed his head and brooded. Then a third man, Philoitios, joined
them, who was bringing in a barren heifer and some goats. These were
brought over by the boatmen who are there to take people over when
any one comes to them. So Philoitios made his heifer and his goats
secure under the gatehouse, and then went up to the swineherd. "Who,
Swineherd," said he, "is this stranger that is lately come here? Is
he one of your men? What is his family? Where does he come from? Poor
fellow, he looks as if he had been some great man, but the gods give
sorrow to whom they will - even to kings if it so pleases
them</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="197">
<p><milestone n="197" unit="line"/>As he spoke he went up to
Odysseus and saluted him with his right hand; "Good day to you,
father stranger," said he, "you seem to be very poorly off now, but I
hope you will have better times [<term lang="xgreek">olbos</term>] by and by.
Father Zeus, of all gods you are the most malicious. We are your own
children, yet you show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions.
A sweat came over me when I saw this man, and my eyes filled with
tears, for he reminds me of Odysseus, who I fear is going about in
just such rags as this man's are, if indeed he is still among
the living. If he is already dead and in the house of Hades, then,
alas! for my good master, who made me his stockman when I was quite
young in the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of the Cephall&ecirc;nians, and now
his cattle are countless; no one could have done better with them
than I have, for they have bred like ears of wheat; nevertheless I
have to keep bringing them in for others to eat, who take no heed of
his son though he is in the house, and fear not the wrath of heaven,
but are already eager to divide Odysseus&rsquo; property among them
because he has been away so long. I have often thought - only it
would not be right while his son is living - of going off with the
cattle to some foreign <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>; bad as this would be, it
is still harder to stay here and be ill-treated about other
people's herds. My position is intolerable, and I should long
since have run away and put myself under the protection of some other
chief, only that I believe my poor master will yet return, and send
all these suitors fleeing out of the house."</p>

<p><milestone n="226" unit="line"/>"Stockman," answered Odysseus,
"you seem to be a very well-disposed person, and I can see that you
are a man of sense. Therefore I will tell you, and will confirm my
words with an oath: by Zeus, the chief of all gods, and by that
hearth of Odysseus to which I am now come, Odysseus shall return
before you leave this place, and if you are so minded you shall see
him killing the suitors who are now masters here."</p>

<p><milestone n="235" unit="line"/>"If Zeus were to bring this to
pass," replied the stockman, "you should see how I would do my very
utmost to help him."</p>

<p><milestone n="238" unit="line"/>And in like manner Eumaios prayed
that Odysseus might return home.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="240">
<p><milestone n="240" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile
the suitors were hatching a plot to murder Telemakhos: but a bird
flew near them on their left hand - an eagle with a dove in its
talons. On this Amphinomos said, "My friends, this plot of ours to
murder Telemakhos will not succeed; let us go to dinner
instead."</p>

<p><milestone n="247" unit="line"/>The others assented, so they went
inside and laid their cloaks on the benches and seats. They
sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the heifer, and when the
inward meats were cooked they served them round. They mixed the wine
in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave every man his cup, while
Philoitios handed round the bread in the breadbaskets, and Melanthios
poured them out their wine. Then they laid their hands upon the good
things that were before them.</p>

<p><milestone n="257" unit="line"/>Telemakhos deliberately
[<term lang="xgreek">kerdos</term>] made Odysseus sit in the part of the room
that was paved with stone; he gave him a shabby-looking seat at a
little table to himself, and had his portion of the inward meats
brought to him, with his wine in a gold cup. "Sit there," said he,
"and drink your wine among the great people. I will put a stop to the
gibes and blows of the suitors, for this is no public house, but
belongs to Odysseus, and has passed from him to me. Therefore,
suitors, keep your hands and your tongues to yourselves, or there
will be trouble."</p>

<p><milestone n="268" unit="line"/>The suitors bit their lips, and
marveled at the boldness of his speech; then Antinoos said, "We do
not like such language but we will put up with it, for Telemakhos is
threatening us in good earnest. If Zeus had let us we should have put
a stop to his brave talk ere now."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="275">
<p><milestone n="275" unit="line"/>Thus spoke Antinoos, but
Telemakhos heeded him not. Meanwhile the heralds were bringing the
holy hecatomb through the city, and the Achaeans gathered under the
shady grove of Apollo.</p>

<p><milestone n="279" unit="line"/>Then they roasted the outer meat,
drew it off the spits, gave every man his portion, and feasted to
their hearts&rsquo; content; those who waited at table gave Odysseus
exactly the same portion as the others had, for Telemakhos had told
them to do so.</p>

<p><milestone n="284" unit="line"/>But Athena would not let the
suitors for one moment drop their insolence, for she wanted Odysseus
to become still more bitter [<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>] against them. Now
there happened to be among them a ribald fellow, whose name was
Ktesippos, and who came from Same. This man, confident in his great
wealth, was paying court to the wife of Odysseus, and said to the
suitors, "Hear what I have to say. The stranger has already had as
large a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not right
nor reasonable [<term lang="xgreek">dikaios</term>] to ill-treat any guest of
Telemakhos who comes here. I will, however, make him a present on my
own account, that he may have something to give to the bath-woman, or
to some other of Odysseus&rsquo; servants."</p>

<p><milestone n="299" unit="line"/>As he spoke he picked up a
heifer's foot from the meat-basket in which it lay, and threw it
at Odysseus, but Odysseus turned his head a little aside, and avoided
it, smiling sardonically as he did so, and it hit the wall, not him.
On this Telemakhos spoke fiercely to Ktesippos, "It is a good thing
for you," said he, "that the stranger turned his head so that you
missed him. If you had hit him I should have run you through with my
spear, and your father would have had to see about getting you buried
rather than married in this house. So let me have no more unseemly
behavior from any of you, for I am grown up now to the knowledge of
good and evil and understand what is going on, instead of being the
child that I have been heretofore. I have long seen you killing my
sheep and making free with my grain and wine: I have put up with
this, for one man is no match for many, but do me no further
violence. Still, if you wish to kill me, kill me; I would far rather
die than see such disgraceful scenes day after day - guests insulted,
and men dragging the women servants about the house in an unseemly
way."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="320">
<p><milestone n="320" unit="line"/>They all held their peace till at
last Agelaos son of Damastor said, "No one should take offense at
what has just been said, nor gainsay it, for it is quite reasonable
[<term lang="xgreek">dikaios</term>]. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the
stranger, or any one else of the servants who are about the house; I
would say, however, a friendly word to Telemakhos and his mother,
which I trust may commend itself to both. &lsquo;As long,&rsquo; I
would say, &lsquo;as you had ground for hoping that Odysseus would one
day come home, there will be no <term lang="xgreek">nemesis</term> as a result of your
waiting and suffering the suitors to be in your house. It would have
been better that he should have returned, but it is now sufficiently
clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all this quietly over
with your mother, and tell her to marry the best man, and the one who
makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will yourself be able
to manage your own inheritance, and to eat and drink in peace, while
your mother will look after some other man's house, not
yours."&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="338" unit="line"/>To this Telemakhos answered, "By
Zeus, Agelaos, and by the sorrows of my unhappy father, who has
either perished far from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, or is wandering in some distant
land, I throw no obstacles in the way of my mother's marriage;
on the contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she will, and I will
give her numberless gifts into the bargain, but I dare not insist
point blank that she shall leave the house against her own wishes.
Heaven forbid that I should do this."</p>

<p><milestone n="345" unit="line"/>Athena now made the suitors fall
to laughing immoderately, and set their wits wandering; but they were
laughing with a forced laughter. Their meat became smeared with
blood; their eyes filled with tears, and their hearts were heavy with
forebodings. Theoklymenos saw this and said, "Unhappy men, what is it
that ails you? There is a shroud of darkness drawn over you from head
to foot, your cheeks are wet with tears; the air is alive with
wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams drip blood; the gate of the
cloisters and the court beyond them are full of ghosts trooping down
into the night of Hades; the sun is blotted out of heaven, and a
blighting gloom is over all the land."</p>

<p><milestone n="358" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak, and they all
of them laughed heartily. Eurymakhos then said, "This stranger who
has lately come here has lost his senses. Servants, turn him out into
the streets, since he finds it so dark here."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="363">
<p><milestone n="363" unit="line"/>But Theoklymenos said,
"Eurymakhos, you need not send any one with me. I have eyes, ears,
and a pair of feet of my own, to say nothing of an understanding mind
[<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>]. I will take these out of the house with me,
for I see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men who
are insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Odysseus
will be able to escape."</p>

<p><milestone n="371" unit="line"/>He left the house as he spoke,
and went back to Peiraios who gave him welcome, but the suitors kept
looking at one another and provoking Telemakhos by laughing at the
strangers. One insolent fellow said to him, "Telemakhos, you are not
happy in your guests; first you have this importunate tramp, who
comes begging bread and wine and has no skill for work or for hard
fighting [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>], but is perfectly useless, and
now here is another fellow who is setting himself up as a seer. Let
me persuade you, for it will be much better, to put them on board
ship and send them off to the Sicels to sell for what they will
bring."</p>

<p><milestone n="384" unit="line"/>Telemakhos gave him no heed, but
sat silently watching his father, expecting every moment that he
would begin his attack upon the suitors.</p>

<p><milestone n="387" unit="line"/>Meanwhile the daughter of
Ikarios, wise Penelope, had had a rich seat placed for her facing the
court and cloisters, so that she could hear what every one was
saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid merriment; it had
been both good and abundant, for they had sacrificed many victims;
but the supper was yet to come, and nothing can be conceived more
gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a brave man were soon to
lay before them - for they had brought their doom upon themselves.

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Athena now put it in
Penelope's mind to make the suitors try their skill with the bow
and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves, as a means of
bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and got the store
room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of ivory; she
then went with her maidens into the store room at the end of the
house, where her husband's treasures of gold, bronze, and
wrought iron were kept, and where was also his bow, and the quiver
full of deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had
met in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> - Iphitos the son of Eurytos. The two fell in with
one another in <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName> at the house of Ortilokhos, where Odysseus was
staying in order to recover a debt that was owing from the whole

sheep from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and had sailed away with them and with their
shepherds. In quest of these Odysseus took a long journey while still
quite young, for his father and the other chieftains sent him on a
mission to recover them. Iphitos had gone there also to try and get
back twelve brood mares that he had lost, and the mule foals that
were running with them. These mares were the death of him in the end,
for when he went to the house of Zeus&rsquo; son, mighty Herakles, who
performed such prodigies of valor, Herakles to his shame killed him,
though he was his guest, for he feared not heaven's vengeance,
nor yet respected his own table which he had set before Iphitos, but
killed him in spite of everything, and kept the mares himself. It was
when claiming these that Iphitos met Odysseus, and gave him the bow
which mighty Eurytos had been used to carry, and which on his death
had been left by him to his son. Odysseus gave him in return a sword
and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast friendship,
although they never visited at one another's houses, for
Zeus&rsquo; son Herakles killed Iphitos ere they could do so. This
bow, then, given him by Iphitos, had not been taken with him by
Odysseus when he sailed for <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>; he had used it so long as he had
been at home, but had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a
valued friend.</p>

<p><milestone n="42" unit="line"/>Penelope presently reached the oak
threshold of the store room; the carpenter had planed this duly, and
had drawn a line on it so as to get it quite straight; he had then
set the door posts into it and hung the doors. She loosed the strap
from the handle of the door, put in the key, and drove it straight
home to shoot back the bolts that held the doors; these flew open
with a noise like a bull bellowing in a meadow, and Penelope stepped
upon the raised platform, where the chests stood in which the fair
linen and clothes were laid by along with fragrant herbs: reaching
thence, she took down the bow with its bow case from the peg on which
it hung. She sat down with it on her knees, weeping bitterly as she
took the bow out of its case, and when her tears had relieved her,
she went to the room where the suitors were, carrying the bow and the
quiver, with the many deadly arrows that were inside it. Along with
her came her maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron and
bronze which her husband had won as prizes. When she reached the
suitors, she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of
the room, holding a veil before her face, and with a maid on either
side of her. Then she said:</p>

<p><milestone n="68" unit="line"/>"Listen to me you suitors, who
persist in abusing the hospitality of this house because its owner
has been long absent, and without other pretext than that you want to
marry me; this, then, being the prize that you are contending for, I
will bring out the mighty bow of Odysseus, and whomsoever of you
shall string it most easily and send his arrow through each one of
twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this house of my lawful
husband, so goodly, and so abounding in wealth. But even so I doubt
not that I shall remember it in my dreams."</p>

<p><milestone n="80" unit="line"/>As she spoke, she told Eumaios to
set the bow and the pieces of iron before the suitors, and Eumaios
wept as he took them to do as she had bidden him. Hard by, the
stockman wept also when he saw his master's bow, but Antinoos
scolded them. "You country louts," said he, "silly simpletons; why
should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by crying in this way?
She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her husband; sit still,
therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or go outside if you want
to cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors shall have to
contend [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>] for it with might and main, for we
shall find it no light matter to string such a bow as this is. There
is not a man of us all who is such another as Odysseus; for I have
seen him and remember him, though I was then only a
child."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="96">
<p><milestone n="96" unit="line"/>This was what he said, but all the
time he was expecting to be able to string the bow and shoot through
the iron, whereas in fact he was to be the first that should taste of
the arrows from the hands of Odysseus, whom he was dishonoring in his
own house - egging the others on to do so also.</p>

<p><milestone n="101" unit="line"/>Then Telemakhos spoke. "Great
heavens!" he exclaimed, "Zeus must have robbed me of my senses. Here
is my dear and excellent mother saying she will quit this house and
marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying myself as though there
were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the contest
[<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>] has been agreed upon, let it go forward. It
is for a woman whose peer is not to be found in <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, or
<placeName key="perseus,Mycenae">Mycenae</placeName>, nor yet in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> nor on the mainland. You know this as well
as I do; what need have I to speak in praise [<term lang="xgreek">ainos</term>]
of my mother? Come on, then, make no excuses for delay, but let us
see whether you can string the bow or no. I too will make trial of
it, for if I can string it and shoot through the iron, I shall not
suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger, not if I can win
the prizes which my father won before me."</p>

<p><milestone n="118" unit="line"/>As he spoke he sprang from his
seat, threw his crimson cloak from him, and took his sword from his
shoulder. First he set the axes in a row, in a long groove which he
had dug for them, and had made straight by line. Then he stamped the
earth tight round them, and everyone was surprised when they saw him
set up so orderly, though he had never seen anything of the kind
before. This done, he went on to the pavement to make trial of the
bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his might to draw the
string, and thrice he had to rest his strength
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>], though he had hoped to string the bow and
shoot through the iron. He was trying forcefully
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] for the fourth time, and would have strung
it had not Odysseus made a sign to check him in spite of all his
eagerness. So he said:</p>

<p><milestone n="131" unit="line"/>"Alas! I shall either be always
feeble and of no prowess, or I am too young, and have not yet reached
my full strength so as to be able to hold my own if any one attacks
me. You others, therefore, who are stronger
[<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] than I, make trial of the bow and get this
contest [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>] settled."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="136">
<p><milestone n="136" unit="line"/>On this he put the bow down,
letting it lean against the door [that led into the house]
with the arrow standing against the top of the bow. Then he sat down
on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinoos said:</p>

<p><milestone n="141" unit="line"/>"Come on each of you in his turn,
going towards the right from the place at which the cupbearer begins
when he is handing round the wine."</p>

<p><milestone n="143" unit="line"/>The rest agreed, and Leiodes son
of Oinops was the first to rise. He was sacrificial priest to the
suitors, and sat in the corner near the mixing-bowl. He was the only
man to whom their evil deeds were hateful [<term lang="xgreek">ekhthra</term>]and
was indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow
and arrow, so he went on to the pavement to make his trial, but he
could not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused to hard
work, they therefore soon grew tired, and he said to the suitors, "My
friends, I cannot string it; let another have it; this bow shall take
the life and soul [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] out of many a chief
among us, for it is better to die than to live after having missed
the prize that we have so long striven for, and which has brought us
so long together. Some one of us is even now hoping and praying that
he may marry Penelope, but when he has seen this bow and tried it,
let him woo and make bridal offerings to some other woman, and let
Penelope marry whoever makes her the best offer and whose lot it is
to win her."</p>

<p><milestone n="163" unit="line"/>On this he put the bow down,
letting it lean against the door, with the arrow standing against the
tip of the bow. Then he took his seat again on the seat from which he
had risen; and Antinoos rebuked him saying:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="167">
<p><milestone n="167" unit="line"/>"Leiodes, what are you talking
about? Your words are monstrous and intolerable; it makes me angry to
listen to you. Shall, then, this bow take the life
[<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of many a chief among us, merely
because you cannot bend it yourself? True, you were not born to be an
archer, but there are others who will soon string it."</p>

<p><milestone n="175" unit="line"/>Then he said to Melanthios the
goatherd, "Look sharp, light a fire in the court, and set a seat hard
by with a sheep skin on it; bring us also a large ball of lard, from
what they have in the house. Let us warm the bow and grease it; we
will then make trial of it again, and bring the contest
[<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>] to an end."</p>

<p><milestone n="181" unit="line"/>Melanthios lit the fire, and set
a seat covered with sheep skins beside it. He also brought a great
ball of lard from what they had in the house, and the suitors warmed
the bow and again made trial of it, but they were none of them nearly
strong [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] enough to string it. Nevertheless
there still remained Antinoos and Eurymakhos, who were the
ringleaders among the suitors and much the foremost in
<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term> among them all.</p>

<p><milestone n="188" unit="line"/>Then the swineherd and the
stockman left the cloisters together, and Odysseus followed them.
When they had got outside the gates and the outer yard, Odysseus said
to them quietly:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="193">
<p><milestone n="193" unit="line"/>"Stockman, and you swineherd, I
have something in my mind which I am in doubt whether to say or no;
but I think I will say it. What manner of men would you be to stand
by Odysseus, if some god should bring him back here all of a sudden?
Say which you are disposed to do - to side with the suitors, or with
Odysseus?"</p>

<p><milestone n="199" unit="line"/>"Father Zeus," answered the
stockman, "would indeed that you might so ordain it. If some
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> were but to bring Odysseus back, you should see
with what might and main I would fight for him."</p>

<p><milestone n="203" unit="line"/>In like words Eumaios prayed to
all the gods that Odysseus might return; when, therefore, he saw for
certain what mind [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] they were of, Odysseus said,
"It is I, Odysseus, who am here. I have suffered much, but at last,
in the twentieth year, I am come back to my own country. I find that
you two alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so, for I
have not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you two,
therefore, will I unfold the truth [<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;theia</term>] as
it shall be. If heaven shall deliver the suitors into my hands, I
will find wives for both of you, will give you house and holding
close to my own, and you shall be to me as though you were brothers
and friends of Telemakhos. I will now give you a convincing proof
[<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>] that you may know me and be assured. See,
here is the scar from the boar's tooth that ripped me when I was
out hunting on Mount Parnassus with the sons of
Autolykos."</p>

<p><milestone n="221" unit="line"/>As he spoke he drew his rags
aside from the great scar, and when they had examined it thoroughly,
they both of them wept about Odysseus, threw their arms round him and
kissed his head and shoulders, while Odysseus kissed their hands and
faces in return. The sun would have gone down upon their mourning if
Odysseus had not checked them and said:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="228">
<p><milestone n="228" unit="line"/>"Cease your weeping, lest some
one should come outside and see us, and tell those who are within.
When you go in, do so separately, not both together; I will go first,
and do you follow afterwards; Let this moreover be the sign
[<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>] between us; the suitors will all of them
try to prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you,
therefore, Eumaios, place it in my hands when you are carrying it
about, and tell the women to close the doors of their apartment. If
they hear any groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house,
they must not come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are
at their work. And I charge you, Philoitios, to make fast the doors
of the outer court, and to bind them securely at once."</p>

<p><milestone n="242" unit="line"/>When he had thus spoken, he went
back to the house and took the seat that he had left. Presently, his
two servants followed him inside.</p>

<p><milestone n="245" unit="line"/>At this moment the bow was in the
hands of Eurymakhos, who was warming it by the fire, but even so he
could not string it, and he was greatly grieved. He heaved a deep
sigh and said, "I grieve [<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>] for myself and for us
all; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage, but I do not
care nearly so much about this, for there are plenty of other women
in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> and elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our being so
inferior to Odysseus in strength [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] that we
cannot string his bow. This will disgrace us in the eyes of those who
are yet unborn."</p>

<p><milestone n="256" unit="line"/>"It shall not be so, Eurymakhos,"
said Antinoos, "and you know it yourself. To-day is the feast of
Apollo throughout all the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>; who can string a bow on
such a day as this? Put it on one side - as for the axes they can
stay where they are, for no one is likely to come to the house and
take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups, that we may
make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of the bow; we will
tell Melanthios to bring us in some goats tomorrow - the best he has;
we can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty archer, and again
make trial of the bow, so as to bring the contest
[<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>] to an end."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="269">
<p><milestone n="269" unit="line"/>The rest approved his words, and
thereon men servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while
pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine and water and handed it round
after giving every man his drink-offering. Then, when they had made
their offerings and had drunk each as much as he desired, Odysseus
craftily said:</p>

<p><milestone n="275" unit="line"/>"Suitors of the illustrious
queen, listen that I may speak even as I am minded. I appeal more
especially to Eurymakhos, and to Antinoos who has just spoken with so
much reason. Cease shooting for the present and leave the matter to
the gods, but in the morning let heaven give victory to whom it will.
For the moment, however, give me the bow that I may prove the power
of my hands among you all, and see whether I still have as much
strength as I used to have, or whether travel and neglect have made
an end of it."</p>

<p><milestone n="285" unit="line"/>This made them all very angry,
for they feared he might string the bow; Antinoos therefore rebuked
him fiercely saying, "Wretched creature, you have not so much as a
grain of sense in your whole body; you ought to think yourself lucky
in being allowed to dine unharmed among your betters, without having
any smaller portion served you than we others have had, and in being
allowed to hear our conversation. No other beggar or stranger has
been allowed to hear what we say among ourselves; the wine must have
been doing you a mischief, as it does with all those drink
immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the Centaur Eurytion when he
was staying with Peirithoos among the Lapiths. When the wine had got
into his head he went mad and did ill deeds about the house of
Peirithoos; this grieved [<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>] the heroes who were
there assembled, so they rushed at him and cut off his ears and
nostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of the house,
so he went away crazed, and bore the burden
[<term lang="xgreek">at&ecirc;</term>] of his crime, bereft of understanding.
Henceforth, therefore, there was war between humankind and the
centaurs, but he brought it upon himself through his own drunkenness.
In like manner I can tell you that it will go hardly with you if you
string the bow: you will find no mercy from any one in our
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>, for we shall at once ship you off to king
Echetos, who kills every one that comes near him: you will never get
away alive, so drink and keep quiet without getting into a quarrel
with men younger than yourself."</p>

<p><milestone n="311" unit="line"/>Penelope then spoke to him.
"Antinoos," said she, "it is not right [<term lang="xgreek">dikaios</term>] that
you should ill-treat any guest of Telemakhos who comes to this house.
If the stranger should prove strong [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] enough
to string the mighty bow of Odysseus, can you suppose that he would
take me home with him and make me his wife? Even the man himself can
have no such idea in his mind: none of you need let that disturb his
feasting; it would be out of all reason."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="320">
<p><milestone n="320" unit="line"/>"Queen Penelope," answered
Eurymakhos, "we do not suppose that this man will take you away with
him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest some of the baser sort,
men or women among the Achaeans, should go gossiping about and say,
&lsquo;These suitors are a feeble folk; they are paying court to the
wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them was able to string, and
yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house strung it at once and sent
an arrow through the iron.&rsquo; This is what will be said, and it
will be a scandal against us."</p>

<p><milestone n="330" unit="line"/>"Eurymakhos," Penelope answered,
"people who persist in eating up the estate of a great chieftain and
dishonoring his house must not expect others in the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos
</term>to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as
you think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built, he says
moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and let us see
whether he can string it or no. I say - and it shall surely be - that
if Apollo grants him the glory of stringing it, I will give him a
cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin to keep off dogs and
robbers, and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals, and will
see him sent safely wherever he wants to go."</p>

<p><milestone n="343" unit="line"/>Then Telemakhos said, "Mother, I
am the only man either in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> or in the islands that are over
against Elis who has the right to let any one have the bow or to
refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the other, not even
though I choose to make the stranger a present of the bow outright,
and let him take it away with him. Go, then, within the house and
busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and
the ordering of your servants. This bow is a man's matter, and
mine above all others, for it is I who am master here."</p>

<p><milestone n="354" unit="line"/>She went wondering back into the
house, and laid her son's saying in her heart. Then going
upstairs with her handmaids into her room, she mourned her dear
husband till Athena sent sweet sleep over her eyelids.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="359">
<p><milestone n="359" unit="line"/>The swineherd now took up the bow
and was for taking it to Odysseus, but the suitors clamored at him
from all parts of the cloisters, and one of them said, "You idiot,
where are you taking the bow to? Are you out of your wits? If Apollo
and the other gods will answer our prayer, your own boarhounds shall
get you into some quiet little place, and worry you to
death."</p>

<p><milestone n="366" unit="line"/>Eumaios was frightened at the
outcry they all raised, so he put the bow down then and there, but
Telemakhos shouted out at him from the other side of the cloisters,
and threatened him saying, "Father Eumaios, bring the bow on in spite
of them, or young as I am I will pelt you with stones back to the
country, for I am the stronger [<term lang="xgreek">bi&ecirc;</term>] man of the
two. I wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the
house as I am than you, I would soon send some of them off sick and
sorry, for they mean mischief."</p>

<p><milestone n="376" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak, and they all
of them laughed heartily, which put them in a better humor with
Telemakhos; so Eumaios brought the bow on and placed it in the hands
of Odysseus. When he had done this, he called Eurykleia apart and
said to her, "Eurykleia, Telemakhos says you are to close the doors
of the women's apartments. If they hear any groaning or uproar
as of men fighting about the house, they are not to come out, but are
to keep quiet and stay where they are at their work."</p>

<p><milestone n="386" unit="line"/>Eurykleia did as she was told and
closed the doors of the women's apartments.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="388">
<p><milestone n="388" unit="line"/>Meanwhile Philoitios slipped
quietly out and made fast the gates of the outer court. There was a
ship's cable of papyrus fiber lying in the gatehouse, so he made
the gates fast with it and then came in again, resuming the seat that
he had left, and keeping an eye on Odysseus, who had now got the bow
in his hands, and was turning it every way about, and proving it all
over to see whether the worms had been eating into its two horns
during his absence. Then would one turn towards his neighbor saying,
"This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either he has got one like it
at home, or he wants to make one, in such workmanlike style does the
old vagabond handle it."</p>

<p><milestone n="401" unit="line"/>Another said, "I hope he may be
no more successful in other things than he is likely to be in
stringing this bow."</p>

<p><milestone n="404" unit="line"/>But Odysseus, when he had taken
it up and examined it all over, strung it as easily as a skilled bard
strings a new peg of his lyre and makes the twisted gut fast at both
ends. Then he took it in his right hand to prove the string, and it
sang sweetly under his touch like the twittering of a swallow. The
suitors were dismayed [<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>], and turned color as
they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Zeus thundered loudly as a
sign [<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>], and the heart of Odysseus rejoiced
as he heard the omen that the son of scheming Kronos had sent
him.</p>

<p><milestone n="416" unit="line"/>He took an arrow that was lying
upon the table - for those which the Achaeans were so shortly about
to taste were all inside the quiver - he laid it on the center-piece
of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow and the string toward
him, still seated on his seat. When he had taken aim he let fly, and
his arrow pierced every one of the handle-holes of the axes from the
first onwards till it had gone right through them, and into the outer
courtyard. Then he said to Telemakhos:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="425">
<p><milestone n="425" unit="line"/>"Your guest has not disgraced
you, Telemakhos. I did not miss what I aimed at, and I was not long
in stringing my bow. I am still strong, and not as the suitors mock
me for being. Now, however, it is time [<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>]
for the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight, and
then otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are
the crowning ornaments of a banquet."</p>

<p><milestone n="431" unit="line"/>As he spoke he made a sign with
his eyebrows, and Telemakhos girded on his sword, grasped his spear,
and stood armed beside his father's seat.
<milestone n="434" unit="line"/></p>
</div2></div1>

<div1 type="Book" n="22">
<head>Scroll 22</head>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Then Odysseus tore off his rags,
and sprang on to the broad pavement with his bow and his quiver full
of arrows. He shed the arrows on to the ground at his feet and said,
"The mighty contest [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>] is at an end. I will now
see whether Apollo will grant it to me to hit another mark which no
man has yet hit."</p>

<p><milestone n="8" unit="line"/>On this he aimed a deadly arrow at
Antinoos, who was about to take up a two-handled gold cup to drink
his wine and already had it in his hands. He had no thought of death
- who amongst all the revelers would think that one man, however
brave, would stand alone among so many and kill him? The arrow struck
Antinoos in the throat, and the point went clean through his neck, so
that he fell over and the cup dropped from his hand, while a thick
stream of blood gushed from his nostrils. He kicked the table from
him and upset the things on it, so that the bread and roasted meats
were all soiled as they fell over on to the ground. The suitors were
in an uproar when they saw that a man had been hit; they sprang in
dismay one and all of them from their seats and looked everywhere
towards the walls, but there was neither shield nor spear, and they
rebuked Odysseus very angrily. "Stranger," said they, "you shall pay
for shooting people in this way: you shall see no other contest
[<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>]; you are a doomed man; he whom you have slain
was the foremost youth in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, and the vultures shall devour you
for having killed him."</p>

<p><milestone n="31" unit="line"/>Thus they spoke, for they thought
that he had killed Antinoos by mistake, and did not perceive that
death was hanging over the head of every one of them. But Odysseus
glared at them and said:</p>

<p><milestone n="35" unit="line"/>"Dogs, did you think that I should
not come back from the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of the Trojans? You have
wasted my substance, have forced my women servants to lie with you,
and have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared
neither the gods nor that there would be future <term lang="xgreek">nemesis</term> from
men, and now you shall die."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="42">
<p><milestone n="42" unit="line"/>They turned pale with fear as he
spoke, and every man looked round about to see whither he might flee
for safety, but Eurymakhos alone spoke.</p>

<p><milestone n="44" unit="line"/>"If you are Odysseus," said he,
"then what you have said is just. We have done much wrong on your
lands and in your house. But Antinoos, who was the head and front of
the offending [<term lang="xgreek">aitios</term>], lies low already. It was all
his doing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so
much care about that; what he wanted was something quite different,
and Zeus has not granted it to him; he wanted to kill your son and to
be chief man in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. Now, therefore, that he has met the death
which was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make
everything good among ourselves in this district
[<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>], and pay you in full for all that we
have eaten and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth
twenty oxen, and we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your
heart is softened. Until we have done this no one can complain of
your being enraged against us."</p>

<p><milestone n="60" unit="line"/>Odysseus again glared at him and
said, "Though you should give me all that you have in the world both
now and all that you ever shall have, I will not stay my hand till I
have paid all of you in full. You must fight, or flee for your lives;
and flee, not a man of you shall."</p>

<p><milestone n="68" unit="line"/>Their hearts sank as they heard
him, but Eurymakhos again spoke saying:</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="70">
<p><milestone n="70" unit="line"/>"My friends, this man will give us
no quarter. He will stand where he is and shoot us down till he has
killed every man among us. Let us then show fight; draw your swords,
and hold up the tables to shield you from his arrows. Let us have at
him with a rush, to drive him from the pavement and doorway: we can
then get through into the town, and raise such an alarm as shall soon
stay his shooting."</p>

<p><milestone n="79" unit="line"/>As he spoke he drew his keen blade
of bronze, sharpened on both sides, and with a loud cry sprang
towards Odysseus, but Odysseus instantly shot an arrow into his
breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself in his liver.
He dropped his sword and fell doubled up over his table. The cup and
all the meats went over on to the ground as he smote the earth with
his forehead in the agonies of death, and he kicked the stool with
his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness.</p>

<p><milestone n="89" unit="line"/>Then Amphinomos drew his sword and
made straight at Odysseus to try and get him away from the door; but
Telemakhos was too quick for him, and struck him from behind; the
spear caught him between the shoulders and went right through his
chest, so that he fell heavily to the ground and struck the earth
with his forehead. Then Telemakhos sprang away from him, leaving his
spear still in the body, for he feared that if he stayed to draw it
out, some one of the Achaeans might come up and hack at him with his
sword, or knock him down, so he set off at a run, and immediately was
at his father's side. Then he said:</p>

<p><milestone n="101" unit="line"/>"Father, let me bring you a
shield, two spears, and a brass helmet for your temples. I will arm
myself as well, and will bring other armor for the swineherd and the
stockman, for we had better be armed."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="105">
<p><milestone n="105" unit="line"/>"Run and fetch them," answered
Odysseus, "while my arrows hold out, or when I am alone they may get
me away from the door."</p>

<p><milestone n="108" unit="line"/>Telemakhos did as his father
said, and went off to the store room where the armor was kept. He
chose four shields, eight spears, and four brass helmets with
horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to his father, and
armed himself first, while the stockman and the swineherd also put on
their armor, and took their places near Odysseus. Meanwhile Odysseus,
as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the suitors one by
one, and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows gave out, he
set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by the door
post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders; on his
comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of
horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped two
redoubtable bronze-shod spears.</p>

<p><milestone n="126" unit="line"/>Now there was a trap door on the
wall, while at one end of the pavement there was an exit leading to a
narrow passage, and this exit was closed by a well-made door.
Odysseus told Philoitios to stand by this door and guard it, for only
one person could attack it at a time. But Agelaos shouted out,
"Cannot some one go up to the trap door and tell the people what is
going on? Help would come at once, and we should soon make an end of
this man and his shooting."</p>

<p><milestone n="135" unit="line"/>"This may not be, Agelaos,"
answered Melanthios, "the mouth of the narrow passage is dangerously
near the entrance to the outer court. One brave man could prevent any
number from getting in. But I know what I will do, I will bring you
arms from the store room, for I am sure it is there that Odysseus and
his son have put them."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="142">
<p><milestone n="142" unit="line"/>On this the goatherd Melanthios
went by back passages to the store room of Odysseus, house. There he
chose twelve shields, with as many helmets and spears, and brought
them back as fast as he could to give them to the suitors.
Odysseus&rsquo; heart began to fail him when he saw the suitors
putting on their armor and brandishing their spears. He saw the
greatness of the danger, and said to Telemakhos, "Some one of the
women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may be
Melanthios."</p>

<p><milestone n="153" unit="line"/>Telemakhos answered, "The fault
[<term lang="xgreek">aitios</term>], father, is mine, and mine only; I left the
store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out than I
have. Go, Eumaios, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the
women who is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthios
the son of Dolios."</p>

<p><milestone n="160" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile
Melanthios was again going to the store room to fetch more armor, but
the swineherd saw him and said to Odysseus who was beside him,
"Odysseus, noble son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, it is that scoundrel Melanthios,
just as we suspected, who is going to the store room. Say, shall I
kill him, if I can get the better of him, or shall I bring him here
that you may take your own revenge for all the many wrongs that he
has done in your house?"</p>

<p><milestone n="170" unit="line"/>Odysseus answered, "Telemakhos
and I will hold these suitors in check, no matter what they do; go
back both of you and bind Melanthios&rsquo; hands and feet behind him.
Throw him into the store room and make the door fast behind you; then
fasten a noose about his body, and string him close up to the rafters
from a high bearing-post, that he may linger on in an
agony."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="178">
<p><milestone n="178" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak, and they did
even as he had said; they went to the store room, which they entered
before Melanthios saw them, for he was busy searching for arms in the
innermost part of the room, so the two took their stand on either
side of the door and waited. By and by Melanthios came out with a
helmet in one hand, and an old dry-rotted shield in the other, which
had been borne by <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> when he was young, but which had been long
since thrown aside, and the straps had become unsewn; on this the two
seized him, dragged him back by the hair, and threw him struggling to
the ground. They bent his hands and feet well behind his back, and
bound them tight with a painful bond as Odysseus had told them; then
they fastened a noose about his body and strung him up from a high
pillar till he was close up to the rafters, and over him did you then
vaunt, O swineherd Eumaios, saying, "Melanthios, you will pass the
night on a soft bed as you deserve. You will know very well when
morning comes from the streams of Okeanos, and it is time for you to
be driving in your goats for the suitors to feast on."</p>

<p><milestone n="200" unit="line"/>There, then, they left him in
very cruel bondage, and having put on their armor they closed the
door behind them and went back to take their places by the side of
Odysseus; whereon the four men stood in the room, fierce and full of
fury; nevertheless, those who were in the body of the court were
still both brave and many. Then Zeus&rsquo; daughter Athena came up to
them, having assumed the voice and form of Mentor. Odysseus was glad
when he saw her and said, "Mentor, lend me your help, and forget not
your old comrade, nor the many good turns he has done you. Besides,
you are my age-mate."</p>

<p><milestone n="210" unit="line"/>But all the time he felt sure it
was Athena, and the suitors from the other side raised an uproar when
they saw her. Agelaos was the first to reproach her. "Mentor," he
cried, "do not let Odysseus beguile you into siding with him and
fighting the suitors. This is what will be our plan
[<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>]: when we have killed these people, father and
son, we will kill you too. You shall pay for it with your head, and
when we have killed you, we will take all you have, in doors or out,
and merge it with Odysseus&rsquo; property; we will not let your sons
live in your house, nor your daughters, nor shall your widow continue
to live in the city of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>."</p>

<p><milestone n="224" unit="line"/>This made Athena still more
furious, so she scolded Odysseus very angrily. "Odysseus," said she,
"your strength and prowess are no longer what they were when you
fought for nine long years among the Trojans about the noble lady
Helen. You killed many a man in those days, and it was through your
stratagem that Priam's city was taken. How comes it that you are
so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your own ground, face
to face with the suitors in your own house? Come on, my good fellow,
stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of Alkinoos shall fight your
foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="236">
<p><milestone n="236" unit="line"/>But she would not give him full
victory as yet, for she wished still further to prove his own prowess
and that of his brave son, so she flew up to one of the rafters in
the roof of the room and sat upon it in the form of a
swallow.</p>

<p><milestone n="241" unit="line"/>Meanwhile Agelaos son of
Damastor, Eurynomos, Amphimedon, Demoptolemos, Peisandros, and
Polybos son of Polyktor bore the brunt of the fight upon the
suitors&rsquo; side; of all those who were still fighting for their
lives [<term lang="xgreek">psukhai</term>], they were by far the most excellent
in <term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>, for the others had already fallen under the
arrows of Odysseus. Agelaos shouted to them and said, "My friends, he
will soon have to leave off, for Mentor has gone away after having
done nothing for him but brag. They are standing at the doors
unsupported. Do not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw your
spears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory by
killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the
others."</p>

<p><milestone n="255" unit="line"/>They threw their spears as he
bade them, but Athena made them all of no effect. One hit the door
post; another went against the door; the pointed shaft of another
struck the wall; and as soon as they had avoided all the spears of
the suitors Odysseus said to his own men, "My friends, I should say
we too had better let drive into the middle of them, or they will
crown all the harm they have done us by killing us
outright."</p>

<p><milestone n="265" unit="line"/>They therefore aimed straight in
front of them and threw their spears. Odysseus killed Demoptolemos,
Telemakhos Euryades, Eumaios Elatus, while the stockman killed
Peisandros. These all bit the dust, and as the others drew back into
a corner Odysseus and his men rushed forward and regained their
spears by drawing them from the bodies of the dead.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="272">
<p><milestone n="272" unit="line"/>The suitors now aimed a second
time, but again Athena made their weapons for the most part without
effect. One hit a bearing-post of the room; another went against the
door; while the pointed shaft of another struck the wall. Still,
Amphimedon just took a piece of the top skin from off
Telemakhos&rsquo; wrist, and Ktesippos managed to graze Eumaios&rsquo;
shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell to the
ground. Then Odysseus and his men let drive into the crowd of
suitors. Odysseus hit Eurydamas, Telemakhos Amphimedon, and Eumaios
Polybos. After this the stockman hit Ktesippos in the breast, and
taunted him saying, "Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, do not be so
foolish as to talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your
speech, for the gods are far stronger than men. I make you a present
of this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Odysseus when
he was begging about in his own house."</p>

<p><milestone n="292" unit="line"/>Thus spoke the stockman, and
Odysseus struck the son of Damastor with a spear in close fight,
while Telemakhos hit Leiokritos son of Euenor in the belly, and the
dart went clean through him, so that he fell forward full on his face
upon the ground. Then Athena from her seat on the rafter held up her
deadly aegis, and the hearts of the suitors quailed. They fled to the
other end of the court like a herd of cattle maddened by the gadfly
in early summer [<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>] when the days are at
their longest. As eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the
mountains swoop down on the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon
the ground, and kill them, for they cannot either fight or flee, and
lookers on enjoy the sport - even so did Odysseus and his men fall
upon the suitors and smite them on every side. They made a horrible
groaning as their brains were being battered in, and the ground
seethed with their blood.</p>

<p><milestone n="310" unit="line"/>Leiodes then caught the knees of
Odysseus and said, "Odysseus I beseech you have mercy upon me and
spare me. I never wronged any of the women in your house either in
word or deed, and I tried to stop the others. I saw them, but they
would not listen, and now they are paying for their folly. I was
their sacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall die without having
done anything to deserve it, and shall have got no thanks
[<term lang="xgreek">kharis</term>] for all the good that I did."</p>

<p><milestone n="320" unit="line"/>Odysseus looked sternly at him
and answered, "If you were their sacrificing priest, you must have
prayed many a time that it might be long before I got home again
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>], and that you might marry my wife and have
children by her. Therefore you shall die."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="326">
<p><milestone n="326" unit="line"/>With these words he picked up the
sword that Agelaos had dropped when he was being killed, and which
was lying upon the ground. Then he struck Leiodes on the back of his
neck, so that his head fell rolling in the dust while he was yet
speaking.</p>

<p><milestone n="330" unit="line"/>The minstrel Phemios son of
Terpes - he who had been forced by the suitors to sing to them - now
tried to save his life. He was standing near towards the trap door,
and held his lyre in his hand. He did not know whether to flee out of
the room and sit down by the altar of Zeus that was in the outer
court, and on which both <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> and Odysseus had offered up the
thigh bones of many an ox, or whether to go straight up to Odysseus
and embrace his knees, but in the end he deemed it best to embrace
Odysseus&rsquo; knees. So he laid his lyre on the ground the ground
between the mixing-bowl and the silver-studded seat; then going up to
Odysseus he caught hold of his knees and said, "Odysseus, I beseech
you have mercy on me and spare me. You will be sorry
[<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>] for it afterwards if you kill a bard who can
sing both for gods and men as I can. I make all my lays myself, and
heaven visits me with every kind of inspiration. I would sing to you
as though you were a god, do not therefore be in such a hurry to cut
my head off. Your own son Telemakhos will tell you that I did not
want to frequent your house and sing to the suitors after their
meals, but they were too many and too strong for me, so they made
me."</p>

<p><milestone n="354" unit="line"/>Telemakhos heard him, and at once
went up to his father. "Hold!" he cried, "the man is guiltless, do
him no hurt; and we will spare Medon too, who was always good to me
when I was a boy, unless Philoitios or Eumaios has already killed
him, or he has fallen in your way when you were raging about the
court."</p>

<p><milestone n="361" unit="line"/>Medon caught these words of
Telemakhos, for he was crouching under a seat beneath which he had
hidden by covering himself up with a freshly flayed heifer's
hide, so he threw off the hide, went up to Telemakhos, and laid hold
of his knees.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="367">
<p><milestone n="367" unit="line"/>"Here I am, my dear sir," said
he, "stay your hand therefore, and tell your father, or he will kill
me in his rage against the suitors for having wasted his substance
and been so foolishly disrespectful to yourself."</p>

<p><milestone n="371" unit="line"/>Odysseus smiled at him and
answered, "Fear not; Telemakhos has saved your life, that you may
know in future, and tell other people, how greatly better good deeds
prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore, outside the cloisters into the
outer court, and be out of the way of the slaughter - you and the
bard - while I finish my work here inside."</p>

<p><milestone n="378" unit="line"/>The pair went into the outer
court as fast as they could, and sat down by Zeus&rsquo; great altar,
looking fearfully round, and still expecting that they would be
killed. Then Odysseus searched the whole court carefully over, to see
if anyone had managed to hide himself and was still living, but he
found them all lying in the dust and weltering in their blood. They
were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of the sea, and
thrown upon the beach to lie gasping for water till the heat of the
sun makes an end of them. Even so were the suitors lying all huddled
up one against the other.</p>

<p><milestone n="390" unit="line"/>Then Odysseus said to Telemakhos,
"Call nurse Eurykleia; I have something to say to her."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="393">
<p><milestone n="393" unit="line"/>Telemakhos went and knocked at
the door of the women's room. "Make haste," said he, "you old
woman who have been set over all the other women in the house. Come
outside; my father wishes to speak to you."</p>

<p><milestone n="398" unit="line"/>When Eurykleia heard this she
unfastened the door of the women's room and came out, following
Telemakhos. She found Odysseus among the corpses bespattered with
blood and filth like a lion that has just been devouring an ox, and
his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so that he is a
fearful sight; even so was Odysseus besmirched from head to foot with
gore. When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of blood, she
was beginning to cry out for joy, for she saw that a great deed had
been done; but Odysseus checked her, "Old woman," said he, "rejoice
in silence; restrain yourself, and do not make any noise about it; it
is an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men. Heaven's doom and
their own evil deeds have brought these men to destruction, for they
respected no man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, who came
near them, and they have come to a bad end as a punishment for their
wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me which of the women in the
house have misconducted themselves, and who are innocent."</p>

<p><milestone n="419" unit="line"/>"I will tell you the truth
[<term lang="xgreek">al&ecirc;theia</term>], my son," answered Eurykleia. "There
are fifty women in the house whom we teach to do things, such as
carding wool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in
all have misbehaved, and have been wanting in respect to me, and also
to Penelope. They showed no disrespect to Telemakhos, for he has only
lately grown and his mother never permitted him to give orders to the
female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife all that
has happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep."</p>

<p><milestone n="430" unit="line"/>"Do not wake her yet," answered
Odysseus, "but tell the women who have misconducted themselves to
come to me."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="431">
<p><milestone n="431" unit="line"/>Eurykleia left the room to tell
the women, and make them come to Odysseus; in the meantime he called
Telemakhos, the stockman, and the swineherd. "Begin," said he, "to
remove the dead, and make the women help you. Then, get sponges and
clean water to swill down the tables and seats. When you have
thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters, take the women into the
space between the domed room and the wall of the outer court, and run
them through with your swords till they are quite dead, and have
forgotten all about love and the way in which they used to lie in
secret with the suitors."</p>

<p><milestone n="446" unit="line"/>On this the women came down in a
body, weeping and wailing bitterly. First they carried the dead
bodies out, and propped them up against one another in the gatehouse.
Odysseus ordered them about and made them do their work quickly, so
they had to carry the bodies out. When they had done this, they
cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges and water, while
Telemakhos and the two others shoveled up the blood and dirt from the
ground, and the women carried it all away and put it out of doors.
Then when they had made the whole place quite clean and orderly, they
took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space between the
wall of the domed room and that of the yard, so that they could not
get away: and Telemakhos said to the other two, "I shall not let
these women die a clean death, for they were insolent to me and my
mother, and used to sleep with the suitors."</p>

<p><milestone n="465" unit="line"/>So saying he made a ship's
cable fast to one of the bearing-posts that supported the roof of the
domed room, and secured it all around the building, at a good height,
lest any of the women's feet should touch the ground; and as
thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been set for them in a
thicket just as they were getting to their nest, and a terrible fate
awaits them, even so did the women have to put their heads in nooses
one after the other and die most miserably. Their feet moved
convulsively for a while, but not for very long.</p>

<p><milestone n="474" unit="line"/>As for Melanthios, they took him
through the room into the inner court. There they cut off his nose
and his ears; they drew out his vitals and gave them to the dogs raw,
and then in their fury they cut off his hands and his
feet.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="478">
<p><milestone n="478" unit="line"/>When they had done this they
washed their hands and feet and went back into the house, for all was
now over; and Odysseus said to the dear old nurse Eurykleia, "Bring
me sulfur, which cleanses all pollution, and fetch fire also that I
may burn it, and purify the cloisters. Go, moreover, and tell
Penelope to come here with her attendants, and also all the maid
servants that are in the house."</p>

<p><milestone n="485" unit="line"/>"All that you have said is true,"
answered Eurykleia, "but let me bring you some clean clothes - a
shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags on your back any longer. It
is not right."</p>

<p><milestone n="490" unit="line"/>"First light me a fire," replied
Odysseus.</p>

<p><milestone n="492" unit="line"/>She brought the fire and sulfur,
as he had bidden her, and Odysseus thoroughly purified the cloisters
and both the inner and outer courts. Then she went inside to call the
women and tell them what had happened; whereon they came from their
apartment with torches in their hands, and pressed round Odysseus to
embrace him, kissing his head and shoulders and taking hold of his
hands. It made him feel as if he should like to weep, for he
remembered every one of them. <milestone n="501" unit="line"/></p>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Eurykleia now went upstairs
laughing to tell her mistress that her dear husband had come home.
Her aged knees became young again and her feet were nimble for joy as
she went up to her mistress and bent over her head to speak to her.
"Wake up Penelope, my dear child," she exclaimed, "and see with your
own eyes something that you have been wanting this long time past.
Odysseus has at last indeed come home again, and has killed the
suitors who were giving so much trouble in his house, eating up his
estate and ill-treating his son."</p>

<p><milestone n="10" unit="line"/>"My good nurse," answered
Penelope, "you must be mad. The gods sometimes send some very
sensible people out of their minds, and make foolish people become
sensible. This is what they must have been doing to you; for you
always used to be a reasonable person. Why should you thus mock me
when I have trouble enough already - talking such nonsense, and
waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of my
eyes and closed them? I have never slept so soundly from the day my
poor husband went to that city with the ill-omened name. Go back
again into the women's room; if it had been any one else, who
had woke me up to bring me such absurd news I should have sent her
away with a severe scolding. As it is, your age shall protect
you."</p>

<p><milestone n="25" unit="line"/>"My dear child," answered
Eurykleia, "I am not mocking you. It is quite true as I tell you that
Odysseus is come home again. He was the stranger whom they all kept
on treating so badly in the room. Telemakhos knew all the time that
he was come back, but kept his father's secret that he might
have his revenge on all these wicked people.</p>

<p><milestone n="32" unit="line"/>Then Penelope sprang up from her
couch, threw her arms round Eurykleia, and wept for joy. "But my dear
nurse," said she, "explain this to me; if he has really come home as
you say, how did he manage to overcome the wicked suitors single
handed, seeing what a number of them there always were?"</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="39">
<p><milestone n="39" unit="line"/>"I was not there," answered
Eurykleia, "and do not know; I only heard them groaning while they
were being killed. We sat crouching and huddled up in a corner of the
women's room with the doors closed, till your son came to fetch
me because his father sent him. Then I found Odysseus standing over
the corpses that were lying on the ground all round him, one on top
of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you could have seen him
standing there all bespattered with blood and filth, and looking just
like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled up in the gatehouse
that is in the outer court, and Odysseus has lit a great fire to
purify the house with sulfur. He has sent me to call you, so come
with me that you may both be happy together after all; for now at
last the desire of your heart has been fulfilled; your husband is
come home to find both wife and son alive and well, and to take his
revenge in his own house on the suitors who behaved so badly to
him."</p>

<p><milestone n="58" unit="line"/>"&lsquo;My dear nurse," said
Penelope, "do not exult too confidently over all this. You know how
delighted every one would be to see Odysseus come home - more
particularly myself, and the son who has been born to both of us; but
what you tell me cannot be really true. It is some god who is angry
with the suitors for their great wickedness [<term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>],
and has made an end of them; for they respected no man in the whole
world, neither rich nor poor, who came near them, who came near them,
and they have come to a bad end in consequence of their iniquity.
Odysseus is dead far away from the Achaean land; he will never return
home again [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>]."</p>

<p><milestone n="69" unit="line"/>Then nurse Eurykleia said, "My
child, what are you talking about? But you were all hard of belief
and have made up your mind that your husband is never coming,
although he is in the house and by his own fire side at this very
moment. Besides I can give you another proof
[<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>]; when I was washing him I perceived the
scar which the wild boar gave him, and I wanted to tell you about it,
but in his wisdom [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] he would not let me, and
clapped his hands over my mouth; so come with me and I will make this
bargain with you - if I am deceiving you, you may have me killed by
the cruelest death you can think of."</p>

<p><milestone n="80" unit="line"/>"My dear nurse," said Penelope,
"however wise you may be you can hardly fathom the counsels of the
gods. Nevertheless, we will go in search of my son, that I may see
the corpses of the suitors, and the man who has killed
them."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="85">
<p><milestone n="85" unit="line"/>On this she came down from her
upper room, and while doing so she considered whether she should keep
at a distance from her husband and question him, or whether she
should at once go up to him and embrace him. When, however, she had
crossed the stone floor of the room, she sat down opposite Odysseus
by the fire, against the wall at right angles to that by which she
had entered, while Odysseus sat near one of the bearing-posts,
looking upon the ground, and waiting to see what his wife would say
to him when she saw him. For a long time she sat silent and as one
lost in amazement. At one moment she looked him full in the face, but
then again directly, she was misled by his shabby clothes and failed
to recognize him, till Telemakhos began to reproach her and
said:</p>

<p><milestone n="97" unit="line"/>"Mother - but you are so hard that
I cannot call you by such a name - why do you keep away from my
father in this way? Why do you not sit by his side and begin talking
to him and asking him questions? No other woman could bear to keep
away from her husband when he had come back to her after twenty years
of absence, and after having gone through so much; but your heart
always was as hard as a stone."</p>

<p><milestone n="104" unit="line"/>Penelope answered, "My son, I am
so lost in astonishment that I can find no words in which either to
ask questions or to answer them. I cannot even look him straight in
the face. Still, if he really is Odysseus come back to his own home
again, we shall get to understand one another better by and by, for
there are tokens [<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;mata</term>] with which we two are
alone acquainted, and which are hidden from all others."</p>

<p><milestone n="111" unit="line"/>Odysseus smiled at this, and said
to Telemakhos, "Let your mother put me to any proof she likes; she
will make up her mind about it presently. She rejects me for the
moment and believes me to be somebody else, because I am covered with
dirt and have such bad clothes on; let us, however, consider what we
had better do next. When one man has killed another in a
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term>, even though he was not one who would leave many
friends to take up his quarrel, the man who has killed him must still
say good bye to his friends and flee the country; whereas we have
been killing the stay of a whole city, and all the picked youth of
<placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. I would have you consider this matter."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="123">
<p><milestone n="123" unit="line"/>"Look to it yourself, father,"
answered Telemakhos, "for they say you are the wisest counselor in
the world, and that there is no other mortal man who can compare with
you. We will follow you with right good will, nor shall you find us
fail you in so far as our strength holds out."</p>

<p><milestone n="129" unit="line"/>"I will say what I think will be
best," answered Odysseus. "First wash and put your shirts on; tell
the maids also to go to their own room and dress; Phemios shall then
strike up a dance tune on his lyre, so that if people outside hear,
or any of the neighbors, or some one going along the street happens
to notice it, they may think there is a wedding in the house, and no
rumors [<term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>] about the death of the suitors will get
about in the town, before we can escape to the woods upon my own
land. Once there, we will settle which of the courses of action
[<term lang="xgreek">kerdos</term>] heaven grants us shall seem
wisest."</p>

<p><milestone n="141" unit="line"/>Thus did he speak, and they did
even as he had said. First they washed and put their shirts on, while
the women got ready. Then Phemios took his lyre and set them all
longing for sweet song and stately dance. The house re-echoed with
the sound of men and women dancing, and the people outside said, "I
suppose the queen has been getting married at last. She ought to be
ashamed of herself for not continuing to protect her husband's
property until he comes home."</p>

<p><milestone n="152" unit="line"/>This was what they said, but they
did not know what it was that had been happening. The upper servant
Eurynome washed and anointed Odysseus in his own house and gave him a
shirt and cloak, while Athena made him look taller and stronger than
before; she also made the hair grow thick on the top of his head, and
flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she shed <term lang="xgreek">kharis</term>
about his head and shoulders just as a skillful workman who has
studied art of all kinds under Hephaistos or Athena - and his work is
full of <term lang="xgreek">kharis</term> - enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding
it. He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals, and sat
down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. "My dear," said he,
"heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever
yet had. No other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when
he had come back to her after twenty years of absence, and after
having gone through so much. But come, nurse, get a bed ready for me;
I will sleep alone, for this woman has a heart as hard as
iron."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="173">
<p><milestone n="173" unit="line"/>"My dear," answered Penelope, "I
have no wish to set myself up, nor to depreciate you; but I am not
struck by your appearance, for I very well remember what kind of a
man you were when you set sail from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. Nevertheless, Eurykleia,
take his bed outside the bed chamber that he himself built. Bring the
bed outside this room, and put bedding upon it with fleeces, good
coverlets, and blankets."</p>

<p><milestone n="181" unit="line"/>She said this to try him, but
Odysseus was very angry and said, "Wife, I am much displeased at what
you have just been saying. Who has been taking my bed from the place
in which I left it? He must have found it a hard task, no matter how
skilled a workman he was, unless some god came and helped him to
shift it. There is no man living, however strong and in his prime,
who could move it from its place. For it was wrought to be a great
sign [<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>]; it is a marvelous curiosity which I
made with my very own hands. There was a young olive growing within
the precincts of the house, in full vigor, and about as thick as a
bearing-post. I built my room round this with strong walls of stone
and a roof to cover them, and I made the doors strong and
well-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive tree and
left the stump standing. This I dressed roughly from the root upwards
and then worked with carpenter's tools well and skillfully,
straightening my work by drawing a line on the wood, and making it
into a bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the middle, and made it the
center-post of my bed, at which I worked till I had finished it,
inlaying it with gold and silver; after this I stretched a hide of
crimson leather from one side of it to the other. So you see I know
all about this sign [<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>], and I desire to
learn whether it is still there, or whether any one has been removing
it by cutting down the olive tree at its roots."</p>

<p><milestone n="205" unit="line"/>When she heard the sure proofs
[<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;mata</term>] Odysseus now gave her, she fairly broke
down. She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his neck,
and kissed him. "Do not be angry with me Odysseus," she cried, "you,
who are the wisest of humankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven
has denied us the happiness of spending our youth, and of growing
old, together; do not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did
not embrace you thus as soon as I saw you. I have been shuddering all
the time through fear that someone might come here and deceive me
with a lying story; for there are many people who plan wicked schemes
[<term lang="xgreek">kerdea</term>]. Zeus&rsquo; daughter Helen would never have
yielded herself to a man from a foreign country, if she had known
that the sons of Achaeans would come after her and bring her back.
Heaven put it in her heart to do wrong, and she gave no thought to
that transgression [<term lang="xgreek">at&ecirc;</term>], which has been the
source of all our sorrows [<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>]. Now, however,
that you have convinced me by showing that you know all the proofs
[<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;mata</term>] of our bed (which no human being has
ever seen but you and I and a single maid servant, the daughter of
Aktor, who was given me by my father on my marriage, and who keeps
the doors of our room), hard of belief though I have been, I can
mistrust no longer."</p>

<p><milestone n="231" unit="line"/>Then Odysseus in his turn melted,
and wept as he clasped his dear and faithful wife to his bosom. As
the sight of land is welcome to men who are swimming towards the
shore, when Poseidon has wrecked their ship with the fury of his
winds and waves - a few alone reach the land, and these, covered with
brine, are thankful when they find themselves on firm ground and out
of danger - even so was her husband welcome to her as she looked upon
him, and she could not tear her two fair arms from about his neck.
Indeed they would have gone on indulging their sorrow till
rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not Athena determined otherwise, and
held night back in the far west, while she would not suffer Dawn to
leave Okeanos, nor to yoke the two steeds Lampos and Phaethon that
bear her onward to break the day upon humankind.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="246">
<p><milestone n="246" unit="line"/>At last, however, Odysseus said,
"Wife, we have not yet reached the end of our trials
[<term lang="xgreek">athloi</term>]. I have an unknown amount of toil
[<term lang="xgreek">ponos</term>] still to undergo. It is long and difficult,
but I must go through with it, for thus the shade
[<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of Teiresias prophesied concerning me,
on the day when I went down into Hades to ask about my return
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] and that of my companions. But now let us go
to bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of
sleep."</p>

<p><milestone n="256" unit="line"/>"You shall go to bed as soon as
you please," replied Penelope, "now that the gods have sent you home
to your own good house and to your country. But as heaven has put it
in your mind to speak of it, tell me about the task
[<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>] that lies before you. I shall have to hear
about it later, so it is better that I should be told at
once."</p>

<p><milestone n="263" unit="line"/>"My dear," answered Odysseus,
"why should you press me to tell you? Still, I will not conceal it
from you, though you will not like it. I do not like it myself, for
Teiresias bade me travel far and wide, carrying an oar, till I came
to a country where the people have never heard of the sea, and do not
even mix salt with their food. They know nothing about ships, nor
oars that are as the wings of a ship. He gave me this certain token
[<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>] which I will not hide from you. He said
that a wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing
shovel that I had on my shoulder. On this, I was to fix my oar in the
ground and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar to Poseidon; after
which I was to go home and offer hecatombs to all the gods in heaven,
one after the other. As for myself, he said that death should come to
me from the sea, and that my life should ebb away very gently when I
was full of years and peace of mind, and my people should be
prosperous [<term lang="xgreek">olbios</term>]. All this, he said, should surely
come to pass."</p>

<p><milestone n="286" unit="line"/>And Penelope said, "If the gods
are going to grant you a happier time in your old age, you may hope
then to have some respite from misfortune."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="288">
<p><milestone n="288" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile
Eurynome and the nurse took torches and made the bed ready with soft
coverlets; as soon as they had laid them, the nurse went back into
the house to go to her rest, leaving the bed chamber woman Eurynome
to show Odysseus and Penelope to bed by torch light. When she had
conducted them to their room she went back, and they then came
joyfully to the rites of their own old bed. Telemakhos, Philoitios,
and the swineherd now left off dancing, and made the women leave off
also. They then laid themselves down to sleep in the
cloisters.</p>

<p><milestone n="300" unit="line"/>When Odysseus and Penelope had
had their fill of love they fell talking with one another. She told
him how much she had to bear in seeing the house filled with a crowd
of wicked suitors who had killed so many sheep and oxen on her
account, and had drunk so many casks of wine. Odysseus in his turn
told her what he had suffered, and how much trouble he had himself
given to other people. He told her everything, and she was so
delighted to listen that she never went to sleep till he had ended
his whole story.</p>

<p><milestone n="310" unit="line"/>He began with his victory over
the Kikones, and how he thence reached the fertile land of the
Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the <placeName key="tgn,2236678">Cyclops</placeName> and how he had
punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave comrades; how
he then went on to Aeolus, who received him hospitably and furthered
him on his way, but even so he was not to reach home, for to his
great grief a gale carried him out to sea again; how he went on to
the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where the people destroyed all his
ships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only. Then he
told of cunning Circe and her craft, and how he sailed to the chill
house of Hades, to consult the ghost [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of
the Theban seer Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms,
and his mother who bore him and brought him up when he was a child;
how he then heard the wondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on to
the wandering rocks and terrible Charybdis and to Scylla, whom no man
had ever yet passed in safety; how his men then ate the cattle of the
sun-god, and how Zeus therefore struck the ship with his
thunderbolts, so that all his men perished together, himself alone
being left alive; how at last he reached the Ogygian island and the
nymph Calypso, who kept him there in a cave, and fed him, and wanted
him to marry her, in which case she intended making him immortal so
that he should never grow old, but she could not persuade him to let
her do so; and how after much suffering he had found his way to the
Phaeacians, who had treated him as though he had been a god, and sent
him back in a ship to his own country after having given him gold,
bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was the last thing about
which he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold upon him and eased
the burden of his sorrows.</p>

<p><milestone n="344" unit="line"/>Then Athena thought of another
matter. When she deemed that Odysseus had had enough both of his wife
and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned Dawn rise out of Okeanos that
she might shed light upon humankind. On this, Odysseus rose from his
comfortable bed and said to Penelope, "Wife, we have both of us had
our full share of trials [<term lang="xgreek">athlos</term>], you, here, in
lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home
[<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>] though I was longing all the time to do so.
Now, however, that we have at last come together, take care of the
property that is in the house. As for the sheep and goats which the
wicked suitors have eaten, I will take many myself by force from
other people, and will compel the Achaeans to make good the rest till
they shall have filled all my yards. I am now going to the wooded
lands out in the country to see my father who has so long been
grieved on my account, and to yourself I will give these
instructions, though you have little need of them. At sunrise it will
at once get abroad that I have been killing the suitors; go upstairs,
therefore, and stay there with your women. See nobody and ask no
questions."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="366">
<p><milestone n="366" unit="line"/>As he spoke he girded on his
armor. Then he roused Telemakhos, Philoitios, and Eumaios, and told
them all to put on their armor also. This they did, and armed
themselves. When they had done so, they opened the gates and sallied
forth, Odysseus leading the way. It was now daylight, but Athena
nevertheless concealed them in darkness and led them quickly out of
the town. <milestone n="372" unit="line"/></p>

<div2 type="card" n="1">
<p><milestone n="1" unit="line"/>Then Hermes of Cyllene summoned the
ghosts [<term lang="xgreek">psukhai</term>] of the suitors, and in his hand he
held the fair golden wand with which he seals men's eyes in
sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the
ghosts and led them, while they followed whining and gibbering behind
him. As bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave, when one
of them has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even so did
the ghosts whine and squeal as Hermes the healer of sorrow led them
down into the dark abode of death. When they had passed the waters of
Okeanos and the rock <placeName key="tgn,7002712">Leukas</placeName>, they came to the gates of the sun and
the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of
asphodel where dwell the souls and shadows of them that can labor no
more.</p>

<p><milestone n="15" unit="line"/>Here they found the ghost
[<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of Achilles son of Peleus, with those
of Patroklos, Antilokhos, and Ajax, who was the finest and handsomest
man of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.</p>

<p><milestone n="19" unit="line"/>They gathered round the ghost of
the son of Peleus, and the ghost [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of
Agamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered
also the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of
Aigisthos; and the ghost [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of Achilles
spoke first.</p>

<p><milestone n="24" unit="line"/>"Son of Atreus," it said, "we used
to say that Zeus had loved you better from first to last than any
other hero, for you were leader over many and brave men, when we were
all fighting together in the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of the Trojans; yet
the hand of death, which no mortal can escape, was laid upon you all
too early. Better for you had you fallen in the Trojan
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> in the hey-day of your renown, for the Achaeans
would have built a mound over your ashes, and your son would have
been heir to your <term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>, whereas it has now been your lot to
come to a most miserable end."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="35">
<p><milestone n="35" unit="line"/>"Happy [<term lang="xgreek">olbios</term>] son
of Peleus," answered the ghost [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of
Agamemnon, "for having died at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> far from <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, while the bravest
of the Trojans and the Achaeans fell round you fighting for your
body. There you lay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and
hugely, heedless now of your chivalry. We fought the whole of the
livelong day, nor should we ever have left off if Zeus had not sent a
gale to stay us. Then, when we had borne you to the ships out of the
fray, we laid you on your bed and cleansed your fair skin with warm
water and with ointments. The Danaans tore their hair and wept
bitterly round about you. Your mother, when she heard, came with her
immortal nymphs from out of the sea, and the sound of a great wailing
went forth over the waters so that the Achaeans quaked for fear. They
would have fled panic-stricken to their ships had not wise old Nestor
whose counsel was ever truest checked them saying, &lsquo;Hold,
Argives, flee not sons of the Achaeans, this is his mother coming
from the sea with her immortal nymphs to view the body of her
son.&rsquo;</p>

<p><milestone n="57" unit="line"/>"Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans
feared no more. The daughters of the old man of the sea stood round
you weeping bitterly, and clothed you in immortal raiment. The nine
muses also came and lifted up their sweet voices in lament - calling
and answering one another; there was not an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> but wept for pity
of the dirge they chanted. Days and nights seven and ten we mourned
you, mortals and immortals, but on the eighteenth day we gave you to
the flames, and many a fat sheep with many an ox did we slay in
sacrifice around you. You were burnt in raiment of the gods, with
rich resins and with honey, while heroes, horse and foot, clashed
their armor round the pile as you were burning, with the tramp as of
a great multitude. But when the flames of heaven had done their work,
we gathered your white bones at daybreak and laid them in ointments
and in pure wine. Your mother brought us a golden vase to hold them -
gift of Bacchus, and work of Hephaistos himself; in this we mingled
your bleached bones with those of Patroklos who had gone before you,
and separate we enclosed also those of Antilokhos, who had been
closer to you than any other of your comrades now that Patroklos was
no more.</p>

<p><milestone n="80" unit="line"/>"Over these the host of the
Argives built a noble tomb, on a point jutting out over the open
<placeName key="tgn,7002638">Hellespont</placeName>, that it might be seen from far out upon the sea by those
now living and by them that shall be born hereafter. Your mother
begged prizes from the gods, and offered them to be contended for
[<term lang="xgreek">ag&ocirc;n</term>] by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must
have been present at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men
gird themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of
some great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed
Thetis offered in your honor; for the gods loved you well. Thus even
in death your <term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>, Achilles, has not been lost, and your
name lives evermore among all humankind. But as for me, what solace
had I when the days of my fighting were done? For Zeus willed my
destruction on my return [<term lang="xgreek">nostos</term>], by the hands of
Aigisthos and those of my wicked wife."</p>

<p><milestone n="98" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse, and
presently Hermes came up to them with the ghosts of the suitors who
had been killed by Odysseus. The ghosts [<term lang="xgreek">psukhai</term>] of
Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up to
them at once. The ghost [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of Agamemnon
recognized Amphimedon son of Melaneus, who lived in <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> and had
been his host, so it began to talk to him.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="106">
<p><milestone n="106" unit="line"/>"Amphimedon," it said, "what has
happened to all you choice [<term lang="xgreek">kr&icirc;n&ocirc;</term>] young
men - all of an age too - that you are come down here under the
ground? One could select [<term lang="xgreek">kr&icirc;n&ocirc;</term>] no finer
body of men from any city. Did Poseidon raise his winds and waves
against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end of
you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing,
or while fighting in defense of their wives and city? Answer my
question, for I have been your guest. Do you not remember how I came
to your house with Menelaos, to persuade Odysseus to join us with his
ships against <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>? It was a whole month ere we could resume our
voyage, for we had hard work to persuade Odysseus to come with
us."</p>

<p><milestone n="120" unit="line"/>And the ghost
[<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of Amphimedon answered, "Agamemnon, son
of Atreus, king of men, I remember everything that you have said, and
will tell you fully and accurately about the way in which our end was
brought about. Odysseus had been long gone, and we were courting his
wife, who did not say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet
bring matters to an end, for she meant to compass our destruction:
this, then, was the trick she played us. She set up a great tambour
frame in her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine
needlework. &lsquo;Sweethearts,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;Odysseus is
indeed dead, still, do not press me to marry again immediately; wait
- for I would not have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded -
till I have completed a shroud for the hero <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, against the time
when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the
<term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> will talk if he is laid out without a
shroud.&rsquo; This is what she said, and we assented; whereupon we
could see her working upon her great web all day long, but at night
she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in
this way for three years without our finding it out, but as time
[<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;ra</term>] wore on and she was now in her fourth
year, and the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished,
one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and we caught
her in the act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it whether
she would or not; and when she showed us the robe she had made, after
she had had it washed, its splendor was as that of the sun or
moon.</p>

<p><milestone n="149" unit="line"/>"Then some malicious
<term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> conveyed Odysseus to the upland farm where his
swineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning from
a voyage to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName>, and the two came to the town when they had hatched
their plot for our destruction. Telemakhos came first, and then after
him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Odysseus, clad in rags and
leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar. He
came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older
ones among us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured
both being struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his
own house; but when the will [<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] of Aegis-bearing
Zeus inspired him, he and Telemakhos took the armor and hid it in an
inner chamber, bolting the doors behind them. Then he cunningly made
his wife offer his bow and a quantity of iron to be contended for by
us ill-fated suitors; and this was the beginning of our end, for not
one of us could string the bow - nor nearly do so. When it was about
to reach the hands of Odysseus, we all of us shouted out that it
should not be given him, no matter what he might say, but Telemakhos
insisted on his having it. When he had got it in his hands he strung
it with ease and sent his arrow through the iron. Then he stood on
the floor of the room and poured his arrows on the ground, glaring
fiercely about him. First he killed Antinoos, and then, aiming
straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts and they fell thick
on one another. It was plain that some one of the gods was helping
them, for they fell upon us with might and main throughout the
cloisters, and there was a hideous sound of groaning as our brains
were being battered in, and the ground seethed with our blood. This,
Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and our bodies are lying still
un-cared for in the house of Odysseus, for our friends at home do not
yet know what has happened, so that they cannot lay us out and wash
the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according to the
offices due to the departed."</p>

<p><milestone n="191" unit="line"/>"Happy Odysseus, son of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>,"
replied the ghost [<term lang="xgreek">psukh&ecirc;</term>] of Agamemnon, "you
are indeed blessed [<term lang="xgreek">olbios</term>] in the possession of a
wife endowed with such rare excellence [<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>]
of understanding, and so faithful to her wedded lord as Penelope the
daughter of Ikarios. The <term lang="xgreek">kleos</term>, therefore, of her excellence
[<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>] shall never die, and the immortals shall
compose a song that shall be welcome to all humankind in honor of the
constancy of Penelope. How far otherwise was the wickedness of the
daughter of Tyndareus who killed her lawful husband; her song shall
be hateful among men, for she has brought disgrace on all womankind
even on the good ones."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="203">
<p><milestone n="203" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse in the
house of Hades deep down within the bowels of the earth. Meanwhile
Odysseus and the others passed out of the town and soon reached the
fair and well-tilled farm of <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, which he had reclaimed with
infinite labor. Here was his house, with a lean-to running all round
it, where the slaves who worked for him slept and sat and ate, while
inside the house there was an old Sicel woman, who looked after him
in this his country-farm. When Odysseus got there, he said to his son
and to the other two:</p>

<p><milestone n="214" unit="line"/>"Go to the house, and kill the

whether my father will know me, or fail to recognize me after so long

<p><milestone n="219" unit="line"/>He then took off his armor and
gave it to Eumaios and Philoitios, who went straight on to the house,
while he turned off into the vineyard to make trial of his father. As
he went down into the great orchard, he did not see Dolios, nor any
of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for they were all gathering
thorns to make a fence for the vineyard, at the place where the old
man had told them; he therefore found his father alone, hoeing a
vine. He had on a dirty old shirt, patched and very shabby; his legs
were bound round with thongs of oxhide to save him from the brambles,
and he also wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat skin cap on his
head, and was looking very woe-begone [<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>]. When
Odysseus saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow
[<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>], he stood still under a tall pear tree and
began to weep. He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell
him all about his having come home, or whether he should first
question him and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it best
to be crafty with him, so in this mind he went up to his father, who
was bending down and digging about a plant.</p>

<p><milestone n="244" unit="line"/>"I see, sir," said Odysseus,
"that you are an excellent gardener - what pains you take with it, to
be sure. There is not a single plant, not a fig tree, vine, olive,
pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of your attention. I trust,
however, that you will not be offended if I say that you take better
care of your garden than of yourself. You are old, unsavory, and very
meanly clad. It cannot be because you are idle that your master takes
such poor care of you, indeed your face and figure have nothing of
the slave about them, and proclaim you of noble birth. I should have
said that you were one of those who should wash well, eat well, and
lie soft at night as old men have a right [<term lang="xgreek">dik&ecirc;</term>]
to do; but tell me, and tell me true, whose laborer are you, and in
whose garden are you working? Tell me also about another matter. Is
this place that I have come to really <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>? I met a man just now
who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the patience to
hear my story out when I was asking him about an old friend of mine,
whether he was still living, or was already dead and in the house of
Hades. Believe me when I tell you that this man came to my house once
when I was in my own country and never yet did any stranger come to
me whom I liked better. He said that his family came from <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> and
that his father was <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, son of Arceisius. I received him
hospitably, making him welcome to all the abundance of my house, and
when he went away I gave him all customary presents. I gave him seven
talents of fine gold, and a cup of solid silver with flowers chased
upon it. I gave him twelve light cloaks, and as many pieces of
tapestry; I also gave him twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs,
twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. To all this I
added four good looking women skilled in all useful arts, and I let
him take his choice."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="280">
<p><milestone n="280" unit="line"/>His father shed tears and
answered, "Sir, you have indeed come to the country that you have
named, but it is fallen into the hands of wicked people. All this
wealth of presents has been given to no purpose. If you could have
found your friend here alive in the <term lang="xgreek">d&ecirc;mos</term> of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, he
would have entertained you hospitably and would have required your
presents amply when you left him - as would have been only right
considering what you have already given him. But tell me, and tell me
true, how many years is it since you entertained this guest - my
unhappy son, as ever was? Alas! He has perished far from his own
country; the fishes of the sea have eaten him, or he has fallen a
prey to the birds and wild beasts of some continent. Neither his
mother, nor I his father, who were his parents, could throw our arms
about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could his excellent and
richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as was natural upon
his death bed, and close his eyes according to the offices due to the
departed. But now, tell me truly for I want to know. Who and whence
are you - tell me of your town and parents? Where is the ship lying
that has brought you and your men to <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>? Or were you a passenger
on some other man's ship, and those who brought you here have
gone on their way and left you?"</p>

<p><milestone n="302" unit="line"/>"I will tell you everything,"
answered Odysseus, "quite truly. I come from Alybas, where I have a
fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who is the son of Polypemon.
My own name is Eperitus; a <term lang="xgreek">daim&ocirc;n</term> drove me off my course
as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried here against my
will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off the open country
outside the town, and this is the fifth year since Odysseus left my
country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for him when he left
me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and I rejoiced
to see them as we parted, for we had every hope that we should have
another friendly meeting and exchange presents."</p>

<p><milestone n="315" unit="line"/>A dark cloud of sorrow
[<term lang="xgreek">akhos</term>] fell upon <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> as he listened. He filled
both hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his
gray head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Odysseus was
touched, and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then
he sprang towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him,
saying, "I am he, father, about whom you are asking - I have returned
after having been away for twenty years. But cease your sighing and
lamentation - we have no time to lose, for I should tell you that I
have been killing the suitors in my house, to punish them for their
insolence and crimes."</p>

<p><milestone n="327" unit="line"/>"If you really are my son
Odysseus," replied <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>, "and have come back again, you must give
me such manifest proof [<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;ma</term>] of your identity
as shall convince me."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="330">
<p><milestone n="330" unit="line"/>"First observe this scar,"
answered Odysseus, "which I got from a boar's tusk when I was
hunting on Mount Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me to
Autolykos, my mother's father, to receive the presents which
when he was over here he had promised to give me. Furthermore I will
point out to you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me, and I
asked you all about them as I followed you round the garden. We went
over them all, and you told me their names and what they all were.
You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty fig
trees; you also said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there was
wheat planted between each row, and they yield grapes of every kind
when the seasons [<term lang="xgreek">h&ocirc;rai</term>] of Zeus have been laid
heavy upon them."</p>

<p><milestone n="345" unit="line"/><placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName>&rsquo; strength failed him
when he heard the convincing proofs [<term lang="xgreek">s&ecirc;mata</term>]
which his son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and
Odysseus had to support him, or he would have gone off into a swoon;
but as soon as he came to, and was beginning to recover his senses,
he said, "O father Zeus, then you gods are still in <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName> after
all, if the suitors have really been punished for their insolence
[<term lang="xgreek">hubris</term>] and folly. Nevertheless, I am much afraid
that I shall have all the townspeople of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName> up here directly, and
they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the cities of
the Cephall&ecirc;nians."</p>

<p><milestone n="356" unit="line"/>Odysseus answered, "Take heart
and do not trouble yourself about that, but let us go into the house
hard by your garden. I have already told Telemakhos, Philoitios, and
Eumaios to go on there and get dinner ready as soon as
possible."</p>

<p><milestone n="361" unit="line"/>Thus conversing the two made
their way towards the house. When they got there they found
Telemakhos with the stockman and the swineherd cutting up meat and
mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> inside
and washed him and anointed him with oil. She put him on a good
cloak, and Athena came up to him and gave him a more imposing
presence, making him taller and stouter than before. When he came
back his son was surprised to see him looking so like an immortal,
and said to him, "My dear father, some one of the gods has been
making you much taller and better-looking."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="375">
<p><milestone n="375" unit="line"/><placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> answered, "Would, by
Father Zeus, Athena, and Apollo, that I were the man I was when I
ruled among the Cephall&ecirc;nians, and took Nericum, that strong
fortress on the foreland. If I were still what I then was and had
been in our house yesterday with my armor on, I should have been able
to stand by you and help you against the suitors. I should have
killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced to see
it."</p>

<p><milestone n="383" unit="line"/>Thus did they converse; but the
others, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready,
left off working [<term lang="xgreek">ponos</term>], and took each his proper
place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by and by old
Dolios and his sons left their work and came up, for their mother,
the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was growing old,
had been to fetch them. When they saw Odysseus and were certain it
was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but Odysseus scolded
them good-naturedly and said, "Sit down to your dinner, old man, and
never mind about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin for
some time and have been waiting for you."</p>

<p><milestone n="397" unit="line"/>Then Dolios put out both his
hands and went up to Odysseus. "Sir," said he, seizing his
master's hand and kissing it at the wrist, "we have long been
wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us after we had
given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper you
[<term lang="xgreek">olbios</term>]. But tell me, does Penelope already know of
your return, or shall we send some one to tell her?"</p>

<p><milestone n="407" unit="line"/>"Old man," answered Odysseus,
"she knows already, so you need not trouble about that." On this he
took his seat, and the sons of Dolios gathered round Odysseus to give
him greeting and embrace him one after the other; then they took
their seats in due order near Dolios their father.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="412">
<p><milestone n="412" unit="line"/>While they were thus busy getting
their dinner ready, Rumor went round the town, and noised abroad the
terrible fate that had befallen the suitors; as soon, therefore, as
the people heard of it they gathered from every quarter, groaning and
hooting before the house of Odysseus. They took the dead away, buried
every man his own, and put the bodies of those who came from
elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for the fishermen to take
each of them to his own place. They then met angrily in the place of
assembly, and when they were got together Eupeithes rose to speak. He
was overwhelmed with grief [<term lang="xgreek">penthos</term>] for the death of
his son Antinoos, who had been the first man killed by Odysseus, so
he said, weeping bitterly, "My friend, this man has done the Achaeans
great wrong. He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet,
and he has lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his return he
has been killing all the foremost men among the Cephall&ecirc;nians.
Let us be up and doing before he can get away to <placeName key="perseus,Pylos">Pylos</placeName> or to <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName>
where the Epeans rule, or we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever
afterwards. It will be an everlasting disgrace to us if we do not
avenge the murder of our sons and brothers. For my own part I should
have no more pleasure in life, but had rather die at once. Let us be
up, then, and after them, before they can cross over to the
mainland."</p>

<p><milestone n="438" unit="line"/>He wept as he spoke and every one
pitied him. But Medon and the bard Phemios had now woke up, and came
to them from the house of Odysseus. Every one was astonished at
seeing them, but they stood in the middle of the assembly, and Medon
said, "Hear me, men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>. Odysseus did not do these things
against the will of heaven. I myself saw an immortal god take the
form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god appeared, now in front
of him encouraging him, and now going furiously about the court and
attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick on one
another."</p>

<p><milestone n="450" unit="line"/>On this pale fear laid hold of
them, and old Halitherses, son of Mastor, rose to speak, for he was
the only man among them who knew both past and future; so he spoke to
them plainly and in all honesty, saying,</p>

<p><milestone n="454" unit="line"/>"Men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>, it is all your
own fault that things have turned out as they have; you would not
listen to me, nor yet to Mentor, when we bade you check the folly of
your sons who were doing much wrong in the wantonness of their hearts
- wasting the substance and dishonoring the wife of a chieftain who
they thought would not return. Now, however, let it be as I say, and
do as I tell you. Do not go out against Odysseus, or you may find
that you have been drawing down evil on your own heads."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="463">
<p><milestone n="463" unit="line"/>This was what he said, and more
than half raised a loud shout, and at once left the assembly. But the
rest stayed where they were, for the speech of Halitherses displeased
them, and they sided with Eupeithes; they therefore hurried off for
their armor, and when they had armed themselves, they met together in
front of the city, and Eupeithes led them on in their folly. He
thought he was going to avenge the murder of his son, whereas in
truth he was never to return, but was himself to perish in his
attempt.</p>

<p><milestone n="472" unit="line"/>Then Athena said to Zeus,
"Father, son of Kronos, king of kings, answer me this question - What
does your <term lang="xgreek">noos</term> bid you? Will you set them fighting still
further, or will you make peace between them?"</p>

<p><milestone n="477" unit="line"/>And Zeus answered, "My child, why
should you ask me? Was it not by your own arrangement
[<term lang="xgreek">noos</term>] that Odysseus came home and took his revenge
upon the suitors? Do whatever you like, but I will tell you what I
think will be the most reasonable arrangement. Now that Odysseus is
revenged, let them swear to a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he
shall continue to rule, while we cause the others to forgive and
forget the massacre of their sons and brothers. Let them then all
become friends as heretofore, and let peace and plenty
reign."</p>

<p><milestone n="487" unit="line"/>This was what Athena was already
eager to bring about, so down she darted from off the topmost summits
of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>.</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="489">
<p><milestone n="489" unit="line"/>Now when <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> and the others
had done dinner, Odysseus began by saying, "Some of you go out and
see if they are not getting close up to us." So one of Dolios&rsquo;
sons went as he was bid. Standing on the threshold he could see them
all quite near, and said to Odysseus, "Here they are, let us put on
our armor at once."</p>

<p><milestone n="496" unit="line"/>They put on their armor as fast
as they could - that is to say Odysseus, his three men, and the six
sons of Dolios. <placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> also and Dolios did the same - warriors by
necessity in spite of their gray hair. When they had all put on their
armor, they opened the gate and sallied forth, Odysseus leading the
way.</p>

<p><milestone n="502" unit="line"/>Then Zeus&rsquo; daughter Athena
came up to them, having assumed the form and voice of Mentor.
Odysseus was glad when he saw her, and said to his son Telemakhos,
"Telemakhos, now that you are about to fight in an engagement, which
will show every man's mettle, be sure not to disgrace your
ancestors, who were eminent for their strength and courage all the
world over."</p>

<p><milestone n="510" unit="line"/>"You say truly, my dear father,"
answered Telemakhos, "and you shall see, if you will, that I am in no
mind to disgrace your family."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="513">
<p><milestone n="513" unit="line"/><placeName key="perseus,Laertes">Laertes</placeName> was delighted when he
heard this. "Good heavens, he exclaimed, "what a day I am enjoying: I
do indeed rejoice at it. My son and grandson are vying with one
another in the matter of valor
[<term lang="xgreek">aret&ecirc;</term>]."</p>

<p><milestone n="516" unit="line"/>On this Athena came close up to
him and said, "Son of Arceisius - best friend I have in the world -
pray to the gray-eyed damsel, and to Zeus her father; then poise your
spear and hurl it."</p>

<p><milestone n="520" unit="line"/>As she spoke she infused fresh
vigor into him, and when he had prayed to her he poised his spear and
hurled it. He hit Eupeithes&rsquo; helmet, and the spear went right
through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and his armor rang rattling
round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Meantime Odysseus and his
son fell the front line of the foe and smote them with their swords
and spears; indeed, they would have killed every one of them, and
prevented them from ever getting home again, only Athena raised her
voice aloud, and made every one pause. "Men of <placeName key="tgn,1007519">Ithaca</placeName>," she cried,
"cease this dreadful war, and settle the matter at once without
further bloodshed."</p>

<p><milestone n="533" unit="line"/>On this pale fear seized every
one; they were so frightened that their arms dropped from their hands
and fell upon the ground at the sound of the goddess&rsquo; voice, and
they fled back to the city for their lives. But Odysseus gave a great
cry, and gathering himself together swooped down like a soaring
eagle. Then the son of Kronos sent a thunderbolt of fire that fell
just in front of Athena, so she said to Odysseus, "Odysseus, noble
son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Zeus will be angry with
you."</p></div2>

<div2 type="card" n="545">
<p><milestone n="545" unit="line"/>Thus spoke Athena, and Odysseus
obeyed her gladly. Then Athena assumed the form and voice of Mentor,
and presently made a covenant of peace between the two contending
parties. <milestone n="548" unit="line"/></p>
