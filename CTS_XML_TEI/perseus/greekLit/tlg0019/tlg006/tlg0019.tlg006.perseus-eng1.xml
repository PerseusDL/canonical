<stage>SCENE:  A wild and desolate region; only thickets, rocks, and a single tree are seen. Euelpides and Pisthetaerus enter, each with a bird in his hand.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p><stage>To his jay.</stage> Do you think I should walk straight for yon tree?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p><stage>To his crow.</stage> Cursed beast, what are you croaking to me?  . . . to retrace my steps?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Why, you wretch, we are wandering at random, we are exerting ourselves only to return to the same spot; we're wasting our time.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="5" unit="line"/>To think that I should trust to this crow, which has made me cover more than a thousand furlongs!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>And that I, in obedience to this jay, should have worn my toes down to the nails!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>If only I knew where we were . . . </p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="10" unit="line"/>Could you find your country again from here?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>No, I feel quite sure I could not, any more than could Execestides find his.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Alas!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Aye, aye, my friend, it's surely the road of &ldquo;alases&rdquo; we are following.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>That Philocrates, the bird-seller, played us a scurvy trick, <milestone ed="p" n="15" unit="line"/>when he pretended these two guides could help us to find Tereus, the Epops, who is a bird, without being born of one. He has indeed sold us this jay, a true son of Tharrhelides, for an obolus, and this crow for three, but what can they do? Why, nothing whatever but bite and scratch! <stage>To his jay.</stage>
<milestone ed="p" n="20" unit="line"/>What's the matter with you then, that you keep opening your beak? Do you want us to fling ourselves headlong down these rocks? There is no road that way.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Not even the vestige of a trail in any direction</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>And what does the crow say about the road to follow?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>By Zeus, it no longer croaks the same thing it did.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="25" unit="line"/>And which way does it tell us to go now?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>It says that, by dint of gnawing, it will devour my fingers.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>What misfortune is ours! we strain every nerve to get to the crows, do everything we can to that end, and we cannot find our way! <milestone ed="p" n="30" unit="line"/>Yes, spectators, our madness is quite different from that of Sacas. He is not a citizen, and would fain be one at any cost; we, on the contrary, born of an honorable tribe and family and living in the midst of our fellow-citizens,
<milestone ed="p" n="35" unit="line"/>we have fled from our country as hard as ever we could go. It's not that we hate it; we recognize it to be great and rich, likewise that everyone has the right to ruin himself paying taxes; but the crickets only chirrup among the fig-trees for a month or two, <milestone ed="p" n="40" unit="line"/>whereas the Athenians spend their whole lives in chanting forth judgments from their law-courts. That is why we started off with a basket, a stew-pot and some myrtle boughs and have come to seek a quiet country <milestone ed="p" n="45" unit="line"/>in which to settle. We are going to Tereus, the Epops, to learn from him, whether, in his aerial flights, he has noticed some town of this kind.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="49">
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Here! look!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>What's the matter?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Why, the crow has been directing me <milestone ed="p" n="50" unit="line"/>to something up there for some time now.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>And the jay is also opening it beak and craning its neck to show me I know not what. Clearly, there are some birds about here. We shall soon know, if we kick up a noise to start them.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Do you know what to do? Knock your leg against this rock.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="55" unit="line"/>And you your head to double the noise.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Well then use a stone instead; take one and hammer with it.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Good idea! <stage>He does so.</stage> Ho there, within! Slave! slave!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>What's that, friend! You say, &ldquo;slave,&rdquo; to summon Epops? It would be much better to shout, <milestone ed="p" n="60" unit="line"/>&ldquo;Epops, Epops!&rdquo;</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Well then, Epops! Must I knock again? Epops!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trochilus</speaker>
<p><stage>Rushing out of a thicket.</stage> Who's there? Who calls my master?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p><stage>In terror.</stage> Apollo the Deliverer! what an enormous beak!</p></sp>
<stage>He defecates. In the confusion both the jay and the crow fly away.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Trochilus</speaker>
<p><stage>Equally frightened.</stage> Good god! they are bird-catchers.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p><stage>Reassuring himself.</stage> But is it so terrible? Wouldn't it be better to explain things?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trochilus</speaker>
<p><stage>Also reassuring himself.</stage> You're done for.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>But we are not men.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trochilus</speaker>
<p>What are you, then?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p><stage>Defecating also.</stage>
<milestone ed="p" n="65" unit="line"/>I am the Fearling, an African bird.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trochilus</speaker>
<p>You talk nonsense.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Well, then, just ask it of my feet.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trochilus</speaker>
<p>And this other one, what bird is it? <stage>To Pisthetaerus.</stage> Speak up!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p><stage>Weakly.</stage> I? I am a Crapple, from the land of the pheasants.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>But you yourself, in the name of the gods! what animal are you?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trochilus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="70" unit="line"/>Why, I am a slave-bird.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Why, have you been conquered by a cock?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trochilus</speaker>
<p>No, but when my master was turned into a hoopoe, he begged me to become a bird also, to follow and to serve him.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Does a bird need a servant, then?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trochilus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="75" unit="line"/>That's no doubt because he was once a man. At times he wants to eat a dish of sardines from Phalerum; I seize my dish and fly to fetch him some. Again he wants some pea-soup; I seize a ladle and a pot and run to get it.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>This is, then, <milestone ed="p" n="80" unit="line"/>truly a running-bird. Come, Trochilus, do us the kindness to call your master.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trochilus</speaker>
<p>Why, he has just fallen asleep after a feed of myrtle-berries and a few grubs.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Never mind; wake him up.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Trochilus</speaker>
<p>I am certain he will be angry. However, I will wake him to please you.</p></sp>
<stage>He goes back into the thicket.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p><stage>As soon as Trochilus is out of sight.</stage>
<milestone ed="p" n="85" unit="line"/>You cursed brute! why, I am almost dead with terror!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Oh! my god! it was sheer fear that made me lose my jay.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Ah! you big coward! were you so frightened that you let go your jay?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>And did you not lose your crow, when you fell sprawling on the ground? Tell me that.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="90">
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="90" unit="line"/>Not at all.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Where is it, then?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>It flew away.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>And you did not let it go? Oh! you brave fellow!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p><stage>From within.</stage> Open the thicket, that I may go out!</p></sp>
<stage>He comes out of the thicket.</stage>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>By Heracles! what a creature! what plumage! What means this triple crest?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="95" unit="line"/>Who wants me?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p><stage>Banteringly.</stage> The twelve great gods have used you ill, it seems.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>Are you twitting me about my feathers? I have been a man, strangers.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>It's not you we are jeering at.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>At what, then?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Why, it's your beak that looks so ridiculous to us.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="100" unit="line"/>This is how Sophocles outrages me in his tragedies. Know, I once was Tereus.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>You were Tereus, and what are you now? a bird or a peacock?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>I am a bird.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Then where are your feathers? I don't see any.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>They have fallen off.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Through illness?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="105" unit="line"/>No. All birds moult their feathers, you know, every winter, and others grow in their place. But tell me, who are you?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>We? We are mortals.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>From what country?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>From the land of the beautiful galleys.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>Are you dicasts?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>No, if anything, <milestone ed="p" n="110" unit="line"/>we are anti-dicasts.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>Is that kind of seed sown among you?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>You have to look hard to find even a little in our fields.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>What brings you here?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>We wish to pay you a visit.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>What for?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Because you formerly were a man, like we are, <milestone ed="p" n="115" unit="line"/>formerly you had debts, as we have, formerly you did not want to pay them, like ourselves; furthermore, being turned into a bird, you have when flying seen all lands and seas. Thus you have all human knowledge as well as that of birds. <milestone ed="p" n="120" unit="line"/>And hence we have come to you to beg you to direct us to some cosy town, in which one can repose as if on thick coverlets.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>And are you looking for a greater city than <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>No, not a greater, but one more pleasant to live in.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="125">
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="125" unit="line"/>Then you are looking for an aristocratic country.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>I? Not at all! I hold the son of Scellias in horror.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>But, after all, what sort of city would please you best?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>A place where the following would be the most important business transacted. &mdash;Some friend would come knocking at the door quite early in the morning
<milestone ed="p" n="130" unit="line"/>saying, &ldquo;By Olympian Zeus, be at my house early, as soon as you have bathed, and bring your children too. I am giving a nuptial feast, so don't fail, or else don't cross my threshold when I am in distress.&rdquo;</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="135" unit="line"/>Ah! that's what may be called being fond of hardships!
<stage>To Pisthetaerus.</stage> And what say you?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>My tastes are similar.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>And they are?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>I want a town where the father of a handsome lad will stop in the street and say to me reproachfully as if I had failed him, &ldquo;Ah! Is this well done, Stilbonides? <milestone ed="p" n="140" unit="line"/>You met my son coming from the bath after the gymnasium and you neither spoke to him, nor kissed him, nor took him with you, nor ever once felt his balls. Would anyone call you an old friend of mine?&rdquo;</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>Ah! wag, I see you are fond of suffering. But there is a city of delights such as you want. <milestone ed="p" n="145" unit="line"/>It's on the <placeName key="tgn,7016791">Red Sea</placeName>.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Oh, no. Not a sea-port, where some fine morning the Salaminian galley can appear, bringing a process-server along. Have you no Greek town you can propose to us?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>Why not choose Lepreum in <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> for your settlement?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="150" unit="line"/>By Zeus! I could not look at Lepreum without disgust, because of Melanthius.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>Then, again, there is the Opuntian Locris, where you could live.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>I would not be Opuntian for a talent.<milestone ed="p" n="155" unit="line"/> But come, what is it like to live with the birds? You should know pretty well.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>Why, it's not a disagreeable life. In the first place, one has no purse.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>That does away with a lot of roguery.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>For food the gardens yield us white sesame, <milestone ed="p" n="160" unit="line"/>myrtle-berries, poppies and mint.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Why, 'tis the life of the newly-wed indeed.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Ha! I am beginning to see a great plan, which will transfer the supreme power to the birds, if you will but take my advice.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="164">
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>Take your advice? In what way?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>In what way? Well, firstly, <milestone ed="p" n="165" unit="line"/>do not fly in all directions with open beak; it is not dignified. Among us, when we see a thoughtless man, we ask, &ldquo;What sort of bird is this?&rdquo; and Teleas answers, &ldquo;It's a man who has no brain, a bird that has lost his head, a creature <milestone ed="p" n="170" unit="line"/>you cannot catch, for it never remains in any one place.&rdquo;</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>By Zeus himself! your jest hits the mark. What then is to be done?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Found a city.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>We birds? But what sort of city should we build?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Oh, really, really! you talk like such a fool! <milestone ed="p" n="175" unit="line"/>Look down.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>I am looking.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Now look up.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>I am looking.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Turn your head round.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>Ah! it will be pleasant for me if I end in twisting my neck off!</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>What have you seen?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>The clouds and the sky.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Very well! is not this the pole of the birds then?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="180" unit="line"/>How their pole?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Or, if you like it, their place. And since it turns and passes through the whole universe, it is called &lsquo;pole.&rsquo; If you build and fortify it, you will turn your pole into a city.<milestone ed="p" n="185" unit="line"/> In this way you will reign over mankind as you do over the grasshoppers and you will cause the gods to die of rabid hunger.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>How so?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>The air is between earth and heaven. When we want to go to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, we ask the Boeotians for leave of passage;<milestone ed="p" n="190" unit="line"/> in the same way, when men sacrifice to the gods, unless the latter pay you tribute, you exercise the right of every nation towards strangers and don't allow the smoke of the sacrifices to pass through your city and territory.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>By earth! by snares! by network! by cages!<milestone ed="p" n="195" unit="line"/> I never heard of anything more cleverly conceived; and, if the other birds approve, I am going to build the city along with you.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Who will explain the matter to them?</p></sp>

<p>Undoubtedly, but sharpen your beak well; <milestone ed="p" n="480" unit="line"/>Zeus won't be in a hurry to hand over his scepter to the woodpecker.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>It was not the gods, but the birds, who were formerly the masters and kings over men; of this I have a thousand proofs. First of all, I will point you to the cock, who governed the Persians before all other monarchs, before Darius and Megabazus. <milestone ed="p" n="485" unit="line"/>It's in memory of his reign that he is called the Persian bird.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>For this reason also, even to-day, he alone of all the birds wears his tiara straight on his head, like the Great King.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>He was so strong, so great, so feared, that even now, on account of his ancient power, <milestone ed="p" n="490" unit="line"/>everyone jumps out of bed as soon as ever he crows at daybreak. Blacksmiths, potters, tanners, shoemakers, bathmen, corn-dealers, lyre-makers and armorers, all put on their shoes and go to work before it is daylight.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>I can tell you something about that. It was the cock's fault that I lost a splendid tunic of Phrygian wool. I was at a feast in town, given to celebrate the birth of a child; I had drunk pretty freely <milestone ed="p" n="495" unit="line"/>and had just fallen asleep, when a cock, I suppose in a greater hurry than the rest, began to crow. I thought it was dawn and set out for Halimus. I had hardly got beyond the walls, when a footpad struck me in the back with his bludgeon; down I went and wanted to shout, but he had already made off with my mantle.</p></sp></div1>

<div1 type="card" n="498">
<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Formerly also the kite was ruler and king over the Greeks.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Leader of the Chorus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="500" unit="line"/>The Greeks?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>And when he was king, he was the one who first taught them to fall on their knees before the kites.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>By Zeus! that's what I did myself one day on seeing a kite; but at the moment I was on my knees, and leaning backwards with mouth agape, I bolted an obolus and was forced to carry my meal-sack home empty.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>The cuckoo was king of <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and of the whole of <placeName key="tgn,6004687">Phoenicia</placeName>. <milestone ed="p" n="505" unit="line"/>When he called out &ldquo;cuckoo,&rdquo; all the Phoenicians hurried to the fields to reap their wheat and their barley.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>Hence no doubt the proverb, &ldquo;Cuckoo! cuckoo! go to the fields, ye circumcised.&rdquo;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>So powerful were the birds that the kings of Grecian cities, Agamemnon, Menelaus, for instance, <milestone ed="p" n="510" unit="line"/>carried a bird on the tip of their scepters, who had his share of all presents.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>That I didn't know and was much astonished when I saw Priam come upon the stage in the tragedies with a bird, which kept watching Lysicrates to see if he got any present.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>But the strongest proof of all is that Zeus, who now reigns, <milestone ed="p" n="515" unit="line"/>is represented as standing with an eagle on his head as a symbol of his royalty; his daughter has an owl, and Phoebus, as his servant, has a hawk.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>By Demeter, the point is well taken. But what are all these birds doing in heaven?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>When anyone sacrifices and, according to the rite, offers the entrails to the gods, these birds take their share before Zeus. <milestone ed="p" n="520" unit="line"/>Formerly men always swore by the birds and never by the gods. And even now Lampon swears by the goose whenever he wishes to deceive someone.  Thus it is clear that you were once great and sacred,</p></sp></div1>

<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="550" unit="line"/>First I advise that the birds gather together in one city and that they build a wall of great bricks, like that at <placeName key="tgn,7002626">Babylon</placeName>, round the plains of the air and the whole region of space that divides earth from heaven.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>Oh, Cebriones! oh, Porphyrion! what a terribly strong place!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Then, when this has been well done and completed, you demand back the empire from Zeus; <milestone ed="p" n="555" unit="line"/>if he will not agree, if he refuses and does not at once confess himself beaten, you declare a sacred war against him and forbid the gods henceforward to pass through your country with their tools up, as hitherto, for the purpose of laying their Alcmenas, their Alopes, or their Semeles! if they try to pass through,<milestone ed="p" n="560" unit="line"/>you put rings on their tools so that they can't make love any longer. You send another messenger to mankind, who will proclaim to them that the birds are kings, that for the future they must first of all sacrifice to them, and only afterwards to the gods; that it is fitting to appoint to each deity the bird that has most in common with it.
<milestone ed="p" n="565" unit="line"/>For instance, are they sacrificing to Aphrodite, let them at the same time offer barley to the coot; are they immolating a sheep to Poseidon, let them consecrate wheat in honor of the duck; if a steer is being offered to Heracles, let honey-cakes be dedicated to the gull; if a goat is being slain for King Zeus, there is a King-Bird, the wren, to whom the sacrifice of a male gnat is due before Zeus himself even.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="570" unit="line"/>This notion of an immolated gnat delights me! And now let the great Zeus thunder!</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Leader of the Chorus</speaker>
<p>But how will mankind recognize us as gods and not as jays? Us, who have wings and fly?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>You talk rubbish! Hermes is a god and has wings and flies, and so do many other gods. First of all, Victory flies with golden wings, Eros is undoubtedly winged too, <milestone ed="p" n="575" unit="line"/>and Iris is compared by Homer to a timorous dove.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>But will not Zeus thunder and send his winged bolts against us?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>If men in their blindness do not recognize us as gods and so continue to worship the dwellers in <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>?  Then a cloud of sparrows greedy for corn must descend upon their fields and eat up all their seeds; <milestone ed="p" n="580" unit="line"/>we shall see then if Demeter will mete them out any wheat.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p>By Zeus, she'll take good care she does not, and you will see her inventing a thousand excuses.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>The crows too will prove your divinity to them by pecking out the eyes of their flocks and of their draught-oxen; and then let Apollo cure them, since he is a physician and is paid for the purpose.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Euelpides</speaker>
<p><milestone ed="p" n="585" unit="line"/>Oh! don't do that! Wait first until I have sold my two young bullocks.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>If on the other hand they recognize that you are God, the principle of life, that you are Earth, Kronos, Poseidon, they shall be loaded with benefits.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Epops</speaker>
<p>Name me one of these then.</p></sp>

<p>Well then, what name can you suggest?</p></sp>
<sp>

<p>Some name borrowed from the clouds, from these lofty regions in which we dwell &mdash;in short, some well-known name.</p></sp>

<p>Is it in Nephelococcygia that all the wealth of Theogenes and most of Aeschines' is?</p></sp>

<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>No, it's rather the plain of Phlegra, where the gods <milestone ed="p" n="825" unit="line"/>withered the pride of the sons of the Earth with their shafts.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leader of the Chorus</speaker>
<p>Oh! what a splendid city! But what god shall be its patron? for whom shall we weave the peplus?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>

<p>Who then shall guard the Pelargicon?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>A bird</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Leader of the Chorus</speaker>
<p>One of us? What kind of bird?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>A bird of Persian strain, who is everywhere proclaimed to be the bravest of all, <milestone ed="p" n="835" unit="line"/>a true chick of Ares.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Euelpides</speaker>

<p>Birds &mdash;birds only; they had neither Egyptian brickmaker, nor stonemason, nor carpenter; <milestone ed="p" n="1135" unit="line"/>the birds did it all themselves; I could hardly believe my eyes. Thirty thousand cranes came from <placeName key="tgn,1000172">Libya</placeName> with a supply of stones, intended for the foundations. The water-rails chiselled them with their beaks. Ten thousand storks were busy making bricks; <milestone ed="p" n="1140" unit="line"/>plovers and other water fowl carried water into the air.</p></sp>

<p>Would you do this better if you had wings?</p></sp>

<p>No, but I should no longer fear the pirates; I should return with the cranes, loaded with a supply of lawsuits by way of ballast.</p></sp>

<p>My friend, I am asking you for wings, not for words.</p></sp>

<p>It's just my words that gives you wings.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Informer</speaker>

<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>They all start this way.</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Informer</speaker>
<p>How?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Have you not often heard<milestone ed="p" n="1440" unit="line"/> the father say to young men in the barbers' shops, &ldquo;It's astonishing how Diitrephes' advice has made my son fly to horse-riding.&rdquo; &mdash;&ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; says another, &ldquo;has <milestone ed="p" n="1445" unit="line"/>flown towards tragic poetry on the wings of his imagination.&rdquo;</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Informer</speaker>
<p>So that words give wings?</p></sp>
<sp>
<speaker>Pisthetaerus</speaker>
<p>Undoubtedly; words give wings to the mind and make a man soar to heaven. Thus I hope that my wise words will give you wings <milestone ed="p" n="1450" unit="line"/>to fly to some less degrading trade.</p></sp>
