      <head>Fragments of Epictetus</head>
      <div type="book" n="0">
        <p>THESE Fragments are entitled <title xml:lang="la">Epicteti Fragmenta maxime ex Ioanne
            Stobaeo, Antonio, et Maximo collecta</title> (ed. Schweig.). There are some notes and
          emendations on the Fragments; and a short dissertation on them by Schweighaeuser.</p>
        <p>Nothing is known of Stobaeus nor of his time, except the fact that he has preserved some
          extracts of an ethical kind from the New Platonist Hierocles, who lived about the middle
          of the fifth century A. D.; and it is therefore concluded that Stobaeus lived after
          Hierocles. The fragments attributed to Epictetus are preserved by Stobaeus in his work
          entitled <foreign xml:lang="grc">'*anfolo/gion</foreign>, or Florilegium or Sermones.</p>
        <p>Antonius Monachus, a Greek monk, also made a Florilegium, entitled Melissa (the bee). His
          date is uncertain, but it was certainly much later than the time of Stobaeus.</p>
        <p>Maximus, also named the monk, and reverenced as a saint, is said to have been a native of
          Constantinople, and born about A. D. <date when="0580">580</date>.</p>
        <p>Some of the Fragments contained in the edition of Schweighaeuser are certainly not from
          Epictetus. Many of the fragments are obscure; but they are translated as accurately as I
          can translate them, and the reader must give to them such meaning as he can. <pb n="406"

          <p>When we have been invited to a banquet, we take what is set before us: but if a guest
            should ask the host to set before him fish or sweet cakes, he would be considered to be

          <p>They are amusing fellows, said he (Epictetus), who are proud of the things which are
            not in our power. A man says, I am better than you, for I possess much land, and you are
            wasting with hunger. Another says, I am of consular rank. Another says, I am a
            Procurator (<foreign xml:lang="grc">e)pi/tropos</foreign>). Another, I have curly hair.
            But a horse does not say to a horse, I am superior to you, for I possess much fodder,
            and much barley, and my bits are of gold and my harness is embroidered: but he says, I
            am swifter than you. And every animal is better or worse from his own merit (virtue) or
            his own badness. Is there then no virtue in man only? and must we look to the hair, and
            our clothes and to our ancestors?</p>

            wish to be happy, you should know that it is both a good thing and in your power, for

            on account of the costliness of the material love it or think it happy, but because the
            nature of it is pernicious, you turn away from it and loathe it; so when you shall see
            vice dwelling in wealth and in the swollen fulness of fortune, be not struck by the
            splendour of the material, but despise the false character of the morals.</p>

          <p>Wealth is not one of the good things; great expenditure is one of the bad; moderation
              (<foreign xml:lang="grc">swfrosu/nh</foreign>)is one of the good things. And
            moderation invites to frugality and the acquisition of good things: but wealth invites
            to great expenditure and draws us away from moderation. It is difficult then for a rich
            man to be moderate, or for a moderate man to be rich.<note anchored="true">'How hardly
              shall they that have riches enter the kingdom of God.' Mark x. 23 (Mrs. Carter). This
              expression in Mark sets forth the danger of riches, a fact which all men know who use
              their observation. In the next verse the truth is expressed in this form, 'How hard it
              is for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God.' The Stoics viewed
              wealth as among the things which are indifferent, neither good nor bad.</note>

              member of the comparison has been omitted by some accident in the MSS. Wolf in his

                >'ita neque in terris divitiae tibi expe tendae sunt. '</quote> Schweig.</note> For
            neither there (in the ship) will the ship naturally be connected with you, nor wealth in
            the other case; but reason is every where naturally connected with you. As then reason
            is a thing which naturally belongs to you and is born in you, consider this also as
            specially your own and take care of it.</p>

          <p>If you had been born among the Persians, you would not have wished to live in Hellas
            (Greece), but to have lived in Persia happy: so if you are born in poverty, why do you
            seek to grow rich, and why do you not remain in poverty and be happy?<note
              anchored="true">To some persons the comparison will not seem apt. Also the notion that
              every man should be taught to rise above the condition in which he is born is, in the
              opinion of some persons, a better teaching I think that it is not. Few persons have
              the talents and the character which enable them to rise from a low condition; and the
              proper lesson for them is to) stay in the condition in which they are born and to be
              content with it. Those who have the power of rising from a low condition will rise
              whether they are advised to attempt it or not: and generally they will not be able to
              rise without doing something useful to society. Those who have ability sufficient to
              raise themselves from a low estate, and at the same time to do it to the damage of
              society, are perhaps only few, but certainly there are such persons. They rise by
              ability, by the use of fraud, by bad means almost innumerable. They gain wealth, they
              fill high places, they disturb society, they are plagues and pests, and the world
              looks on sometimes with stupid admiration until death removes the dazzling and
              deceitful image, and honest men breathe freely again <p>In the Church of England
                Catechism there are two answers to two questions, one on our duty to God, the other
                on our duty to our neighbour. Both the answers would be accepted by Epictetus,
                except such few words as were not applicable to the circumstances of his age. The
                second answer ends with the words 'to learn and labour to get mine own living and to
                do my duty in that state of life unto which it shall please God to call
              me.'</p></note>

              must be something which is capable of using the body and a power which possesses what
              we name intelligence and consciousness. Our bodies, as Bishop Butler says, are what we
              name matter, and differ from other matter only in being more closely connected with us
              than other matter. It would be easy to pass from these notions to the notion that this
              intelligence and power, or to use a common word. the soul, is something which exists
              independent of the body, though we only know the soul while it acts within and on the

          <p>Admirable is nature, and, as Xenophon says, a lover of animated beings. The body then,

            we should not be able to endure it. Consider then what a thing it would be to rise in
            the morning and rub the teeth of another, and after doing some of the necessary offices
            to wash those parts. In truth it is wonderful that we love a thing to which we perform
            such services every day. I fill this bag, and then I empty it;<note anchored="true">This

            submitted to it. Why then do you not submit, when Nature who has given us this body
            takes it away? I love the body, you may say. Well, as I said just now, Nature gave you

            of the stars, and the plants of earth and animals. And our body obeys it also both in
            disease and in health when it (the universe) chooses, both in youth and in age, and when
            it is passing through the other changes. What is reasonable then and in our power is
            this, for our judgment not to be the only thing which resists it (the universe): for it
            is strong and superior, and it has determined better about us by administering
            (governing) us also together with the whole. And besides, this opposition also is
            unreasonable and does nothing more than cause us to be tormented uselessly and to fall
            into pain and sorrow.</p>

          <p>Of the things which are, God has put some of them in our power, and some he has not. In

            happiness, tranquillity, constancy: and this is also justice and law, and temperance,
