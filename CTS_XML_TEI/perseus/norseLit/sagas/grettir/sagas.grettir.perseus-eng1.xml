     <head>PREFACE.</head>
     <p>WE do not feel able to take in hand the wide subject of the Sagas of Iceland within the
      limits of a Preface; therefore we have only to say that we put forward this volume as the
      translation of an old story founded on facts, full of dramatic interest, and setting before
      people's eyes pictures of the life and manners of an interesting race of men near akin to
      ourselves.</p>
     <p>Those, to whom the subject is new, we must refer to the translations already made of some
      other of these works,<note place="foot">Such as 'Burnt Nial,' Edinburgh 1861, 8vo, and 'Gisli
       the Outlaw,' Edinburgh, 1866, 4vo, by Dasent the 'Saga of Viga-Glum,' London, 1866, 8vo, by
       Sir E. Head; the 'Heimskringla,' London, 1844, 8vo, by S. Laing; the 'Eddas,' Prose by
       Dasent, Stockholm, 1842; Poetic by A. S. Cottle, Bristol, 1797, and Thorpe, London and Halle,
       1866, and the 'Saga of Gunnlaug the Worm-tongue,' by Magnússon and Morris, in the <hi
        rend="ital">Fortnightly Review</hi>, Jan. 1869.</note> and to the notes which accompany
      them: a few notes at the end of this volume may be of use to students of Saga literature.</p>
     <p>For the original tale we think little apology is <pb n="vi"/> due; that it holds a very high
      place among the Sagas of Iceland no students of that literature will deny; of these we think
      it yields only to the story of Njal and his sons, a work in our estimation to be placed beside
      the few great works of the world. Our Saga is fuller and more complete than the tale of the
      other great outlaw Gisli; less frightful than the wonderfully characteristic and strange
      history of Egil, the son of Skallagrim; as personal and dramatic as that of Gunnlaug the
      Worm-tongue, if it lack the rare sentiment of that beautiful story with more detail and
      consistency, if with less variety, than the history of Gudrun and her lovers in the Laxdæla;
      and more a work of art than that, or than the unstrung gems of Eyrbyggja, and the great
      compilation of Snorri Sturluson, the History of the Kings of Norway.</p>
     <p>At any rate, we repeat, whatever place among the best Sagas may be given to Grettla<note
       place="foot">Such is the conversational title of this Saga; many of the other Sagas have
       their longer title abbreviated in a like manner: Egil's saga becomes Egla, Njal's saga Njála;
       Eyrbyggja saga, Laxdæla saga, Vatnsdæla saga, Reykdæla saga, Svarfdæla saga, become
       Eyrbyggja, Laxdæla, Vatnsdæla, Reykdæla, Svarfdæla (gen. plur. masc. of dælir, dale-dwellers,
       is forced into a fem. sing. regularly declined, saga being understood); furthermore, Landnáma
       bók (landnáma, gen. pl. neut.) the book of land settlings, becomes Landnáma (fern. sing.
       regularly declined, bók being understood); lastly, Sturlunga saga the Saga of the mighty
       family of the Sturlungs, becomes Sturlunga in the same manner.</note> by readers of such
      things, it must of necessity be held to be one of the best in all ways; nor will those, we
      hope, of our readers who have not yet turned their attention to the works written in the
      Icelandic tongue, fail <pb n="vii"/> to be moved more or less by the dramatic power and eager
      interest in human character, shown by our story-teller; we say, we hope, but we are sure that
      no one of insight will disappoint us in this, when he has once accustomed himself to the
      unusual, and, if he pleases, barbarous atmosphere of these ancient stories.</p>
     <p>As some may like to know what they are going to read about before venturing on beginning the
      book, we will now give a short outline of our Saga.</p>
     <p>The first thirteen chapters (which sometimes are met with separately in the Icelandic as the
      Saga of Onund Treefoot), we have considered as an introduction to the story, and have
      accordingly distinguished them from the main body of the book. They relate the doings of
      Grettir's ancestors in Norway, in the lands West over the Sea and in Iceland, and are
      interesting and in many points necessary for the understanding of the subsequent story; one of
      these we note here for the reader's convenience, viz. the consanguinity of Grettir and King
      Olaf the Saint;<note place="foot"><figure n="table">

      </note> for it adds strongly to the significance of the King's refusal to entertain Grettir at
      his court, or to go further into the case of the murder- he was falsely accused of,</p>
     <p>The genealogies of this part of the work agree <pb n="viii"/> closely with those of the
      Landnáma-bók, and of the other most reliable Sagas.</p>
     <p>After this comes the birth of Grettir, and anecdotes (one at least sufficiently monstrous)
      of his unruly childhood; then our hero kills his first man by misadventure, and must leave
      Iceland; wrecked on an isle off Norway, he is taken in there by a lord of that land, and there
      works the deed that makes him a famous man; the slaying of the villanous bearserks, namely,
      who would else have made wreck of the honour and goods of Grettir's host in his absence; this
      great deed, we should say, is prefaced by Grettir's first dealings with the supernatural,
      which characterise this Saga, and throw a strange light on the more ordinary matters
      throughout. The slaying of the bearserks is followed by a feud which Grettir has on his hands
      for the slaying of a braggart who insulted him past bearing, and so great the feud grows that
      Grettir at last finds himself at enmity with Earl Svein, the ruler of Norway, and, delivered
      from death by his friends, yet has to leave the land and betake himself to Iceland again.
      Coming back there, and finding himself a man of great fame, and hungry for more still, he
      tries to measure himself against the greatest men in the land, but nothing comes of these
      trials, for he is being reserved for a greater deed than the dealing with mere men; his enemy
      is Glam the thrall; the revenant of a strange, unearthly man who was himself killed by an evil
      spirit; Grettir contends with, and slays, this monster, whose dying curse on him is the
      turning-point of the story. <pb n="ix"/> All seems fair for our hero, his last deed has made
      him the foremost man in Iceland, and news now coming out of Olaf the Saint, his relative,
      being King of Norway, he goes thither to get honour at his hands; but Glam's curse works;
      Grettir gains a powerful enemy by slaying an insulting braggart just as he was going on
      ship-board; and on the voyage it falls out that in striving to save the life of his shipmates
      by a desperate action, that he gets the reputation of having destroyed the sons of a powerful
      Icelander, Thorir of Garth, with their fellows. This evil report clings to him when he lands
      in Norway; and all people, including the King from whom he hoped so much, look coldly on him;
      now he offers to free himself from the false charge by the ordeal of bearing hot iron; the
      King assents, and all is ready; but Glam is busy, and some strange appearance in the church
      where the ordeal is to be brings all to nothing; and the foreseeing Olaf refuses to take
      Grettir into his court, because of his ill-luck. So he goes to his brother, Thorstein Dromund,
      for a while, and then goes back to Iceland. But there, too, his ill-luck had been at work, and
      when he lands he hears three pieces of bad news at once; his father is dead; his eldest
      brother, Atli, is slain and unatoned; and he himself has been made an outlaw by Thorir of
      Garth for a deed he has never done.</p>
     <p>He avenges his brother, and seeks here and there harbour from his friends, but his foes are
      too strong for him, or some unlucky turn of fate always pushes him off the help of men, and he
      has to take to the <pb n="x"/> wilderness with a price upon his head; and now the other part
      of the curse falls on him heavier, for ever after the struggle with the ghost he sees horrible
      things in the dark, and cannot bear to be alone, and runs all kinds of risks to avoid it; and
      so the years of his outlawry pass on. From time to time driven by need, and rage at his
      unmerited ill-fortune, he takes to plundering those who cannot hold their own; at other times
      he lives alone, and supports himself by fishing, and is twice nearly brought to his end by
      hired assassins the while. Sometimes he dwells with the friendly spirits of the land, and
      chiefly with Hallmund, his friend, who saves his life in one of the desperate fights he is
      forced into. But little by little all fall off from him; his friends durst harbour him no more
      or are slain. Hallmund comes to a tragic end; Grettir is driven from his lairs one after the
      other, and makes up his mind to try, as a last resource, to set himself down on the island of
      Drangey, which rises up sheer from the midst of Skagafirth like a castle; he goes to his
      father's house, and bids farewell to his mother, and sets off for Drangey in the company of
      his youngest brother, Illugi, who will not leave him in this pinch, and a losel called
      "Noise," a good joker (we are told), but a slothful, untrustworthy poltroon. The three get out
      to Drangey, and possess themselves of the live-stock on it, and for a while all goes well; the
      land-owners who held the island in shares, despairing of ridding themselves of the outlaw,
      give their shares or sell them to one Thorbiorn Angle, a man of good house, <pb n="xi"/> but
      violent, unpopular, and unscrupulous. This man, after trying the obvious ways of persuasion,
      cajolery, and assassination, for getting the island into his hands, at last, with the help of
      a certain hag, his foster-mother, has recourse to sorcery; by means of her spells (as the
      story goes) Grettir wounds himself in the leg in the third year of his sojourn at Drangey, and
      though the wound speedily closes, in a week or two gangrene supervenes, and Grettir, at last,
      lies nearly helpless, watched continually by his brother Illugi. The losel, "Noise," now that
      the brothers can no more stir abroad, will not take the trouble to pull up the ladders that
      lead from the top of the island down to the beach; and, amidst all this, helped by a magic
      storm the sorceress has raised, Thorbiorn Angle, with a band of men, surprises the island,
      unroofs the hut of the brothers, and gains ingress there, and after a short struggle (for
      Grettir is already a dying man) slays the great outlaw and captures Illugi in spite of a
      gallant defence; he, too, disdaining to make any terms with the murderers of his brother, is
      slain, and Angle goes away exulting, after he had mutilated the body of Grettir, with the head
      on which so great a price had been put, and the sword which the dead man had borne.</p>
     <p>But now that the mighty man was dead, and people were relieved of their fear of him, the
      minds of men turned against him who had overcome him in a way, according to their notions, so
      base and unworthy, and Angle has no easy time of it; he fails to get the head-money, and is
      himself brought to trial <pb n="xii"/> for sorcery and practising heathen rites, and the
      'nithings-deed' of slaying a man already dying, and is banished from the land.</p>
     <p>Now comes the part so necessary to the Icelandic tale of a hero, the revenging of his death;
      Angle goes to Norway, and is thought highly of for his deed by people who did not know the
      whole tale; but Thorstein Dromund, an elder half-brother of Grettir, is a lord in that land,
      and Angle knowing of this feels uneasy in Norway, and at last goes away to Micklegarth
      (Constantinople), to take service with the Varangians: Thorstein hears of this and follows
      him, and both are together at last in Micklegarth, but neither knows the other: at last Angle
      betrays himself by showing Grettir's sword, at a 'weapon-show' of the Varangians, and
      Thorstein slays him then and there with the same weapon. Thorstein alone in a strange land,
      with none to speak for him, is obliged to submit to the laws of the country, and is thrown
      into a dungeon to perish of hunger and wretchedness there. From this fate he is delivered by a
      great lady of the city, called Spes, who afterwards falls in love with him; and the two meet
      often in spite of the watchful jealousy of the lady's husband, who is at last so completely
      conquered by a plot of hers (the sagaman here has taken an incident with little or no change
      from the Romance of Tristram and Iseult), that he is obliged to submit to a divorce and the
      loss of his wife's dower, and thereafter the lovers go away together to Norway, and live there
      happily till old age reminds them of their misdeeds, and they then set off together for <pb
       n="xiii"/> Rome and pass the rest of their lives in penitence and apart from one another. And
      so the story ends, summing up the worth of Grettir the Strong by reminding people, of his huge
      strength, his long endurance in outlawry, his gift for dealing with ghosts and evil spirits,
      the famous vengeance taken for him in Micklegarth; and, lastly, the fortunate life and good
      end of Thorstein Dromund, his brother and avenger.</p>
     <p>Such is the outline of this tale of a man far above his fellows in all matters valued among
      his times and people, but also far above them all in ill-luck, for that is the conception that
      the story-teller has formed, of the great outlaw. To us moderns the real interest in these
      records of a past state of life lies principally in seeing events true in the main treated
      vividly and dramatically by people who completely understood the manners, life, and, above
      all, the. turn of mind of the actors in them. Amidst many drawbacks, perhaps, to the modern
      reader, this interest is seldom or ever wanting in the historical sagas, and least of all in
      our present story; the sagaman never relaxes his grasp of Grettir's character, and he is the
      same man from beginning to end; thrust this way and that by circumstances, but little altered
      by them; unlucky in all things, yet made strong to bear all ill-luck; scornful of the world,
      yet capable of enjoyment, and determined to make the most of it; not deceived by men's
      specious ways, but disdaining to cry out because he must needs bear with them; scorning men,
      yet helping them when called on, and desirous of fame: prudent in theory, and wise in
      foreseeing the inevitable <pb n="xiv"/> sequence of events, but reckless beyond the
      recklessness even of that time and people, and finally capable of inspiring in others strong
      affection and devotion to him in spite of his rugged self-sufficing temper--all these traits
      which we find in our sagaman's Grettir seem always the most suited to the story of the deeds
      that surround him, and to our mind most skilfully and dramatically are they suggested to the
      reader.</p>
     <p>As is fitting the other characters are very much subordinate to the principal figure, but in
      their way they are no less life-like; the braggart--that inevitable foil to the hero in a
      saga--was never better represented than in the Gisli of our tale; the thrall Noise, with his
      carelessness, and thriftless, untrustworthy mirth, is the very pattern of a slave; Snorri the
      Godi, little though there is of him, fully sustains the prudent and crafty character. which
      follows him in all the Sagas; Thorbiorn Oxmain is a good specimen of the overbearing and sour
      chief, as is Atli, on the other hand, of the kindly and high-minded, if prudent rich man; and
      no one, in short, plays his part like a puppet but acts as one expects him to act, always
      allowing the peculiar atmosphere of these tales; and to crown all, as the story comes to its
      end, the high-souled and poetically conceived Illugi throws a tenderness on the dreadful story
      of the end of the hero, contrasted as it is with that of the gloomy, superstitious Angle.</p>
     <p>Something of a blot from some points of view the story of Spes and Thorstein Dromund (of
      which, more anon) must be considered; yet whoever added it to the tale did so with some skill
      considering its <pb n="xv"/> incongruous and superfluous nature, for he takes care that
      Grettir shall not be forgotten amidst all the plots and success of the lovers; and, whether it
      be accidental or not, there is to our minds something touching in the contrast between the
      rude life and tragic end of the hero, and the long, drawn out, worldly good hap and quiet
      hopes for another life which fall to the lot of his happier brother.</p>
     <p>As to the authorship of our story, it has no doubt gone through the stages which mark the
      growth of the Sagas in general, that is, it was for long handed about from mouth to mouth
      until it took a definite shape in men's minds; and after it held that position for a certain
      time, and had received all the necessary .polish for an enjoyable saga, was committed to
      writing as it flowed ready made from the tongue of the people; its style in common with that
      of all the sagas shows evidences enough of this: for the rest the only name connected with it
      is that of Sturla Thordson the Lawman, a man of good position and family, and a prolific
      author, who was born in 1214 and died 1284; there is, however, no proof that he wrote the
      present work, though we think the passages in it that mention his name show clearly enough
      that he had something to do with the story of Grettir: on the whole, we are inclined to think
      that a story of Grettir was either written by him or under his auspices, but that the present
      tale is the work of a later hand, nor do we think so complete a saga-teller as his other
      undoubted works show him to have been, would ever have finished his story with the epilogue
       <pb n="xvi"/> of Spes and Thorstein Dromund, steeped as that latter part is with the spirit
      of the mcdiæval romances, even to the distinct appropriation of a marked and well-known
      episode of the Tristram; though it must be admitted that he had probably plenty of opportunity
      for being versed in that romance, as Tristram was first translated into the tongue of Norway
      in the year 1226, by Brother Robert, at the instance of King Hakon Hakonson, the history of
      whose time was the favourite study of Sturla Thordson, the results of which he has embodied in
      Hakonar saga, Heimskr. (Bd. V.)</p>
     <p>For our translation of this work we have no more to say than to apologise for its
      shortcomings, and to hope, that in spite of them, it will give some portion of the pleasure to
      our readers which we felt in accomplishing it ourselves.</p>

     <head>CHAP. I.</head>
     <note><p>This First Part tells of the forefathers of Grettir in Norway, and how they fled away
       before Harald Fairhair, and settled in Iceland; and of their deeds in Iceland before Grettir
       was born</p></note>
     <p>THERE was a man named Onund, who was the son of Ufeigh Clubfoot, the son of Ivar the Smiter;
      Onund was brother of Gudbiorg, the mother of Gudbrand Ball, the father of Asta, the mother of
      King Olaf the Saint. Onund was an Uplander by the kin of his mother; but the kin of his father
      dwelt chiefly about Rogaland and Hordaland. He was a great viking, and went harrying west over
      the Sea.<note place="foot">"West over the Sea," means in the Sagas the British isles, and the
       islands about them--the Hebrides, Orkneys, &amp;c.</note> Balk of Sotanes, the son of Blæng,
      was with him herein, and Orm the Wealthy withal, and Hallvard was the name of the third of
      them. They had five ships, all well manned, and therewith they harried in the
       South-isles;<note place="foot">South-isles are the Hebrides, and the other islands down to
       Man.</note> and when they came to Barra, they found there a king, called Kiarval, and he,
      too, had five ships. They gave him battle, and a hard fray there was. The men of Onund were of
      the eagerest, and on either side many fell; but the <pb n="2"/> end of it was that the king
      fled with only one ship. So there the men of Onund took both ships and much wealth, and abode
      there through the winter. For three summers they harried throughout Ireland and Scotland, and
      thereafter went to Norway.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2">
     <p>IN those days were there great troubles in Norway. Harald the Unshorn,<note place="foot"
       >"Harald the Unshorn:" he was so called at first because he made a vow not to cut his hair
       till he was sole king of Norway. When he had attained to this, and Earl Rognvald had taken
       him to the bath and trimmed his hair, he was called "Fair-hair," from its length and
       beauty.</note> son of Halfdan the Black, was pushing forth for the kingdom. Before that he
      was King of the Uplands; then he went north through the land, and had many battles there, and
      ever won the day. Thereafter he harried south in the land, and wheresoever he came, laid all
      under him; but when he came to Hordaland, swarms of folk came thronging against him; and their
      captains were Kiotvi the Wealthy, and Thorir Longchin, and those of South Rogaland, and King
      Sulki. Geirmund Helskin was then in the west over the Sea; nor was he in that battle, though
      he had a kingdom in Hordaland.</p>
     <p>Now that autumn Onund and his fellows came from the west over the Sea; and when Thorir
      Longchin and King Kiotvi heard thereof, they sent men to meet them, and prayed them for help,
      and promised them honours. Then they entered into fellowship with Thorir and his men; for they
      were exceeding fain to try their strength, and said that there would they be whereas the fight
      was hottest.</p>
     <p>Now was the meeting with Harald the King in Rogaland, <pb n="3"/> in that firth which is
      called Haftsfirth; and both sides had many men. This was the greatest battle that has ever
      been fought in Norway, and hereof most Sagas tell; for of those is ever most told, of whom the
      Sagas are made; and thereto came folk from all the land, and many from other lands and swarms
      of vikings.</p>
     <p>Now Onund laid his ship alongside one board of the ship of Thorir Longchin, about the midst
      of the fleet, but King Harald laid his on the other board, because Thorir was the greatest
      bearserk, and the stoutest of men; so the fight was of the fiercest on either side. Then the
      king cried on his bearserks for an onslaught, and they were called the Wolf-coats, for on them
      would no steel bite, and when they set on nought might withstand them. Thorir defended him
      very stoutly, and fell in all hardihood on board his ship; then was it cleared from stem to
      stern, and cut from the grapplings, and let drift astern betwixt the other ships. Thereafter
      the king's men laid their ship alongside Onund's, and he was in the forepart thereof and
      fought manly; then the king's folk said, "Lo, a forward man in the forecastle there, let him
      have somewhat to mind him how that he was in this battle." Now Onund put one foot out over the
      bulwark and dealt a blow at a man, and even therewith a spear was aimed at him, and as he put
      the blow from him he bent backward withal, and one of the king's forecastle men smote at him,
      and the stroke took his leg below the knee and sheared it off, and forthwith made him unmeet
      for fight. Then fell the more part of the folk on board his ship; but Onund was brought to the
      ship of him who is called Thrand; he was the son of Biorn, and brother of Eyvind the Eastman;
      he was in the fight against King Harald and lay on the other board of Onund's ship. <pb n="4"
      /> But now, after these things, the more part of the fleet scattered in flight; Thrand and his
      men, with the other vikings, got them away each as he might, and sailed west over the Sea;
      Onund went with him, and Balk and Hallvard Sweeping; Onund was healed, but went with a wooden
      leg all his life after; therefore as long as he lived was he called Onund Treefoot.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
     <p>AT that time were many great men west over the Sea, such as had fled from their lands in
      Norway before King Harald, because he had made all those outlaws, who had met him in battle,
      and taken to him their possessions. So, when Onund was healed of his wounds, he and Thrand
      went to meet Geirmund Helskin, because he was the most famed of vikings west there over the
      Sea, and they asked him whether he had any mind to seek after that kingdom which he had in
      Hordaland, and offered him their fellowship herein; for they deemed they had a sore loss of
      their lands there, since Onund was both mighty and of great kin.</p>
     <p>Geirmund said that so great had grown the strength of King Harald, that he deemed there was
      little hope that they would win honour in their war with him when men had been worsted, even
      when all the folk of the land had been drawn together; and yet withal that he was loth to
      become a king's thrall and pray for that which was his own; that he would find somewhat better
      to do than that; and now, too, he was no longer young. So Onund and his fellows went back to
      the South-isles, and there met many of their friends.</p>
     <p>There was a man, Ufeigh by name, who was bynamed <pb n="5"/> Grettir; he was the son of
      Einar, the son of Olvir Bairn-Carle; he was brother to Oleif the Broad, the father of Thormod
      Shaft; Steinulf was the name of Olvir Bairn-Carle's son, he was the father of Una whom
      Thorbiorn Salmon-Carle had to wife. Another son of Olvir Bairn-Carle was Steinmod, the father
      of Konal, who was the father of Aldis of Barra. The son of Konal was Steinmod, the father of
      Haldora, the wife of Eilif, the son of Ketil the One-handed. Ufeigh Grettir had to wife Asny,
      the daughter of Vestar Hængson; and Asmund the Beardless and Asbiorn were the sons of Ufeigh
      Grettir, but his daughters were these, Aldis, and Asa, and Asvor. Ufeigh had fled away west
      over the Sea before Harald the king, and so had Thormod Shaft his kinsman, and had with them
      their kith and kin; and they harried in Scotland, and far and wide west beyond the Sea.</p>
     <p>Now Thrand and Onund Treefoot made west for Ireland to find Eyvind the Eastman, Thrand's
      brother, who was Land-ward along the coasts of Ireland; the mother of Eyvind was Hlif, the
      daughter of Rolf, son of Ingiald, the son of King Frodi; but Thrand's mother was Helga, the
      daughter of Ondott the Crow; Biorn was the name of the father of Eyvind and Thrand, he was the
      son of Rolf from Am; he had had to flee from Gothland, for that he had burned in his house
      Sigfast, the son-in-law of King Solver; and thereafter had he gone to Norway, and was the next
      winter with Grim the hersir, the son of Kolbiorn the Abasher. Now Grim had a mind to murder
      Biorn for his money, so he fled thence to Ondott the Crow, who dwelt in Hvinisfirth in Agdir;
      he received Biorn well,, and Biorn was with him in the winter, but was in warfare in
      summertide, until Hlif his wife died; and after that Ondott gave Biorn Helga his daughter, and
      then Biorn left off warring. <pb n="6"/> Now thereon Eyvind took to him the war-ships of his
      father, and was become a great chief west over the Sea he wedded Rafarta, the daughter of
      Kiarval, King of Ireland their sons were Helgi the Lean and Sn&#156;biorn.</p>
     <p>So when Thrand and Onund came to the South-isles, there they met Ufeigh Grettir and Thormod
      Shaft, and great friendship grew up betwixt them, for each thought he had gained from hell the
      last who had been left behind in Norway while the troubles there were at the highest. But
      Onund was exceeding moody, and when Thrand marked it, he asked what he was brooding over in
      his mind. Onund answered, and sang this stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>What joy since that day can I get</l>
      <l>When shield-fire's thunder last I met</l>
      <l>Ah, too soon clutch the claws of ill;</l>
      <l>For that axe-edge shall grieve me still.</l>
      <l>In eyes of fighting man and thane,</l>
      <l>My strength and manhood are but vain,</l>
      <l>This is the thing that makes me grow</l>
      <l>A joyless man; is it enow?"</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Thrand answered that whereso he was, he would still be deemed a brave man, "And now it is
      meet for thee to settle down and get married, and I would put forth my word and help, if I but
      knew whereto thou lookest."</p>
     <p>Onund said he did in manly wise, but that his good hope for matches of any gain was gone by
      now.</p>
     <p>Thrand answered, "Ufeigh has a daughter who is called Asa, thitherward will we turn if it
      seem good to thee." Onund showed that he was willing enough hereto; so after wards they talked
      the matter over with Ufeigh; he answered well, and said that he knew how that Onund was a man
      of <pb n="7"/> great kin and rich of chattels; "but his lands," said he, "I put at low worth,
      nor do I deem him to be a hale man, and withal my daughter is but a child."</p>
     <p>Thrand said, that Onund was a brisker man yet than many who were hale of both legs, and so
      by Thrand's help was this bargain struck; Ufeigh was to give his daughter but chattels for
      dowry, because those lands that were in Norway neither would lay down any money for.</p>
     <p>AL little after Thrand wooed the daughter of Thormod Shaft, and both were to sit in troth
      for three winters.</p>
     <p>So thereafter they went a harrying in the summer, but were in Barra in the winter-tide.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="4">
     <p>THERE were two vikings called Vigbiod and Vestmar; they were South-islanders, and lay out
      both winter and summer; they had thirteen ships, and harried mostly in Ireland, and did many
      an ill deed there till Eyvind the Eastman took the land-wardship; thereafter they got them
      gone to the South-isles, and harried there and all about the firths of Scotland: against these
      went Thrand and Onund, and heard that they had sailed to that island, which is called Bute.
      Now Onund and his folk came there with five ships; and when the vikings see their ships and
      know how many they are, they deem they have enough strength gathered there, and take their
      weapons and lay their ships in the midst betwixt two cliffs, where was a great and deep sound;
      only on one side could they be set on, and that with but five ships at once. Now Onund was the
      wisest of men, and bade lay five ships up into the sound, so <pb n="8"/> that he and his might
      have back way when they would, for there was plenty of sea-room astern. On one board of them
      too was a certain island, and under the lee thereof he let one ship lie, and his men brought
      many great stones forth on to the sheer cliffs above, yet might not be seen withal from the
      ships.</p>
     <p>Now the vikings laid their ships boldly enough for the attack, and thought that the others
      quailed; and Vigbiod asked who they were that were in such jeopardy. Thrand said that he was
      the brother of Eyvind the Eastman, "and here beside me is Onund Treefoot my fellow."</p>
     <p>Then laughed the vikings, and shouted--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>Treefoot, Treefoot, foot of tree,</l>
      <l>Trolls take thee and thy company.</l>
     </lg>

     <p>"Yea, a sight it is seldom seen of us, that such men should go into battle as have no might
      over themselves."</p>
     <p>Onund said that they could know nought thereof ere it were tried; and withal they laid their
      ships alongside one of the other, and there began a great fight, and either side did boldly.
      But when they came to handy blows, Onund gave back toward the cliff, and when the vikings saw
      this, they deemed he was minded to flee, and made towards his ship, and came as nigh to the
      cliff as they might. But in that very point of time those came forth on to the edge of the
      cliff who were appointed so to do, and sent at the vikings so great a flight of stones that
      they might not withstand it.</p>
     <p>Then fell many of the viking-folk, and others were hurt so that they might not bear weapon;
      and withal they were fain to draw back, and might not, because their ships were even then come
      into the narrowest of the sound, and they were huddled together both by the ships and the <pb
       n="9"/> stream; but Onund and his men set on fiercely, whereas Vigbiod was, but Thrand set on
      Vestmar, and won little thereby; so, when the folk were thinned on Vigbiod's ship, Onund's men
      and Onund himself got ready to board her: that Vigbiod saw, and cheered on his men without
      stint: then he turned to meet Onund, and the more part fled before him; but Onund bade his men
      mark how it went between them; for he was of huge strength. Now they set a log of wood under
      Onund's knee, so that he stood firmly enow; the viking fought his way forward along the ship
      till he reached Onund, and he smote at him with his sword, and the stroke took the shield, and
      sheared off all it met and then the sword drove into the log that Onund had under his knee,
      and stuck fast therein; and Vigbiod stooped in drawing it out, and even therewith Onund smote
      at his shoulder in such wise, that he cut the arm from off him, and then was the viking unmeet
      for battle.</p>
     <p>But when Vestmar knew that his fellow was fallen, he leaped into the furthermost ship and
      fled with all those who might reach her. Thereafter they ransacked the fallen men; and by then
      was Vigbiod nigh to his death: Onund went up to him, and sang-</p>


     <lg>
      <l>Yea, seest thou thy wide wounds bleed?</l>
      <l>What of shrinking didst thou heed</l>
      <l>In the one-foot sling of gold?</l>
      <l>What scratch here dost thou behold?</l>
      <l>And in e'en such wise as this</l>
      <l>Many an axe-breaker there is</l>
      <l>Strong of tongue and weak of hand</l>
      <l>Tried thou wert, and mighest not stand."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>So there they took much spoil and sailed back to Barra in the autumn.</p>
    </div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="5">
     <pb n="10"/>
     <p>THE summer after this they made ready to fare west to Ireland. But at that time Balk and
      Hallvard betook themselves from the lands west over the Sea, and went out to Iceland, for from
      thence came tales of land good to choose. Balk settled land in Ramfirth and dwelt at either
      Balkstead; Hallvard settled Sweepingsfirth, and Hallwick out to the Stair, and dwelt
      there.</p>
     <p>Now Thrand and Onund met Eyvind the Eastman, and he received his brother well; but when he
      knew that Onund was come with him, then he waxed wroth, and would fain set on him. Thrand bade
      him do it not, and said that it was not for him to wage war against Northmen, and least of all
      such men as fared peaceably. Eyvind said that he fared otherwise before, and had broken the
      peace of Kiarval the King, and that he should now pay for all. Many words the brothers had
      over this, till Thrand said at last that one fate should befall both him and Onund; and then
      Eyvind let himself be appeased.</p>
     <p>So they dwelt there long that summer, and went on warfare with Eyvind, who found Onund to be
      the bravest of men. In the autumn they fared to the South-isles, and Eyvind gave to Thrand to
      take all the heritage of their father, if Biorn should die before Thrand.</p>
     <p>Now were the twain in the South-isles until they wedded their wives, and some winters after
      withal.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
     <pb n="11"/>
     <p>AND now it came to pass that Biorn, the father of Thrand, died; and when Grim the hersir
      hears thereof he went to meet Ondott Crow, and claimed the goods left by Biorn; but Ondott
      said that Thrand had the heritage after his father; Grim said that Thrand was west over seas,
      and that Biorn was a Gothlander of kin, and that the king took the heritage of all outland
      men. Ondott said that he should keep the goods for the hands of Thrand, his daughter's son;
      and therewith Grim gat him gone, and had nought for his claiming the goods.</p>
     <p>Now Thrand had news of his father's death, and straightway got ready to go from the
      South-isles, and Onund Treefoot with him; but Ufelgh Grettir and Thormod Shaft went out to
      Iceland with their kith and kin, and came out to the Eres in the south country, and dwelt the
      first winter with Thorbiorn Salmon-Carle.</p>
     <p>Thereafter the settled Gnup-Wards'-rape, Ufeigh, the outward part, between Thwart-river and
      Kalf-river, and he dwelt at Ufeigh's-stead by Stone-holt; but Thormod settled the eastward
      part, and abode at Shaft-holt.</p>
     <p>The daughters of Thormod were these: Thorvor, mother of Thorod the Godi<note place="foot"
       >"Gadi" is the name for the rulers of the thirty-nine districts into which the republic of
       Iceland was anciently divided. While the ancient religion lasted, their office combined in
       itself the highest civil and sacerdotal functions.</note> of Hialli, and Thora, mother of
      Thorstein, the Godi, the father of Biarni the Sage.</p>
     <p>Now it is to be said of Thrand and Onund that they sailed from the lands west over the Sea
      toward Norway, and <pb n="12"/> had fair wind, and such speed, that no rumour of their voyage
      was abroad till they came to Ondott Crow.</p>
     <p>He gave Thrand good welcome, and told him how Grim the hersir had claimed the heritage left
      by Biorn. "Meeter it seems to me, kinsman," said he, "that thou take the heritage of thy
      father and not king's-thralls; good luck has befallen thee, in that none knows of thy coming,
      but it misdoubts me that Grim will come upon one or other of us if he may; therefore I would
      that thou shouldst take the inheritance to thee, and get thee gone to other lands."</p>
     <p>Thrand said that so he would do, he took to him the chattels and got away from Norway at his
      speediest; but before he sailed into the sea, he asked Onund Treefoot whether he would not
      make for Iceland with him; Onund said he would first go see his kin and friends in the south
      country.</p>
     <p>Thrand said, "Then must we part now, but I would that thou shouldst aid my kin, for on them
      will vengeance fall if I get off clear; but to Iceland shall I go, and I would that thou
      withal shouldst make that journey."</p>
     <p>Onund gave his word to all, and they parted in good love. So Thrand went to Iceland, and
      Ufeigh and Thormod Shaft received him well. Thrand dwelt at Thrand's-holt, which is west of
      Steer's-river.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="7">
     <p>ONUND went south to Rogaland, and met there many of his kin and friends; he dwelt there in
      secret at a man's called Kolbein. Now he heard that the king had taken his lands to him and
      set a man thereover who was called Harek, who was a farmer of the king's; so on a night <pb
       n="13"/> Onund went to him, and took him in his house; there Harek was led out and cut down,
      and Onund took all the chattels they found and burnt the homestead; and thereafter he abode in
      many places that winter.</p>
     <p>But that autumn Grim the hersir slew Ondott Crow, because he might not get the
      heritage-money for the king; and that same night of his slaying, Signy, his wife, brought
      aboard ship all her chattels, and fared with her sons, Asmund and Asgrim, to Sighvat her
      father; but a little after sent her sons to Soknadale to Hedin her foster-father; but that
      seemed good to them but for a little while, and they would fain go back again to their mother;
      so they departed and came at Yule-tide to Ingiald the rusty at Hvin; he took them in because
      of the urgency of Gyda his wife, and they were there the winter through. But in spring came
      Onund north to Agdir, because he had heard of the slaying of Ondott Crow; but when he found
      Signy he asked her what help she would have of him.</p>
     <p>She said that she would fain have vengeance on Grim the hersir for the slaying of Ondott.
      Then were the sons of Ondott sent for, and when they met Onund Treefoot, they made up one
      fellowship together, and had spies abroad on the doings of Grim. Now in the summer was a great
      ale-drinking held at Grim's, because he had bidden to him Earl Audun; and when Onund and the
      sons of Ondott knew thereof they went to Grim's homestead and laid fire to the house, for they
      were come there unawares, and burnt Grim the hersir therein, and nigh thirty men, and many
      good things they took there withal. Then went Onund to the woods, but the sons of Ondott took
      a boat of Ingiald's, their foster-father's, and rowed away therein, and lay hid a little way
      off the homestead. Earl Audun came to the feast, even as had been settled afore, and there
      "missed friend <pb n="14"/> from stead." Then he gathered men to him, and dwelt there some
      nights, but nought was heard of Onund and his fellows; and the Earl slept in a loft with two
      men.</p>
     <p>Onund had full tidings from the homestead, and sent after those brothers; and, when they
      met, Onund asked them whether they would watch the farm or fall on the Earl; but they chose to
      set on the Earl. So they drove beams at the loft-doors and broke them in; then Asmund caught
      hold of the two who were with the Earl, and cast them down so hard that they were well-nigh
      slain; but Asgrim ran at the Earl, and bade him render up weregild for his father, since he
      had been in the plot and the onslaught with Grim the hersir when Ondott Crow was slain. The
      Earl said he had no money with him there, and prayed for delay of that payment. Then Asgrim
      set his spear-point to the Earl-s breast and bade him pay there and then; so the Earl took a
      chain from his neck, and three gold rings, and a cloak of rich web, and gave them up. Asgrim
      took the goods and gave the Earl a name, and called him Audun Goaty.</p>
     <p>But when the bonders and neighbouring folk were ware that war was come among them, they went
      abroad and would bring help to the Earl, and a hard fight there was, for Onund had many men,
      and there fell many good bonders and courtmen of the Earl. Now came the brothers, and told how
      they had fared with the Earl, and Onund said that it was ill that he was not slain, "that
      would have been somewhat of a revenge on the King for our loss at his hands of fee and
      friends." They said that this was a greater shame to the Earl; and therewith they went away up
      to Sorreldale to Eric Alefain, a king's lord, and he took them in for all the winter.</p>
     <p>Now at Yule they drank turn and turn about with a man called Hallstein, who was bynamed
      Horse; Eric gave the <pb n="15"/> first feast, well and truly, and then Hallstein gave his,
      but thereat was there bickering between them, and Hallstein smote Eric with a deer-horn; Eric
      gat no revenge therefor, but went home straightway. This sore misliked the sons of Ondott, and
      a little after Asgrim fared to Hallstein's homestead, and went in alone, and gave him a great
      wound, but those who were therein sprang up and set on Asgrim. Asgrim defended himself well
      and got out of their hands in the dark; but they deemed they had slain him.</p>
     <p>Onund and Asmund heard thereof and supposed him dead, but deemed they might do nought. Eric
      counselled them to make for Iceland, and said that it would be of no avail to abide there in
      the land whenso the king should bring matters about to his liking. So this they did, and made
      them ready for Iceland and had each one ship. Hallstein lay wounded, and died before Onund and
      his folk sailed. Kolbein withal, who is afore mentioned, went abroad with Onund.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">
     <p>NOW Onund and Asmund sailed into the sea when they were ready, and held company together;
      then sang Onund this stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>Meet was I in days agone</l>
      <l>For storm, wherein the Sweeping One,</l>
      <l>Midst rain of swords, and the darts' breath,</l>
      <l>Blew o'er all a gale of death.</l>
      <l>Now a maimed, one-footed man</l>
      <l>On rollers' steed through waters wan</l>
      <l>Out to Iceland must I go;</l>
      <l>Ah, the skald is sinking low."</l>
     </lg>

     <pb n="16"/>
     <p>They had a hard voyage of it and much of baffling gales from the south, and drove north into
      the main; but they made Iceland, and were by then come to the north off Longness when they
      found where they were: so little space there was betwixt them that they spake together; and
      Asmund said that they had best sail to Islefirth, and thereto they both agreed; then they beat
      up toward the land, and a south-east wind sprang up; but when Onund and his folk laid the ship
      close to the wind, the yard was sprung; then they took in sail, and therewith were driven off
      to sea; but Asmund got under the lee of Brakeisle, and there lay till a fair wind brought him
      into Islefirth; Helgi the Lean gave him all Kræklings'-lithe, and he dwelt at South
      Glass-river; Asgrim his brother came out some winters later and abode at North Glass-river; he
      was the father of Ellida-Grim, the father of Asgrim Ellida-Grimson.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="9">
     <p>NOW it is to be told of Onund Treefoot that he drave out to sea for certain days, but at
      last the wind got round to the north, and they sailed for land: then those knew who had been
      there before that they had come west off the Skagi; then they sailed into Strand-Bay, and near
      to the South-Strands, and there rowed toward them six men in a ten-oared boat, who bailed the
      big ship, and asked who was their captain; Onund named himself, and asked whence they came;
      they said they were house-carles of Thorvald, from Drangar; Onund asked if all land through
      the Strands had been settled; they said there was little unsettled in the inner Strands, and
      none north thereof. Then <pb n="17"/> Onund asked his shipmates, whether they would make for
      the west country, or take such as they had been told of; they chose to view the land first. So
      they sailed in up the bay, and brought to in a creek off Arness, then put forth a boat and
      rowed to land. There dwelt a rich man, Eric Snare, who had taken land betwixt Ingolfs-firth,
      and Wayless in Fishless; but when Eric knew that Onund was come there, he bade him take of his
      hands whatso he would, but said that there was little that had not been settled before. Onund
      said he would first see what there was; so they went landward south past some firths, till
      they came to Wayless; then said Eric, "Here is what there is to look to; all from here is
      unsettled, and right in to the settlements of Bjorn." Now a great mountain went down the
      eastern side of the firth, and snow had fallen thereon, Onund looked on that mountain, and
      sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Brand-whetter's life awry doth go.</l>
      <l>Fair lands and wide full well I know;</l>
      <l>Past house, and field, and fold of man,</l>
      <l>The swift steed of the rollers ran:</l>
      <l>My lands, and kin, I left behind,</l>
      <l>That I this latter day might find,</l>
      <l>Coldback for sunny meads to have;</l>
      <l>Hard fate a bitter bargain drave."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Eric answered, "Many have lost so much in Norway, that it may not be bettered: and I think
      withal that most lands in the main-settlements are already settled, and therefore I urge thee
      not to go from hence; but I shall hold to what I spake, that thou mayst have whatso of my
      lands seems meet to thee." Onund said, that he would take that offer, and so he settled land
      out from Wayless over the three <pb n="18"/> creeks, Byrgis-Creek, Kolbein's-Creek, and
      Coldback-Creek, up to Coldback-Cleft. Thereafter Eric gave him all Fishless, and Reekfirth,
      and all Reekness, out on that side of the firth; but as to drifts there was nought set forth,
      for they were then so plentiful that every man had of them what he would. Now Onund set up a
      household at Coldback, and had many men about him; but when his goods began to grow great he
      had another stead in Reekfirth. Kolbein dwelt at Kolbein's-Creek. So Onund abode in peace for
      certain winters.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="10">
     <p>NOW Onund was so brisk a man, that few, even of whole men, could cope with him; and his name
      withal was well known throughout the land, because of his forefathers. After these things,
      befell that strife betwixt Ufeigh Grettir and Thorbiorn Earls'-champion, which had such
      ending, that Ufeigh fell before Thorbiorn in Grettir's-Gill, near Heel. There were many drawn
      together to the sons of Ufeigh concerning the blood-suit, and Onund Treefoot was sent for, and
      rode south in the spring, and guested at Hvamm, with Aud the Deep-minded, and she gave him
      exceeding good welcome, because he had been with her west over the Sea. In those days Olaf
      Feilan, her son's son, was a man full grown, and Aud was by then worn with great eld; she bade
      Onund know that she would have Olaf, her kinsman, married; and was fain that he should woo
      Aldis of Barra, who was cousin to Asa, whom Onund had to wife. Onund deemed the matter
      hopeful, and Olaf rode south with him. So when Onund met his friends and kin-in-law <pb n="19"
      /> they bade him abide with them: then was the suit talked over, and was laid to Kialarnes
      Thing, for as then the Althing was not yet set up. So the case was settled by umpiredom, and
      heavy weregild came for the slayings, and Thorbiorn Earls'-champion was outlawed. His son was
      Solmund, the father of Kari the Singed; father and son dwelt abroad a long time
      afterwards.</p>
     <p>Thrand bade Onund and Olaf to his house, and so did Thormod Shaft, and they backed Olaf's
      wooing, which was settled with ease, because men knew how mighty a woman Aud was. So the
      bargain was made, and, so much being done, Onund rode home, and Aud thanked him well for his
      help to Olaf. That autumn Olaf Feilan wedded Aldis of Barra; and then died Aud the
      Deep-minded, as is told in the story of the Laxdale men.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
     <p>ONUND and Asa had two sons; the elder was called Thorgeir, the younger Ufeigh Grettir; but
      Asa soon died. Thereafter Onund got to wife a woman called Thordis, the daughter of Thorgrim,
      from Gnup in Midfirth, and akin to Midfirth Skeggi. Of her Onund had a son called Thorgrim; he
      was early a big man, and a strong, wise, and good withal in matters of husbandry. Onund dwelt
      on at Coldback till he was old, then he died in his bed, and is buried in Treefoot's barrow;
      he was the briskest and lithest of one-footed men who have ever lived in Iceland.</p>
     <p>Now Thorgrim took the lead among the sons of Onund, though others of them were older than
      he; but when he was twenty-five years old he grew grey-haired, and therefore <pb n="20"/> was
      he bynamed Greypate; Thordis, his mother, was afterwards wedded north in Willowdale, to Audun
      Skokul, and their son was Asgeir, of Asgeir's-River. Thorgrim Greypate and his brothers had
      great possessions in common, nor did they divide the goods between them. Now Erie, who farmed
      at Arness, as is aforesaid, had to wife Alof, daughter of Ingolf, of Ingolfs-firth; and Flosi
      was the name of their son, a hopeful man, and of many friends. In those days three brothers
      came out hither, Ingolf, Ufeigh, and Eyvind, and settled those three firths that are known by
      their names, and there dwelt afterwards. Olaf was the name of Eyvind's son, he first dwelt at
      Eyvind's-firth, and after at Drangar, and was a man to hold his own well.</p>
     <p>Now there was no strife betwixt these men while their elders were alive; but when Eric died,
      it seemed to Flosi, that those of Coldback had no lawful title to the lands which Erie had
      given to Onund; and from this befell much ill-blood betwixt them; but Thorgrim and his kin
      still held their lands as before, but they might not risk having sports together. Now Thorgeir
      was head-man of the household of those brothers in Reekfirth, and would ever be rowing out
      a-fishing, because in those days were the firths full of fish; so those in the Creek made up
      their plot; a man there was, a house-carle of Flosi in Arness, called Thorfin, him Flosi sent
      for Thorgeir's head, and he went and hid himself in the boat-stand; that morning, Thorgeir got
      ready to row out to sea, and two men with him, one called Hamund, the other Brand. Thorgeir
      went first, and had on his back a leather bottle and drink therein. It was very dark, and as
      he walked down from the boat-stand Thorfin ran at him, and smote him with an axe betwixt the
      shoulders, and the axe sank in, and the bottle squeaked, but he let go the axe, for he deemed
      that there would be little need of binding <pb n="21"/> up, and would save himself as swiftly
      as might be; and it is to be told of him that he ran off to Arness, and came there before
      broad day, and told of Thorgeir's slaying, and said that he should have need of Flosi's
      shelter, and that the only thing to be done was to offer atonement, "for that of all things,"
      said he, "is like to better our strait, great as it has now grown."</p>
     <p>Flosi said that he would first hear tidings; "and I am minded to think that thou art afraid
      after thy big deed."</p>
     <p>Now it is to be said of Thorgeir, that he turned from the blow as the axe smote the bottle,
      nor had he any wound; they made no search for the man because of the dark, so they rowed past
      the firths to Coldback, and told tidings of what had happed; thereat folk made much mocking,
      and called Thorgeir, Bottleback, and that was his by-name ever after.</p>
     <p>And this was sung withal--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>The brave men of days of old,</l>
      <l>Whereof many a tale is told,</l>
      <l>Bathed the whiting of the shield,</l>
      <l>In wounds' house on battle-field</l>
      <l>But the honour-missing fool,</l>
      <l>Both sides of his slaying tool,</l>
      <l>Since faint heart his hand made vain,</l>
      <l>With but curdled milk must stain."</l>
     </lg>
     <lg>
      <l><!--&nbsp;--></l>
     </lg>

    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
     <p>IN those days befell such hard times in Iceland, that nought like them has been known there;
      well-nigh all gettings from the sea, and all drifts, came to an end; <pb n="22"/> and this
      went on for many seasons. One autumn certain chapmen in a big ship were drifted thither, and
      were wrecked there in the Creek, and Flosi took to him four or five of them; Stein was the
      name of their captain; they were housed here and there about the Creek, and were minded to
      build them a new ship from the wreck; but they were unhandy herein, and the ship was over
      small stem and stern, but over big amid-ships.</p>
     <p>That spring befell a great storm from the north, which lasted near a week, and after the
      storm men looked after their drifts. Now there was a mail called Thorstein, who dwelt at
      Reekness; he found a whale driven up on the firthward side of the ness, at a place called
      Rib-Skerries, and the whale was a big whale.</p>
     <p>Thorstein sent forthwith a messenger to Wick to Flosi, and so to the nighest farm-steads.
      Now Einar was the name of the farmer at Combe, and he was a tenant of those of Coldback, and
      had the ward of their drifts on that side of the firths; and now withal he was ware of the
      stranding of the whale: and he took boat and rowed past the firths to Byrgis Creek, whence he
      sent a man to Coldback; and when Thorgrim and his brothers heard that, they got ready at their
      swiftest, and were twelve in a ten-oared boat, and Kolbein's sons fared with them, Ivar and
      Leif, and were six altogether; and all farmers who could bring it about went to the whale.</p>
     <p>Now it is to be told of Flosi that he sent to his kin in Ingolfs-firth and Ufeigh's-firth,
      and for Olaf Eyvindson, who then dwelt at Drangar; and Flosi came first to the whale, with the
      men of the Creek, then they fell to cutting up the whale, and what was cut was forthwith sent
      ashore; near twenty men were thereat at first, but soon folk came thronging thither. <pb
       n="23"/> Therewith came those of Coldback in four boats, and Thorgrim laid claim to the whale
      and forbade the men of Wick to shear, allot, or carry off aught thereof: Flosi bade him show
      if Eric had given Onund Treefoot the drift in clear terms, or else he said he should defend
      himself with arms. Thorgrim thought he and his too few, and would not risk an onset; but
      therewithal came a boat rowing up the firth, and the rowers therein pulled smartly. Soon they
      came up, and there was Swan, from Knoll in Biornfirth, and his house-carles; and straightway,
      when he came, he bade Thorgrim not to let himself be robbed; and great friends they had been
      heretofore, and now Swan offered his aid. The brothers said they would take it, and therewith
      set on fiercely; Thorgeir Bottle-back first mounted the whale against Flosi's house-carles;
      there the afore-named Thorfin was cutting the whale, he was in front nigh the head, and stood
      in a foot-hold he had cut for himself; then Thorgeir said, "Herewith I bring thee back thy
      axe," and smote him on the neck, and struck off his head.</p>
     <p>Flosi was up on the foreshore when he saw that, and he egged on his men to meet them
      hardily; now they fought long together, but those of Coldback had the best of it: few men
      there had weapons except the axes wherewith they were cutting up the whale, and some choppers.
      So the men of Wick gave back to the foreshores; the Eastmen had weapons, and many a wound they
      gave; Stein, the captain, smote a foot off Ivar Kolbeinson, but Leif, Ivar's brother, beat to
      death a fellow of Stein's with a whale-rib; blows were dealt there with whatever could be
      caught at, and men fell on either side. But now came up Olaf and his men from Drangar in many
      boats, and gave help to Flosi, and then those of Coldback were borne back overpowered; but
      they had loaded their boats already, and Swan bade get <pb n="24"/> aboard, and thitherward
      they gave back, and the n-in of Wick came on after them; and when Swan was come down to the
      sea, he smote at Stein, the sea-captain, and gave him a great wound, and then leapt aboard his
      boat; Thorgrim wounded Flosi with a great wound and therewith got away; Olaf cut at Ufeigh
      Grettir, and wounded him to death; but Thorgeir caught Ufeigh up and leapt aboard with him.
      Now those of Coldback row east by the firths, and thus they parted; and this was sung of their
      meeting--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>At Rib-skerries, I hear folk tell,</l>
      <l>A hard and dreadful fray befell,</l>
      <l>For men unarmed upon that day</l>
      <l>With strips of whale-fat made good play.</l>
      <l>Fierce steel-gods these in turn did meet</l>
      <l>With blubber-slices nowise sweet;</l>
      <l>Certes a wretched thing it is</l>
      <l>To tell of squabbles such as this.</l>
     </lg>

     <p>After these things was peace settled between them, and these suits were laid to the Althing;
      there Thorod the Godi and Midfirth-Skeggi, with many of the south-country folk, aided those of
      Coldback; Flosi was outlawed, and many of those who had been with him; and his moneys were
      greatly drained because he chose to pay up all weregild himself. Thorgrim and his folk could
      not show that they had paid money for the lands and drifts which Flosi claimed. Thorkel Moon
      was law-man then, and he was bidden to give his decision; he said that to him it seemed law,
      that something had been paid for those lands, though mayhap not their full worth; "For so did
      Steinvor the Old to Ingolf, my grandfather, that she had from him all Rosmwhale-ness and gave
      therefor a spotted cloak, nor has that gift been voided, <pb n="25"/> though certes greater
      flaws be therein: but here I lay down my rede," said he, "that the land be shared, and that
      both sides have equal part therein; and henceforth be it made law, that each man have the
      drifts before his own lands." Now this was done, and the land was so divided that Thorgrim and
      his folk had to give up Reekfirth and all the lands by the firth-side, but Combe they were to
      keep still. Ufeigh was atoned with a great sum; Thorfin was unatoned, and boot was given to
      Thorgeir for the attack on his life; and thereafter were they set at one together. Flosi took
      ship for Norway with Stein, the ship-master, and sold his lands in the Wick to Geirmund
      Hiuka-timber, who dwelt there afterwards. Now that ship which the chapmen had made was very
      broad of beam, so that men called it the Treetub, and by that name is the creek known: but in
      that keel did Flosi go out, but was driven back to Axefirth, whereof came the tale of Bodmod,
      and Grimulf, and Gerpir.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="13">
     <p>NOW after this the brothers Thorgrim and Thorgeir shared their possessions. Thorgrim took
      the chattels and Thorgeir the land; Thorgrim betook himself to Midfirth and bought land at
      Biarg by the counsel of Skeggi; he had to wife Thordis, daughter of Asmund of Asmund's-peak,
      who had settled the Thingere lands: Thorgrim and Thordis had a son who was called Asmund; he
      was a big man and a strong, wise withal, and the fairest-haired of men, but his head grew grey
      early, wherefore he was called Asmund the Greyhaired. Thorgrim grew to be a man very busy
      about his household, and kept all his men <pb n="26"/> well to their work. Asmund would do but
      little work, so the father and son had small fellowship together; and so things fared till
      Asmund had grown of age; then he asked his father for travelling money; Thorgrim said he
      should have little enough, but gave him somewhat of huckstering wares.</p>
     <p>Then Asmund went abroad, and his goods soon grew great; he sailed to sundry lands, and
      became the greatest of merchants, and very rich; he was a man well beloved and trusty, and
      many kinsmen he had in Norway of great birth.</p>
     <p>One autumn he guested east in the Wick with a great man who was called Thorstein; he was an
      Uplander of kin, and had a sister called Ranveig, one to be chosen before all women; her
      Asmund wooed, and gained her by the help of Thorstein her brother; and there Asmund dwelt a
      while and was held in good esteem: he had of Ranveig a son hight Thorstein, strong, and the
      fairest of men, and great of voice; a man tall of growth he was, but somewhat slow in his
      mien, and therefore was he called Dromund. Now when Thorstein was nigh grown up, his mother
      fell sick and died, and thereafter Asmund had no joy in Norway; the kin of Thorstein's mother
      took his goods, and him withal to foster; but Asmund betook himself once more to sea-faring,
      and became a man of great renown. Now he brought his ship into Huna-water, and in those days
      was Thorkel Krafla chief over the Waterdale folk; and he heard of Asmund's coming out, and
      rode to the ship and bade Asmund to his house; and he dwelt at Marstead in Waterdale; so
      Asmund went to be guest there. This Thorkel was the son of Thorgrim the Godi of Corn-river,
      and was a very wise man.</p>
     <p>Now this was after the coming out of Bishop Frederick, <pb n="27"/> and Thorvald Kodran's
      son, and they dwelt at the Brooksmeet, when these things came to pass: they were the first to
      preach the law of Christ in the north country; Thorkel let himself be signed with the cross
      and many men with him, and things enow betid betwixt the bishop and the north-country folk
      which come not into this tale.</p>
     <p>Now at Thorkel's was a woman brought up, Asdis by name, who was the daughter of Bard, the
      son of Jokul, the son of Ingimund the Old, the son of Thorstein, the son of Ketil the Huge:
      the mother of Asdis was Aldis the daughter of Ufeigh Grettir, as is aforesaid; Asdis was as
      yet unwedded, and was deemed the best match among women, both for her kin and her possessions;
      Asmund was grown weary of seafaring, and was fain to take up his abode in Iceland; so he took
      up the word, and wooed this woman. Thorkel knew well all his ways, that he was a rich man and
      of good counsel to hold his wealth; so that came about, that Asmund got Asdis to wife; he
      became a bosom friend of Thorkel, and a great dealer in matters of farming, cunning in the
      law, and far-reaching. And now a little after this Thorgrim Greypate died at Biarg, and Asmund
      took the heritage after him and dwelt there.</p>

     <head>HERE BEGINS THE STORY OF THE LIFE OF GRETTIR THE STRONG. Of Grettir as a Child, and his

     <p>Grettir Asmundson was fair to look on, broad-faced, short-faced, red-haired, and much
      freckled; not of quick growth in his childhood. <pb n="29"/> Thordis was a daughter of Asmund,
      whom Glum, the son of Uspak, the son of Kiarlak of Skridinsenni, afterwards had to wife.
      Ranveig was another daughter of Asmund, she was the wife of Gamli, the son of Thorhal, the son
      of the Vendlander; they kept house at Meals in Ramfirth; their son was Grim. The son of Glum
      and Thordis, the daughter of Asmund, was Uspak, who quarrelled with Odd the son of Ufeigh, as
      is told in the Bandamanna Saga.</p>
     <p>Grettir grew up at Biarg till he was ten years old; then he began to get on a little; but
      Asmund bade him do some work; Grettir answered that work was not right meet for him, but asked
      what he should do.</p>
     <p>Says Asmund, "Thou shalt watch my home-geese."</p>
     <p>Grettir answered and said, "A mean work, a milksop's work."</p>
     <p>Asmund said, "Turn it well out of hand, and then matters shall get better between us."</p>
     <p>Then Grettir betook himself to watching the home-geese; fifty of them there were, with many
      goslings; but no long time went by before he found them a troublesome drove, and the goslings
      slow-paced withal. Thereat he got sore worried, for little did he keep his temper in hand. So
      some time after this, wayfaring men found the goslings, strewn about dead, and the home-geese
      broken-winged; and this was in autumn. Asmund was mightily vexed hereat, and asked if Grettir
      had killed the fowl: he sneered mockingly, and answered--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>Surely as winter comes, shall I</l>
      <l>Twist the goslings' necks awry.</l>
      <l>If in like case are the geese,</l>
      <l>I have finished each of these."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>"Thou shalt kill them no more," said Asmund. <pb n="30"/> "Well, <hi rend="ital">a friend
       should warn a friend of ill</hi>," said Grettir.</p>
     <p>"Another work shall be found for thee then," said Asmund.</p>
     <p>"<hi rend="ital">More one knows the more one tries</hi>," said Grettir; and what shall I do
      now?"</p>
     <p>Asmund answered, "Thou shalt rub my back at the fire, as I have been wont to have it
      done."</p>
     <p>"Hot for the hand, truly," said Grettir; "but still a milksop's work."</p>
     <p>Now Grettir went on with this work for a while; but autumn came on, and Asmund became very
      fain of heat, and he spurs Grettir on to rub his back briskly. Now, in those times there were
      wont to be large fire-halls at the homesteads, wherein men sat at long fires in the evenings;
      boards were set before the men there, and afterwards folk slept out sideways from the fires;
      there also women worked at the wool in the daytime. Now, one evening, when Grettir had to rub
      Asmund's back, the old carle said,--</p>
     <p>"Now thou wilt have to put away thy sloth, thou milksop."</p>
     <p>Says Grettir, "<hi rend="ital">Ill is it to goad the foolhardy</hi>."</p>
     <p>Asmund answers, "Thou wilt ever be a good-for-nought."</p>
     <p>Now Grettir sees where, in one of the seats stood wool-combs: one of these he caught up, and
      let it go all down Asmund's back. He sprang up, and was mad wroth thereat; and was going to
      smite Grettir with his staff, but he ran off. Then came the housewife, and asked what was this
      to-do betwixt them. Then Grettir answered by this ditty--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>This jewel-strewer, O ground of gold,</l>
      <l>(His counsels I deem over bold),</l>
      <l>On both these hands that trouble sow,</l>
      <l>(Ah bitter pain) will burn me now;</l>
     </lg>

     <pb n="31"/>


     <lg>
      <l>Therefore with wool-comb's nails unshorn</l>
      <l>Somewhat ring-strewer's back is torn:</l>
      <l>The hook-clawed bird that wrought his wound,--</l>
      <l>Lo, now I see it on the ground."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Hereupon was his mother sore vexed, that he should have taken to a trick like this; she said
      he would never fall to be the most reckless of men. All this nowise bettered matters between
      Asmund and Grettir.</p>
     <p>Now, some time after this, Asmund had a talk with Grettir, that he should watch his horses.
      Grettir said this was more to his mind than the back-rubbing.</p>
     <p>"Then shalt thou do as I bid thee," said Asmund. "I have a dun mare, which I call Keingala;
      she is so wise as to shifts of weather, thaws, and the like, that rough weather will never
      fail to follow, when she will not go out on grazing. At such times thou shalt lock the horses
      up under cover; but keep them to grazing on the mountain neck yonder, when winter comes on.
      Now I shall deem it needful that thou turn this work out of hand better than the two I have
      set thee to already."</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "This is a cold work and a manly, but I deem it ill to trust in the mare,
      for I know none who has done it yet."</p>
     <p>Now Grettir took to the horse-watching, and so the time went on till past Yule-time; then
      came on much cold weather with snow, that made grazing hard to come at. Now Grettir was ill
      clad, and as yet little hardened, and he began to be starved by the cold; but Keingala grazed
      away in the windiest place she could find, let the weather be as rough as it would. Early as
      she might go to the pasture, never would she go back to stable before nightfall. Now Grettir
      deemed that he must think of some scurvy <pb n="32"/> trick or other, that Keingala might be
      paid in full for her way of grazing: so, one morning early, he comes to the horse-stable,
      opens it, and finds Keingala standing all along before the crib; for, whatever food was given
      to the horses with her, it was her way to get it all to herself. Grettir got on her back, and
      had a sharp knife in his hand, and drew it right across Keingala's shoulder, and then all
      along both sides of the back. Thereat the mare, being both fat and shy, gave a mad bound, and
      kicked so fiercely, that her hooves clattered against the wall. Grettir fell off; but, getting
      on his legs, strove to mount her again. Now their struggle is of the sharpest, but the end of
      it is, that he flays off the whole of the strip along the back to the loins. Thereafter he
      drove the horses out on grazing; Keingala would bite but at her back, and when noon was barely
      past, she started off, and ran back to the house. Grettir now locks the stable and goes home.
      Asmund asked Grettir where the horses were. He said that he had stabled them as he was wont.
      Asmund said that rough weather was like to be at hand, as the horses would not keep at their
      grazing in such good weather as now it was.</p>
     <p>Grettir said, "<hi rend="ital">Oft fail in wisdom folk of better trust</hi>."</p>
     <p>Now the night goes by, but no rough weather came on. Grettir drove off the horses, but
      Keingala cannot bear the grazing. This seemed strange to Asmund, as the weather changed in
      nowise from what it had been theretofore. The third morning Asmund went to the horses, and,
      coming to Keingala, said,--</p>
     <p>"I must needs deem these horses to be in sorry case, good as the winter has been, but thy
      sides will scarce lack flesh, my dun."</p>
     <p>"<hi rend="ital">Things boded will happen</hi>," said Grettir, "<hi rend="ital">but so will
       things unboded</hi>." <pb n="33"/> Asmund stroked the back of the mare, and, lo, the hide
      came off beneath his hand; he wondered how this could have happened, and said it was likely to
      be Grettir's doing. Grettir sneered mockingly, but said nought. Now goodman Asmund went home
      talking as one mad; he went straight to the fire-hall, and as he came heard the good wife say,
      "It were good indeed if the horse-keeping of my kinsman had gone off well."</p>
     <p>Then Asmund sang this stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>Grettir has in such wise played,</l>
      <l>That Keingala has he flayed,</l>
      <l>Whose trustiness would be my boast</l>
      <l>(Proudest women talk the most);</l>
      <l>So the cunning lad has wrought,</l>
      <l>Thinking thereby to do nought</l>
      <l>Of my biddings any more.</l>
      <l>In thy mind turn these words o'er."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>The housewife answered, "I know not which is least to my mind, that thou shouldst ever be
      bidding him work, or that he should turn out all his work in one wise."</p>
     <p>"That too we will make an end of," said Asmund, "but he shall fare the worse therefor."</p>
     <p>Then Grettir said, "Well, let neither make words about it to the other."</p>
     <p>So things went on awhile, and Asmund had Keingala killed; and many other scurvy tricks did
      Grettir in his childhood whereof the story says nought. But he grew great of body, though his
      strength was not well known, for he was unskilled in wrestling; he would make ditties and
      rhymes, but was somewhat scurrilous therein. He had no will to lie a-night in the fire-hall
      and was mostly of few words. <pb n="34"/>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
     <head>Of the Ball-play on Midfirth Water</head>
     <p>AT this time there were many growing up to be men in Midfirth; Skald-Torfa dwelt at
      Torfa's-stead in those days; her son was called Bessi, he was the shapeliest of men and a good
      skald.</p>
     <p>At Meal lived two brothers, Kormak and Thorgils, with them a man called Odd was fostered,
      and was called the Foundling-skald.</p>
     <p>One called Audun was growing up at Audunstead in Willowdale, he was a kind and good man to
      deal with, and the strongest in those north parts, of all who were of an age with him. Kalf
      Asgeirson dwelt at Asgeir's-river, and his brother Thorvald with him. Atli also, Grettir's
      brother, was growing into a ripe man at that time; the gentlest of men he was, and well
      beloved of all. Now these men settled to have ball-play together on Midfirth Water; thither
      came the Midfirthers, and Willowdale men, and men from Westhope, and Waterness, and Ramfirth,
      but those who came from far abode at the play-stead.</p>
     <p>Now those who were most even in strength were paired together, and thereat was always the
      greatest sport in autumntide. But when he was fourteen years old Grettir went to the plays,
      because he was prayed thereto by his brother Atli.</p>
     <p>Now were all paired off for the plays, and Grettir was allotted to play against Audun, the
      afore-named, who was some winters the eldest of the two; Audun struck the ball over Grettir's
      head, so that he could not catch it, and it <pb n="35"/> bounded far away along the ice;
      Grettir got angry thereat, deeming that Audun would outplay him; but he fetches the ball and
      brings it back, and, when he was within reach of Audun, hurls it right against his forehead,
      and smites him so that the skin was broken; then Audun struck at Grettir with the bat he held
      in his hand, but smote him no hard blow, for Grettir ran in under the stroke; and thereat they
      seized one another with arms clasped, and wrestled. Then all saw that Grettir was stronger
      than he had been taken to be, for Audun was a man full of strength.</p>
     <p>A long tug they had of it, but the end was that Grettir fell, and Audun thrust his knees
      against his belly and breast, and dealt hardly with him.</p>
     <p>Then Atli and Bessi and many others ran up and parted them; but Grettir said there was no
      need to hold him like a mad dog: "For," said he, "<hi rend="ital">thralls wreak themselves at
       once, dastards never</hi>."</p>
     <p>This men suffered not to grow into open strife, for the brothers, Kalf and Thorvald, were
      fain that all should be at one again, and Audun and Grettir were somewhat akin withal; so the
      play went on as before, nor did anything else befall to bring about strife.</p>
    </div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="16">
     <head>Of the Slaying of Skeggi</head>
     <p>NOW Thorkel Krafla got very old; he had the rule of Waterdale and was a great man. He was
      bosom friend of Asmund the Greyhaired, as was beseeming for the sake of their kinship; he was
      wont to ride to Biarg every <pb n="36"/> year and see his kin there, nor did he fail herein
      the spring following these matters just told. Asmund and Asdis welcomed him most heartily, he
      was there three nights, and many things did the kinsmen speak of between them. Now Thorkel
      asked Asmund what his mind foreboded him about his sons, as to what kind of craft they would
      be likely to take to. Asmund said that he thought Atli would be a great man at farming,
      foreseeing, and money-making. Thorkel answered, "A useful man and like unto thyself: but what
      dost thou say of Grettir?"</p>
     <p>Asmund said, "Of him I say, that he will be a strong man and an unruly, and, certes, of
      wrathful mood, and heavy enough he has been to me."</p>
     <p>Thorkel answered, "That bodes no good, friend; but how shall we settle about our riding to
      the Thing next summer?"</p>
     <p>Asmund answered, "I am growing heavy for wayfaring, and would fain sit at home."</p>
     <p>"Wouldst thou that Atli go in thy stead?" said Thorkel.</p>
     <p>"I do not see how I could spare him," says Asmund, "because of the farm-work and ingathering
      of household stores; but now Grettir will not work, yet he bears about that wit with him that
      I deem he will know how to keep up the showing forth of the law for me through thy aid."</p>
     <p>"Well, thou shalt have thy will," said Thorkel, and withal he rode home when he was ready,
      and Asmund let him go with good gifts.</p>
     <p>Some time after this Thorkel made him ready to ride to the Thing, he rode with sixty men,
      for all went with him who were in his rule: thus he came to Biarg, and therefrom rode Grettir
      with him.</p>
     <p>Now they rode south over the heath that is called Two-day's-ride; but on this mountain the
      baiting grounds were <pb n="37"/> poor, therefore they rode fast across it down to the settled
      lands, and when they came down to Fleet-tongue they thought it was time to sleep, so they took
      the bridles off their horses and let them graze with the saddles on. They lay sleeping till
      far on in the day, and when they woke, the men went about looking for their horses; but they
      had gone each his own way, and some of them had been rolling; but Grettir was the last to find
      his horse.</p>
     <p>Now it was the wont in those days that men should carry their own victuals when they rode to
      the Althing, and most bore meal-bags athwart their saddles; and the saddle was turned under
      the belly of Grettir's horse, and the meal-bag was gone, so he goes and searches, and finds
      nought.</p>
     <p>Just then he sees a man running fast, Grettir asks who it is who is running there; the man
      answered that his name was Skeggi, and that he was a house-carle from the Ridge in Waterdale.
      "I am one of the following of goodman Thorkel," he says, "but, faring heedlessly, I have lost
      my meal-bag."</p>
     <p>Grettir said, "<hi rend="ital">Odd haps are worse haps</hi>, for I, also, have lost the
      meal-sack which I owned, and now let us search both together."</p>
     <p>This Skeggi liked well, and a while they go thus together; but all of a sudden Skeggi
      bounded off up along the moors and caught up a meal-sack. Grettir saw him stoop, and asked
      what he took up there.</p>
     <p>"My meal-sack," says Skeggi.</p>
     <p>"Who speaks to that besides thyself?" says Grettir; "let me see it, for many a thing has its
      like."</p>
     <p>Skeggi said that no man should take from him what was his own; but Grettir caught at the
      meal-bag, and now they tug one another along with the meal-sack between them, both trying hard
      to get the best of it. <pb n="38"/> "It is to be wondered at," says the house-carle, "that ye
      Waterdale men should deem, that because other men are not as wealthy as ye, that they should
      not therefore dare to hold aught of their own in your despite."</p>
     <p>Grettir said, that it had nought to do with the worth of men that each should have his
      own.</p>
     <p>Skeggi answers, "Too far off is Audun now to throttle thee as at that ball-play."</p>
     <p>"Good," said Grettir; "but, howsoever that went, thou at least shalt never throttle me."</p>
     <p>Then Skeggi got at his axe and hewed at Grettir; when Grettir saw that, he caught the
      axe-handle with the left hand bladeward of Skeggi's hand, so hard that straightway was the axe
      loosed from his hold. Then Grettir drave that same axe into his head so that it stood in the
      brain, and the house-carle fell dead to earth. Then Grettir seized the meal-bag and threw it
      across his saddle, and thereon rode after his fellows.</p>
     <p>Now Thorkel rode ahead of all, for he had no misgiving of such things befalling: but men
      missed Skeggi from the company, and when Grettir came up they asked him what he knew of
      Skeggi; then he sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>A rock-troll her weight did throw</l>
      <l>At Skeggi's throat a while ago:</l>
      <l>Over the battle ogress ran</l>
      <l>The red blood of the serving-man;</l>
      <l>Her deadly iron mouth did gape</l>
      <l>Above him, till clean out of shape</l>
      <l>She tore his head and let out life</l>
      <l>And certainly I saw their strife."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Then Thorkel's men sprung up and said that surely <pb n="39"/> trolls had not taken the man
      in broad daylight. Thorkel grew silent, but said presently, "The matter is likely to be quite
      other than this; methinks Grettir has in all likelihood killed him, or what could befall?"</p>
     <p>Then Grettir told all their strife. Thorkel says, "This has come to pass most unluckily, for
      Skeggi was given to my following, and was, nathless, a man of good kin; but I shall deal thus
      with the matter: I shall give boot for the man as the doom goes, but the outlawry I may not
      settle. Now, two things thou hast to choose between, Grettir; whether thou wilt rather go to
      the Thing and risk the turn of matters, or go back home."</p>
     <p>Grettir chose to go to the Thing, and thither he went. But a law-suit was set on foot by the
      heirs of the slain man: Thorkel gave handsel, and paid up all fines, but Grettir must needs be
      outlawed, and keep abroad three winters.</p>
     <p>Now when the chiefs rode from the Thing, they baited under Sledgehill before they parted:
      then Grettir lifted a stone which now lies there in the grass and is called Grettir's-heave;
      but many men came up to see the stone, and found it a great wonder that so young a man should
      heave aloft such a huge rock.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir rode home to Biarg and tells the tale of his journey; Asmund let out little
      thereon, but said that he would turn out an unruly man.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="17">
     <head>Of Grettir's Voyage out</head>
     <p>THERE was a man called Haflidi, who dwelt at Reydarfell in Whiteriverside, he was a
      seafaring man <pb n="40"/> and had a sailing ship, which lay up Whiteriver: there was a man on
      board his ship hight Bard, who had a wife with him young and fair. Asmund sent a man to
      Haflidi, praying him to take Grettir and look after him; Haflidi said that he had heard that
      the man was ill ruled of mood; yet for the sake of the friendship between him and Asmund he
      took Grettir to himself, and made ready for sailing abroad.</p>
     <p>Asmund would give to his son no faring-goods but victuals for the voyage and a little
      wadmall. Grettir prayed him for some weapon, but Asmund answered, "Thou hast not been obedient
      to me, nor do I know how far thou art likely to work with weapons things that may be of any
      gain; and no weapon shalt thou have of me."</p>
     <p>"<hi rend="ital">No deed no reward</hi>," says Grettir. Then father and son parted with
      little love. Many there were who bade Grettir farewell, but few bade him come back.</p>
     <p>But his mother brought him on his road, and before they parted she spoke thus, "Thou art not
      fitted out from home, son, as I fain would thou wert, a man so well born as thou; but,
      meseems, the greatest shortcoming herein is that thou hast no weapons of any avail, and my
      mind misgives me that thou wilt perchance need them sorely."</p>
     <p>With that she took out from under her cloak a sword well wrought, and a fair thing it was,
      and then she said, "This sword was owned by Jokul, my father's father, and the earlier
      Waterdale men, and it gained them many a day; now I give thee the sword, and may it stand thee
      in good stead."</p>
     <p>Grettir thanked her well for this gift, and said he deemed it better than things of more
      worth; then he went on his way, and Asdis wished him all good hap.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir rode south over the heath, and made no stay till he came to the ship. Haflidi
      gave him a good <pb n="41"/> welcome and asked him for his faring-goods, then Grettir
      sang-</p>


     <lg>
      <l>Rider of wind-driven steed,</l>
      <l>Little gat I to my need,</l>
      <l>When I left my fair birth-stead,</l>
      <l>From the snatchers of worm's bed;</l>
      <l>But this man's-bane hanging here,</l>
      <l>Gift of woman good of cheer,</l>
      <l>Proves the old saw said not ill,</l>
      <l><hi rend="ital">Best to bairn is mother still</hi>."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Haflidi said it was easily seen that she thought the most of him. But now they put to sea
      when they were ready, and had wind at will; but when they had got out over all shallows they
      hoisted sail.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir made a den for himself under the boat, from whence he would move for nought,
      neither for baling, nor to do aught at the sail, nor to work at what he was bound to work at
      in the ship in even shares with the other men, neither would he buy himself off from the
      work.</p>
     <p>Now they sailed south by Reekness and then south from the land; and when they lost land they
      got much heavy sea; the ship was somewhat leaky, and scarce seaworthy in heavy weather,
      therefore they had it wet enough. Now Grettir let fly his biting rhymes, whereat the men got
      sore wroth. One day, when it so happened that the weather was both squally and cold, the men
      called out to Grettir, and bade him now do manfully: "For," said they, "now our claws grow
      right cold." Grettir looked up and said--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>Good luck, scurvy starvelings, if I should behold</l>
      <l>Each finger ye have doubled up with the cold."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>And no work they got out of him, and now it misliked <pb n="42"/> them of their lot as much
      again as before, and they said that he should pay with his skin for his rhymes and the
      lawlessness which he did. "Thou art more fain," said they, "of playing with Bard the mate's
      wife than doing thy duty on board ship, and this is a thing not to be borne at all."</p>
     <p>The gale grew greater steadily, and now they stood baling for days and nights together, and
      all swore to kill Grettir. But when Haflidi heard this, he went up to where Grettir lay, and
      said, "Methinks the bargain between thee and the chapmen is scarcely fair; first thou dost by
      them unlawfully, and thereafter thou castest thy rhymes at them; and now they swear that they
      will throw thee overboard, and this is unseemly work to go on."</p>
     <p>"Why should they not be free to do as they will?" says Grettir; "but I well would that one
      or two of them tarry here behind with me, or ever I go overboard."</p>
     <p>Haflidi says, "Such deeds are not to be done, and we shall never thrive if ye rush into such
      madness; but I shall give thee good rede."</p>
     <p>"What is that?" says Grettir.</p>
     <p>"They blame thee for singing ill things of them; now, therefore, I would that thou sing some
      scurvy rhyme to me, for then it might be that they would bear with thee the easier."</p>
     <p>"To thee I never sing but good," says Grettir: "I am not going to make thee like these
      starvelings."</p>
     <p>"One may sing so," says Haflidi, "that the lampoon be not so foul when it is searched into,
      though at first sight it be not over fair."</p>
     <p>"I have ever plenty of that skill in me," says Grettir.</p>
     <p>Then Haflidi went to the men where they were baling, and said, "Great is your toil, and no
      wonder that ye have taken ill liking to Grettir." <pb n="43"/> "But his lampoons we deem worse
      than all the rest together," they said.</p>
     <p>Haflidi said in a loud voice, "He will surely fare ill for it in the end."</p>
     <p>But when Grettir heard Haflidi speak blamefully of him, he sang</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Otherwise would matters be,</l>
      <l>When this shouting Haflidi</l>
      <l>Ate in house at Reydarfell</l>
      <l>Curdled milk, and deemed it well</l>
      <l>He who decks the reindeer's side</l>
      <l>That 'twixt ness and ness doth glide,</l>
      <l>Twice in one day had his fill</l>
      <l>Of the feast of dart shower shrill." <note place="foot">This is about as obscure as the
        original, which seems to allude to some event not mentioned in the Saga.</note></l>
     </lg>

     <p>The shipmen thought this foul enough, and said he should not put shame on Skipper Haflidi
      for nought.</p>
     <p>Then said Haflidi, "Grettir is plentifully worthy that ye should do him some shame, but I
      will not have my honour staked against his ill-will and recklessness; nor is it good for us to
      wreak vengeance for this forthwith while we have this danger hanging over us; but be ye
      mindful of it when ye land, if so it seem good to you."</p>
     <p>"Well," they said, "why should we not fare even as thou farest? for why should his vile word
      bite us more than thee?"</p>
     <p>And in that mind Haflidi bade them abide; and thenceforward the chapmen made far less noise
      about Grettir's rhymes than before.</p>
     <p>Now a long and a hard voyage they had, and the leak <pb n="44"/> gained on the ship, and men
      began to be exceeding worn with toil. The young wife of the mate was wont to sew from
      Grettir's hands, and much would the crew mock him therefor; but Haflidi went up to where
      Grettir lay and sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Grettir, stand up from thy grave,</l>
      <l>In the trough of the grey wave</l>
      <l>The keel labours, tell my say</l>
      <l>Now unto thy merry may;</l>
      <l>From thy hands the linen-clad</l>
      <l>Fill of sewing now has had,</l>
      <l>Till we make the land will she</l>
      <l>Deem that labour fitteth thee."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Then Grettir stood up and sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Stand we up, for neath us now</l>
      <l>Rides the black ship high enow;</l>
      <l>This fair wife will like it ill</l>
      <l>If my limbs are laid here still</l>
      <l>Certes, the white trothful one</l>
      <l>Will not deem the deed well done,</l>
      <l>If the work that I should share</l>
      <l>Other folk must ever bear."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Then he ran aft to where they were baling, and asked what they would he should do; they said
      he would do mighty little good.</p>
     <p>"Well," said he, "<hi rend="ital">ye may yet be apaid of a man's aid</hi>."</p>
     <p>Haflidi bade them not set aside his help, "For it may be he shall deem his hands freed if he
      offers his aid."</p>
     <p>At that time pumping was not used in ships that fared <pb n="45"/> over the main; the manner
      of baling they used men called tub or cask baling, and a wet work it was and a wearisome; two
      balers were used, and one went down while the other came up. Now the chapmen bade Grettir have
      the job of sinking the balers, and said that now it should be tried what he could do; he said
      that the less it was tried the better it would be. But he goes down and sinks the balers, and
      now two were got to bale against him; they held out but a little while before they were
      overcome with weariness, and then four came forward and soon fared in likewise, and, so say
      some, that eight baled against him before the baling was done and the ship was made dry.
      Thenceforth the manner of the chapmen's words to Grettir was much changed, for they saw what
      strength he had to fall back upon; and from that time he was the stoutest and readiest to
      help, wheresoever need was.</p>
     <p>Now they bore off cast into the main, and much thick weather they had, and one night
      unawares they ran suddenly on a rock, so that the nether part of the ship went from under her;
      then the boat was run down, and women and all the loose goods were brought off: nearby was a
      little holm whither they brought their matters as they best could in the night; but when it
      began to dawn they had a talk as to where they were come; then they who had fared between
      lands before knew the land for Southmere in Norway; there was an island hardby called
      Haramsey; many folk dwelt there, and therein too was the manor of a lord.</p>

    </div>


    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="18">
     <pb n="46"/>
     <head>Of Grettir at Haramsey and his dealings with Karr the Old</head>
     <p>NOW the lord who dwelt in the island was called Thorfinn; he was the son of Karr the Old,
      who had dwelt there long; and Thorfinn was a great chief.</p>
     <p>But when day was fully come men saw from the island that the chapmen were brought to great
      straits. This was made known to Thorfinn, and he quickly bestirred himself, and had a large
      bark of his launched, rowed by sixteen men, on this bark were nigh thirty men in all; they
      came up speedily and saved the chapmen's wares; but the ship settled down, and much goods were
      lost there. Thorfinn brought all men from the ship home to himself, and they abode there a
      week and dried their wares. Then the chapmen went south into the land, and are now out of the
      tale.</p>
     <p>Grettir was left behind with Thorfinn, and little he stirred, and was at most times mighty
      short of speech. Thorfinn bade give him meals, but otherwise paid small heed to him; Grettir
      was loth to follow him, and would not go out with him in the day; this Thorfinn tool, ill, but
      had not the heart to have food withheld from him.</p>
     <p>Now Thorfinn was fond of stately housekeeping, and was a man of great joyance, and would
      fain have other men merry too: but Grettir would walk about from house to house, and often
      went into other farms about the island.</p>
     <p>There was a man called Audun who dwelt at Windham; thither Grettir went every day, and he
      made friends with Audun, and there he was wont to sit till far on in the day. Now one night
      very late, as Grettir made ready to go home, <pb n="47"/> he saw a great fire burst out on a
      ness to the north of Audun's farm. Grettir asked what new thing this might be. Audun said that
      he need be in no haste to know that.</p>
     <p>"It would be said," quoth Grettir, "if that were seen in our land, that the flame burned
      above hid treasure."</p>
     <p>The farmer said, "That fire I deem to be ruled over by one into whose matters it avails
      little to pry."</p>
     <p>"Yet fain would I know thereof," said Grettir.</p>
     <p>"On that ness," said Audun, "stands a barrow, great and strong, wherein was laid Karr the
      Old, Thorfinn's father; at first father and son had but one farm in the island; but since Karr
      died he has so haunted this place that he has swept away all farmers who owned lands here, so
      that now Thorfinn holds the whole island; but whatsoever man Thorfinn holds his hand over,
      gets no scathe."</p>
     <p>Grettir said that he had told his tale well: "And," says he, "I shall come here to-morrow,
      and then thou shalt have digging-tools ready."</p>
     <p>"Now, I pray thee," says Audun, "to do nought herein, for I know that Thorfinn will cast his
      hatred on thee therefor."</p>
     <p>Grettir said he would risk that.</p>
     <p>So the night went by, and Grettir came early on the morrow and the digging-tools were ready;
      the farmer goes with him to the barrow, and Grettir brake it open, and was rough-handed enough
      thereat, and did not leave off till he came to the rafters, and by then the day was spent;
      then he tore away the rafters, and now Audun prayed him hard not to go into the barrow;
      Grettir bade him guard the rope, "but I shall espy what dwells within here."</p>
     <p>Then Grettir entered into the barrow, and right dark it was, and a smell there was therein
      none of the sweetest. Now he groped about to see how things were below; first <pb n="48"/> he
      found horse-bones, and then he stumbled against the arm of a high-chair, and in that chair
      found a man sitting; great treasures of gold and silver were heaped together there, and a
      small chest was set under the feet of him full of silver, all these riches Grettir carried
      together to the rope; but as he went out through the barrow he was griped at right strongly;
      thereon he let go the treasure and rushed against the barrow-dweller, and now they set on one
      another unsparingly enough.</p>
     <p>Everything in their way was kicked out of place, the barrow-wight setting on with hideous
      eagerness; Grettir gave back before him for a long time, till at last it came to this, that he
      saw it would not do to hoard his strength any more; now neither spared the other, and they
      were brought to where the horse-bones were, and thereabout they wrestled long. And now one,
      now the other, fell on his knee; but the end of the strife was, that the barrow-dweller fell
      over on his back with huge din. Then ran Audun from the holding of the rope, and deemed
      Grettir dead. But Grettir drew the sword, 'Jokul's gift,' and drave it at the neck of the
      barrow-bider so that it took off his head, and Grettir laid it at the thigh of him.<note
       place="foot">The old belief was that by this means, only could a ghost be laid.</note> Then
      he went to the rope with the treasure, and lo, Audun was clean gone, so he had to get up the
      rope by his hands; he had tied a line to the treasure, and therewith he now haled it up.</p>
     <p>Grettir had got very stiff with his dealings with Karr, and now he went back to Thorfinn's
      house with the treasures, whenas all folk had set them down to table. Thorfinn gave Grettir a
      sharp look when he came into the drinking-hall, and asked him what work he had on hand so
      needful to do <pb n="49"/> that he might not keep times of meals with other men. Grettir
      answers, "Many little matters will hap on late eves," and therewith he cast down on the table
      all the treasure he had taken in the barrow; but one matter there was thereof, on which he
      must needs keep his eyes; this was a short sword, so good a weapon, that a better, he said, he
      had never seen; and this he gave up the last of all. Thorfinn was blithe to see that sword,
      for it was an heirloom of his house, and had never yet gone out of his kin.</p>
     <p>"Whence came these treasures to thine hand?" said Thorfinn.</p>
     <p>Grettir sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Lessener of the flame of sea,</l>
      <l>My strong hope was true to me,</l>
      <l>When I deemed that treasure lay</l>
      <l>In the barrow; from to-day</l>
      <l>Folk shall know that I was right;</l>
      <l>The begetters of the fight</l>
      <l>Small joy now shall have therein,</l>
      <l>Seeking dragon's-lair to win."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Thorfinn answered, "Blood will seldom seem blood to thine eyes; no man before thee has had
      will to break open the barrow; but, because I know that what wealth soever is hid in earth or
      borne into barrow is wrongly placed, I shall not hold thee blameworthy for thy deed as thou
      hast brought it all to me; yea, or whence didst thou get the good sword?"</p>
     <p>Grettir answered and sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Lessener of waves flashing flame,</l>
      <l>To my lucky hand this came </l>
      <pb n="50"/>
      <l>In the barrow where that thing</l>
      <l>Through the dark fell clattering</l>
      <l>If that helm-fire I should gain,</l>
      <l>Made so fair to be the bane</l>
      <l>Of the breakers of the bow,</l>
      <l>Ne'er from my hand should it go."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Thorfinn said, "Well hast thou prayed for it, but thou must show some deed of fame before I
      give thee that sword, for never could I get it of my father while he lived."</p>
     <p>Said Grettir, "Who knows to whom most gain will come of it in the end?"</p>
     <p>So Thorfinn took the treasures and kept the sword at his bed-head, and the winter wore on
      toward Yule, so that little else fell out to be told of.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="19">
     <head>Of Yule at Haramsey, and how Grettir dealt with the Bearserks</head>
     <p>NOW the summer before these things Earl Erie Hakonson made ready to go from his land west to
      England, to see King Knut the Mighty, his brother-in-law, but left behind him in the rule of
      Norway Hakon, his son, and gave him into the hands of Earl Svein, his brother, for the
      watching and warding of his realm, for Hakon was a child in years.</p>
     <p>But before Earl Erie went away from the land, he called together lords and rich bonders, and
      many things they spoke on laws and the rule of the land, for Earl Eric was a man good at rule.
      Now men thought it an exceeding <pb n="51"/> ill fashion in the land that runagates or
      bearserks called to holm high-born men for their fee or womankind, in such wise, that
      whosoever should fall before the other should lie unatoned; hereof many got both shame and
      loss of goods, and some lost their lives withal; and therefore Earl Erie did away with all
      holm-gangs and outlawed all bearserks who fared with raids and riots.</p>
     <p>In the making of this law, the chief of all, with Earl Erie, was Thorfinn Karrson, from
      Haramsey, for he was a wise man, and a dear friend of the Earls.</p>
     <p>Two brothers are named as being of the worst in these matters, one hight Thorir Paunch, the
      other Ogmund the Evil; they were of Halogaland kin, bigger and stronger than other men. They
      wrought the bearserks'-gang and spared nothing in their fury; they would take away the wives
      of men and hold them for a week or a half-month, and then bring them back to their husbands;
      they robbed wheresoever they came, or did some other ill deeds. Now Earl Erie made them
      outlaws through the length and breadth of Norway, and Thorfinn was the eagerest of men in
      bringing about their outlawry, therefore they deemed that they owed him ill-will enow.</p>
     <p>So the Earl went away from the land, as is said in his Saga; but Earl Svein bore sway over
      Norway. Thorfinn went home to his house, and sat at home till just up to Yule, as is
      aforesaid; but at Yule he made ready to go to his farm called Slys-firth, which is on the
      mainland, and thither he had bidden many of his friends. Thorfinn's wife could not go with her
      husband, for her daughter of ripe years lay ill a-bed, so they both abode at home. Grettir was
      at home too, and eight house-carles. Now Thorfinn went with thirty freedmen to the Yule-feast,
      whereat there was the greatest mirth and joyance among men. <pb n="52"/> Now Yule-eve comes
      on, and the weather was bright and calm; Grettir was mostly abroad this day, and saw how ships
      fared north and south along the land, for each one sought the other's home where the Yule
      drinking was settled to come off. By this time the goodman's daughter was so much better that
      she could walk about with her mother, and thus the day wore on.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir sees how a ship rows up toward the island it was not right big, but shield-hung
      it was from stem to stern, and stained all above the sea: these folk rowed smartly, and made
      for the boat-stands of goodman Thorfinn, and when the keel took land, those who were therein
      sprang overboard. Grettir cast up the number of the men, and they were twelve altogether; he
      deemed their guise to be far from peaceful. They took tip their ship and bore it up from the
      sea; thereafter they ran up to the boat-stand, and therein was that big boat of Thorfinn,
      which was never launched to sea by less than thirty men, but these twelve shot it in one haul
      down to the shingle of the foreshore; and thereon they took up their own bark and bore it into
      the boat-stand.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir thought that he could see clear enough that they would make themselves at home.
      But he goes down to meet them, and welcomes them merrily, and asks who they were and what
      their leader was hight; he to whom these words were spoken answered quickly, and said that his
      name was Thorir, and that he was called Paunch, and that his brother was Ogmund, and that the
      others were fellows of theirs.</p>
     <p>"I deem," said Thorir, "that thy master Thorfinn has heard tell of us; is he perchance at
      home?"</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "Lucky men are ye, and hither have come in a good hour, if ye are the men
      I take you to be; <pb n="53"/> the goodman is gone away with all his home-folk who are
      freemen, and will not be home again till after Yule; but the mistress is at home, and so is
      the goodman's daughter; and if I thought that I had some ill-will to pay back, I should have
      chosen above all things to have come just thus; for here are all matters in plenty whereof ye
      stand in need, both beer, and all other good things."</p>
     <p>Thorir held his peace, while Grettir let this tale run on, then he said to Ogmund--</p>
     <p>"How far have things come to pass other than as I guessed? and now am I well enough minded
      to take revenge on Thorfinn for having made us outlaws; and this man is ready enough of
      tidings, and no need have we to drag the words out of him."</p>
     <p>"Words all may use freely," said Grettir, "and I shall give you such cheer as I may; and now
      come home with me."</p>
     <p>They bade him have thanks therefor, and said they would take his offer.</p>
     <p>But when they came home to the farm, Grettir took Thorir by the hand and led him into the
      hall; and now was Grettir mightily full of words. The mistress was in the hall, and had had it
      decked with hangings, and made all fair and seemly; but when she heard Grettir's talk, she
      stood still on the floor, and asked whom he welcomed in that earnest wise.</p>
     <p>He answered, "Now, mistress, is it right meet to welcome these guests merrily, for here is
      come goodman Thorir Paunch and the whole twelve of them, and are minded to sit here Yule over,
      and a right good hap it is, for we were few enough before."</p>
     <p>She answered, "Am I to number these among bonders and goodmen, who are the worst of robbers
      and ill-doers? <pb n="54"/> a large share of my goods had I given that they had no come here
      as at this time; and ill dost thou reward Thorfinn, for that he took thee a needy man from
      shipwreck and has held thee through the winter as a free man."</p>
     <p>Grettir said, "It would be better to take the wet clothes off these guests than to scold at
      me; since for that thou mayst have time long enough."</p>
     <p>Then said Thorir, "Be not cross-grained, mistress; nought shalt thou miss thy husband's
      being away, for a man shall be got in his place for thee, yea, and for thy daughter a man, and
      for each of the home-women."</p>
     <p>"That is spoken like a man," said Grettir, "nor will they thus have any cause to bewail
      their lot."</p>
     <p>Now all the women rushed forth from the hall smitten with huge dread and weeping; then said
      Grettir to the bearserks, "Give into my hands what it pleases you to lay aside of weapons and
      wet clothes, for the folk will not be yielding to us while they are scared."</p>
     <p>Thorir said he heeded not how women might squeal; "But," said he, "thee indeed we may set
      apart from the other home-folk, and methinks we may well make thee our man of trust."</p>
     <p>"See to that yourselves," said Grettir, "but certes I do not take to all men alike."</p>
     <p>Thereupon they laid aside the more part of their weapons, and thereafter Grettir said--</p>
     <p>"Methinks it is a good rede now that ye sit down to table and drink somewhat, for it is
      right likely that ye are thirsty after the rowing."</p>
     <p>They said they were ready enough for that, but knew not where to find out the cellar;
      Grettir asked if they would that he should see for things and go about for them. The bearserks
      said they would be right fain of that; so Grettir <pb n="55"/> fetched beer and gave them to
      drink; they were mightily weary, and drank in huge draughts, and still he let them have the
      strongest beer that there was, and this went on for a long time, and meanwhile he told them
      many merry tales. From all this there was din enough to be heard among them, and the home-folk
      were nowise fain to come to them.</p>
     <p>Now Thorir said, "Never yet did I meet a man unknown to me, who would do us such good deeds
      as this man; now, what reward wilt thou take of us for thy work?"</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "As yet I look to no reward for this, but if we be even such friends when
      ye go away, as it looks like we shall be, I am minded to join fellowship with you, and though
      I be of less might than some of you, yet shall I not let any man of big redes."</p>
     <p>Hereat they were well pleased, and would settle the fellowship with vows.</p>
     <p>Grettir said that this they should not do, "For true is the old saw, <hi rend="ital">Ale is
       another man</hi>, nor shall ye settle this in haste any further than as I have said, for on
      both sides are we men little meet to rule our tempers."</p>
     <p>They said that they would not undo what they had said. Withal the evening wore on till it
      grew quite dark; then sees Grettir that they were getting very heavy with drink, so he
      said--</p>
     <p>"Do ye not find it time to go to sleep?"</p>
     <p>Thorir said, "Time enough forsooth, and sure shall I be to keep to what I have promised the
      mistress."</p>
     <p>Then Grettir went forth from the hall, and cried out loudly--</p>
     <p>"Go ye to your beds, women all, for so is goodman Thorir pleased to bid."</p>
     <p>They cursed him for this, and to hear them was like <pb n="56"/> hearkening to the noise of
      many wolves. Now the bearserks came forth from the hall, and Grettir said--</p>
     <p>"Let us go out, and I will show you Thorfinn's cloth bower."</p>
     <p>They were willing to be led there; so they came to an out-bower exceeding great; a door
      there was to it, and a strong lock thereon, and the store-house was very strong withal; there
      too was a closet good and great, and a shield panelling between the chambers; both chambers
      stood high, and men went up by steps to them. Now the bearserks got riotous and pushed Grettir
      about, and he kept tumbling away from them, and when they least thought thereof, he slipped
      quickly out of the bower, seized the latch, slammed the door to, and put the bolt on. Thorir
      and his fellows thought at first that the door must have got locked of itself, and paid no
      heed thereto; they had light with them, for Grettir had showed them many choice things which
      Thorfinn owned, and these they now noted awhile. Meantime Grettir made all speed home to the
      farm, and when he came in at the door he called out loudly, and asked where the goodwife was;
      she held her peace, for she did not dare to answer.</p>
     <p>He said, "Here is somewhat of a chance of a good catch; but are there any weapons of avail
      here?"</p>
     <p>She answers, "Weapons there are, but how they may avail thee I know not."</p>
     <p>"Let us talk thereof anon," says he, "but now let every man do his best, for later on no
      better chance shall there be."</p>
     <p>The good wife said, "Now God were in garth if our lot might better: over Thorfinn's bed
      hangs the barbed spear, the big one that was owned by Karr the Old; there, too, is a <pb
       n="57"/> helmet and a byrni, and the short-sword, the good one and the arms will not fail if
      thine heart does well."</p>
     <p>Grettir seizes the helmet and spear, girds himself with the short-sword, and rushed out
      swiftly; and the mistress called upon the house-carles, bidding them follow such a dauntless
      man, four of them rushed forth and seized their weapons, but the other four durst come nowhere
      nigh. Now it is to be said of the bearserks that they thought Grettir delayed his coming back
      strangely; and now they began to doubt if there were not some guile in the matter. They rushed
      against the door and found it was locked, and now they try the timber walls so that every beam
      creaked again; at last they brought things so far that they broke down the shield-panelling,
      got into the passage, and thence out to the steps. Now bearserks'-gang seized them, and they
      howled like dogs. In that very nick of time Grettir came up and with both hands thrust his
      spear at the midst of Thorir, as he was about to get down the steps, so that it went through
      him at once. Now the spear-head was both long and broad, and Ogmund the Evil ran on to Thorir
      and pushed him on to Grettir's thrust, so that all went up to the barb-ends; then the spear
      stood out through Thorir's back and into Ogmund's breast, and they both tumbled dead off the
      spear; then of the others each rushed down the steps as he came forth; Grettir set on each one
      of them, and in turn hewed with the sword, or thrust with the spear; but they defended
      themselves with logs that lay on the green, and whatso thing they could lay hands on,
      therefore the greatest danger it was to deal with them, because of their strength, even though
      they were weaponless.</p>
     <p>Two of the Halogalanders Grettir slew on the green, and then came up the house-carles; they
      could not come to <pb n="58"/> one mind as to what weapons each should have; now they set on
      whenever the bearserks gave back, but when they turned about on them, then the house-carles
      slunk away up to the houses. Six vikings fell there, and of all of them was Grettir the bane.
      Then the six others got off and came down to the boat-stand, and so into it, and thence they
      defended themselves with oars. Grettir now got great blows from them, so that at all times he
      ran the risk of much hurt; but the house-carles went home, and had much to say of their stout
      onset; the mistress bade them espy what became of Grettir, but that was not to be got out of
      them. Two more of the bearserks Grettir slew in the boatstand, but four slipped out by him;
      and by this, dark night had come on; two of them ran into a corn-barn, at the farm of Windham,
      which is aforenamed: here they fought for a long time, but at last Grettir killed them both;
      then was he beyond measure weary and stiff, the night was far gone, and the weather got very
      cold with the drift of the snow. He was fain to leave the search of the two vikings who were
      left now, so he walked home to the farm. The mistress had lights lighted in the highest lofts
      at the windows that they might guide him on his way; and so it was that he found his road home
      whereas he saw the light.</p>
     <p>But when he was come into the door, the mistress went up to him, and bade him welcome.</p>
     <p>"Now," she said, "thou hast reaped great glory, and freed me and my house from a shame of
      which we should never have been healed, but if thou hadst saved us."</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "Methinks I am much the same as I was this evening, when thou didst cast
      ill words on me."</p>
     <p>The mistress answered, "We wotted not that thou wert a man of such prowess as we have now
      proved thee; now shall all things in the house be at thy will which I may <pb n="59"/> bestow
      on thee, and which it may be seeming for thee to take; but methinks that Thorfinn will reward
      thee better still when he comes home."</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "Little of reward will be needed now, but I keep thine offer till the
      coming of the master; and I have some hope now that ye will sleep in peace as for the
      bearserks."</p>
     <p>Grettir drank little that evening, and lay with his weapons about him through the night. In
      the morning, when it began to dawn, people were summoned together throughout the island, and a
      search was set on foot for the bearserks who had escaped the night before; they were found far
      on in the day under a rock, and were by then dead from cold and wounds; then they were brought
      unto a tide-washed heap of stones and buried thereunder.</p>
     <p>After that folk went home, and the men of that island deemed themselves brought unto fair
      peace.</p>
     <p>Now when Grettir came back to the mistress, he sang this stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"By the sea's wash have we made</l>
      <l>Graves, where twelve spear-groves are laid</l>
      <l>I alone such speedy end,</l>
      <l>Unto all these folk did send.</l>
      <l>O fair giver forth of gold,</l>
      <l>Whereof can great words be told,</l>
      <l>'Midst the deeds one man has wrought,</l>
      <l>If this deed should come to nought?"</l>
     </lg>

     <p>The good wife said, "Surely thou art like unto very few men who are now living on the
      earth."</p>
     <p>So she set him in the high seat, and all things she did well to him, and now time wore on
      till Thorfinn's coming home was looked for.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="20">
     <head>How Thorfinn met Grettir at Haramsey again</head>
     <p>AFTER Yule Thorfinn made ready for coming home, and he let those folk go with good gifts
      whom he had bidden to his feast. Now he fares with his following till he comes hard by his
      boat-stands; they saw a ship lying on the strand, and soon knew it for Thorfinn's bark, the
      big one. Now Thorfinn had as yet had no news of the vikings, he bade his men hasten landward,
      "For I fear," said he, "that friends have not been at work here."</p>
     <p>Thorfinn was the first to step ashore before his men, and forthwith he went up to the
      boat-stand; he saw a keel standing there, and knew it for the bearserks' ship. Then he said to
      his men, "My mind misgives me much that here things have come to pass, even such as I would
      have given the whole island, yea, every whit of what I have herein, that they might never have
      happed."</p>
     <p>They asked why he spake thus. Then he said, "Here have come the vikings, whom I know to be
      the worst of all Norway, Thorir Paunch and Ogmund the Evil; in good sooth they will hardly
      have kept house happily for us, and in an Icelander I have but little trust."</p>
     <p>Withal he spoke many things hereabout to his fellows.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir was at home, and so brought it about, that folk were slow to go down to the
      shore; and said he did not care much if the goodman Thorfinn had somewhat of a shake at what
      he saw before him; but when the mistress asked him leave to go, he said she should have her
      will as to where she went, but that he himself should stir nowhither. <pb n="61"/> She ran
      swiftly to meet Thorfinn, and welcomed him cheerily. He was glad thereof, and said, "Praise be
      to God that I see thee whole and merry, and my daughter in likewise. But how have ye fared
      since I went from home?"</p>
     <p>She answered, "Things have turned out well, but we were near being overtaken by such a shame
      as we should never have had healing of, if thy winter-guest had not holpen us."</p>
     <p>Then Thorfinn spake, "Now shall we sit down, but do thou tell us these tidings."</p>
     <p>Then she told all things plainly even as they had come to pass, and praised greatly
      Grettir's stoutness and great daring; meanwhile Thorfinn held his peace, but when she had made
      an end of her tale, he said, "How true is the saw, <hi rend="ital">Long it takes to try a
       man</hi>. But where is Grettir now?</p>
     <p>The goodwife said, "He is at home in the hall."</p>
     <p>Thereupon they went home to the farm.</p>
     <p>Thorfinn went up to Grettir and kissed him, and thanked him with many fair words for the
      great heart which he had shown to him; "And I will say to thee what few say to their friends,
      that I would thou shouldst be in need of men, that then thou mightest know if I were to thee
      in a man's stead or not; but for thy good deed I can never reward thee unless thou comest to
      be in some troublous need; but as to thy abiding with me, that shall ever stand open to thee
      when thou willest it; and thou shalt be held the first of all my men."</p>
     <p>Grettir bade him have much thank therefor. "And," quoth he, "this should I have taken even
      if thou hadst made me proffer thereof before."</p>
     <p>Now Grettir sat there the winter over, and was in the closest friendship with Thorfinn; and
      for this deed he was now well renowned all over Norway, and there the most, <pb n="62"/> where
      the bearserks had erst wrought the greatest ill deeds.</p>
     <p>This spring Thorfinn asked Grettir what he was about to busy himself with: he said he would
      go north to Vogar while the fair was. Thorfinn said there was ready for him money as much as
      he would. Grettir said that he needed no more money at that time than faring-silver: this,
      Thorfinn said, was full-well due to him, and thereupon went with him to ship.</p>
     <p>Now he gave him the short-sword, the good one, which Grettir bore as long as he lived, and
      the choicest of choice things it was. Withal Thorfinn bade Grettir come to him whenever he
      might need aid.</p>
     <p>But Grettir went north to Vogar, and a many folk were there; many men welcomed him there
      right heartily who had not seen him before, for the sake of that great deed of prowess which
      he had done when he saw the vikings; many high-born men prayed him to come and abide with
      them, but he would fain go back to his friend Thorfinn. Now he took ship in a bark that was
      owned of a man hight Thorkel, who dwelt in Salft in Halogaland, and was a high-born man. But
      when Grettir came to Thorkel he welcomed him right heartily, and bade Grettir abide with him
      that winter, and laid many words thereto.</p>
     <p>This offer Grettir took, and was with Thorkel that winter in great joyance and fame.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="21">
     <head>Of Grettir and Biorn and the Bear</head>
     <p>THERE was a man, hight Biorn, who was dwelling with Thorkel; he was a man of rash temper, of
      good <pb n="63"/> birth, and somewhat akin to Thorkel; he was not well loved of men, for he
      would slander much those who were with Thorkel, and in this wise he sent many away. Grettir
      and he had little to do together; Biorn thought him of little worth weighed against himself,
      but Grettir was unyielding, so that things fell athwart between them. Biorn was a mightily
      boisterous man, and made himself very big; many young men gat into fellowship with him in
      these things, and would stray abroad by night. Now it befell, that early in winter a savage
      bear ran abroad from his winter lair, and got so grim that he spared neither man nor beast.
      Men thought he had been roused by the noise that Biorn and his fellows had made. The brute got
      so hard to deal with that he tore down the herds of men, and Thorkel had the greatest hurt
      thereof, for he was the richest man in the neighbourhood.</p>
     <p>Now one day Thorkel bade his men to follow him, and search for the lair of the bear. They
      found it in sheer sea-rocks; there was a high rock and a cave before it down below, but only
      one track to go up to it; under the cave were scarped rocks, and a heap of stones down by the
      sea, and sure death it was to all who might fall down there. The bear lay in his lair by day,
      but went abroad as soon as night fell; no fold could keep sheep safe from him, nor could any
      dogs be set on him: and all this men thought the heaviest trouble. Biorn, Thorkel's kinsman,
      said that the greatest part had been done, as the lair had been found. "And now I shall try,"
      said he, "what sort of play we<note place="foot">Biorn is Icelandic for bear.</note> namesakes
      shall have together." Grettir made as if he knew not what Biorn said on this matter.</p>
     <p>Now it happened always when men went to sleep anights that Biorn disappeared: and one night
      when Biorn <pb n="64"/> went to the lair, he was aware that the beast was there before him,
      and roaring savagely. Biorn lay down in the track, and had over him his shield, and was going
      to wait till the beast should stir abroad as his manner was. Now the bear had an inkling of
      the man, and got somewhat slow to move off. Biorn waxed very sleepy where he lay, and cannot
      wake up, and just at this time the beast betakes himself from his lair; now he sees where the
      man lies, and, hooking at him with his claw, he tears from him the shield and throws it down
      over the rocks. Biorn started up suddenly awake, takes to his legs and runs home, and it was a
      near thing that the beast gat him not. This his fellows knew, for they had spies about Biorn's
      ways; in the morning they found the shield, and made the greatest jeering at all this.</p>
     <p>At Yule Thorkel went himself, and eight of them altogether, and there was Grettir and Biorn
      and other followers of Thorkel. Grettir had on a fur-cloak, which he laid aside while they set
      on the beast. It was awkward for an onslaught there, for thereat could folk come but by
      spear-thrusts, and all the spear-points the bear turned off him with his teeth.. Now Biorn
      urged them on much to the onset, yet he himself went not so nigh as to run the risk of any
      hurt. Amid this, when men looked least for it, Biorn suddenly seized Grettir's coat, and cast
      it into the beast's lair. Now nought they could wreak on him, and had to go back when the day
      was far spent. But when Grettir was going he misses his coat, and he could see that the bear
      has it cast under him. Then he said, "What man of you has wrought the jest of throwing my
      cloak into the lair?"</p>
     <p>Biorn says, "He who is like to dare to own to it."</p>
     <p>Grettir answers, "I set no great store on such matters."</p>
     <p>Now they, went on their way home, and when they had <pb n="65"/> walked awhile, the thong of
      Grettir's leggings brake. Thorkel bid them wait for him; but Grettir said there was no need of
      that. Then said Biorn, "Ye need not think that Grettir will run away from his coat; he will
      have the honour all to himself, and will slay that beast all alone, wherefrom we have gone
      back all eight of us; thus would he be such as he is said to be: but sluggishly enow has he
      fared forth to-day."</p>
     <p>"I know not," said Thorkel, "how thou wilt fare in the end, but men of equal prowess I deem
      you not: lay as few burdens on him as thou mayst, Biorn."</p>
     <p>Biorn said, that neither of them should pick and choose words from out his mouth.</p>
     <p>Now, when a hill's brow was between them, Grettir went back to the pass, for now there was
      no striving with others for the onset. He drew the sword, Jokul's gift, but had a loop over
      the handle of the short-sword, and slipped it up over his hand, and this he did in that he
      thought he could easier have it at his will if his hand were loose. He went up into the pass
      forthwith, and when the beast saw a man, it rushed against Grettir exceeding fiercely, and
      smote at him with that paw which was furthest off from the rock; Grettir hewed against the
      blow with the sword, and therewith smote the paw above the claws, and took it off; then the
      beast was fain to smite at Grettir with the paw that was whole, and dropped down therewith on
      to the docked one, but it was shorter than he wotted of, and withal he tumbled into to
      Grettir's arms. Now he griped at the beast between the ears and held him off, so that he got
      not at him to bite. And, so Grettir himself says, that herein he deemed he had had the hardest
      trial of his strength, thus to hold the brute. But now as it struggled fiercely, and the space
      was narrow, they both tumbled down over the rock; the beast <pb n="66"/> was the heaviest of
      the two, and came down first upon the stone heap below, Grettir being the uppermost, and the
      beast was much mangled on its nether side. Now Grettir seized the short-sword and thrust it
      into the heart of the bear, and that was his bane. Thereafter he went home, taking with him
      his cloak all tattered, and withal what he had cut from the paw of the bear. Thorkel sat
      a-drinking when be came into the ball, and much men laughed at the rags of the cloak Grettir
      had cast over him. Now he threw on to the table what he had chopped off the paw.</p>
     <p>Then said Thorkel, "Where is now Biorn my kinsman? never did I see thy irons bite the like
      of this, Biorn, and my will it is, that thou make Grettir a seemly offer for this shame thou
      hast wrought on him."</p>
     <p>Biorn said that was like to be long about, "and never shall I care whether he likes it well
      or ill."</p>
     <p>Then Grettir sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Oft that war-god came to hall</l>
      <l>Frighted, when no blood did fall,</l>
      <l>In the dusk; who ever cried</l>
      <l>On the bear last autumn-tide;</l>
      <l>No man saw me sitting there</l>
      <l>Late at eve before the lair</l>
      <l>Yet the shaggy one to-day</l>
      <l>From his den I drew away."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>"Sure enough," said Biorn, "thou hast fared forth well to-day, and two tales thou tellest of
      us twain therefor; and well I know that thou hast had a good hit at me."</p>
     <p>Thorkel said, "I would, Grettir, that thou wouldst not avenge thee on Biorn, but for him I
      will give a full man-gild if thereby ye may be friends." <pb n="67"/> Biorn said he might well
      turn his money to better account, than to boot for this; "And, methinks it is wisest that in
      my dealings with Grettir <hi rend="ital">one oak should have what from the other it
       shaves</hi>."</p>
     <p>Grettir said that he should like that very well. But Thorkel said, "Yet I hope, Grettir,
      that thou wilt do this for my sake, not to do aught against Biorn while ye are with me."</p>
     <p>"That shall be," said Grettir.</p>
     <p>Biorn said he would walk fearless of Grettir wheresoever they might meet.</p>
     <p>Grettir smiled mockingly, but would not take boot for Biorn. So they were here that winter
      through.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="22">
     <head>Of the Slaying of Biorn</head>
     <p>IN the spring Grettir went north to Vogar with chapmen. He and Thorkel parted in friendship;
      but Biorn went west to England, and was the master of Thorkel's ship that went thither. Biorn
      dwelt thereabout that summer and bought such things for Thorkel as he had given him word to
      get; but as the autumn wore on he sailed from the west. Grettir was at Vogar till the fleet
      broke up; then he sailed from the north with some chapmen until they came to a harbour at an
      island before the mouth of Drontheim-firth, called Gartar, where they pitched their tents. Now
      when they were housed, a ship came sailing havenward from the south along the land; they soon
      saw that it was an England farer; she took the strand further out, and her crew went <pb
       n="68"/> ashore; Grettir and his fellows went to meet them. But when they met, Grettir saw
      that Biorn was among those men, and spake--</p>
     <p>"It is well that we have met here; now we may well take up our ancient quarrel, and now I
      will try which of us twain may do the most."</p>
     <p>Biorn said that was an old tale to him, "but if there has been aught of such things between
      us, I will boot for it, so that thou mayst think thyself well holden thereof."</p>
     <p>Then Grettir sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"In hard strife I slew the bear,</l>
      <l>Thereof many a man doth hear;</l>
      <l>Then the cloak I oft had worn,</l>
      <l>By the beast to rags was torn</l>
      <l>Thou, O braggart ring-bearer,</l>
      <l>Wrought that jest upon me there,</l>
      <l>Now thou payest for thy jest,</l>
      <l>Not in words am I the best."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Biorn said, that oft had greater matters than these been atoned for.</p>
     <p>Grettir said, "That few had chosen hitherto to strive to trip him up with spite and envy,
      nor ever had he taken fee for such, and still must matters fare in likewise. Know thou that we
      shall not both of us go hence whole men if I may have my will, and a coward's name will I lay
      on thy back, if thou darest not to fight."</p>
     <p>Now Biorn saw that it would avail nought to try to talk himself free; so he took his weapons
      and went a-land.</p>
     <p>Then they ran one at the other and fought, but not long before Biorn got sore wounded, and
      presently fell dead to earth. But when Biorn's fellows saw that, they went to <pb n="61"/>
      their ship, and made off north along the land to meet Thorkel and told him of this hap: he
      said it had not come to pass ere it might have been looked for.</p>
     <p>Soon after this Thorkel went south to Drontheim, and met there Earl Svein. Grettir went
      south to Mere after the slaying of Biorn, and found his friend Thorfinn, and told him what had
      befallen. Thorfinn gave him good welcome, and said--</p>
     <p>"It is well now that thou art in need of a friend, with me shalt thou abide until these
      matters have come to an end."</p>
     <p>Grettir thanked him for his offer, and said he would take it now.</p>
     <p>Earl Svein was dwelling in Drontheim, at Steinker, when he heard of Biorn's slaying; at that
      time there was with him Hiarandi, the brother of Biorn, and he was the Earl's man; he was
      exceeding wroth when he heard of the slaying of Biorn, and begged the Earl's aid in the
      matter, and the Earl gave his word thereto.</p>
     <p>Then he sent men to Thorfinn and summoned to him both him and Grettir. Thorfinn and Grettir
      made ready at once at the Earl's bidding to go north to Drontheim to meet him. Now the Earl
      held a council on the matter, and bade Hiarandi to be thereat; Hiarandi said he would not
      bring his brother to purse; "and I shall either fare in a like wise with him, or else wreak
      vengeance for him." Now when the matter was looked into, the Earl found that Biorn had been
      guilty towards Grettir in many ways; and Thorfinn offered weregild, such as the Earl deemed
      might be befitting for Biorn's kin to take; and thereon he had much to say on the freedom
      which Grettir had wrought for men north there in the land, when he slew the bearserks, as has
      been afore said. <pb n="70"/> The Earl answered, "With much truth thou sayest this, Thorfinn,
      that was the greatest land-ridding, and good it seems to us to take weregild because of thy
      words; and withal Grettir is a man well renowned because of his strength and prowess."</p>
     <p>Hiarandi would not take the settlement, and they broke up the meeting. Thorfinn got his
      kinsman Arnbiorn to go about with Grettir day by day, for he knew that Hiarandi lay in wait
      for his life.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="23">
     <head>The Slaying of Hiarandi</head>
     <p>IT happened one day that Grettir and Arnbiorn were walking through some streets for their
      sport, that as they came past a certain court gate, a man bounded forth therefrom with axe
      borne aloft, and drave it at Grettir with both hands; he was all unwares of this, and walked
      on slowly; Arnbiorn caught timely sight of the man, and seized Grettir, and thrust him on so
      hard that he fell on his knee; the axe smote the shoulder-blade, and cut sideways out under
      the arm-pit, and a great wound it was. Grettir turned about nimbly, and drew the short-sword,
      and saw that there was Hiarandi. Now the axe stuck fast in the road, and it was slow work for
      Hiarandi to draw it to him again, and in this very nick of time Grettir hewed at him, and the
      blow fell on the upper arm, near the shoulder, and cut it off; then the fellows of Hiarandi
      rushed forth, five of them, and a fight forthwith befell, and speedy change happed there, for
      Grettir and Arnbiorn slew those who were <pb n="71"/> with Hiarandi, all but one, who got off,
      and forthwith went to the Earl to tell him these tidings.</p>
     <p>The Earl was exceeding wroth when he heard of this, and the second day thereafter he had a
      Thing summoned. Then they, Thorfinn and Grettir, came both to the Thing. The Earl put forth
      against Grettir the guilt for these manslaughters; he owned them all, and said he had had to
      defend his hands.</p>
     <p>"Whereof methinks I bear some marks on me," says Grettir, "and surely I had found death if
      Arnbiorn had not saved me."</p>
     <p>The Earl answered that it was ill hap that Grettir was not slain.</p>
     <p>"For many a man's bane wilt thou be if thou livest, Grettir."</p>
     <p>Then came to the Earl, Bessi, son of Skald-Torfa, a fellow and a friend to Grettir; he and
      Thorfinn went before the Earl and prayed him respite for Grettir, and offered, that the Earl
      alone should doom in this matter, but that Grettir might have peace and leave to dwell in the
      land.</p>
     <p>The Earl was slow to come to any settlement, but suffered himself to be led thereto because
      of their prayers. There respite was granted to Grettir till the next spring; still the Earl
      would not settle the peace till Gunnar, the brother of Biorn and Hiarandi, was thereat; now
      Gunnar was a court-owner in Tunsberg.</p>
     <p>In the spring, the Earl summoned Grettir and Thorfinn east to Tunsberg, for he would dwell
      there east while the most sail was thereat. Now they went east thither, and the Earl was
      before them in the town when they came. Here Grettir found his brother, Thorstein Dromond, who
      was fain of him and bade him abide with him: Thorstein was a court-owner in the town. Grettir
      told him all about his matters, <pb n="72"/> and Thorstein gave a good hearing thereto, but
      bade him beware of Gunnar. And so the spring wore on.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="24">
     <head>Of the Slaying of Gunnar, and Grettir's strife with Earl Svein</head>
     <p>NOW Gunnar was in the town, and lay in wait for Grettir always and everywhere. It happened
      on a day that Grettir-sat in a booth a-drinking, for he would not throw himself in Gunnar's
      way. But, when be wotted of it the least, the door was driven at so that it brake asunder,
      four men all-armed burst in, and there was Gunnar and his fellows.</p>
     <p>They set on Grettir; but he caught up his weapons which hung over him, and then drew aback
      into the corner, whence he defended himself, having before him the shield, but dealing blows
      with the short-sword, nor did they have speedy luck with him. Now he smote at one of Gunnar's
      fellows, and more he needed not, then he advanced forth on the floor, and therewith they were
      driven doorward through the booth, and there fell another man of Gunnar's; then were Gunnar
      and his fellows fain of flight; one of them got to the door, struck his foot against the
      threshold and lay there grovelling and was slow in getting to his feet. Gunnar had his shield
      before him, and gave back before Grettir, but he set on him fiercely and leaped up on the
      cross-beam by the door. Now the hands of Gunnar and the shield were within the door, but
      Grettir dealt a blow down amidst Gunnar and the shield and cut off both his hands by <pb
       n="73"/> the wrist, and he fell aback out of the door; then Grettir dealt him his
      death-blow.</p>
     <p>But in this nick of time got to his feet Gunnar's man, who had lain fallen awhile, and he
      ran straightway to see the Earl, and to tell him these tidings.</p>
     <p>Earl Svein was wondrous wroth at this tale, and forthwith summoned a Thing in the town. But
      when Thorfinn and Thorstein Dromond knew this, they brought together their kin and friends and
      came thronging to the Thing. Very cross-grained was the Earl, and it was no easy matter to
      come to speech with him. Thorfinn went up first before the Earl and said, "For this cause am I
      come hither, to offer thee peace and honour for these man-slayings that Grettir has wrought;
      thou alone shalt shape and settle all, if the man hath respite of his life."</p>
     <p>The Earl answered sore wroth: "Late wilt thou be loth to ask respite for Grettir; but in my
      mind it is that thou hast no good cause in court; he has now slain three brothers, one at the
      heels of the other, who were men so brave that they would none bear the other to purse. Now it
      will not avail thee, Thorfinn, to pray for Grettir, for I will not thus bring wrongs into the
      land so as to take boot for such unmeasured misdeeds."</p>
     <p>Then came forward Bessi, Skald-Torfa's son, and prayed the Earl to take the offered
      settlement. "Thereto," be said, "I will give up my goods, for Grettir is a man of great kin
      and a good friend of mine; thou mayst well see, Lord, that it is better to respite one man's
      life and to have therefor the thanks of many, thyself alone dooming the fines, than to break
      down thine own honour, and risk whether thou canst seize the man or not."</p>
     <p>The Earl answered, "Thou farest well herein, Bessi, and showest at all times that thou art a
      high-minded man; <pb n="74"/> still I am loth thus to break the laws of the land, giving
      respite to men of foredoomed lives."</p>
     <p>Then stepped forth Thorstein Dromond and greeted the Earl, and made offers on Grettir's
      behalf, and laid thereto many fair words. The Earl asked for what cause he made offers for
      this man. Thorstein said that they were brothers. The Earl said that he had not known it
      before: "Now it is but the part of a man for thee to help him, but because we have made up our
      mind not to take money for these manslayings, we shall make all men of equal worth here, and
      Grettir's life will we have, whatsoever it shall cost and whensoever chance shall serve."</p>
     <p>Thereat the Earl sprang up, and would listen in nowise to the offered atonements.</p>
     <p>Now Thorfinn and his folk went home to Thorstein's court and made ready. But when the Earl
      saw this he bade all his men take weapons, and then he went thither with his folk in array.
      But before he came up Thorfinn and his men ordered themselves for defence before the gate of
      the court. Foremost stood Thorfinn and Thorstein and Grettir, and then Bessi, and each of them
      had a large following of men with him.</p>
     <p>The Earl bade them to give up Grettir, nor to bring themselves into an evil strait; they
      made the very same offer as before. The Earl would not hearken thereto. Then Thorfinn and
      Thorstein said that the Earl should have more ado yet for the getting of Grettir's life, "For
      one fate shall befall us all, and it will be said thou workest hard for one man's life, if all
      we have to be laid on earth therefor."</p>
     <p>The Earl said he should spare none of them, and now they were at the very point to
      fight.</p>
     <p>Then went to the Earl many men of good-will, and <pb n="75"/> prayed him not to push matters
      on to such great evils, and said they would have to pay heavily before all these were slain.
      The Earl found this rede to be wholesome, and became somewhat softened thereat.</p>
     <p>Thereafter they drew up an agreement to which Thorstein and Thorfinn were willing enough,
      now that Grettir should have respite of his life. The Earl spake: "Know ye," quoth he, "that
      though I deal by way of mean words with these manslayings at this time, yet I call this no
      settlement, but I am loth to fight against my own folk; though I see that ye make little of me
      in this matter."</p>
     <p>Then said Thorfinn, "This is a greater honour for thee, Lord, for that thou alone wilt doom
      the weregild."</p>
     <p>Then the Earl said that Grettir should go in peace, as for him, out to Iceland, when ships
      fared out, if so they would; they said that they would take this. They paid the Earl fines to
      his mind, and parted from him with little friendship. Grettir went with Thorfinn; he and his
      brother Thorstein parted fondly.</p>
     <p>Thorfinn got great fame for the aid he had given Grettir against such overwhelming power as
      he had to deal with: none of the men who had helped Grettir were ever after well loved of the
      Earl, save Bessi.</p>
     <p>So quoth Grettir--</p>

     <p>Grettir went back north with Thorfinn, and was with him till he gat him to ship with chapmen
      who were bound out to Iceland : he gave him many fair gifts of raiment, and a fair-stained
      saddle and a bridle withal. They parted in friendship, and Thorfinn bade him come to him

     <head>The Slaying of Thorgils Makson</head>
     <p>ASMUND the Greyhaired lived on at Biarg, while Grettir was abroad, and by that time he was
      thought to be the greatest of bonders in Midfirth. Thorkel Krafla died during those seasons
      that Grettir was out of Iceland. Thorvald Asgeirson farmed then at the Ridge in Waterdale, and
      waxed a great chief. He was the father of Dalla whom Isleif had to wife, he who afterwards was
      bishop at Skalholt.</p>
     <p>Asmund had in Thorvald the greatest help in suits and in many other matters. At Asmund's
      grew up a man, hight Thorgils, called Thorgils Makson, near akin to Asmund. Thorgils was a man
      of great strength and gained much money by Asmund's foresight.</p>
     <p>Asmund bought for Thorgils the land at Brookmeet, and there he farmed. Thorgils was a great
      store-gatherer, and went a-searching to the Strands every year, and there he gat for himself
      whales and other gettings; and a stout-hearted man he was.</p>
     <p>In those days was at its height the waxing of the foster brothers, Thorgeir Havarson and
      Thormod Coalbrowskald, they had a boat and went therein far and wide, and were not thought men
      of much even-dealing. It chanced one summer that Thorgils Makson found a whale on the common
      drift-lands, and forthwith he and his folk set about cutting, it up.</p>
     <p>But when the foster-brothers heard thereof they went thither, and at first their talk had a
      likely look out. Thorgils <pb n="78"/> offered that they should have the half of the uncut
      whale; but they would have for themselves all the uncut, or else divide all into halves, both
      the cut and the uncut. Thorgils flatly refused to give up what was cut of the whale; and
      thereat things grew hot between them, and forthwithal both sides caught up their weapons and
      fought. Thorgeir and Thorgils fought long together without either losing or gaining and both
      were of the eagerest. Their strife was both fierce and long, but the end of it was, that
      Thorgils fell dead to earth before Thorgeir; but Thormod and the men of Thorgils fought in
      another place; Thormod had the best of that strife, and three of Thorgils' men fell before
      him. After the slaying of Thorgils, his folk went back east to Midfirth, and brought his dead
      body with them. Men thought that they had the greatest loss in him. But the foster-brothers
      took all the whale to themselves.</p>
     <p>This meeting Thormod tells of in that drapa that he made on Thorgeir dead. Asmund the
      Greyhaired heard of the slaying of Thorgils his kinsman; he was suitor in the case for
      Thorgils' slaying, he went and took witnesses to the wounds, and summoned the case before the
      Althing, for then this seemed to be law, as the case had happened in another quarter. And so
      time wears on.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="26">
     <head>Of Thorstein Kuggson, and the gathering for the Bloodsuit for the Slaying of Thorgils
      Makson</head>
     <p>THERE was a man called Thorstein, he was the son of Thorkel Kugg, the son of Thord the
      Yeller, the son <pb n="79"/> of Olaf Feilan, the son of Thorstein the Red, the son of And the
      Deep-minded. The mother of Thorstein Kuggson was Thurid the daughter of Asgeir Madpate, Asgeir
      was father's brother of Asmund the Greyhaired.</p>
     <p>Thorstein Kuggson was suitor in the case about Thorgils Makson's slaying along with Asmund
      the Greyhaired, who now sent word to Thorstein that he should come to meet him. Thorstein was
      a great champion, and the wildest-tempered of men; he went at once to meet his kinsman Asmund,
      and they talked the blood-suit over together. Thorstein was mightily wroth and said that no
      atonement should be for this, and said they had strength of kin enough to bring about for the
      slaying either outlawry or vengeance on men. Asmund said that he would follow him in
      whatsoever he would have done. They rode north to Thorvald their kinsman to pray his aid, and
      he quickly gave his word and said yea thereto. So they settled the suit against Thorgeir and
      Thormod; then Thorstein rode home to his farmstead, he then farmed at Liarskogar in Hvamsveit.
      Skeggi farmed at Hvam, he also joined in the suit with Thorstein. Skeggi was the son of
      Thorarinn Fylsenni, the son of Thord the Yeller; the mother of Skeggi was Fridgerd, daughter
      of Thord of Head.</p>
     <p>These had a many men with them at the Thing, and pushed their suit with great eagerness.</p>
     <p>Asmund and Thorvald rode from the north with six tens of men, and sat at Liarskogar many
      nights.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="27">
     <head>The Suit for the Slaying of Thorgils Makson</head>
     <p>A MAN hight Thorgils abode at Reek-knolls in those days, he was the son of Ari, the son of
      Mar, the son of Atli the Red, the son of Ulf the Squinter, who settled at Reekness; the mother
      of Thorgils Arison was Thorgerd, the daughter of Alf a-Dales; another daughter of Alf was
      Thorelf, mother of Thorgeir Havarson. There had Thorgeir good kinship to trust in, for
      Thorgils was the greatest chief in the Westfirthers' quarter. He was a man of such
      bountifulness, that he gave food to any free-born man as long as he would have it, and
      therefore there was at all times a throng of people at Reek-knolls; thus had Thorgils much
      renown of his house-keeping. He was a man withal of good will and foreknowledge. Thorgeir was
      with Thorgils in winter, but went to the Strands in summer.</p>
     <p>After the slaying of Thorgils Makson, Thorgeir went to Reek-knolls and told Thorgils Arison
      these tidings; Thorgils said that he was ready to give him harbour with him, "But, methinks,"
      he says, "that they will be heavy in the suit, and I am loth to eke out the troubles. Now I
      shall send a man to Thorstein and bid weregild for the slaying of Thorgils; but if he will not
      take atonement I shall not defend the case stiffly."</p>
     <p>Thorgeir said he would trust to his foresight. In autumn Thorgils sent a man to Thorstein
      Kuggson to try settling the case, but he was cross-grained to deal with as to the taking money
      for the blood-suit of Thorgils Makson; but about the other manslayings, he said he would do as
      wise <pb n="81"/> men should urge him. Now when Thorgils heard this, he called Thorgeir to him
      for a talk, and asked him what kind of aid he now deemed meetest for him; Thorgeir said that
      it was most to his mind to go abroad if he should be outlawed. Thorgils said that that should
      be tried. A ship lay up Northriver in Burgfirth; in that keel Thorgils secretly paid faring
      for the foster-brothers, and thus the winter passed. Thorgils heard that Asmund and Thorstein
      drew together many men to the Althing, and sat in Liarskogar. He drew out the time of riding
      from home, for he would that Asmund and Thorstein should have ridden by before him to the
      south, when he came from the west; and so it fell out. Thorgils rode south, and with him rode
      the foster-brothers. In this ride Thorgeir killed Bundle-Torfi of Marswell, and Skuf withal,
      and Biarni in Dog-dale; thus says Thormod in Thorgeir's-Drapa--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Mighty strife the warrior made,</l>
      <l>When to earth was Makson laid,</l>
      <l>Well the sword-shower wrought he there,</l>
      <l>Flesh the ravens got to tear;</l>
      <l>Then when Skuf and Biarni fell,</l>
      <l>He was there the tale to tell;</l>
      <l>Sea-steed's rider took his way</l>
      <l>Through the thickest of the fray."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Thorgils settled the peace for the slaying of Skuf and Biarni then and there in the Dale,
      and delayed no longer than his will was before; Thorgeir went to ship, but Thorgils to the
      Althing, and came not thither until men were going to the courts.</p>
     <p>Then Asmund the Greyhaired challenged the defence for the blood-suit on the slaying of
      Thorgils Makson. <pb n="82"/> Thorgils went to the court and offered weregild for the slaying,
      if thereby Thorgeir might become free of guilt; he put forth for defence in the suit whether
      they had not free catch on all common foreshores. The lawman was asked if this was a lawful
      defence. Skapti was the lawman, and backed Asmund for the sake of their kinship. He said this
      was law if they were equal men, but said that bonders had a right to take before batchelors.
      Asmund said that Thorgils had offered an even sharing to the foster-brothers in so much of the
      whale as was uncut when they came thereto; and therewith that way of defence was closed
      against them. Now Thorstein and his kin followed up the suit with much eagerness, and nought
      was good to them but that Thorgeir should be made guilty.</p>
     <p>Thorgils saw that one of two things was to be done, either to set on with many men, not
      knowing what might be gained thereby, or to suffer them to go on as they would; and, whereas
      Thorgeir had been got on board ship, Thorgils let the suit go on unheeded.</p>
     <p>Thorgeir was outlawed, but for Thormod was taken weregild, and he to be quit. By this
      blood-suit Thorstein and Asmund were deemed to have waxed much. And now men ride home from the
      Thing.</p>
     <p>Some men would hold talk that Thorgils had lightly backed the case, but he heeded their talk
      little, and let any one say thereon what he would.</p>
     <p>But when Thorgeir heard of this outlawry, he said--</p>
     <p>"Fain am I that those who have made me an outlaw should have full pay for this, ere all be
      over."</p>
     <p>There was a man called Gaut Sleitason, who was akin to Thorgils Makson. Gaut had made ready
      to go in this same ship wherein Thorgeir was to sail. He bristled up against Thorgeir, and
      showed mighty ill-will against him <pb n="83"/> and went about scowling; when the chapmen
      found this out, they thought it far from safe that both should sail in one ship. Thorgeir said
      he heeded not how much soever Gaut would bend his brows on him, still it was agreed that Gaut
      should take himself off from the ship, whereupon he went north into the upper settlements, and
      that time nought happed between him and Thorgeir, but out of this sprang up between them ill
      blood, as matters showed after.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="28">
     <head>Grettir comes out to Iceland again</head>
     <p>THIS summer Grettir Asmundson came out to Skagafirth: he was in those days so famed a man
      for strength and prowess, that none was deemed his like among young men. He rode home to Biarg
      forthwith, and Asmund welcomed him meetly. At that time Atli managed the farming matters, and
      well things befell betwixt the brothers.</p>
     <p>But now Grettir waxed so overbearing, that he deemed that nought was too much for him to do.
      At that time had many men grown into full manhood who were young in the days when Grettir was
      wont to play with them on Midfirthwater before he went abroad; one of these was Audun, who
      then dwelt at Audunstead, in Willowdale, he was the Son of Asgeir, the son of Audun, the son
      of Asgeir Madpate; of all men he was the strongest north there; but he was thought to be the
      gentlest of neighbours. Now it came into Grettir's mind that he had had the worst of Audun, in
       <pb n="84"/> that ball-play whereof is told before; and now he would fain try which of the
      twain had ripened the most since then. For this cause Grettir took his way from home, and
      fared unto Audunstead. This was in early mowing tide; Grettir was well dight, and rode in a
      fair-stained saddle of very excellent workmanship, which Thorfinn had given him; a good horse
      he had withal, and all weapons of the best. Grettir came early in the day to Audunstead, and
      knocked at the door. Few folk were within; Grettir asked if Audun was at home. Men said that
      he had gone to fetch victuals from the hill-dairy. Then Grettir took the bridle off his horse;
      the field was unmowed, and the horse went whereas, the grass was the highest. Grettir went
      into the hall, sat down on the seat-beam, and thereon fell asleep. Soon after Audun came home,
      and sees a horse grazing in the field with a fair-stained saddle on; Audun was bringing
      victuals on two horses, and carried curds on one of them, in drawn-up hides, tied round about:
      this fashion men called curd-bags. Audun took the loads off the horses and carried the
      curd-bags in his arms into the house.</p>
     <p>Now it was dark before his eyes, and Grettir stretched his foot from out the beam so that
      Audun fell flat down head-foremost on to the curd-bag, whereby the bonds of the bag brake;
      Audun leaped up and asked who was that rascal in the way. Grettir named himself.</p>
     <p>Then said Audun, "Rashly hast thou done herein what is thine errand then?"</p>
     <p>Grettir said, "I will fight with thee."</p>
     <p>"First I will see about my victuals," said Audun.</p>
     <p>"That thou mayst well do," said Grettir, "if thou canst .not charge other folk
      therewith."</p>
     <p>Then Audun stooped down and caught up the curd-bag and dashed it against Grettir's bosom,
      and bade him first <pb n="85"/> take what was sent him; and therewith was Grettir all
      smothered in the curds; and a greater shame he deemed that than if Audun had given him a great
      wound.</p>
     <p>Now thereon they rushed at one another and wrestled fiercely; Grettir set on with great
      eagerness, but Audun gave back before him. Yet he feels that Grettir has outgrown him in
      strength. Now all things in their way were kicked out of place, and they were borne on
      wrestling to and fro throughout all the hall; neither spared his might, but still Grettir was
      the toughest of the twain, and at last Audun fell, having torn all weapons from Grettir.</p>
     <p>Now they grapple hard with one another, and huge cracking was all around them. Withal a
      great din was heard coining through the earth underneath the farmstead, and Grettir heard some
      one ride up to the houses, get off his horse, and stride in with great strides; he sees a man
      come up, of goodly growth, in a red kirtle and with a helmet on his head. He took his way into
      the hall, for he had heard clamorous doings there as they were struggling together; he asked
      what was in the hall.</p>
     <p>Grettir named himself, "But who asks thereof?" quoth he.</p>
     <p>"Bardi am I hight," said the new comer.</p>
     <p>"Art thou Bardi, the son of Gudmund, from Asbiornsness?"</p>
     <p>"That very man am I," said Bardi; "but what art thou doing?"</p>
     <p>Grettir said, "We, Audun and I, are playing here in sport."</p>
     <p>"I know not as to the sport thereof," said Bardi, "nor are ye even men either; thou art full
      of unfairness and overbearing, and he is easy and good to deal with; so let him stand up
      forthwith." <pb n="86"/> Grettir said, "<hi rend="ital">Many a man stretches round the door to
       the lock</hi>; and meseems it lies more in thy way to avenge thy brother Hall<note
       place="foot">Who was killed in Norway by the sons of Harek, and whose revenge is told of in
       the Saga of the Heath slayings (existing in fragment).</note>, than to meddle in the dealings
      betwixt me and Audun."</p>
     <p>"At all times I hear this," said Bardi, "nor know I if that will be avenged, but none the
      less I will that thou let Audun be at peace, for he is a quiet man."</p>
     <p>Grettir did so at Bardi's bidding, nathless, little did it please him. Bardi asked for what
      cause they strove.</p>
     <p>Grettir sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Prithee, Audun, who can tell,</l>
      <l>But that now thy throat shall swell,</l>
      <l>That from rough hands thou shalt gain</l>
      <l>By our strife a certain pain.</l>
      <l>E'en such wrong as I have done,</l>
      <l>I of yore from Audun won,</l>
      <l>When the young, fell-creeping lad</l>
      <l>At his hands a choking had."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Bardi said that certes it was a matter to be borne with, if he had had to avenge
      himself.</p>
     <p>"Now I will settle matters between you," quoth Bardi;</p>
     <p>"I will that ye part, leaving things as they are, that thereby there may be an end of all
      between you."</p>
     <p>This they let hold good, but Grettir took ill liking to Bardi and his brothers.</p>
     <p>Now they all rode off, and when they were somewhat on their way, Grettir spake--</p>
     <p>"I have heard that thou hast will to go to Burgfirth <pb n="87"/> this summer, and I now
      offer to go south with thee; and methinks that herein I do for thee more than thou art worthy
      of."</p>
     <p>Hereat was Bardi glad, and speedily said yea thereto, and bade him have thanks for this; and
      thereupon they parted. But a little after Bardi came back and said--</p>
     <p>"I will have it known that thou goest not unless my foster-father Thorarin will have it so,
      for he shall have all the rule of the faring."</p>
     <p>"Well mightest thou, methinks, have full freedom as to thine own redes," said Grettir, "and
      my faring I will not have laid under the choice of other folk; and I shall mislike it if thou
      castest me aside from thy fellowship."</p>
     <p>Now either went their way, and Bardi said he should let Grettir know for sure if Thorarin
      would that he should fare with him, but that otherwise he might sit quiet at home. Grettir
      rode home to Biarg, but Bardi to his own house.</p>

     <head>Of the Horse-fight at Longfit</head>
     <p>THAT summer was settled to be a great horse-fight at Longfit, below Reeks. Thither came many
      men. Atli of Biarg had a good horse, a black-maned roan of Keingala's kin, and father and son
      had great love for that horse. The brothers, Kormak and Thorgils of Meal, had a brown horse,
      trusty in fight. These were to fight their horse against Atli of Biarg. And many other good
      horses were there.</p>
     <p>Odd the Foundlingskald, of Kormak's kin, was to follow the horse of his kinsman through the
      day. Odd was then <pb n="88"/> growing a big man, and bragged much of himself, and was
      untameable and reckless. Grettir asked of Atli his brother, who should follow his horse.</p>
     <p>"I am not so clear about that," said he.</p>
     <p>"Wilt thou that I stand by it?" said Grettir.</p>
     <p>"Be thou then very peaceable, kinsman," said Atli, "for here have we to deal with
      overbearing men."</p>
     <p>"Well, let them pay for their own insolence," said Grettir, "if they know not how to hold it
      back."</p>
     <p>Now are the horses led out, but all stood forth on the river-bank tied together. There was a
      deep hollow in the river down below the bank. The horses bit well at each other, and the
      greatest sport it was.</p>
     <p>Odd drave on his horse with all his might, but Grettir held back, and seized the tail with
      one hand, and the staff wherewith he goaded the horse he held in the other. Odd stood far
      before his horse, nor was it so sure that he did not goad Atli's horse from his hold. Grettir
      made as if he saw it not. Now the horses bore forth towards the river. Then Odd drave his
      staff at Grettir, and smote the shoulder-blade, for that Grettir turned the shoulder towards
      him: that was so mighty a stroke, that the flesh shrank from under it, but Grettir was little
      scratched.</p>
     <p>Now in that nick of time the horses reared up high, and Grettir ran under his horse's hocks,
      and thrust his staff so hard at the side of Odd that three ribs brake in him, but he was
      hurled out into deep water, together with his horse. and all the horses that were tied
      together. Then men swam out to him and dragged him out of the river; then was a great hooting
      made thereat; Kormak's folk ran to their weapons, as did the men of Biarg in another place.
      But when the Ramfirthers and the men of Waterness saw that, they went betwixt them, and they
      were parted and <pb n="89"/> went home, but both sides had ill-will one with the other, though
      they sat peacefully at home for a while. Atli was sparing of speech over this, but Grettir was
      right unsparing, and said that they would meet another time if his will came to pass.</p>

     <head>Of Thorbiorn Oxmain and Thorbiorn Tardy, and of Grettir's meeting with Kormak on
      Ramfirth-neck</head>
     <p>THORBIORN was the name of a man who dwelt at Thorodstead in Ramfirth; he was the son of
      Arnor Hay-nose,<note place="foot">In the Landnáma he is called 'Hy-nef;' the meaning is
       doubtful, but it seems that the author of this history means to call him Hay-nose.</note> the
      son of Thorod, who had settled Ramfirth on that side out as far as Bank was on the other.
      Thorbiorn was the strongest of all men; he was called Oxmain. Thorod was the name of his
      brother, he was called Drapa-stump; their mother was Gerd, daughter of Bodvar, from
      Bodvars-knolls. Thorbiorn was a great and hardy warrior, and had many men with him; he was
      noted as being worse at getting servants than other men, and barely gave he wages to any man,
      nor was he thought a good man to deal with. There was a kinsman of his hight Thorbiorn, and
      bynamed Tardy; he was a sailor, and the namesakes were partners. He was ever at Thorodstead,
      and was thought to better Thorbiorn but little. He was a fault-finding fellow, and went about
      jeering at most men. There was a man hight Thorir, the son of Thorkel of <pb n="90"/>
      Boardere. He farmed first at Meals in Ramfirth; his daughter was Helga, whom Sleita-Helgi had
      to wife, but after the man-slaying in Fairslope Thorir set up for himself his abode south in
      Hawkdale, and farmed at the Pass, and sold the land at Meals to Thorhall, son of Gamli the
       Vendlander.<note place="foot">Ed. 1853 has the "Widelanded, Viðlendings," which here is
       altered agreeably to the collection in ch. 14, p. 29.</note> His son was Gamli, who had to
      wife Ranveig, daughter of Asmund the Greyhaired, and Grettir's sister. They dwelt at that time
      at Meals, and had good hap. Thorir of the Pass had two sons, one hight Gunnar, the other
      Thorgeir; they were both hopeful men, and had then taken the farm after their father, yet were
      for ever with Thorbiorn Oxmain, and were growing exceeding unruly.</p>
     <p>The summer after that just told, Kormak and Thorgils and Narfi their kinsman rode south to
      Northriverdale, on some errand of theirs. Odd the Foundlingskald fared also with them, and by
      then was gotten healed of the stiffness he gained at the horse fight. But while they were
      south of the heath, Grettir fared from Biarg, and with him two house-carles of Atli's. They
      rode over to Bowerfell, and thence over the mountain neck to Ramfirth, and came to Meals in
      the evening.</p>
     <p>They were there three nights; Ranveig and Gamli welcomed Grettir well, and bade him abide
      with them, but he had will to ride home.</p>
     <p>Then Grettir heard that Kormak and his fellows were come from the south, and had guested at
      Tongue through the night. Grettir got ready early to leave Meals; Gamli offered him men to go
      with him. Now Grim was the name of Gamli's brother; he was of all men I the swiftest; he rode
      with Grettir with another man; they were five in all. <pb n="91"/> Thus they rode on till they
      came to Ramfirth-neck, west of Bowerfell. There stands a huge stone that is called Grettir's
      heave; for he tried long that day to lift that stone, and thus they delayed till Kormak and
      his fellows were come. Grettir rode to meet them, and both sides jumped off their horses.
      Grettir said it was more like free men now to deal blows of the biggest, than to fight with
      staves like wandering churles. Then Kormak bade them take the challenge in manly wise, and do
      their best. Thereafter they ran at one another and fought. Grettir went before his men, and
      bade them take heed, that none came at his back. Thus they fought a while, and men were
      wounded on both sides.</p>
     <p>Now Thorbiorn Oxmain had ridden that day over the neck to Bowerfell, and when he rode back
      he saw their meeting. There were with him then Thorbiorn the Tardy, and Gunnar and Thorgeir,
      Thorir's sons, and Thorod Drapastump. Now when they came thereto, Thorbiorn called on his men
      to go between them. But the others were by then so eager that they could do nought. Grettir
      broke forth fiercely, and before him were the sons of Thorir, and they both fell as he thrust
      them from him; they waxed exceeding furious thereat, insomuch that Gunnar dealt a death-blow
      at a house-carle of Atli; and when Thorbiorn saw that, he bade them part, saying withal that
      he would aid which side soever should pay heed to his words. By then were fallen two
      house-carles of Kormak, but Grettir saw, that it would hardly do if Thorbiorn should bring aid
      to them against him, wherefore now he gave tip the battle, and all were wounded who had been
      at that meeting. But much it misliked Grettir that they had been parted.</p>
     <p>Thereafter either side rode home, nor did they settle peace after these slayings. Thorbiorn
      the Tardy made <pb n="92"/> much mocking at all this, therefore things began to worsen betwixt
      the men of Biarg and Thorbiorn Oxmain, so that therefrom fell much ill-will as came to be
      known after. No boot was bidden to Atli for his house-carle, but he made as if he knew it not.
      Grettir sat at home at Biarg until Twainmonth.<note place="foot">The second month in the year,
       corresponding to our September.</note> Nor is it said in story that he and Kormak met ever
      again after these things betid.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="31">
     <head>How Grettir met Bardi, the Son of Gudmund, as he came back from the Heath-slayings</head>
     <p>BARDI, the son of Gudmund, and his brothers, rode home to Asbiornsness after their parting
      with Grettir.</p>
     <p>They were the sons of Gudmund, the son of S&#156;mund. The mother of S&#156;mund was
      Thorlaug, the daughter of S&#156;mund, the South-Island man, the foster-brother of Ingimund
      the Old, and Bardi was a very noble man.</p>
     <p>Now soon he rode to find Thorarin the Wise, his foster-father. He welcomed Bardi well, and
      asked what gain he had got of followers and aid, for they had before taken counsel over
      Bardi's journey. Bardi answered that he had got the aid of that man to his fellow, whose aid
      he deemed better than that of any other twain. Thorarin got silent thereat, and then said,</p>
     <p>"That man will be Grettir Asmundson."</p>
     <p>"<hi rend="ital">Sooth is the sage's guess</hi>," said Bardi; "that is the very man,
      foster-father." <pb n="93"/> Thorarin answered, "True it is, that Grettir is much before any
      other man of those who are to choose in our land, and late will he be won with weapons, if he
      be hale, yet it misdoubts me how far he will bring thee luck; but of thy following all must
      not be luckless, and enough ye will do, though he fare not with thee: nowise shall he go if I
      may have my will."</p>
     <p>"This I could not have deemed, foster-father," said he, "that thou wouldst grudge me the aid
      of the bravest of men, if my need should be hard. A man cannot foresee all things when he is
      driven on as methinks I am."</p>
     <p>"Thou wilt do well," said Thorarin; "though thou abidest by my foresight."</p>
     <p>Now thus must things be, even as Thorarin would, that no word more was sent to Grettir, but
      Bardi fared south to Burgfirth, and then befell the Heath-slayings.</p>
     <p>Grettir was at Biarg when he heard that Bardi had ridden south; he started up in anger for
      that no word had been sent to him, and said that not thus should they part. He had news of
      them when they were looked for coming from the south, and thereat he rode down to
      Thorey's-peak, for the waylaying of Bardi's folk as they came back from the south: he fared
      from the homestead up on to the hillside, and abode there. That same day rode Bardi and his
      men north over Twodaysway, from the Heath-slayings; they were six in all, and every man sore
      wounded; and when they came forth by the homestead, then said Bardi--</p>
     <p>"A man there is up on the hill-side; a big man, armed. What man do ye take him to be?"</p>
     <p>They said that they wotted not who he was.</p>
     <p>Bardi said, "Methinks there," quoth he, "is Grettir Asmundson; and if so it is, there will
      he meet us. I deem that it has misliked him that be fared not with us, but methinks <pb n="94"
      /> we are not in good case, if he be bent on doing us harm. I now shall send after men to
      Thoreys-peak, and stake nought on the chance of his ill-will."</p>
     <p>They said this was a good rede, and so was it done.</p>
     <p>Thereafter Bardi and his folk rode on their way. Grettir saw where they fared, and went in
      the way before them, and when they met, either greeted other.</p>
     <p>Grettir asked for tidings, but Bardi told them fearlessly, even as they were. Grettir asked
      what men were in that journey with him. Bardi said that there were his brothers, and Eyulf his
      brother-in-law.</p>
     <p>"Thou hast now cleared thyself from all blame," said Grettir; "but now is it best that we
      try between us who is of most might here."</p>
     <p>Said Bardi, "Too nigh to my garth have deeds of hard need been, than that I should fight
      with thee without a cause, and well methinks have I thrust these from me."</p>
     <p>"Thou growest soft, methinks, Bardi," said Grettir, "since thou durst not fight with
      me."</p>
     <p>"Call that what thou wilt," said Bardi; "but in some other stead would I that thou wreak
      thine high-handedness than here on me; and that is like enough, for now does thy rashness pass
      all bounds."</p>
     <p>Grettir thought ill of his spaedom, and now doubted within himself whether he should set on
      one or other of them; but it seemed rash to him, as they were six and he one: and in that nick
      of time came up the men from Thoreys-peak to the aid of Bardi and his folk; then Grettir drew
      off from them, and turned aside to his horse. But Bardi and his fellows went on their way, nor
      were there farewells between them at parting.</p>
     <p>No further dealings between Bardi and Grettir are told of after these things betid. <pb
       n="95"/> Now so has Grettir said that he deemed himself well matched to fight with most men,
      though they were three together, but he would have no mind to flee before four, without trying
      it; but against more would he fight only if he must needs defend his hand, as is said in this
      stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"My life trust I 'gainst three</l>
      <l>Skilled in Mist's mystery;</l>
      <l>Whatso in Hilda's weather</l>
      <l>Shall bring the swords together;</l>
      <l>If over four they are</l>
      <l>My wayfaring that bar</l>
      <l>No gale of swords will I</l>
      <l>Wake with them willingly."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>After his parting with Bardi, Grettir fared to Biarg, and very ill he it thought that he
      might nowhere try his strength, and searched all about if anywhere might be somewhat wherewith
      he might contend.</p>

     <head>Of the Haunting at Thorhall-stead; and how Thorhall took a Shepherd by the rede of Skapti
      the Lawman, and of what befell thereafter</head>
     <p>THERE was a man hight Thorhall, who dwelt at Thorhall-stead, in Shady-vale, which runs up
      from Waterdale. Thorhall was the son of Grim, son of Thorhall, the son of Fridmund, who
      settled Shady-vale. Thorhall had a wife hight Gudrun. Grim was their son, and Thurid their
      daughter; they were well-nigh grown up. <pb n="96"/> Thorhall was a rich man, but mostly in
      cattle, so that no man had so much of live-stock as he. He was no chief, but an honest bonder
      he was. Much was that place haunted, and hardly could he get a shepherd that he deemed should
      serve his turn. He sought counsel of many men as to what he might do therewith, but none gave
      him a rede that might serve him. Thorhall rode each summer to the Thing, and good horses he
      had. But one summer at the Althing, Thorhall went to the booth of Skapti Thorodson the Lawman.
      Skapti was the wisest of men, and wholesome were his redes when folk prayed him for them. But
      he and his father differed thus much, that Thorod was foretelling, and yet was called
      under-handed of some folk; but Skapti showed forth to every man what he deemed would avail
      most, if it were not departed from, therefore was he called Father-betterer."</p>
     <p>Now Thorhall went into Skapti's booth, and Skapti greeted him well, for he knew that he was
      a man rich in cattle, and he asked him what were the tidings.</p>
     <p>Thorhall answered, "A wholesome counsel would I have from thee."</p>
     <p>"Little am I meet for that," said Skapti; "but what dost thou stand in need of?"</p>
     <p>Thorhall said, "So is the matter grown to be, that but a little while do my shepherds avail
      me; for ever will they get badly hurt; but others will not serve to the end, and now no one
      will take the job when he knows what bides in the way."</p>
     <p>Skapti answered, "Some evil things shall be there then, since men are more unwilling to
      watch thy sheep than those of other men. Now, therefore, as thou hast sought rede of me, I
      shall get thee a shepherd who is hight Glam, a Swede, from Sylgsdale, who came out last
      summer, a big <pb n="97"/> man and a strong, though he is not much to the mind of most
      folk."</p>
     <p>Thorhall said he heeded that little if he watched the sheep well.</p>
     <p>Skapti said that little would be the look out for others, if he could not watch them,
      despite his strength and daring.</p>
     <p>Then Thorhall went out from him, and this was towards the breaking up of the Thing. Thorhall
      missed two dun horses, and fared himself to seek for them; wherefore folk deem that he was no
      great man. He went up to Sledgehill and south along the fell which is called Armansfell; then
      he saw how a man fared down from Godi's-wood, and bore faggots on a horse. Soon they met
      together, and Thorhall asked him of his name. He said that he was called Glam. This man was
      great of growth, uncouth to look on; his eyes were grey and glaring, and his hair was
      wolf-grey.</p>
     <p>Thorhall stared at him somewhat when he saw this man, till he saw that this was he to whom
      he had been sent.</p>
     <p>"What work hast thou best will to do?" said Thorhall.</p>
     <p>Glam said, "That he was of good mind to watch sheep in winter."</p>
     <p>"Wilt thou watch my sheep?" said Thorhall. "Skapti has given thee to my will."</p>
     <p>"So only shall my service avail thee, if I go of my own will, for I am evil of mood if
      matters mislike me," quoth Glam.</p>
     <p>"I fear no hurt thereof," said Thorhall, "and I will that thou fare to my house."</p>
     <p>"That may I do," said Glam, "perchance there are some troubles there?"</p>
     <p>"Folk deem the place haunted," said Thorhall. <pb n="98"/> "Such bugs will not scare me,"
      quoth Glam; "life seems to me less irksome thereby."</p>
     <p>"It must needs seem so," said Thorhall, "and truly it is better that a mannikin be not
      there."</p>
     <p>Thereafter they struck bargain together, and Glam is to come at winter nights: then they
      parted, and Thorhall found his horses even where he had just been searching. Thorhall rode
      home, and thanked Skapti for his good deed.</p>
     <p>Summer slipped away, and Thorhall heard nought of his shepherd, nor did any man know aught
      about him but at the appointed time he came to Thorhall-stead. The bonder greeted him well,
      but none of the other folk could abide him, and the good wife least of all.</p>
     <p>Now he took to the sheep-watching, and little trouble it seemed to give him; he was
      big-voiced and husky, and all the beasts would run together when he whooped. There was a
      church at Thorhall-stead, but nowise would Glam come therein; he was a loather of church-song,
      and godless, foul-tempered, and surly, and no man might abide him.</p>
     <p>Now passed the time till it came to Yule-eve; then Glam got up and straightway called for
      his meat. The good wife said--</p>
     <p>"No Christian man is wont to eat meat this day, because that on the morrow is the first day
      of Yule," says she, "wherefore must men first fast to-day."</p>
     <p>He answers, "Many follies have ye, whereof I see no good come, nor know I that men fare
      better now than when they paid no heed to such things; and methinks the ways of men were
      better when they were called heathens; and now will I have my meat, and none of this
      fooling."</p>
     <p>Then said the housewife, "I know for sure that thou shalt fare ill to day, if thou takest up
      this evil turn." <pb n="99"/> Glam bade her bring food straightway, and said that she should
      fare the worse else. She durst do but as he would, and so when he was full, he went out,
      growling and grumbling.</p>
     <p>Now the weather was such, that mirk was over all, and the snow-flakes drave down, and great
      din there was, and still all grew much the worse, as the day slipped away.</p>
     <p>Men heard the shepherd through the early morning, but less of him as the day wore; then it
      took to snowing, and by evening there was a great storm; then men went to church, and thus
      time drew on to night-fall, and Glam came not home; then folk held talk, as to whether search
      should not be made for him, but, because of the snowstorm and pitch darkness, that came to
      nought.</p>
     <p>Now he came not home on the night of Yule-eve; and thus men abide till after the time of
      worship; but further on in the day men fared out to the search, and found the sheep scattered
      wide about in fens, beaten down by the storm, or strayed up into the mountains. Thereafter
      they came on a great beaten place high up in the valley, and they thought it was as if strong
      wrestling had gone on there; for that all about the stones had been uptorn and the earth
      withal; now they looked closely and saw where Glam lay a little way therefrom; he was dead,
      and as blue as hell, and as great as a neat.</p>
     <p>Huge loathing took them, at the sight of him, and they shuddered in their souls at him, yet
      they strove to bring him to church, but could get him only as far as a certain gil-edge a
      little way below.</p>
     <p>Then they fared home to the farm, and told the bonder what had happed. He asked what was
      like to have been Glam's bane. They said they had tracked steps as great as if a cask-bottom
      had been stamped down, from there <pb n="100"/> where the beaten place was, up to beneath
      sheer rocks which were high up the valley, and there along went great stains of blood. Now men
      drew from this, that the evil wight which had been there before had killed Glam, but had got
      such wounds as had been full enough for him, for of him none has since been ware.</p>
     <p>The second day of Yule men went afresh to try to bring Glam to church; drag horses were put
      to him, but could move him nowhere where they had to go on even ground and not down hill; then
      folk had to go away therefrom leaving things done so far.</p>
     <p>The third day the priest fared with them, and they sought all day, but found not Glam. The
      priest would go no more on such search, but the herdsman was found whenso the priest was not
      in their company. Then they let alone striving to bring him to church, and buried him there
      whereto he had been brought.</p>
     <p>A little time after men were ware that Glam lay not quiet. Folk got great hurt therefrom, so
      that many fell into swoons when they saw him, but others lost their wits thereby. But just
      after Yule men thought they saw him home at the farm. Folk became exceeding afeard thereat,
      and many fled there and then. Next Glam. took to riding the house-roofs at night, so that he
      went nigh to breaking them in. Now he walked well-nigh night and day, Hardly durst men fare up
      into the dale, though they had errands enough there. And much scathe the men of the
      countryside deemed all this.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="33">
     <head>Of the doings of Glam at Thorhall-stead</head>
     <p>IN the spring Thorhall got serving-men, and set up house at his farm; then the hauntings
      began to go off while the sun was at its height; and so things went on to midsummer. That
      summer a ship came out to Hunawater, wherein was a man named Thorgaut. He was an outlander of
      kin, big and stout, and two men's strength he had. He was unhired and single, and would fain
      do some work, for he was moneyless. Now Thorhall rode to the ship, and asked Thorgaut if he
      would work for him. Thorgaut said that might be, and moreover that he was not nice about
      work.</p>
     <p>"Be sure in thy mind," said Thorhall, "that mannikins are of small avail there because of
      the hauntings that have been going on there for one while now; for I will not draw thee on by
      wiles."</p>
     <p>Thorgaut answers, "I deem not myself given up, though I should see some wraithlings; matters
      will not be light when I am scared, nor will I give up my service for that."</p>
     <p>Now they come speedily to a bargain, and Thorgaut is to watch the sheep when winter comes.
      So the summer wore on, and Thorgaut betook himself to the shepherding, at winter nights, and
      all liked him well. But ever came Glam home and rode the house-roofs; this Thorgaut deemed
      sport enough, and quoth he--</p>
     <p>"The thrall must come nigher to scare me."</p>
     <p>Thorhall bade him keep silence over that.</p>
     <pb n="102"/>
     <p>"Better will it be that ye have no trial together."</p>
     <p>Thorgaut said, "Surely all might is shaken out of you, nor shall I drop down betwixt morn
      and eve at such talk."</p>
     <p>Now so things go through the winter till Yule-tide. On Yule-eve the shepherd would fare out
      to his sheep. Then said the good wife--</p>
     <p>"Need is it that things go not the old way."</p>
     <p>He answered, "Have no fear thereof, goodwife; something worth telling of will betide if I
      come not back."</p>
     <p>And thereafter he went to his sheep; and the weather was somewhat cold, and there was much
      snow. Thorgaut was wont to come home when twilight had set in, and now he came not at that
      time. Folk went to church as they were wont. Men now thought things looked not unlike what
      they did before; the bonder would have search made for the shepherd, but the church-goers
      begged off, and said that they would not give themselves into the hands of trolls by night; so
      the bonder durst not go, and the search came to nought.</p>
     <p>Yule-day, when men were full, they fared out and searched for the shepherd; they first went
      to Glam's cairn, because men thought that from his deeds came the loss of the herdsman. But
      when they came nigh to the cairn, there they saw great tidings, for there they found the
      shepherd, and his neck was broken, and every bone in him smashed. Then they brought him to
      church, and no harm came to men from Thorgaut afterwards.</p>
     <p>But Glam began afresh to wax mighty; and such deeds he wrought, that all men fled away from
      Thorhall-stead, except the goodman and his goodwife. Now the same neatherd had long been
      there, and Thorhall would not let him go, because of his good will and safe ward; he was <pb
       n="103"/> well on in years, and was very loth to fare away, for he saw that all things the
      bonder had went to nought from not being watched.</p>
     <p>Now after midwinter one morning the housewife fared to the byre to milk the cows after the
      wonted time; by then was it broad daylight, for none other than the neatherd would trust
      themselves out before day; but he went out at dawn. She heard great cracking in the byre, with
      bellowing and roaring; she ran back crying out,, and said she knew not what uncouth things
      were going on in the byre.</p>
     <p>The bonder went out and came to the cows, which were goring one another; so he thought it
      not good to go in there, but went in to the hay-barn. There he saw where lay the neatherd, and
      had his head in one boose<note place="foot">Boose, a cow-stall.</note> and his feet in the
      other; and he lay cast on his back. The bonder went up to him, and felt him all over with his
      hand, and finds soon that he was dead, and the spine of him broken asunder; it had been broken
      over the raised stone-edge of a boose.</p>
     <p>Now the goodman thought there was no abiding there longer; so he fled away from the farm
      with all that he might take away; but all such live stock as was left behind Glam killed, and
      then he fared all over the valley and destroyed farms up from Tongue. But Thorhall was with
      his friends the rest of the winter.</p>
     <p>No man might fare up the dale with horse or hound,</p>
     <p>because straightway it was Slain. But when spring came, and the sun-light was the greatest,
      somewhat the hauntings abated; and now would Thorhall go back to his own land; he had no easy
      task in getting servants, nathless he set up house again at Thorhall-stead; but all went the
      same way <pb n="104"/> as before; for when autumn came, the hauntings began to wax again; the
      bonder's daughter was most set on, and fared so that she died thereof. Many redes were sought,
      but nought could be done; men thought it like that all Waterdale would be laid waste if nought
      were found to better this.</p>
    </div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="34">
     <head>Grettir hears of the Hauntings</head>
     <p>NOW we take up the story where Grettir Asmundson sat at Biarg through the autumn after they
      parted, he and Slaying-Bardi at Thoreys-peak; and when the time of winter-nights had well-nigh
      come, Grettir rode from home north over the neck to Willowdale, and guested at Audunstead; he
      and Audun made a full peace, and Grettir gave Audun a good axe, and they talked of friendship
      between them. Audun dwelt long at Audunstead, and was a man of many and hopeful kin; his son
      was Egil, who married Ulfheid, daughter of Eyulf Gudmundson, and their son was Eyulf, who was
      slain at the Althing, he was the father of Orm, who was the chaplain of Bishop Thorlak.</p>
     <p>Grettir rode north to Waterdale, and came to see his kin at Tongue. In those days dwelt
      there Jokull, the son of Bard, the mother's brother of Grettir: Jokull was a big man and a
      strong, and the most violent of men; he was a seafaring man, very wild, and yet a man of great
      account.</p>
     <p>He greeted Grettir well, and he was there three nights. There were so many words about
      Glam's hauntings, that nought was so much spoken of as of that. Grettir asked closely about
      all things that had happed. Jokull said that <pb n="105"/> thereof was told no more than the
      very truth; "And, perchance, thou art wishfull to go there, kinsman?"</p>
     <p>Grettir said that so it was.</p>
     <p>Jokull bade him do it not, "Because it is a great risk for thy good luck, and thy kinsmen
      have much to hazard thou art," said he, "for of young men we think there is none such as thou;
      but <hi rend="ital">from ill cometh ill</hi> whereas Glam is; and far better it is to deal
      with men than with such evil wights."</p>
     <p>Grettir said, "That he had a mind to go to Thorhall-stead and see how things went
      there."</p>
     <p>Said Jokull, "Now I see it is of no avail to let thee; but so it is, as men say, <hi
       rend="ital">Good luck and goodliness are twain</hi>."</p>
     <p>"<hi rend="ital">Woe is before one's own door when it is inside one's neighbour's</hi>;
      think how it may fare with thyself ere things are ended," said Grettir.</p>
     <p>Jokull answered, "Maybe we may both see somewhat of things to come, but neither may help
      aught herein."</p>
     <p>They parted thereafter, and neither thought well of the other's foretelling.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="35">
     <head>Grettir goes to Thorhall-stead, and has to do with Glam</head>
     <p>GRETTIR rode to Thorhall-stead, and the bonder gave him good welcome; he asked whither
      Grettir was minded to fare, but Grettir said he would be there that night if the bonder would
      have it so.</p>
     <p>Thorhall said that he thanked him therefor, "But few have thought it a treat to guest here
      for any time; thou must needs have heard what is going on here, and I fain <pb n="106"/> would
      that thou shouldest have no trouble from me: but though thou shouldest come off whole thyself,
      that know I for sure, that thou wilt lose thy horse, for none keeps his horse whole who comes
      here."</p>
     <p>Grettir said that horses were to be had in plenty whatsoever might hap to this. Then
      Thorhall was glad that Grettir was to be there, and gave him a hearty welcome.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir's horse was locked up in a strong house, and they went to sleep; and so the
      night slipped by, and Glam came not home.</p>
     <p>Then said Thorhall, "Things have gone well at thy coming, for every night is Glam wont to
      ride the house-roofs, or break open doors, as thou mayst well see."</p>
     <p>Grettir said, "Then shall one of two things be, either he shall not hold himself back for
      long, or the hauntings will abate for more than one night; I will bide here another night and
      see how things fare."</p>
     <p>Thereafter they went to Grettir's horse, and nought had been tried against it; then all
      seemed to the bonder to go one way.</p>
     <p>Now is Grettir there another night, and neither came the thrall home; that the farmer deemed
      very hopeful; withal he fared to see after Grettir's horse. When the farmer came there, he
      found the house broken into, but the horse was dragged out to the door, and every bone in him
      broken to pieces. Thorhall told Grettir what had happed there, and bade him save himself, "For
      sure is thy death if thou abidest Glam."</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "I must not have less for my horse than a sight of the thrall."</p>
     <p>The bonder said it was no boon to see him, for he was unlike any shape of man; "but good
      methinks is every hour that thou art here." <pb n="107"/> Now the day goes by, and when men
      should go to sleep Grettir would not put off his clothes, but lay down on the seat over
      against the bonder's lock-bed. He had a drugget cloak over him, and wrapped one skirt of it
      under his feet, and twined the other under his head, and looked out through the head-opening;
      a seat-beam was before the seat, a very strong one, and against this he set his feet. The
      door-fittings were all broken from the outer door, but a wrecked door was now bound thereby,
      and all was fitted up in the wretchedest wise. The panelling which had been before the seat
      athwart the hall, was all broken away both above and below the cross-beam; all beds had been
      torn out of place, and an uncouth place it was.</p>
     <p>Light burned in the hall through the night; and when the third part of the night was passed,
      Grettir heard huge din without, and then one went up upon the houses and rode the hall, and
      drave his heels against the thatch so that every rafter cracked again.</p>
     <p>That went on long, and then he came down from the house and went to the door; and as the
      door opened, Grettir saw that the thrall stretched in his head, which seemed to him
      monstrously big, and wondrous thick cut.</p>
     <p>Glam fared slowly when he came into the door and stretched himself high up under the roof,
      and turned looking along the hall, and laid his arms on the tie-beam, and glared inwards over
      the place. The farmer would not let himself be heard, for he deemed he had had enough, in
      hearing himself what had gone on outside. Grettir lay quiet, and moved no whit; then Glam saw
      that some bundle lay on the seat, and therewith he stalked up the hall and griped at the
      wrapper wondrous hard, but Grettir set his foot against the beam, and moved in no wise; Glam
      pulled again much harder, but still the wrapper <pb n="108"/> moved not at all; the third time
      he pulled with both hands so hard, that he drew Grettir upright from the seat; and now they
      tore the wrapper asunder between them.</p>
     <p>Glam gazed at the rag he held in his hand, and wondered much who might pull so hard against
      him; and therewithal Grettir ran under his hands and gripped him round the middle, and bent
      back his spine as hard as he might, and his mind it was that Glam should shrink thereat; but
      the thrall lay so hard on Grettir's arms, that he shrank all aback because of Glam's
      strength.</p>
     <p>Then Grettir bore back before him into sundry seats; but the seat-beams were driven out of
      place, and all was broken that was before them. Glam was fain to get out, but Grettir set his
      feet against all things that he might; nathless Glam got him dragged from out the hall; there
      had they a wondrous hard wrestling, because the thrall had a mind to bring him out of the
      house but Grettir saw that ill as it was to deal with Glam within doors, yet worse would it be
      without; therefore he struggled with all his might and main against going out-a-doors.</p>
     <p>Now Glam gathered up his strength and knit Grettir towards him when they came to the outer
      door; but when Grettir saw that he might not set his feet against that, all of a sudden in one
      rush he drave his hardest against the thrall's breast, and spurned both feet against the
      half-sunken stone that stood in the threshold of the door; for this the thrall was not ready,
      for he had been tugging to draw Grettir to him, therefore he reeled aback and spun out against
      the door, so that his shoulders caught the upper door-case, and the roof burst asunder, both
      rafters and frozen thatch, and therewith he fell open-armed aback out of the house, and.
      Grettir over him.</p>
     <p>Bright moonlight was there without, and the drift was <pb n="109"/> broken, now drawn over
      the moon, now driven from off her; and, even as Glam fell, a cloud was driven from the moon,
      and Glam glared up against her. And Grettir himself says that by that sight only was he
      dismayed amidst all that he ever saw.</p>
     <p>Then his soul sank within him so, from all these things, both from weariness, and because he
      had seen Glam turn his eyes so horribly, that he might not draw the short-sword, and lay
      well-nigh 'twixt home and hell.</p>
     <p>But herein was there more fiendish craft in Glam than in most other ghosts, that he spake
      now in this wise--</p>
     <p>"Exceeding eagerly hast thou wrought to meet me, Grettir, but no wonder will it be deemed,
      though thou gettest no good hap of me; and this must I tell thee, that thou now hast got half
      the strength and manhood, which was thy lot if thou hadst not met me: now I may not take from
      thee the strength which thou hast got before this; but that may I rule, that thou shalt never
      be mightier than now thou art; and nathless art thou mighty enow, and that shall many an one
      learn. Hitherto hast thou earned fame by thy deeds, but henceforth will wrongs and manslayings
      fall on thee, and the most part of thy doings will turn to thy woe and ill-hap; an outlaw
      shalt thou be made, and ever shall it be thy lot to dwell alone abroad; therefore this weird I
      lay on thee, ever in those days to see these eyes with thine eyes, and thou wilt find it hard
      to be alone--and that shall drag thee unto death."</p>
     <p>Now when the thrall had thus said, the astonishment fell from Grettir that had lain on him,
      and therewith he drew the short-sword and hewed the head from Glam, and laid it at his
      thigh.</p>
     <p>Then came the farmer out; he had clad himself while Glam had his spell going, but he durst
      come nowhere nigh till Glam had fallen. <pb n="110"/> Thorhall praised God therefor, and
      thanked Grettir well for that he had won this unclean spirit. Then they set to work and burned
      Glam to cold coals, thereafter they gathered his ashes into the skin of a beast, and dug it
      down whereas sheep-pastures were fewest, or the ways of men. They walked home thereafter, and
      by then it had got far on towards day; Grettir laid him down, for he was very stiff: but
      Thorhall sent to the nearest farm for men, and both showed them and told them how all things
      had fared.</p>
     <p>All men who heard thereof deemed this a deed of great worth, and in those days it was said
      by all that none in all the land was like to Grettir Asmundson for great heart and
      prowess.</p>
     <p>Thorhall saw off Grettir handsomely, and gave him a good horse and seemly clothes, for those
      were all torn to pieces that he had worn before; so they parted in friendly wise. Grettir rode
      thence to the Ridge in Waterdale, and Thorvald received him well, and asked closely about the
      struggle with Glam. Grettir told him all, and said thereto that he had never had such a trial
      of strength, so long was their struggle.</p>
     <p>Thorvald bade him keep quiet, "Then all will go well with thee, else wilt thou be a man of
      many troubles."</p>
     <p>Grettir said that his temper had been nowise bettered by this, that he was worse to quiet
      than before, and that he deemed all trouble worse than it was; but that herein be found the
      greatest change, in that he was become so fearsome a man in the dark, that he durst go
      nowhither alone after nightfall, for then he seemed to see all kinds of horrors.</p>
     <p>And that has fallen since into a proverb, that Glam lends eyes, or gives Glamsight to those
      who see things nowise as they are. <pb n="111"/> But Grettir rode home to Biarg when he had
      done his errands, and sat at home through the winter.</p>

     <head>Of Thorbiorn Oxmain's Autumn-feast, and the mocks of Thorbiorn Tardy</head>
     <p>THORBIORN Oxmain held a great autumn feast, and many men came thither to him, and that was
      while Grettir fared north to Waterdale in the autumn; Thorbiorn the Tardy was there at the
      feast, and many things were spoken of there. There the Ramfirthers asked of those dealings of
      Grettir on the neck the summer before.</p>
     <p>Thorbiorn Oxmain told the story right fairly as towards Grettir, and said that Kormak would
      have got the worst of it, if none had come there to part them.</p>
     <p>Then spake Thorbiorn the Tardy, "Both these things are true," said he: "I saw Grettir win no
      great honour, and I deem withal that fear shot through his heart when we came thereto, and
      right blithe was he to part, nor did I see him seek for vengeance when Atli's house-carle was
      slain, therefore do I deem that there is no heart in him if he is not holpen enow."</p>
     <p>And thereat Thorbiorn went on gabbling at his most; but many put in a word, and said that
      this was worthless fooling, and that Grettir would not leave things thus, if he heard that
      talk.</p>
     <p>Nought else befell worth telling of at the feast, and men went home; but much ill-will there
      was betwixt them that winter, though neither set on other; nor were there other tidings
      through the winter.</p>

     <head>Olaf the Saint, King in Norway; the slaying of Thorbiorn Tardy; Grettir goes to
      Norway</head>
     <p>EARLY the spring after came out a ship from Norway; and that was before the Thing; these
      folk knew many things to tell, and first that there was change of rulers in Norway, for Olaf
      Haraldson was come to be king, and Earl Svein had fled the country in the spring after the
      fight at Ness. Many noteworthy matters were told of King Olaf, and this withal, that he
      received such men in the best of ways who were of prowess in any deeds, and that he made such
      his men.</p>
     <p>Thereat were many young men glad, and listed to go abroad, and when Grettir heard the
      tidings he became much minded to sail out; for he, like others, hoped for honour at the king's
      hands.</p>
     <p>A ship lay in Goose-ere in Eyjafirth, therein Grettir got him a berth and made ready for the
      voyage, nor had he yet much of faring-goods.</p>
     <p>Now Asmund was growing very feeble with eld, and was well-nigh bedridden; he and Asdis had a
      young son who was called Illugi, and was the hopefullest of men; and, by this time, Atli
      tended all farming and money-keeping, and this was deemed to better matters, because he was a
      peaceable and foreseeing man.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir went shipward, but in that same ship had Thorbiorn the Tardy taken passage,
      before folk knew that Grettir would sail therein. Now men would hinder Thorbiorn from sailing
      in the same ship with Grettir, but <pb n="113"/> Thorbiorn said that he would go for all that.
      He gat him ready for the voyage out, and was somewhat late thereat, nor did he come to the
      north to Goose-ere before the ship was ready for sea; and before Thorbiorn fared from the
      west, Asmund the Greyhaired fell sick and was bedridden.</p>
     <p>Now Thorbiorn the Tardy came late one day down to the sand; men were getting ready to go to
      table, and were washing their hands outside the booths; but when Thorbiorn rode up the lane
      betwixt the booths, he was greeted, and asked for tidings. He made as if there was nought to
      tell, "Save that I deem that Asmund, the champion of Biarg, is now dead."</p>
     <p>Many men said that there where he went, departed a worthy good-man from the world.</p>
     <p>"But what brought it about?" said they.</p>
     <p>He answered, "Little went to the death of that champion, for in the chamber smoke was he
      smothered like a dog; nor is there loss therein, for he was grown a dotard."</p>
     <p>"Thou speakest marvellously of such a man," said they, "nor would Grettir like thy words
      well, if he heard them."</p>
     <p>"That must I bear," said Thorbiorn, "and higher must Grettir bear the sword than he did last
      summer at Ramfirth-neck, if I am to tremble at him."</p>
     <p>Now Grettir heard full well what Thorbiorn said, and paid no heed thereto while he let his
      tale run on; but when he had made an end, then spake Grettir--</p>
     <p>"That fate I foretell for thee, Tardy," said he, "that thou wilt not die in chamber smoke,
      yet may be withal thou wilt not die of eld; but it is strangely done to speak scorn of
      sackless men."</p>
     <p>Thorbiorn said, "I have no will to hold in about these things, and methinks thou didst not
      bear thyself so briskly <pb n="114"/> when we got thee off that time when the men of Meals
      beat thee like a neat's head."</p>
     <p>Then sang Grettir--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>Day by day full over long,</l>
      <l>Arrow-dealer, grows thy tongue;</l>
      <l>Such a man there is, that thou</l>
      <l>Mayst be paid for all words now;</l>
      <l>Many a man, who has been fain,</l>
      <l>Wound-worm's tower with hands to gain,</l>
      <l>With less deeds his death has bought,</l>
      <l>Than thou, Tardy-one, hast wrought."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Said Thorbiorn, "About as feigh do I deem myself as before, despite thy squealing."</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "Heretofore my spaedom has not been long-lived, and so shall things go
      still; now beware if thou wilt, hereafter will no out-look be left."</p>
     <p>Therewith Grettir hewed at Thorbiorn, but he swung up his hand, with the mind to ward the
      stroke from him, but that stroke came on his arm about the wrist, and withal the short-sword
      drave into his neck so that the head was smitten off.</p>
     <p>Then said the chapmen that he was a man of mighty strokes, and that such should king's men
      be; and no scathe they deemed it though Thorbiorn were slain, in that he had been both
      quarrelsome and spiteful.</p>
     <p>A little after they sailed into the sea, and came in late summer to Norway, south at
      Hordaland, and then they heard that King Olaf was north at Drontheim; then Grettir took ship
      in a trading keel to go north therefrom, because he would fain see the king.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="38">
     <head>Of Thorir of Garth and his sons; and how Grettir fetched fire for his shipmates</head>
     <p>THERE was a man named Thorir, who lived at Garth, in Maindale, he was the son of Skeggi, the
      son of Botulf. Skeggi had settled Well-wharf up to Well-ness; he had to wife Helga, daughter
      of Thorkel, of Fish-brook; Thorir, his son, was a great chief, and a sea-faring man. He had
      two sons, one called Thorgeir and one Skeggi, they were both hopeful men, and fully grown in
      those days. Thorir had been in Norway that summer, when King Olaf came east from England, and
      got into great friendship with the king, and with Bishop Sigurd as well; and this is a token
      thereof, that Thorir had had a large ship built in the wood, and prayed Bishop Sigurd to
      hallow it, and so he did. Thereafter Thorir fared out to Iceland and caused the ship to be
      broken up, when he grew weary of sailing, but the beaks of the ship, he had set up over his
      outer door, and they were there long afterwards, and were so full of weather wisdom, that the
      one whistled before a south wind, and the other before a north wind.</p>
     <p>But when Thorir knew that King Olaf had got the sole rule over all Norway, he deemed that he
      had some friendship there to fall back on; then he sent his sons to Norway to meet the king,
      and was minded that they should be his men. They came there south, late in autumn, and got to
      themselves a row-barge, and fared north along the land, with the mind to go and meet the
      king.</p>
     <p>They came to a haven south of Stead, and lay there <pb n="116"/> some nights, and kept
      themselves in good case as to meat and drink, and were not much abroad when the weather was
      foul.</p>
     <p>Now it is to be told that Grettir and his fellows fared north along the land, and often had
      hard weather, because it was then the beginning of winter; and when they bore down north on
      Stead, they had much foul weather, with snow and frost, and with exceeding trouble they make
      land one evening all much worn with wet; so they lay to by a certain dyke, and could thus save
      their money and goods; the chapmen were bard put to it for the cold, because they could not
      light any fire, though thereon they deemed well. nigh their life and health lay.</p>
     <p>Thus they lay that evening in evil plight; but as the night wore on they saw that a great
      fire sprang up in the midst of the sound over against there whereas they had come. But when
      Grettir's shipmates saw the fire, they said one to the other that be would be a happy man who
      might get it, and they doubted whether they should unmoor the ship, but to all of them there
      seemed danger in that. Then they had a long talk over it, whether any man was of might enow to
      fetch that fire.</p>
     <p>Grettir gave little heed thereto, but said, that such men had been as would not have feared
      the task. The chapmen said that they were not bettered by what had been, if now there was
      nought to take to.</p>
     <p>"Perchance thou deemest thyself man enough thereto, Grettir," said they, "since thou art
      called the man of most prowess among the men of Iceland, and thou wottest well enough what our
      need is."</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "It seems to me no great deed to fetch the fire, but I wot not if ye will
      reward it according to the prayer of him who does it." <pb n="117"/> They said, "Why deemest
      thou us such shameful men as that we should reward that deed but with good?"</p>
     <p>Quoth he, "I may try this if so be that ye think much lies on it, but my mind bids me hope
      to get nought of good thereby."</p>
     <p>They said that that should never be, and bade all hail to his words; and thereafter Grettir
      made ready for swimming, and cast his clothes from off him; of clothes he had on but a cape
      and sail-cloth breeches; he girt up the cape and tied a bast-rope strongly round his middle,
      and had with him a cask; then he leaped overboard; he stretched across the sound, and got
      a-land.</p>
     <p>There he saw a house stand, and heard therefrom the talk of men, and much clatter, and
      therewith he turned toward that house.</p>
     <p>Now is it to be said of those that were there before. that here were come the sons of
      Thorir, as is aforesaid; they had lain there many nights, and bided there the falling of the
      gale, that they might have wind at will to go north, beyond Stead. They had set them down
      a-drinking, and were twelve men in all; their ship rode in the main haven, and they were at a
      house of refuge for such men to guest in, as went along the coast.</p>
     <p>Much straw had been borne into the house, and there was a great fire on the floor; Grettir
      burst into the house, and wotted not who was there before; his cape was all over ice when he
      came a-land, and he himself was wondrous great to behold, even as a troll; now those first
      comers were exceeding amazed at him, and deemed he must be some evil wight; they smote at him
      with all things they might lay hold of, and mighty din went on around them, but Grettir put
      off all blows strongly with his arms, then some smote him with fire-brands, and the fire burst
      off over <pb n="118"/> all the house, and therewith he got off with the fire and fared back
      again to his fellows.</p>
     <p>They mightily praised his journey and the prowess of it, and said that his like would never
      be. And now the night wore, and they deemed themselves happy in that they had got the
      fire.</p>
     <p>The next morning the weather was fair; the chapmen woke early and got them ready to depart,
      and they talked together that now they should meet those who had had the rule of that fire,
      and wot who they were.</p>
     <p>Now they unmoored their ship, and crossed over the sound; there they found no hall, but saw
      a great heap of ashes, and found therein many bones of men; then they deemed that this house
      of refuge had been utterly burned up, with all those men who had been therein.</p>
     <p>Thereat they asked if Grettir had brought about that ill-hap, and said that it was the
      greatest misdeed.</p>
     <p>Grettir said, that now had come to pass even as he had misdoubted, that they should reward
      him ill for the fetching of the fire, and that it was ill to help unmanly men.</p>
     <p>Grettir got such hurt of this, that the chapmen said, wheresoever they came, that Grettir
      had burned those men. The news soon got abroad that in that house were lost the aforenamed
      sons of Thorir of Garth, and their fellows; then they drave Grettir from their ship and would
      not have him with them; and now be became so ill looked on that scarce any one would do good
      to him.</p>
     <p>Now he deemed that matters were utterly hopeless, but before all things would go to meet the
      king, and so made north to Drontheim. The king was there before him, and knew all or ever
      Grettir came there, who had been much slandered to the king. And Grettir was some days in the
      town before he could get to meet the king.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="39">
     <head>How Grettir would fain bear Iron before the King</head>
     <p>NOW on a day when the king sat in council, Grettir went before the king and greeted him
      well. The king looked at him and said, "Art thou Grettir the Strong?"</p>
     <p>He answered, "So have I been called, and for that cause am I come to thee, that I hope from
      thee deliverance from the evil tale that is laid on me, though I deem that I nowise wrought
      that deed."</p>
     <p>King Olaf said, "Thou art great enough, but I know not what luck thou mayest bear about to
      cast off this matter from thee; but it is like, indeed, that thou didst not willingly burn the
      men."</p>
     <p>Grettir said he was fain to put from him this slander, if the king thought he might do so;
      the king bade him tell truthfully, how it had gone betwixt him and those men: Grettir told him
      all, even as has been said before, and this withal, that they were all alive when he came out
      with the fire--</p>
     <p>"I And now I will offer to free myself in such wise as ye may deem will stand good in law
      therefor."</p>
     <p>Olaf the king said, "We will grant thee to bear iron for this matter if thy luck will have
      it so."</p>
     <p>Grettir liked this exceeding well; and now took to fasting for the iron; and so the time
      wore on till the day came whereas the trial should come off; then went the king to <pb n="120"
      /> the church, and the bishop and much folk, for many were eager to have a sight of Grettir,
      so much as had been told of him.</p>
     <p>Then was Grettir led to the church, and when he came thither, many of those who were there
      before gazed at him and said one to the other, that he was little like to most folk, because
      of his strength and greatness of growth.</p>
     <p>Now, as Grettir went up the church-floor, there started up a lad of ripe growth, wondrous
      wild of look, and he said to Grettir--</p>
     <p>"Marvellous is now the custom in this land, as men are called Christians therein, that
      ill-doers, and folk riotous, and thieves shall go their ways in peace and become free by
      trials; yea, and what would the evil man do but save his life while he might? So here now is a
      misdoer, proven clearly a man of misdeeds, and has burnt sackless men withal, and yet shall
      he, too, have a trial to free him; ah, a mighty ill custom!"</p>
     <p>Therewith he went up to Grettir and pointed finger, and wagged head at him, and called him
      mermaid's son, and many other ill names.</p>
     <p>Grettir grew wroth beyond measure hereat, and could not keep himself in; he lifted up his
      fist, and smote the lad under the ear, so that forthwith he fell down stunned, but some say
      that he was slain there and then. None seemed to know whence that lad came or what became of
      him, but men are mostly minded to think, that it was some unclean spirit, sent thither for
      Grettir's hurt.</p>
     <p>Now a great clamour rose in the church, and it was told the king, "He who should bear the
      iron is smiting all about him;" then King Olaf went down the church, and saw what was going
      on, and spake--</p>
     <p>"A most unlucky man art thou," said he, "that now the <pb n="121"/> trial should not be, as
      ready as all things were thereto, nor will it be easy to deal with thine ill-luck."</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "I was minded that I should have gained more honour from thee, Lord, for
      the sake of my kin, than now seems like to be;" and he told withal how en were faring to King
      Olaf, as was said afore, "and now I am fain," said he, "that thou wouldest take me to thee;
      thou hast here many men with thee, who will not be deemed more like men-at-arms than I?"</p>
     <p>"That see I well," said the king, "that few men are like unto thee for strength and
      stoutness of heart, but thou art far too luckless a man to abide with us: now shalt thou go in
      peace for me, wheresoever thou wilt, the winter long, but next summer go thou out to Iceland,
      for there will it be thy fate to leave thy bones."</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "First would I put from me this affair of the burning, if I might, for I
      did not the deed willingly."</p>
     <p>"It is most like," said the king; "but yet, because the trial is now come to nought for thy
      heedlessness' sake, thou wilt not get this charge cast from thee more than now it is, <hi
       rend="ital">For ill-heed still to ill doth lead</hi>, and if ever man has been cursed, of all
      men must thou have been."</p>
     <p>So Grettir dwelt a while in the town thereafter, but dealt no more with the king than has
      been told.</p>
     <p>Then he fared into the south country, and was minded east for Tunsberg, to find Thorstein
      Dromond, his brother, and there is nought told of his travels till he came east to Jadar.</p>

    <pb n="122"/>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="40">
     <head>Of Grettir and Snækoll</head>
     <p>AT Yule came Grettir to a bonder who was called Einar, he was a rich man, and was married
      and had one daughter of marriageable age, who was called Gyrid; she was a fair woman, and was
      deemed a right good match; Einar bade Grettir abide with him through Yule, and that proffer he
      took.</p>
     <p>Then was it the wont far and wide in Norway that woodmen and misdoers would break out of the
      woods and challenge men for their women, or they took away men's goods with violence, whereas
      they had not much help of men.</p>
     <p>Now it so befell here, that one day in Yule there came to Einar the bonder many ill-doers
      together, and he was called Snækoll who was the head of them, and a great bearserk he was. He
      challenged goodman Einar to give up his daughter, or to defend her, if he thought himself man
      enough thereto; but the bonder was then past his youth, and was no man for fighting; he deemed
      he had a great trouble on his hands, and asked Grettir, in a whisper, what rede he would give
      thereto: "Since thou art called a famous man." Grettir bade him say yea to those things alone,
      which he thought of no shame to him.</p>
     <p>The bearserk sat on his horse, and had a helm on his head, but the cheek-pieces were not
      made fast; he had an iron-rimmed shield before him, and went on in the most monstrous
      wise.</p>
     <p>Now he said to the bonder, "Make one or other choice <pb n="123"/> speedily, or what counsel
      is that big churl giving thee who stands there before thee, is it not so that he will play
      with me?"</p>
     <p>Grettir said, "We are about equal herein, the bonder and I, for neither of us is skilled in
      arms."</p>
     <p>Snækoll said, "Ye will both of you be somewhat afraid to deal with me, if I grow wroth."</p>
     <p>"That is known when it is tried," said Grettir.</p>
     <p>Now the bearserk saw that there was some edging out of the matter going on, and he began to
      roar aloud, and bit the rim of his shield, and thrust it up into his mouth, and gaped over the
      corner of the shield, and went on very madly. Grettir took a sweep along over the field, and
      when he came alongside of the bearserk's horse, sent up his foot under the tail of the shield
      so hard, that the shield went up into the mouth of him, and his throat was riven asunder, and
      his jaws fell down on his breast. Then he wrought so that, all in one rush, he caught hold of
      the helmet with his left hand, and swept the viking off his horse; and with the other hand
      drew the short-sword that he was girt withal, and drave it at his neck, so that off the head
      flew. But when Snækoll's fellows saw that, they fled, each his own way, and Grettir had no
      mind to follow, for he saw there was no heart in them.</p>
     <p>The bonder thanked him well for his work and many other men too; and that deed was deemed to
      have been wrought both swiftly and hardily.</p>
     <p>Grettir was there through Yule, and the farmer saw him off handsomely: then he went east to
      Tunsberg, and met his brother Thorstein; he received Grettir fondly, and asked of his travels
      and how he won the bearserk. Then Grettir sang a stave--</p>
     <pb n="124"/>


     <lg>
      <l>"There the shield that men doth save</l>
      <l>Mighty spurn with foot I gave.</l>
      <l>Snækoll's throat it smote aright,</l>
      <l>The fierce follower of the fight,</l>
      <l>And by mighty dint of it</l>
      <l>Were the tofts of tooth-hedge split;</l>
      <l>The strong spear-walk's iron rim,</l>
      <l>Tore a-down the jaws of him."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Thorstein said, "Deft wouldst thou be at many things, kinsman, if mishaps went not
      therewith."</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "<hi rend="ital">Deeds done will be told of</hi>."</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="41">
     <head>Of Thorstein Dromond's Arms, and what he deemed they might do</head>
     <p>NOW Grettir was with Thorstein for the rest of the winter and on into the spring; and it
      befell one morning, as those brothers, Thorstein and Grettir, lay in their sleeping-loft, that
      Grettir had laid his arms outside the bedclothes; and Thorstein was awake and saw it. Now
      Grettir woke up a little after, and then spake Thorstein:</p>
     <p>"I have seen thine arms, kinsman," said he, "and I deem it nowise wonderful, though thy
      strokes fall heavy on many, for no man's arms have I seen like thine."</p>
     <p>"Thou mayst know well enough," said Grettir, "that I should not have brought such things to
      pass as I have wrought, if I were not well knit."</p>
     <p>"Better should I deem it," said Thorstein, "if they were slenderer and somewhat luckier
      withal." <pb n="125"/> Grettir said, "True it is, as folk say, <hi rend="ital">No man makes
       himself</hi>; but let me see thine arms," said he.</p>
     <p>Thorstein did so; he was the longest and gauntest of men; and Grettir laughed, and said,</p>
     <p>"No need to look at that longer; hooked together are the ribs in thee; nor, methinks, have I
      ever seen such tongs as thou bearest about, and I deem thee to be scarce of a woman's
      strength."</p>
     <p>"That may be," said Thorstein; "yet shalt thou know that these same thin arms shall avenge
      thee, else shalt thou never be avenged; who may know what shall be, when all is over and
      done?"</p>
     <p>No more is told of their talk together; the spring wore on, and Grettir took ship in the
      summer. The brothers parted in friendship, and saw each other never after.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="42">
     <head>Of the Death of Asmund the Greyhaired</head>
     <p>NOW must the tale be taken up where it was left before, for Thorbiorn Oxmain heard how
      Thorbiorn Tardy was slain, as aforesaid, and broke out into great wrath, and said it would
      please him well that <hi rend="ital">now this and now that should have strokes in his
       garth</hi>.</p>
     <p>Asmund the Greyhaired lay long sick that summer, and when he thought his ailings drew closer
      on him, he called to him his kin, and said that it was his will, that Atli should have charge
      of all his goods after his day.</p>
     <p>"But my mind misgives me," said Asmund, "that thou mayst scarce sit quiet because of the
      iniquity of men, and I would that all ye of my kin should help him to the uttermost, <pb
       n="126"/> but of Grettir nought can I say, for methinks overmuch on a whirling wheel his life
      turns; and though he be a mighty man, yet I fear me that he will have to heed his own troubles
      more than the helping of his kin: but Illugi, though he be young, yet shall he become a man of
      prowess, if he keep himself whole."</p>
     <p>So, when Asmund had settled matters about his sons as be would, his sickness lay hard on
      him, and in a little while he died, and was laid in earth at Biarg; for there had he let make
      a church; but his death his neighbours deemed a great loss.</p>
     <p>Now Atli became a mighty bonder, and had many with him, and was a great gatherer of
      household-stuff. When the summer was far gone, he went out to Snowfellness to get him
      stockfish. He drave many horses, and rode from home to Meals in Ramfirth to Gamli his
      brother-in-law; and on this journey rode with him Grim Thorhallson, Gamli's brother, and
      another man withal. They rode west to Hawkdale Pass, and so on, as the road lay west to Ness:
      there they bought much stockfish, and loaded seven horses therewith, and turned homeward when
      they were ready.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="43">
     <head>The Onset on Atli at the Pass and the Slaying of Gunnar and Thorgeir</head>
     <p>THORBIORN Oxmain heard that Atli and Grim were on a journey from home, and there were with
      him the sons of Thorir from the Pass, Gunnar and Thorgeir. Now Thorbiorn envied Atli for his
      many friendships, and therefore he egged on the two brothers, the sons of Thorir, to waylay
      Atli as he came back from the outer ness. Then they rode <pb n="127"/> home to the Pass, and
      abode there till Atli and his fellows went by with their train; but when they came as. far as
      the homestead at the Pass, their riding was seen, and those brothers brake out swiftly with
      their house-carles and rode after them; but when Atli and his folk saw their faring, Atli bade
      them take the loads from the horses, "for perchance they will give me atonement for my
      house-carle, whom Gunnar slew last summer. Let us not begin the work, but defend ourselves if
      they be first to raise strife with us."</p>
     <p>Now the brothers came up and leaped off their horses. Atli welcomed them, and asked for
      tidings: "Perchance, Gunnar, thou wilt give me some atonement for my house-carle."</p>
     <p>Gunnar answered, "Something else is your due, men of Biarg, than that I should lay down
      aught good therefor; yea, atonement is due withal for the slaying of Thorbiorn, whom Grettir
      slew."</p>
     <p>"It is not for me to answer thereto," said Atli; "nor art thou a suitor in that case."</p>
     <p>Gunnar said he would stand in that stead none-the-less. "Come, let us set on them, and make
      much of it, at Grettir is not nigh them now."</p>
     <p>Then they ran at Atli, eight of them altogether, but Atli and his folk were six.</p>
     <p>Atli went before his men, and drew the sword, Jokul's gift, which Grettir had given him.</p>
     <p>Then said Thorgeir, "Many like ways have those who deem themselves good; high aloft did
      Grettir bear his short-sword last summer on the Ramfirth-neck."</p>
     <p>Atli answered, "Yea, he is more wont to deal in great deeds than I."</p>
     <p>Thereafter they fought; Gunnar set on Atli exceeding <pb n="128"/> fiercely, and was of the
      maddest; and when they had fought awhile, Atli said,</p>
     <p>"No fame there is in thus killing workmen each for the other; more seeming it is that we
      ourselves play together, for never have I fought with weapons till now."</p>
     <p>Gunnar would not have it so, but Atli bade his house-carles look to the burdens; "But I will
      see what these will do herein."</p>
     <p>Then he went forward so mightily that Gunnar and his folk shrunk back before him, and he
      slew two of the men of those brothers, and thereafter turned to meet Gunnar, and smote at him,
      so that the shield was cleft asunder almost below the handle, and the stroke fell on his leg
      below the knee, and then he smote at him again, and that was his bane.</p>
     <p>Now is it to be told of Grim Thorhallson that he went against Thorgeir, and they strove
      together long, for each was a hardy man. Thorgeir saw the fall of his brother Gunnar, and was
      fain to draw off. Grim ran after him, and followed him till Thorgeir stumbled, and fell face
      foremost; then Grim smote at him with an axe betwixt the shoulders, so that it stood deep
      sunken therein.</p>
     <p>Then they gave peace to three of their followers who were left; and thereafter they bound up
      their wounds, and laid the burdens on the horses, and then fared home, and made these
      man-slayings known.</p>
     <p>Atli sat at home with many men through the winter. Thorbiorn Oxmain took these doings
      exceedingly ill, but could do nought therein because Atli was a man well befriended. Grim was
      with him through the winter, and Gamli, his brother-in-law; and there was Glum, son of Uspak,
      another kinsman-in-law of his, who at that time dwelt at Ere in Bitra. They had many men
      dwelling at Biarg, and great mirth was thereat through the winter.</p>

     <head>The Suit for the Slaying of the Sons of Thorir of the Pass</head>
     <p>THORBIORN Oxmain took on himself the suit for the slaying of the sons of Thorir of the Pass.
      He made ready a suit against Grim and Atli, but they set forth for their defence onset and
      attack, to make those brothers fall unatoned. The suit was brought to the Hunawater Thing, and
      men came thronging to both sides. Atli had good help because he was exceeding strong of
      kin.</p>
     <p>Now the friends of both stood forth and talked of peace, and all said that Atli's ways were
      good, a peaceful man, but stout in danger none-the-less.</p>
     <p>Now Thorbiorn deemed that by nought would his honour be served better than by taking the
      peace offered. Atli laid down before-hand that he would have neither district outlawry nor
      banishment.</p>
     <p>Then were men chosen for the judges. Thorvald, son of Asgeir, on Atli's side, and on
      Thorbiorn's, Solvi the Proud, who was the son of Asbrand, the son of Thorbrand, the son of
      Harald Ring, who had settled all Waterness from the Foreland up to Bond-maids River on the
      west, but on the east all up to Cross-river, and there right across to Berg-ridge, and all on
      that side of the Bergs down to the sea: this Solvi was a man of great stateliness and a wise
      man, therefore Thorbiorn chose him to be judge on his behoof.</p>
     <p>Now they set forth their judgment, that half-fines should be paid for the sons of Thorir,
      but half fell away because of the onslaught and attack, and attempt on Atli's life, the <pb
       n="130"/> slaying of Atli's house-carle, who was slain on Ramfirth-neck, and the slaying of
      those twain who fell with the sons of Thorir were set off one against the other. Grim
      Thorhallson should leave dwelling in the district, but Atli alone should pay the money
      atonement.</p>
     <p>This peace pleased Atli much, but Thorbiorn misliked it, but they parted appeased, as far as
      words went; howsoever it fell from Thorbiorn that their dealings would not be made an end of
      yet, if things went as he would.</p>
     <p>But Atli rode home from the Thing, and thanked Thorvald well for his aid. Grim Thorhallson
      went south to Burgfirth, and dwelt at Gilsbank, and was a great bonder.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="45">
     <head>Of the Slaying of Atli Asmundson</head>
     <p>THERE was a man with Thorbiorn Oxmain who was called Ali; he was a house-carle, a somewhat
      lazy and unruly man.</p>
     <p>Thorbiorn bade him work better, or he would beat him. All said he had no list thereto, and
      was beyond measure worrying. Thorbiorn would not abide it, and drave him under him, and
      handled him hardly. Then Ali went off from his service, and fared over the Neck to Midfirth,
      and made no stay till he came to Biarg. Atli was at home, and asked whither he went. He said
      that he sought service.</p>
     <p>"Art thou not Thorbiorn's workman?" said Atli.</p>
     <p>"That did not go off so pleasantly," said Ali; "I was not there long, and evil I deemed it
      while I was there, and <pb n="131"/> we parted, so that I deemed his song about my throat
      nowise sweet; and I will go to dwell there no more, whatso else may hap to me; and true it is
      that much unlike ye are in the luck ye have with servants, and now I would fain work with thee
      if I might have the choice."</p>
     <p>Atli answered, "Enough I have of workmen, though I reach not out to Thorbiorn's hands for
      such men as he has hired, and methinks there is no gain in thee, so go back to him."</p>
     <p>Ali said, "Thither I go not of my own free-will."</p>
     <p>And now he dwells there awhile; but one Morning he went out to work with Atli's
      house-carles, and worked so that his hands were everywhere, and thus he went on till far into
      summer. Atli said nought to him, but bade give him meat, for he liked his working well,</p>
     <p>Now Thorbiorn hears that Ali is at Biarg; then he rode to Biarg with two men, and called out
      Atli to talk with him, Atli went out and welcomed him.</p>
     <p>Thorbiorn said, "Still wilt thou take up afresh ill-will against me, and trouble me, Atli.
      Why hast thou taken my workman? Wrongfully is this done."</p>
     <p>Atli answered, "It is not proven to me that he is thy workman, nor will I withhold him from
      thee, if thou showest proofs thereof, yet am I loth to drag him out of my house."</p>
     <p>"Thou must have thy will now," said Thorbiorn; "but I claim the man, and forbid him to work
      here; and I will come again another time, and I know not if we shall then part better friends
      than now."</p>
     <p>Atli said, "I shall abide at home, and take what may come to hand."</p>
     <p>Then Thorbiorn rode home; but when the workmen come home in the evening, Atli tells all the
      talk betwixt <pb n="132"/> him and Thorbiorn, and bids Ali go his way, and said he should not
      abide there longer.</p>
     <p>Ali answered, "True is the old saw, <hi rend="ital">over-praised and first to fail</hi>. I
      deemed not that thou wouldst drive me away after I had tolled here all the summer enough to
      break my heart, and I hoped that thou wouldst stand up for me somehow; but this is the way of
      you, though ye look as if good might be hoped from you. I shall be beaten here before thine
      eyes if thou givest me not some defence or help."</p>
     <p>Atli altered his mind at this talk of his, and had no heart now to drive him away from
      him.</p>
     <p>Now the time wore, till men began hay-harvest, and one day, somewhat before midsummer,
      Thorbiorn Oxmain rode to Biarg, he was so attired that he had a helm on his head, and was girt
      with a sword, and had a spear in his hand. A barbed spear it was, and the barbs were
      broad.</p>
     <p>It was wet abroad that day. Atli had sent his house-carles to the mowing, but some of them
      were north at Horn a-fishing. Atli was at home, and few other men.</p>
     <p>Thorbiorn came there about high-noon; alone he was, and rode up to the outer door; the door
      was locked, and no men were abroad. Thorbiorn smote on the door, and then drew aback behind
      the houses, so that none might see him from the door. The home-folk heard that the door was
      knocked at, and a woman went out. Thorbiorn had an inkling of the woman, and would not let
      himself be seen, for he had a mind to do something else.</p>
     <p>Now the woman went into the chamber, and Atli asked who was come there. She said, "I have
      seen nought stirring abroad." And even as they spake Thorbiorn let drive a great stroke on the
      door.</p>
     <p>Then said Atli, "This one would see me, and he must <pb n="133"/> have some errand with me,
      whatever may be the gain thereof to me."</p>
     <p>Then he went forth and out of the door, and saw no one without. Exceeding wet it was,
      therefore he went not out, but laid a hand on either door-post, and so peered about him.</p>
     <p>In that point of time Thorbiorn swung round before the door, and thrust the spear with both
      hands amidst of Atli, so that it pierced him through.</p>
     <p>Then said Atli, when he got the thrust, "<hi rend="ital">Broad spears are about now</hi>,"
      says he, and fell forward over the threshold.</p>
     <p>Then came out women who had been in the chamber, and saw that Atli was dead. By then was
      Thorbiorn on horseback, and he gave out the slaying as having been done by his hand, and
      thereafter rode home.</p>
     <p>The goodwife Asdis sent for her men, and Atli's corpse was laid out, and he was buried
      beside his father. Great mourning folk made for his death, for he had been a wise man, and of
      many friends.</p>
     <p>No weregild came for the slaying of Atli, nor did any man claim atonement for him, because
      Grettir had the blood-suit to take up if he should come out; so these matters stood still for
      that summer. Thorbiorn was little thanked for that deed of his; but he sat at peace in his
      homestead.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="46">
     <head>Grettir outlawed at the Thing at the Suit of Thorir of Garth</head>
     <p>THIS summer, whereof the tale was telling e'en now, a ship came out to Goose-ere before the
      Thing. Then <pb n="134"/> was the news told of Grettir's travels, and therewithal men spake of
      that house-burning; and at that story was Thorir of Garth mad wroth, and deemed that there
      whereas Grettir was he had to look for vengeance for his sons. He rode with many men and set
      forth at the Thing the case for the burning, but men deemed they knew nought to say therein,
      while there was none to answer.</p>
     <p>Thorir said that he would have nought, but that Grettir should be made an outlaw throughout
      the land for such misdeeds.</p>
     <p>Then answered Skapti the Lawman, "Surely an ill deed it is, if things are as is said; but a
      tale is half told if one man tells it, for most folk are readiest to bring their stories to
      the worser side when there are two ways of telling them; now, therefore, I shall not give my
      word that Grettir be made guilty for this that has been done."</p>
     <p>Now Thorir was a man of might in his district and a great chief, and well befriended of many
      great men; and he pushed on matters so hard that nought could avail to acquit Grettir; and so
      this Thorir made Grettir an outlaw throughout all the land, and was ever thenceforth the
      heaviest of all his foes, as things would oft show.</p>
     <p>Now he put a price on his head, as was wont to be done with other wood-folk, and thereafter
      rode home.</p>
     <p>Many men got saying that this was done rather by the high hand than according to law; but so
      it stood as it was done; and now nought else happed to tell of till past midsummer.</p>
    </div>

    <pb n="135"/>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="47">
     <head>Grettir comes out to Iceland again</head>
     <p>WHEN summer was far spent came Grettir Asmundson out to Whiteriver in Burgfirth; folk went
      down to the ship from thereabout, and these tidings came all at once to Grettir: the first,
      that his father was dead; the second, that his brother was slain; the third, that he himself
      was made an outlaw throughout all the land. Then sang Grettir this stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Heavy tidings thick and fast</l>
      <l>On the singer now are cast;</l>
      <l>My father dead, my brother dead,</l>
      <l>A price set upon my head;</l>
      <l>Yet, O grove of Hedin's maid,</l>
      <l>May these things one day be paid</l>
      <l>Yea upon another morn</l>
      <l>Others may be more forlorn."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>So men say that Grettir changed nowise at these tidings, but was even as merry as
      before.</p>
     <p>Now he abode with the ship awhile, because he could get no horse to his mind. But there was
      a man called Svein, who dwelt at Bank up from Thingness, he was a good bonder and a merry man,
      and often sang such songs as were gamesome to hear; he had a mare black to behold, the
      swiftest of all horses, and her Svein called Saddle-fair.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir went one night away from the wolds, but he would not that the chapmen should
      beware of his ways; he <pb n="136"/> got a black cape, and threw it over his clothes, and so
      was disguised; he went up past Thingness, and so up to Bank, and by then it was daylight. He
      saw a black horse in the home-field and went up to it, and laid bridle on it, leapt on the
      back of it, and rode up along White-river, and below Bye up to Flokedale-river, and then up
      the tracks above Kalfness; the workmen at Bank got up now and told the bonder of the man who
      had got on his mare; he got up and laughed, and sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"One that helm-fire well can wield</l>
      <l>Rode off from my well-fenced field,</l>
      <l>Helm-stalk stole away from me</l>
      <l>Saddle-fair, the swift to see;</l>
      <l>Certes, more great deeds this Frey</l>
      <l>Yet shall do in such-like way</l>
      <l>As this was done; I deem him then</l>
      <l>Most overbold and rash of men."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Then he took horse and rode after him; Grettir rode on till he came up to the homestead at
      Kropp; there he met a man called Hall, who said that he was going down to the ship at the
      Wolds; Grettir sang a stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"In broad-peopled lands say thou</l>
      <l>That thou sawest even now</l>
      <l>Unto Kropp-firm's gate anigh,</l>
      <l>Saddle-fair and Elm-stalk high;</l>
      <l>That thou sawest stiff on steed</l>
      <l>(Get thee gone at greatest speed),</l>
      <l>One who loveth game and play</l>
      <l>Clad in cape of black to-day."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Then they part, and Hall went down the track and <pb n="137"/> all the way down to Kalfness,
      before Svein met him; they greeted one another hastily, then sang Svein--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Sawest thou him who did me harm</l>
      <l>On my horse by yonder farm?</l>
      <l>Even such an one was he,</l>
      <l>Sluggish yet a thief to see</l>
      <l>From the neighbours presently</l>
      <l>Doom of thief shall he abye</l>
      <l>And a blue skin shall he wear,</l>
      <l>If his back I come anear."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>"That thou mayst yet do," said Hall, "I saw that man who said that he rode on Saddle-fair,
      and bade me tell it over the peopled lands and settlements; great of growth he was, and was
      clad in a black cape."</p>
     <p>"He deems he has something to fall back on," said the bonder, "but I shall ride after him
      and find out who he is."</p>
     <p>Now Grettir came to Deildar-Tongue, and there was a woman without the door; Grettir went up
      to talk to her, and sang this stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Say to guard of deep-sea's flame</l>
      <l>That here worm-land's haunter came;</l>
      <l>Well-born goddess of red gold,</l>
      <l>Thus let gamesome rhyme be told.</l>
      <l>'Giver forth of Odin's mead</l>
      <l>Of thy black mare have I need;</l>
      <l>For to Gilsbank will I ride,</l>
      <l>Meed of my rash words to bide.'"</l>
     </lg>

     <p>The woman learned this song, and thereafter Grettir rode on his way; Svein came there a
      little after, and she was not yet gone in, and as he came he sang this--</p>
     <pb n="138"/>


     <lg>
      <l>What foreteller of spear-shower</l>
      <l>Fen within this nigh-passed hour,</l>
      <l>Swift through the rough weather rode</l>
      <l>Past the gate of this abode?</l>
      <l>He, the hound-eyed reckless one,</l>
      <l>By all good deeds left alone,</l>
      <l>Surely long upon this day</l>
      <l>From my hands will flee away."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Then she told him what she had been bidden to; he thought over the ditty, and said, "It is
      not unlike that he will be no man to play with; natheless, I will find him out."</p>
     <p>Now he rode along the peopled lands, and each man ever saw the other's riding; and the
      weather was both squally and wet.</p>
     <p>Grettir came to Gilsbank that day, and when Grim Thorhallson knew thereof, he welcomed him
      with great joy, and bade him abide with him. This Grettir agreed to; then he let loose
      Saddle-fair, and told Grim how she had been come by. Therewith came Svein, and leapt from his
      horse, and saw his own mare, and sang this withal--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Who rode on my mare away?</l>
      <l>What is that which thou wilt pay?</l>
      <l>Who a greater theft has seen?</l>
      <l>What does the cowl-covered mean?"</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Grettir by then had doft his wet clothes, and he heard the stave, and answered--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"I did ride thy mare to Grim</l>
      <l>(Thou art feeble weighed with him),</l>
      <l>Little will I pay to thee,</l>
      <l>Yet good fellows let us be."</l>
     </lg>

     <pb n="139"/>
     <p>Well, so be it then," said the farmer, "and the ride is well paid for."</p>
     <p>Then each sang his own songs, and Grettir said he had no fault to find, though he failed to
      hold his own; the bonder was there that night, and the twain of them together, and great game
      they made of this; and they called all this Saddle-fair's lays. Next morning the bonder rode
      home, and he and Grettir parted good friends.</p>
     <p>Now Grim told Grettir of many things from the north and Midfirth, that had befallen while he
      was abroad, and this withal, that Atli was unatoned, and how that Thorbiorn Oxmain waxed so
      great, and was so high-handed, that it was not sure that goodwife Asdis might abide at Biarg
      if matters still went so.</p>
     <p>Grettir abode but few nights with Grim, for be was fain that no news should go before him
      north over the Heaths. Grim bade him come thither if he should have any need of safeguard.</p>
     <p>"Yet shall I shun being made guilty in law for the harbouring of thee."</p>
     <p>Grettir said he did well. "But it is more like that later on I may need thy good deed
      more."</p>
     <p>Now Grettir rode north over Twodaysway, and so to Biarg, and came there in the dead of
      night, when all folk were asleep save his mother. He went in by the back of the house and
      through a door that was there, for the ways of the house were well known to him, and came to
      the hall, and got to his mother's bed, and groped about before him.</p>
     <p>She asked who was there, and Grettir told her; then she sat tip and kissed him, and sighed
      withal, heavily, and spake, "Be welcome, son," she said, "but my joyance in my sons is
      slipping from me; for he is slain who was of most <pb n="140"/> avail, and thou art made an
      outlaw and a guilty man, and the third is so young, that he may do nought for me."</p>
     <p>"An old saw it is," said Grettir, "<hi rend="ital">Even so shall bale be bettered, by biding
       greater bale</hi>; but there are more things to he thought of by men than money atonements
      alone, and most like it is that Atli will be avenged; but as to things that may fall to me,
      many must even take their lot at my hand in dealing with me, and like it as they may."</p>
     <p>She said that was not unlike. And now Grettir was there a while with the knowledge of few
      folk; and he had news of the doings of the folk of the country-side; and men knew not that
      Grettir was come into Midfirth: but he heard that Thorbiorn Oxmain was at home with few men;
      and that was after the home-field hay-harvest.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="48">
     <head>The Slaying of Thorbiorn Oxmain</head>
     <p>ON a fair day Grettir rode west over the Necks to Thorodstead, and came there about noon,
      and knocked at the door; women came out and welcomed him, but knew him not; he asked for
      Thorbiorn, but they said he was gone to the meadow to bind hay, and with him his son of
      sixteen winters, who was called Arnor; for Thorbiorn was a very busy man, and well-nigh never
      idle.</p>
     <p>So when Grettir knew this, he bade them well betide, and went his way on the road toward
      Reeks, there a marsh stretches down from the hill-side, and on it was much grass to mow, and
      much hay had Thorbiorn made there, and now it was fully dry, and he was minded to bind it up
      for <pb n="141"/> home, he and the lad with him, but a woman did the raking.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir rode from below up into the field, but the father and son were higher up, and
      had bound one load, and were now at another; Thorbiorn had set his shield and sword against
      the load, and the lad had a hand-axe beside him.</p>
     <p>Now Thorbiorn saw a man coming, and said to the lad, "Yonder is a man riding toward us, let
      us leave binding the hay, and know what he will with us."</p>
     <p>So did they, and Grettir leapt off his horse; he had a helm on his head, and was girt with
      the short-sword, and bore a great spear in his hand, a spear without barbs, and the socket
      inlaid with silver. Now he sat down and knocked out the socket-nail, because he would not that
      Thorbiorn should cast the spear back.</p>
     <p>Then said Thorbiorn, "He is a big man, and no man in field know I, if that is not Grettir
      Asmundson, and he must needs think he has enough against us; so let us meet him sharply, and
      let him see no signs of failing in us. We shall deal cunningly, for I will go against him in
      front, and take thou heed how matters go betwixt us, for I will trust myself against any man
      if I have one alone to meet; but do thou go behind him, and drive the axe at him with both
      hands a-twixt his shoulders; thou needest not fear that he will do thee hurt, as his back will
      be turned to thee."</p>
     <p>Neither Thorbiorn nor his son had a helm.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir got into the mead, and when he came within spear-throw of them, he cast his
      spear at Thorbiorn, but the head was looser on the shaft than he deemed it would be, and it
      swerved in its flight, and fell down from the shaft to the earth t then Thorbiorn took his
      shield, and put it before him, but drew his sword and went against <pb n="142"/> Grettir when
      he knew him; then Grettir drew his short-sword, and turned about somewhat, so that he saw how
      the lad stood at his back, wherefore he kept himself free to move here or there, till he saw
      that the lad was come within reach of him, and therewith he raised the short-sword high aloft,
      and sent it back against Arnor's head so mightily that the skull was shattered, and that was
      his bane. Then Thorbiorn ran against Grettir and smote at him, but he thrust forth his buckler
      with his left hand, and put the blow from him, and smote with the short-sword withal, and
      cleft the shield of Thorbiorn, and the short-sword smote so hard into his head that it went
      even unto the brain, and he fell dead to earth beneath that stroke, nor did Grettir give him
      any other wound.</p>
     <p>Then he sought for his spear-head, and found it not; so he went to his horse and rode out to
      Reeks, and there told of the slayings. Withal the woman who was in the meadow saw the
      slayings, and ran home full of fear, and said that Thorbiorn was slain, and his son both; this
      took those of the house utterly unawares, for they knew nought of Grettir's travelling. So
      were men sent for to the next homestead, and soon came many folk, and brought the bodies to
      church. Thorod Drapa-stump took up the blood-suit for these slayings and had folk a-field
      forthwith.</p>
     <p>But Grettir rode home to Biarg, and found his mother, and told her what had happed; and she
      was glad thereat, and said that now he got to be like unto the Waterdale kin. "Yet will this
      be the root and stem of thine outlawry, and I know for sooth that thou mayest not abide here
      long because of the kin of Thorbiorn; but now may they know that thou mayest be angered."</p>
     <p>Grettir sang this stave thereupon--</p>
     <pb n="143"/>


     <lg>
      <l>Giant's friend fell dead to earth</l>
      <l>On the grass of Wether-firth,</l>
      <l>No fierce fighting would avail,</l>
      <l>Oxmain in the Odin's gale.</l>
      <l>So, and in no other wise,</l>
      <l>Has been paid a fitting price</l>
      <l>For that Atli, who of yore,</l>
      <l>Lay dead-slain a-nigh his door."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Goodwife Asdis said that was true; "But I know not what rede thou art minded to take?"</p>
     <p>Grettir said that he would seek help of his friends and kin in the west; "But on thee shall
      no trouble fall for my sake," said he.</p>
     <p>So he made ready to go, and mother and son parted in love; but first he went to Meals in
      Ramfirth, and told Gamli his brother-in-law all, even as it had happed, concerning the slaying
      of Thorbiorn.</p>
     <p>Gamli told him he must needs depart from Ramfirth while Thorbiorn's kin had their folk
      about; "But our aid in the suit for Atli's slaying we shall yield thee as we may."</p>
     <p>So thereafter Grettir rode west over Laxdale-heath, and stayed not till he came to
      Liarskogar to Thorstein Kuggson, where he dwelt long that autumn.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="49">
     <head>The gathering to avenge Thorbiorn Oxmain</head>
     <p>THOROD Drapa-stump sought tidings of this who might have slain Thorbiorn and his son, and
      when he came to Reeks, it was told him that Grettir had been <pb n="144"/> there and given out
      the slayings as from his hand. Now, Thorod deemed he saw how things had come to pass; so he
      went to Biarg, and there found many folk, but he asked if Grettir were there.</p>
     <p>The goodwife said he had ridden away, and that she would not slip him into hiding-places if
      he were there.</p>
     <p>"Now ye will be well pleased that matters have so been wrought; nor was the slaying of Atli
      over-avenged, though this was paid for it. Ye asked not then what grief of heart I had; and
      now, too, it is well that things are even so."</p>
     <p>Therewith they rode home, and found it not easy to do aught therein.</p>
     <p>Now that spear-head which Grettir lost was not found till within the memory of men living
      now; it was found in the latter days of Sturla Thordson the lawman, and in that marsh where
      Thorbiorn fell, which is now called Spearmead; and that sign men have to show that Thorbiorn
      was slain there, though in some places it is said that he was slain on Midfit.</p>
     <p>Thorod and his kin heard that Grettir abode at Liarskogar; then they gathered men, and were
      minded to go thither; but when Gamli of Meals was ware thereof, he made Thorstein and Grettir
      sure of the farings of the Ramfirthers; and when Thorstein knew it, he sent Grettir in to
      Tongue to Snorri Godi, for then there was no strife between them, and Thorstein gave that
      counsel to Grettir that he should pray Snorri the Godi for his watch and ward; but if he would
      not grant it, he made Grettir go west to Reekknolls to Thorgils Arison, "and he will take thee
      to him through this winter, and keep within the Westfirths till these matters are
      settled."</p>
     <p>Grettir said he would take good heed to his counsels <pb n="145"/> then he rode into Tongue,
      and found Snorri the Godi, and talked with him, and prayed him to take him in.</p>
     <p>Snorri answered, "I grow an old man now, and loth am I to harbour outlawed men if no need
      drive me thereto. What has come to pass that the elder put thee off from him?"</p>
     <p>Grettir said that Thorstein had often done well to him; "But more shall I need than him
      alone, if things are to go well."</p>
     <p>Said Snorri, "My good word I shall put in for thee if that may avail thee aught, but in some
      other place than with me must thou seek a dwelling."</p>
     <p>With these words they parted, and Grettir turned west to Reekness; the Ramfirthers with
      their band got as far as Samstead, and there they heard that Grettir had departed from
      Liarskogar, and thereat they went back home.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="50">
     <head>Grettir and the Foster-brothers at Reek-knolls</head>
     <p>NOW Grettir came to Reek-knolls about winter-nights, and prayed Thorgils for winter abode;
      Thorgils said, that for him as for other free men meat was ready; "but the fare of guests here
      is nowise choice." Grettir said he was not nice about that.</p>
     <p>"There is yet another thing here for thy trouble," said Thorgils: "Men are minded to harbour
      here, who are deemed somewhat hard to keep quiet, even as those foster-brothers, Thorgeir and
      Thormod; I wot not how meet it may be for you to be together; but their dwelling shall ever be
      here if <pb n="146"/> they will it so: now mayst thou abide here if thou wilt, but I will not
      have it that either of you make strife with the other."</p>
     <p>Grettir said he would not be the first to raise strife with any man, and so much the less as
      the bonder's will was such.</p>
     <p>A little after came those foster-brothers home; things went not merrily betwixt Thorgeir and
      Grettir, but Thormod bore himself well. Goodman Thorgils said to the foster-brothers even as
      he had said to Grettir; and of suchworth they held him, that neither cast an untoward word at
      the other although their minds went nowise the same way: and so wore the early winter.</p>
     <p>Now men say that Thorgils owned those isles, which are called Olaf's-isles, and lie out in
      the firth a sea-mile and a half off Reekness; there had bonder Thorgils a good ox that he
      might not fetch home in the autumn; and he was ever saying that he would fain have him against
      Yule. Now, one day those foster-brothers got ready to seek the ox, if a third man could be
      gotten to their aid: Grettir offered to go with them, and they were well pleased thereat; they
      went, the three of them, in a ten-oared boat: the weather was cold, and the wind shifting from
      the north, and the craft lay up on Whaleshead-holm.</p>
     <p>Now they sail out, and somewhat the wind got up, but they came to the isle and got hold of
      the ox; then asked Grettir which they would do, bear the ox aboard or keep hold of the craft,
      because the surf at the isle was great; then they bade him hold the boat; so he stood
      amidships on that side which looked from shore, and the sea took him up to the
      shoulder-blades, yet he held her so that she moved nowise: but Thorgeir took the ox behind and
      Thormod before, and so hove it down to the boat; then they sat down <pb n="147"/> to row, and
      Thormod rowed in the bows, Thorgeir amidships, and Grettir aft, and therewith they made out
      into the open bay; but when they came off Goat-rock, a squall caught them, then said Thorgeir,
      "The stern is fain to lag behind."</p>
     <p>Then said Grettir, "The stern will not be left if the rowing afore be good."</p>
     <p>Thereat Thorgeir fell to rowing so hard that both the tholes were broken: then said he, "Row
      on, Grettir, while I mend the thole-pins."</p>
     <p>Then Grettir pulled mightily while Thorgeir did his mending, but when Thorgeir took to
      rowing again, the oars had got so worn that Grettir shook them asunder on the gunwale.</p>
     <p>"Better," quoth Thormod, "to row less and break nought."</p>
     <p>Then Grettir caught up two unshapen oar beams that lay in the boat and bored large holes in
      the gunwales, and rowed withal so mightily that every beam creaked, but whereas the craft was
      good, and the men somewhat of the brisker sort, they reached Whaleshead-holm.</p>
     <p>Then Grettir asked whether they would rather go home with the ox or haul up the boat; they
      chose to haul up the boat, and hauled it up with all the sea that was in it, and all the ice,
      for it was much covered with icicles: but Grettir led home the ox, and exceeding stiff in tow
      he was, and very fat, and he grew very weary, and when they came up below Titling-stead could
      go no more.</p>
     <p>The foster-brothers went up to the house, for neither would help the other in his allotted
      work; Thorgils asked after Grettir, but they told him where they had parted; then he sent men
      to meet him, and when they came down to Cave-knolls they saw how there came towards them a <pb
       n="148"/> man with a neat on his back, and lo, there was Grettir come, bearing the ox: then
      all men wondered at his great might.</p>
     <p>Now Thorgeir got very envious of Grettir's strength, and one day somewhat after Yule,
      Grettir went alone to bathe; Thorgeir knew thereof, and said to Thormod, "Let us go on now,
      and try how Grettir will start if I set on him as he comes from his bathing."</p>
     <p>"That is not my mind," said Thormod, "and no good wilt thou get from him."</p>
     <p>"I will go though," says Thorgeir; and therewith he went down to the slope, and bore aloft
      an axe.</p>
     <p>By then was Grettir walking up from the bath, and when they met, Thorgeir said; "Is it true,
      Grettir," says he, "that thou hast said so much as that thou wouldst never run before one
      man?"</p>
     <p>"That I know not for sure," said Grettir, "yet but a little way have I run before thee."</p>
     <p>Thorgeir raised aloft the axe, but therewith Grettir ran in under Thorgeir and gave him an
      exceeding great fall: then said Thorgeir to Thormod, "Wilt thou standby and see this fiend
      drive me down under him?"</p>
     <p>Thormod caught hold of Grettir's feet, and was minded to pull him from off Thorgeir, but
      could do nought thereat: he was girt with a short-sword and was going to draw it, when goodman
      Thorgils came up and bade them be quiet and have nought to do with Grettir.</p>
     <p>So did they and turned it all to game, and no more is told of their dealings; and men
      thought Thorgils had great luck in that he kept such reckless men in good peace.</p>
     <p>But when spring came they all went away; Grettir went round to Codfirth, and he was asked,
      how he liked the fare of the winter abode at Reek-knolls; he answered, "There <pb n="149"/>
      have I ever been as fain as might be of my meals when I got at them."</p>
     <p>Thereafter he went west over the heaths.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="51">
     <head>Of the suit for the Slaying of Thorbiorn Oxmain, and how Thorir of Garth would not that
      Grettir should be made sackless</head>
     <p>THORGILS Arison rode to the Thing with many men; and thither came all the great men of the
      land. Now Thorgils and Skapti the Lawman soon met, and fell to talking.</p>
     <p>Then said Skapti, "Is it true, Thorgils, that thou hast harboured those three men through
      the winter who are deemed to be the wildest of all men; yea, and all of them outlawed withal,
      and yet hast kept them so quiet, that no one of them has done hurt to the other?"</p>
     <p>Thorgils said it was true enough.</p>
     <p>Skapti said that great might over men it showed forth in him; "But how goes it, thinkest
      thou, with the temper of each of them; and which of them thinkest thou the bravest man?"</p>
     <p>Thorgils said, "I deem they are all of them full stout of heart; but two of them I deem know
      what fear is, and yet in unlike ways; for Thormod is a great believer and fears God much; but
      Grettir is so fearsome in the dark, that he dares go nowhither after dusk has set in, if he
      may do after his own mind. But my kinsman Thorgeir I deem knows not how to fear." <pb n="150"
      /> "Yea, so it is with their minds as thou sayest," said Skapti; and with that they left
      talking.</p>
     <p>Now, at this Althing Thorod Drapa-Stump brought forward a suit for the slaying of Thorbiorn
      Oxmain, which he had not brought to a hearing at the Hunawater Thing, because of the kin of
      Atli, and he deemed that here his case would be less like to be thrown over. The kinsmen of
      Atli sought counsel of Skapti about the case; and he said he saw in it a lawful defence, so
      that full atonement would be forthcoming therefor. Then were these matters laid unto
      umpiredom, and most men were minded that the slayings of Atli and Thorbiorn should be set one
      against the other.</p>
     <p>But when Skapti knew that, he went to the judges, and asked whence they had that? They said
      that they deemed the slain men were bonders of equal worth.</p>
     <p>Then Skapti asked, which was the first, the outlawry of Grettir or the slaying of Atli? So,
      when that was reckoned up, there was a week's space betwixt Grettir's outlawry at the Althing
      and the slaying of Atli, which befell just after it.</p>
     <p>Then said Skapti, "Thereof my mind misgave me, that ye had made an oversight in setting on
      foot the suit in that ye made him a suitor, who was outlawed already, and could neither defend
      nor prosecute his own case. Now I say that Grettir has nought to do with the case of the
      slaying, but let him take up the blood-suit, who is nighest of kin by law."</p>
     <p>Then said Thorod Drapa-Stump, "And who shall answer for the slaying of Thorbiorn my
      brother?"</p>
     <p>"See ye to that for yourselves," said Skapti; "but the kin of Grettir will never pour out
      fee for him or his works, if no peace is to be bought for him." <pb n="151"/> Now when
      Thorvald Asgeirson was aware that Grettir was set aside from following the blood-suit, he and
      his sought concerning who was the next of kin; and that turned out to be Skeggi, son of Gamli
      of Meals, and Uspak, son of Glum of Ere in Bitra; they were both of them exceeding zealous and
      pushing.</p>
     <p>Now must Thorod give atonement for Atli's slaying, and two hundreds in silver he had to
      pay.</p>
     <p>Then spake Snorri the Godi, "Will ye now, Ramfirthers," says he, "that this money-fine
      should fall away, and that Grettir be made sackless withal, for in my mind it is that as a
      guilty man he will be sorely felt?"</p>
     <p>Grettir's kin took up his word well, and said that they heeded the fee nought if he might
      have peace and freedom. Thorod said that he saw Grettir's lot would be full of heavy trouble,
      and made as if he would take the offer, for his part. Then Snorri bade them first know if
      Thorir of Garth would give his leave to Grettir being made free; but when Thorir heard thereof
      he turned away exceeding wroth, and said that Grettir should never either get out of his
      outlawry or be brought out of it: "And the more to bring that about," said he, "a greater
      price shall be put on his head than on the head of any outlaw or woodman yet."</p>
     <p>So, when he took the thing so ill, the freeing of Grettir .came to nought, and Gamli and his
      fellows took the money to them, and kept it in their ward; but Thorod, Drapa-Stump had no
      atonement for his brother Thorbiorn.</p>
     <p>Now Thorir and Thorod set each of them on Grettir's head three marks of silver, and that
      folk deemed a new thing, for never had any greater price been laid down to such an end before
      than three marks in all.</p>
     <p>Snorri said it was unwisely done to make a sport of <pb n="152"/> keeping a man in outlawry
      who might work so much ill, and that many a man would have to pay for it.</p>
     <p>But now men part and ride home from the Thing.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="52">
     <head>How Grettir was taken by the Icefirth Carles</head>
     <p>WHEN Grettir came over Codfirth-heath down into Longdale, he swept up unsparingly the goods
      of the petty bonders, and had of every man what he would; from some he took weapons, from some
      clothes; and these folk gave up in very unlike ways; but as soon as he was gone, all said they
      gave them unwillingly.</p>
     <p>In those days dwelt in Waterfirth Vermund the Slender, the brother of Slaying-Styr; he had
      to wife Thorbiorg, the daughter of Olaf Peacock, son of Hoskuld. She was called Thorbiorg the
      Big; but at the time that Grettir was in Longdale had Vermund ridden to the Thing.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir went over the neck to Bathstead. There dwelt a man called Helgi, who was the
      biggest of bonders thereabout: from there had Grettir a good horse, which the bonder owned,
      and thence he went to Giorvidale, where farmed a man named Thorkel. He was well stored with
      victuals, yet a mannikin withal: therefrom took Grettir what he would, nor durst Thorkel blame
      him or withhold aught from him.</p>
     <p>Thence went Grettir to Ere, and out along the side of the firth, and had from every farm
      victuals and clothes, and dealt hardly with many; so that most men deemed him a heavy trouble
      to live under. <pb n="153"/> Now he fared fearlessly withal, and took no keep of himself, and
      so went on till he came to Waterfirth-dale, and went to the mountain-dairy, and there he dwelt
      a many nights, and lay in the woods there, and took no heed to himself; but when the herdsmen
      knew that, they went to the farm, and said that to that stead was a fiend come whom they
      deemed nowise easy to deal with; then the farmers gathered together, and were thirty men in
      all: they lurked in the wood, so that Grettir was unaware of them, and let a shepherd spy on
      Grettir till they might get at him, yet they wotted not clearly who the man was.</p>
     <p>Now so it befell that on a day as Grettir lay sleeping, the bonders came upon him, and when
      they saw him they took counsel how they should take him at the least cost of life, and settled
      so that ten men should leap on him, while some laid bonds on his feet; and this they did, and
      threw themselves on him, but Grettir broke forth so mightily that they fell from off him, and
      he got to his knees, yet thereby they might cast the bonds over him, and round about his feet;
      then Grettir spurned two of them so hard about the ears that they lay stunned on the earth.
      Now one after the other rushed at him, and he struggled hard and long, yet had they might to
      overcome him at the last, and so bound him.</p>
     <p>Thereafter they talked over what they should do with him, and they bade Helgi of Bathstead
      take him and keep him in ward till Vermund came home from the Thing. He answered--</p>
     <p>"Other things I deem more helpful to me than to let my house-carles sit over him, for my
      lands are hard to work, nor shall he ever come across me."</p>
     <p>Then they bade Thorkel of Giorvidale take and keep him, and said that he was a man who had
      enow. <pb n="154"/> But Thorkel spake against it, and said that for nought would he do that:
      "Whereas I live alone in my house with my Carline, far from other men; nor shall ye lay that
      box on me," said he.</p>
     <p>"Then, Thoralf of Ere," said they, "do thou take Grettir and do well to him till after the
      Thing; or else bring him on to the next farm, and be answerable that he get not loose, but
      deliver him bound as now thou hast him."</p>
     <p>He answers, "Nay, I will not take Grettir, for I have neither victuals nor money to keep him
      withal, nor has he been taken on my land, and I deem it more trouble than honour to take him,
      or to have aught to do with him, nor shall he ever come into my house."</p>
     <p>Thereafter they tried it with every bonder, but one and all spake against it; and after this
      talk have merry men made that lay which is hight Grettir's-faring, and added many words of
      good game thereto for the sport of men.</p>
     <p>So when they had talked it over long, they said, with one assent, that they would not make
      ill hap of their good hap; so they went about and straightway reared up a gallows there in the
      wood, with the mind to hang Grettir, and made great clatter thereover.</p>
     <p>Even therewith they see six folk riding down below in the dale, and one in coloured clothes,
      and they guessed that there would goodwife Thorbiorg be going from Waterfirth; and so it was,
      and she was going to the mountain-dairy. Now she was a very stirring woman, and exceeding
      wise; she had the ruling of the neighbourhood, and settled all matters, when Vermund was from
      home. Now she turned to where the men were gathered, and was helped off her horse, and the
      bonders gave her good welcome. <pb n="155"/> Then said she, "What have ye here? or who is the
      big-necked one who sits in bonds yonder?"</p>
     <p>Grettir named himself, and greeted her.</p>
     <p>She spake again, "What drove thee to this, Grettir," says she, "that thou must needs do
      riotously among my Thing-men?"</p>
     <p>"I may not look to everything; I must needs be somewhere," said he.</p>
     <p>"Great ill luck it is," says she, "that these milksops should take thee in such wise that
      none should fall before thee. What are ye minded to do with him?"</p>
     <p>The bonders told her that they were going to tie him up to the gallows for his
      lawlessness.</p>
     <p>She answers, "Maybe Grettir is guilty enough therefor, but it is too great a deed for you,
      Icefirthers, to take his life, for he is a famous man, and of mighty kin, albeit he is no
      lucky man; but now what wilt thou do for thy life, Grettir, if I give it thee?"</p>
     <p>He answered, "What sayest thou thereto?"</p>
     <p>She said, "Thou shalt make oath to work no evil riots here in Icefirth, and take no revenge
      on whomsoever has been at the taking of thee."</p>
     <p>Grettir said that she should have her will, and so he was loosed; and he says of himself
      that at that time of all times did he most rule his temper, when he smote them not as they
      made themselves great before him.</p>
     <p>Now Thorbiorg bade him go home with her, and gave him a horse for his riding; so he went to
      Waterfirth and abode there till Vermund came home, and the housewife did well to him, and for
      this deed was she much renowned far and wide in the district.</p>
     <p>But Vermund took this ill at his coming home, and <pb n="156"/> asked what made Grettir
      there? Then Thorbiorg told him how all had gone betwixt Grettir and the Icefirthers.</p>
     <p>"What reward was due to him," said Vermund, "that thou gavest him his life?"</p>
     <p>"Many grounds there were thereto," said Thorbiorg; "and this, first of all, that thou wilt
      be deemed a greater chief than before in that thou hast a wife who has dared to do such a
      deed; and then withal surely would Hrefha his kinswoman say that I should not let men slay
      him; and, thirdly, he is a man of the greatest prowess in many wise."</p>
     <p>"A wise wife thou art withal," said Vermund, "and have thou thanks therefor."</p>
     <p>Then he said to Grettir, "Stout as thou art, but little was to be paid for thee, when thou
      must needs be taken of mannikins; but so ever it fares with men riotous."</p>
     <p>Then Grettir sang this stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>III luck to me</l>
      <l>That I should be</l>
      <l>On sea-roof-firth</l>
      <l>Borne unto earth;</l>
      <l>Ill luck enow</l>
      <l>To lie alow,</l>
      <l>This head of mine</l>
      <l>Griped fast by swine."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>"What were they minded to do to thee," said Vermund, when they took thee there?"</p>
     <p>Quoth Grettir--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>There many men</l>
      <l>Bade give me then</l>
      <l>E'en Sigar's meed </l>
      <pb n="157"/>
      <l>For lovesome deed;</l>
      <l>Till found me there</l>
      <l>That willow fair,</l>
      <l>Whose leaves are praise,</l>
      <l>Her stems good days."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Vermund asked, "Would they have hanged thee then, if they alone had had to meddle with
      matters?" Said Grettir--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>Yea, to the snare</l>
      <l>That dangled there</l>
      <l>My head must I</l>
      <l>Soon bring anigh;</l>
      <l>But Thorbiorg came</l>
      <l>The brightest dame,</l>
      <l>And from that need</l>
      <l>The singer freed."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Then said Vermund, "Did she bid thee to her?" Grettir answered--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>Sif's lord's good aid,</l>
      <l>My saviour, bade</l>
      <l>To take my way</l>
      <l>With her that day;</l>
      <l>So did it fall;</l>
      <l>And therewithal</l>
      <l>A horse she gave;</l>
      <l>Good peace I have."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>"Mighty will thy life be and troublous," said Vermund, but now thou hast learned to beware
      of thy foes; but I have no will to harbour thee, and gain therefor the ill-will <pb n="158"/>
      of many rich men; but best is it for thee to seek thy kinsmen, though few men will be willing
      to take thee in if they may do aught else; nor to most men art thou an easy fellow
      withal."</p>
     <p>Now Grettir was in Waterfirth a certain space, and then fared thence to the Westfirths, and
      sought shelter of many great men; but something ever came to pass whereby none of them would
      harbour him.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="53">
     <head>Grettir with Thorstein Kuggson</head>
     <p>WHEN the autumn was somewhat spent, Grettir turned back by the south, and made no stay till
      he came to Liarskogar to Thorstein Kuggson, his kinsman, and there had he good welcome, for
      Thorstein bade him abide there through the winter, and that bidding he agreed to. Thorstein
      was a busy man and a good smith, and kept men close to their work; but Grettir had little mind
      to work, wherefore their tempers went but little together.</p>
     <p>Thorstein had let make a church at his homestead; and a bridge he had made out from his
      house, wrought with great craft; for in the outside bridge, under the beams that held it up,
      were rings wrought all about, and din-bells, so that one might hear over to Scarf-stead, half
      a sea-mile off, if aught went over the bridge, because of the shaking of the rings. Thorstein
      had much to do over this work, for he was a great worker of iron; but Grettir went fiercely at
      the iron-smiting, yet was in many minds thereover; but he was quiet through the winter, so
      that nought befell worthy telling. But when the Ramfirthers knew that Grettir was with
      Thorstein, <pb n="159"/> they had their band afoot as soon as spring came. So when Thorstein
      knew that, he bade Grettir seek some other shelter than his house, "For I see thou wilt not
      work, and men who will do nought are not meet men for me."</p>
     <p>"Where wouldst thou have me go, then?" said Grettir.</p>
     <p>Thorstein bade him fare to the south country, and find his kin, "But come to me if they
      avail thee not."</p>
     <p>Now so Grettir wrought that he went south to Burgfirth, to Grim Thorhallson, and dwelt there
      till over the Thing. Then Grim sent him on to Skapti the Lawman at Hjalli, and he went south
      by the lower heaths and stayed not till he came to Thorhall, son of Asgrim, son of
      Ellida-grim, and went little in the peopled lands. Thorhall knew Grettir because of his father
      and mother, and, indeed, by then was the name of Grettir well renowned through all the land
      because of his great deeds.</p>
     <p>Thorhall was a wise man, and he did well to Grettir, but would not let him abide there
      long.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="54">
     <head>Grettir meets Hallmund on the Keel</head>
     <p>NOW Grettir fared from Tongue up to Hawkdale, and thence north upon the Keel, and kept about
      there long that summer; nor was there trust of him that he would not take men's goods from
      them, as they went from or to the north over the Keel, because he was hard put to it to get
      wares.</p>
     <p>Now on a day, when as Grettir would keep about the <pb n="160"/> north at Doveness-path, he
      saw a man riding from the north over the Keel; he was huge to behold on horseback, and had a
      good horse, and an embossed bridle well wrought; another horse he had in tow and bags thereon;
      this man had withal a slouched hat on his head, nor could his face be clearly seen.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir looked hard at the horse and the goods thereon, and went to meet the man, and
      greeting him asked his name, but he said he was called Air. "I wot well what thou art called,"
      said he, "for thou shalt be Grettir the Strong, the son of Asmund. Whither art thou
      bound?"</p>
     <p>"As to the place I have not named it yet," said Grettir; "but as to my errand, it is to know
      if thou wilt lay down some of the goods thou farest with."</p>
     <p>Said Air, "Why should I give thee mine own, or what wilt thou give me therefor?"</p>
     <p>Grettir answers, "Hast thou not heard that I take, and give no money again? and yet it seems
      to most men that I get what I will."</p>
     <p>Said Air, "Give such choice as this to those who deem it good, but not thus will I give up
      what I have; let each of us go his own way."</p>
     <p>And therewithal he rode forth past Grettir and spurred his horse.</p>
     <p>"Nay, we part not so hastily," said Grettir. and laid hold of the reins of Air's horse in
      front of his hands, and held on with both hands.</p>
     <p>Said Air, "Go thy ways, nought thou hast of me if I may hold mine own."</p>
     <p>"That will now be proven," said Grettir.</p>
     <p>Now Air stretched his hands down the head-gear and laid hold of the reins betwixt Grettir's
      hands and the snaffle-rings and dragged at them so hard that Grettir's hands were <pb n="161"
      /> drawn down along the reins, till Air dragged all the bridle from him.</p>
     <p>Grettir looked into the hollow of his hands, and saw that this man must have strength in
      claws rather than not, and he looked after him, and said, "Whither art thou minded to
      fare?"</p>
     <p>Air answered and sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"To the Kettle's side</l>
      <l>Now will I ride,</l>
      <l>Where the waters fall</l>
      <l>From the great ice-wall;</l>
      <l>If thou hast mind</l>
      <l>There mayest thou find</l>
      <l>With little stone<note place="foot">Hall, a stone: mund, a hand, and by periphrasis, 'land
        of a fist'; so that Hallmund is meant by this couplet, and that was the real name of "Air,"
        who is not a mere man, but a friendly spirit of the mountains.</note></l>
      <l>Fist's land alone."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Grettir said, "It is of no avail to seek after thine abode if thou tellest of it no clearer
      than this."</p>
     <p>Then Air spake and sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"I would not hide</l>
      <l>Where I abide,</l>
      <l>If thou art fain</l>
      <l>To see me again;</l>
      <l>From that lone weald,</l>
      <l>Over Burgfirth field,</l>
      <l>That ye men name</l>
      <l>Balljokul, I came."</l>
     </lg>

     <pb n="162"/>
     <p>Thereat they parted, and Grettir sees that he has no strength against this man; and
      therewithal he sang a stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Too far on this luckless day,</l>
      <l>Atli, good at weapon-play,</l>
      <l>Brisk Illugi were from me;</l>
      <l>Such-like oft I shall not be</l>
      <l>As I was, when I must stand</l>
      <l>With the reins drawn through my hand</l>
      <l>By the unflinching losel Air.</l>
      <l>Maids weep when they know I fear."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Thereafter Grettir went to the south from the Keel; and rode to Hjalli and found Skapti, and
      prayed for watch and ward from him.</p>
     <p>Skapti said, "It is told me that thou farest somewhat lawlessly, and layest hand on other
      men's goods; and this beseems thee ill, great of kin as thou art. Now all would make a better
      tale, if thou didst not rob and reive; but whereas I have to bear the name of lawman in the
      land, folk would not abide that I should take outlawed men to me, and break the laws thereby.
      I will that thou seek some place wherein thou wilt not have need to take men's goods from
      them."</p>
     <p>Grettir said he would do even so, yet withal that he might scarcely be alone because he so
      feared the dark.</p>
     <p>Skapti said that of that one thing then, which he deemed the best, be might not avail
      himself; "But put not such trust in any as to fare as thou didst in the Westfirths; it has
      been many a man's bane that he has been too trustful."</p>
     <p>Grettir thanked him for his wholesome redes, and so turned back to Burgfirth in the autumn,
      and found Grim <pb n="163"/> Thorhallson, his friend, and told him of Skapti's counsels; so
      Grim bade him fare north to Fishwater lakes on Ernewaterheath; and thus did he.</p>
    </div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="55">
     <head>Of Grettir on Ernewaterheath, and his dealings with Grim there</head>
     <p>GRETTIR went up to Ernewaterheath and made there a hut for himself (whereof are yet signs
      left) and dwelt there, for now was he fain to do anything rather than rob and reive; he got
      him nets and a boat and caught fish for his food; exceeding dreary he deemed it in the
      mountains, because he was so fearsome of the dark.</p>
     <p>But when other outlaws heard this, that Grettir was come down there, many of them had a mind
      to see him, because they thought there was much avail of him, There was a man called Grim, a
      Northlander, who was an outlaw; with him the Northlanders made a bargain that he should slay
      Grettir, and promised him freedom and gifts of money, if he should bring it to pass; so he
      went to meet Grettir, and prayed him to take him in.</p>
     <p>Grettir answers, "I see not how thou art the more holpen for being with me, and troublous to
      heed are ye woodfolk; but ill I deem it to be alone, if other choice there were; but I will
      that such an one only be with me as shall do whatso work may befall."</p>
     <p>Grim said he was of no other mind, and prayed hard that he might dwell there; then Grettir
      let himself be talked round, and took him in; and he was there on into the <pb n="164"/>
      winter, and watched Grettir, but deemed it no little matter to set on him. Grettir misdoubted
      him, and had his weapons by his side night and day, nor durst Grim attack him while he was
      awake.</p>
     <p>But one morning whenas Grim came in from fishing, he went into the hut and stamped with his
      foot, and would know whether Grettir slept, but he started in nowise, but lay still; and the
      short-sword hung up over Grettir's head.</p>
     <p>Now Grim thought that no better chance would happen, so he made a great noise, that Grettir
      might chide him therefor, if he were awake, but that befell not. Now he thought that Grettir
      must surely be asleep, so he went stealthily up to the bed and reached out for the
      short-sword, and took it down, and unsheathed it. But even therewith Grettir sprang up on to
      the floor, and caught the short-sword just as the other raised it aloft, and laid the other
      hand on Grim betwixt the shoulders, and cast him down with such a fall, that he was well-nigh
      stunned; "Ah, such hast thou shown thyself," said he, "though thou wouldest give me good hope
      of thee." Then he had a true story from him, and thereafter slew him.</p>
     <p>And now Grettir deemed he saw what it was to take in wood-folk, and so the winter wore; and
      nothing Grettir thought to be of more trouble than his dread of the dark.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="56">
     <head>Of Grettir and Thorir Redbeard</head>
     <p>NOW Thorir of Garth heard where Grettir had set himself down, and was fain to set afoot some
      plot whereby he might be slain. There was a man called Thorir <pb n="165"/> Redbeard; he was
      the biggest of men, and a great manslayer, and therefore was he made outlaw throughout the
      land. Thorir of Garth sent word to him, and when they met he bade him go on an errand of his,
      and slay Grettir the Strong. Redbeard said that was no easy task, and that Grettir was a wise
      man and a wary.</p>
     <p>Thorir bade him make up his mind to this; "A manly task it is for so brisk a fellow as thou;
      but I shall bring thee out of thine outlawry, and therewithal give thee money enough."</p>
     <p>So by that counsel Redbeard abode, and Thorir told him how be should go about the winning of
      Grettir. So thereafter he went round the land by the east, for thus he deemed his faring would
      be the less misdoubted; so he came to Ernewaterheath when Grettir had been there a winter. But
      when he met Grettir, he prayed for winter dwelling at his hands.</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "I cannot suffer you often to play the like play with me that he did who
      came here last autumn, who bepraised me cunningly, and when he had been here a little while
      lay in wait for my life; now, therefore, I have no mind to run the risk any more of the taking
      in of wood-folk."</p>
     <p>Thorir answered, "My mind goes fully with thine in that thou deemest ill of outlawed men:
      and thou wilt have heard tell of me as of a man-slayer and a misdoer, but not as of a doer of
      such foul deeds as to betray my master. Now, <hi rend="ital">ill it is ill to be</hi>, for
      many deem others to do after their own ways; nor should I have been minded to come hither, if
      I might have had a choice of better things; withal I deem we shall not easily be won while we
      stand together, thou mightest risk trying at first how thou likest me, and let me go my ways
      whenso thou markest ill faith in me." <pb n="166"/> Grettir answered, "Once more then will I
      risk it, even with thee; but wot thou well, that if I misdoubt me of thee, that will be thy
      bane."</p>
     <p>Thorir bade him do even so, and thereafter Grettir received him, and found this, that he
      must have the strength of twain, what work soever he took in hand: he was ready for anything
      that Grettir might set him to, and Grettir need turn to nothing, nor had he found his life so
      good since he had been outlawed, yet was he ever so wary of himself that Thorir never got a
      chance against him.</p>
     <p>Thorir Redbeard was with Grettir on the heath for two winters, and now he began to loathe
      his life on the heath, and falls to thinking what deed be shall do that Grettir will not see
      through; so one night in spring a great storm arose while they were asleep; Grettir awoke
      therewith, and asked where was their boat. Thorir sprang up, and ran down to the boat, and
      brake it all to pieces, and threw the broken pieces about here and there, so that it seemed as
      though the storm had driven them along. Then he went into the hut, and called out aloud,</p>
     <p>"Good things have not befallen us, my friend," said he; "for our boat is all broken to
      pieces, and the nets lie a long way out in the water."</p>
     <p>"Go and bring them in then," said Grettir, "for methinks it is with thy goodwill that the
      boat is broken."</p>
     <p>Thorir answered, "Among manly deeds swimming is the least handy to me, but most other deeds,
      I think, I may do against men who are not marvellous; thou mayest wot well enough that I was
      minded that thou shouldst not have to work while I abode here, and this I would not bid if it
      were in me to do it."</p>
     <p>Then Grettir arose and took his weapons, and went to the waterside. Now the land was so
      wrought there that a <pb n="167"/> ness ran into the water, and a great creek was on the other
      side, and the water was deep right up to the shore.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir spake: "Swim off to the nets, and let me see how skilled a man thou art."</p>
     <p>"I told thee before," said Thorir, "that I might not swim; and now I know not what is gone
      with thy manliness and daring."</p>
     <p>"Well, the nets I may get in," said Grettir, "but betray thou me not, since I trust in
      thee."</p>
     <p>Said Thorir, "Deem me not to be so shamed and worthless."</p>
     <p>"Thou wilt thyself prove thyself, what thou art," said Grettir, and therewith he put off his
      clothes and weapons, and swam off for the nets. He swept them up together, and brought them to
      land, and cast them on to the bank; but when he was minded to come aland, then Thorir caught
      up the short-sword and drew it hastily, and ran therewith swiftly on Grettir and smote at him
      as he set foot on the bank; but Grettir fell on his back down into the water, and sank like a
      stone; and Thorir stood gazing out on to the water, to keep him off from the shore if he came
      up again; but Grettir dived and groped along the bottom as near as he might to the bank, so
      that Thorir might not see him till he came into the creek at his back, and got aland; and
      Thorir heeded him not, and felt nought till Grettir heaved him up over his head, and cast him
      down so hard that the short-sword flew out of his hand; then Grettir got hold of it and had no
      words with him, but smote off his head straightway, and this was the end of his life.</p>
     <p>But after this would Grettir never take outlaws to him, yet hardly might he bear to be
      alone.</p>
    </div>

    <pb n="168"/>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="57">
     <head>How Thorir of Garth set on Grettir on Ernewaterheath</head>
     <p>AT the Althing Thorir of Garth heard of the slaying of Thorir Redbeard, and now he thought
      he saw that he had no light task to deal with; but such rede he took that he rode west over
      the lower heathlands from the Thing with well-nigh eighty men, and was minded to go and take
      Grettir's life: but when Grim Thorhallson knew thereof he sent Grettir word and bade him
      beware of himself, so Grettir ever took heed to the goings of men. But one day he saw many men
      riding who took the way to his abode; so he ran into a rift in the rocks, nor would he flee
      because he had not seen all the strength of those folk.</p>
     <p>Then up came Thorir and all his men, and bade them smite Grettir's head from his body, and
      said that the ill-doer's life would be had cheaply now.</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "<hi rend="ital">Though the spoon has taken it up, yet the mouth has had
       no sup</hi>. From afar have ye come, and marks of the game shall some have ere we part."</p>
     <p>Then Thorir egged on his men busily to set on him; but the pass was narrow, and he could
      defend it well from one side; yet hereat he marvelled, that howsoever they went round to the
      back of him, yet no hurt he got thereby; some fell of Thorir's company, and some were wounded,
      but nothing might they do.</p>
     <p>Then said Thorir, "Oft have I heard that Grettir is a man of marvel before all others for
      prowess and good heart, but never knew I that he was so wise a wizard as now I behold him; for
      half as many again fall at his back as fall before him; lo, now we have to do with trolls and
      no men." <pb n="169"/> So he bid them turn away and they did so. Grettir marvelled how that
      might be, for withal he was utterly foredone.</p>
     <p>Thorir and his men turn away and ride toward the north country, and men deemed their journey
      to be of the shamefullest; eighteen men had they left there and many were wounded withal.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir went up into the pass, and found there one great of growth, who sat leaning
      against the rock and was sore wounded. Grettir asked him of his name, and he said he was hight
      Hallmund.</p>
     <p>"And this I will tell thee to know me by, that thou didst deem me to have a good hold of the
      reins that summer when we met on the Keel; now, methinks, I have paid thee back therefor."</p>
     <p>"Yea, in sooth," said Grettir, "I deem that thou hast shown great manliness toward me;
      whenso I may, I will reward thee."</p>
     <p>Hallmund said, "But now I will that thou come to my abode, for thou must e'en think time
      drags heavily here on the heaths."</p>
     <p>Grettir said he was fain thereof; and now they fare both together south under Balljokul, and
      there had Hallmund a huge cave, and a daughter great of growth and of high mind; there they
      did well to Grettir, and the woman healed the wounds of both of them, and Grettir dwelt long
      there that summer, and a lay he made on Hallmund, wherein is this--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Wide and high doth Hallmund stride</l>
      <l>In the hollow mountain side."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>And this stave also is therein--</p>

      <l>That day gave to other hands.</l>
      <l>Hallmund, dweller in the cave,</l>
      <l>Grettir's life that day did save."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Men say that Grettir slew six men in that meeting, but Hallmund twelve.</p>
     <p>Now as the summer wore Grettir yearned for the peopled country, to see his friends and kin;
      Hallmund bade him visit him when he came to the south country again, and Grettir promised him
      so to do; then he went west to Burgfirth, and thence to the Broadfirth Dales, and sought
      counsel of Thorstein Kuggson as to where he should now seek for protection, but Thorstein said
      that his foes were now so many that few would harbour him; "But thou mightest fare south to
      the Marshes and see what fate abides thee there."</p>
     <p>So in the autumn Grettir went south to the Marshes.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="58">
     <head>Grettir in Fairwood-fell</head>
     <p>IN those days dwelt at Holm Biorn the Hitdale-Champion, who was the son of Arngeir, the son
      of Berse the Godless, the son of Balk, who settled Ramfirth as is aforesaid; Biorn was a great
      chief and a hardy man, and would ever harbour outlawed men.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir came to Holm, and Biorn gave him good cheer, for there had been friendship
      between the earlier kin of both of them; so Grettir asked if he would give him harbourage; <pb
       n="171"/> but Biorn said that he had got to himself so many feuds through all the land that
      men would shun harbouring him so long as to be made outlaws therefor: "But some gain will I be
      to thee, if thou lettest those men dwell in peace who are under my ward, whatsoever thou dost
      by other men in the countryside."</p>
     <p>Grettir said yea thereto. Then said Biorn, "Well, I have thought over it, and in that
      mountain, which stretches forth outside of Hitriver, is a stead good for defence, and a good
      hiding-place withal, if it be cunningly dealt with; for there is a hollow through the
      mountain, that is seen from the way below; for the highway lies beneath it, but above is a
      slip of sand and stones so exceeding steep, that few men may come up there if one hardy man
      stand on his defence above in the lair. Now this seems to me the best rede for thee, and the
      one thing worth talking of for thine abode, because, withal, it is easy to go thence and get
      goods from the Marshes, and right away to the sea."</p>
     <p>Grettir said that he would trust in his foresight if he would give him any help. Then he
      went up to Fairwoodfell and made his abode there; he hung grey wadmal before the hole in the
      mountain, and from the way below it was like to behold as if one saw through. Now he was wont
      to ride for things needful through the country-side, and men deemed a woful guest had come
      among them whereas he went.</p>
     <p>Thord Kolbeinson dwelt at Hitness in those days, and a good skald he was; at that time was
      there great enmity betwixt him and Biorn; and Biorn was but half loth, though Grettir wrought
      some ill on Thord's men or his goods.</p>
     <p>Grettir was ever with Biorn, and they tried their skill in many sports, and it is shown in
      the story of Biorn that they were deemed equal in prowess, but it is the mind of most <pb
       n="172"/> that Grettir was the strongest man ever known in the land, since Orm the son of
      Storolf, and Thoralf the son of Skolm, left off their trials of strength. Grettir and Bjorn
      swam in one spell all down Hitriver, from the lake right away to the sea: they brought those
      Stepping-stones into the river that have never since been washed away either by floods, or the
      drift of ice, or glacier slips.</p>
     <p>So Grettir abode in Fairwood-fell for one winter, in such wise, that none set on him, though
      many lost their goods at his hands and could do nought therefor, for a good place for defence
      he had, and was ever good friend to those nighest to him.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="58">
     <head>Gisli's meeting with Grettir</head>
     <p>THERE was a man hight Gisli, the son of that Thorstein whom Snorri Godi had slain. Gisli was
      a big man and strong, a man showy in weapons and clothes, who made much of himself, and was
      somewhat of a self-praiser; he was a seafaring man, and came one summer out to Whiteriver,
      whenas Grettir had been a winter on the fell. Thord, son of Kolbein, rode to his ship, and
      Gisli gave him good welcome, and bade him take of his wares whatso he would; thereto Thord
      agreed, and then they fell to talk one with the other, and Gisli said:</p>
     <p>"Is that true which is told me, that ye have no counsel that avails to rid you of a certain
      outlaw who is doing you great ill?"</p>
     <p>Thord said, "We have not tried aught on him yet, but to many he seems a man hard to deal
      with, and that has been proven on many a man." <pb n="173"/> It is like, methinks, that ye
      should find Bjorn a heavy trouble, if ye may not drive away this man: luckless it is for you
      withal, that I shall be too far off this winter to better matters for you."</p>
     <p>"Thou wilt be better pleased to deal with him by hearsay."</p>
     <p>"Nay, no need to tell me of Grettir," said Gisli; "I have borne harder brunts when I was in
      warfare along with King Knut the Mighty, and west over the Sea, and I was ever thought to hold
      my own; and if I should have a chance at him I would trust myself and my weapons well
      enough."</p>
     <p>Thord said he would not work for nought if he prevailed against Grettir; "For there is more
      put upon his head than on the head of any other of wood-folk; six marks of silver it was; but
      last summer Thorir of Garth laid thereto yet three marks; and men deem he will have enough to
      do therefor whose lot it is to win it."</p>
     <p>"All things soever will men do for money," says Gisli, "and we chapmen not the least; but
      now shall we keep this talk hushed up, for mayhap he will be the warier," says he, "if he come
      to know that I am with you against him: now I am minded to abide this winter at Snowfellsness
      at Waveridge. Is his lair on my way at all? for he will not foresee this, nor shall I draw
      together many men against him."</p>
     <p>Thord liked the plot well, he rode home therewith and held his peace about this; but now
      things went according to the saw, <hi rend="ital">a listening ear in the holt is anear</hi>;
      men had been by at the talk betwixt Thord and Gisli, who were friends to Biorn of Hitdale, and
      they told him all from end to end; so when Biorn and Grettir met, Biorn showed forth <pb
       n="174"/> the whole matter to him, and said that now he might prove how he could meet a
      foe.</p>
     <p>"It would not be bad sport," said he, "if thou wert to handle him roughly, but to slay him
      not, if thou mightest do otherwise."</p>
     <p>Grettir smiled thereat, but spake little.</p>
     <p>Now at the folding time in the autumn Grettir went down to Flysia-wharf and got sheep for
      himself; he had laid hold on four wethers; but the bonders became ware of his ways and went
      after him; and these two things befell at the same time, that he got up under the fell-side,
      and that they came upon him, and would drive the sheep from him, yet bare they no weapon
      against him; they were six altogether, and stood thick in his path. Now the sheep troubled him
      and he waxed wroth, and caught up two of those men, and cast them down over the hill-side, so
      that they lay stunned; and when the others saw that, they came. on less eagerly; then Grettir
      took up the sheep and locked them together by the horns, and threw them over his shoulders,
      two on each side, and went up into his lair.</p>
     <p>So the bonders turned back, and deemed they had got but ill from him, and their lot misliked
      them now worse than before.</p>
     <p>Now Gisli abode at his ship through the autumn till it was rolled ashore. Many things made
      him abide there, so he was ready late, and rode away but a little before winter-nights. Then
      he went from the south, and guested under Raun on the south side of Hitriver. In the morning,
      before he rode thence, he began a talk with his fellows:</p>
     <p>"Now shall we ride in coloured clothes to-day, and let the outlaw see that we are not like
      other wayfarers who are drifted about here day by day." <pb n="175"/> So this they did, and
      they were three in all: but when they came west over the river, he spake again to them:</p>
     <p>"Here in these bents, I am told, lurks the outlaw, and no easy way is there up to him; but
      may it not perchance seem good to him to come and meet us and behold our array?"</p>
     <p>They said that it was ever his wont so to do. Now that morning Grettir had risen early in
      his lair; the weather was cold and frosty, and snow had fallen, but not much of it. He saw how
      three men rode from the south over Hitriver, and their state raiment glittered and their
      inlaid shields. Then it came into his mind who these should be, and he deems it would be good
      for him to get some rag of their array; and he was right wishful withal to meet such
      braggarts: so he catches up his weapons and runs down the slip-side. And when Gisli heard the
      clatter of the stones, he spake thus:</p>
     <p>"There goes a man down the hill-side, and somewhat big he is, and he is coming to meet us:
      now, therefore, let us go against him briskly, for here is good getting come to hand."</p>
     <p>His fellows said that this one would scarce run into their very hands, if be knew not his
      might; "And good it is that <hi rend="ital">he bewail who brought the woe</hi>."</p>
     <p>So they leapt off their horses, and therewith Grettir came up to them, and laid hands on a
      clothes-bag that Gisli had tied to his saddle behind him, and said--</p>
     <p>"This will I have, for oft I lowt for little things."</p>
     <p>Gisli answers, "Nay, it shall not be; dost thou know with whom thou hast to do?"</p>
     <p>Says Grettir, "I am not very clear about that; nor will I have much respect for persons,
      since I am lowly now, and ask for little." <pb n="176"/> "Mayhap thou thinkest it little,"
      says he, "but I had rather pay down thirty hundreds; but robbery and wrong are ever uppermost
      in thy mind methinks; so on him, good fellows, and let see what he may do."</p>
     <p>So did they, and Grettir gave back before them to a stone which stands by the way and is
      called Grettir's-Heave and thence defended himself; and Gisli egged on his fellows eagerly;
      but Grettir saw now that he was no such a hardy heart as he had made believe, for he was ever
      behind his fellows' backs; and withal he grew aweary of this fulling business, and swept round
      the short-sword, and smote one of Gisli's fellows to the death, and leaped down from the
      stone, and set on so fiercely, that Gisli shrank aback before him all along the hill-side:
      there Gisli's other fellow was slain, and then Grettir spake:</p>
     <p>"Little is it seen in thee that thou hast done well wide in the world, and in ill wise dost
      thou part from thy fellows."</p>
     <p>Gisli answers, "<hi rend="ital">Hottest is the fire that lies on oneself--with hell's-man
       are dealings ill</hi>."</p>
     <p>Then they gave and took but a little, before Gisli cast away his weapons, and took to his
      heels out along the mountain. Grettir gave him time to cast off whatso he would, and every
      time Gisli saw a chance for it he threw off somewhat of his clothes; and Grettir never
      followed him so close but that there was still some space betwixt them. Gisli ran right past
      that mountain and then across Coldriver-dale, and then through Aslaug's-lithe and above by
      Kolbeinstead, and then out into Burgh-lava; and by then was he in shirt and breech alone, and
      was now exceeding weary. Grettir still followed after him, and there was ever a stone's throw
      between them; and now he pulled up a great bush. But Gisli made no stay till he came out at
      Haf-firth-river, <pb n="177"/> and it was swollen with ice and ill to ford; Gisli made
      straightway for the river, but Grettir ran in on him and seized him, and then the strength of
      either was soon known: Grettir drave him down under him, and said,</p>
     <p>"Art thou that Gisli who would fain meet Grettir Asmundson?"</p>
     <p>Gisli answers, "I have found him now, in good sooth, nor do I know in what wise we shall
      part: keep that which thou hast got, and let me go free."</p>
     <p>Grettir said, "Nay, thou art scarce deft enow to learn what I have to teach thee, so needs
      must I give thee somewhat to remember it by."</p>
     <p>Therewith he pulls the shirt up over his head and let the twigs go all down his back, and
      along both sides of him, and Gisli strove all he might to wriggle away from him; but Grettir
      flogged him through and through, and then let him go; and Gisli thought he would learn no more
      of Grettir and have such another flogging withal; nor did he ever again earn the like
      skin-rubbing.</p>
     <p>But when he got his legs under him again, he ran off unto a great pool in the river, and
      swam it, and came by night to a farm called Horseholt, and utterly foredone he was by then.
      There he lay a week with his body all swollen, and then fared to his abode.</p>
     <p>Grettir turned back, and took up the things Gisli had cast down, and brought them to his
      place, nor from that time forth gat Gisli aught thereof.</p>
     <p>Many men thought Gisli had his due herein for the noise and swagger he had made about
      himself; and Grettir sang this about their dealings together--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"In fighting ring where steed meets steed,</l>
      <l>The sluggish brute of mongrel breed, </l>
      <pb n="178"/>
      <l>Certes will shrink back nothing less</l>
      <l>Before the stallion's dauntlessness,</l>
      <l>Than Gisli before me to-day;</l>
      <l>As, casting shame and clothes away,</l>
      <l>And sweating o'er the marsh with fear,</l>
      <l>He helped the wind from mouth and rear."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>The next spring Gisli got ready to go to his ship, and bade men above all things beware of
      carrying aught of their goods south along the mountain, and said that the very fiend dwelt
      there.</p>
     <p>Gisli rode south along the sea all the way to his ship, and never met Grettir again; and now
      he is out of the story.</p>
     <p>But things grew worse between Thord Kolbeinson and Grettir, and Thord set on foot many a
      plot to get Grettir driven away or slain.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="60">
     <head>Of the Fight at Hitriver</head>
     <p>WHEN Grettir had been two winters at Fairwoodfell, and the third was now come, he fared
      south to the Marshes, to the farm called Brook-bow, and had thence six wethers against the
      will of him who owned them, Then he went to Acres and took away two neat for slaughtering, and
      many sheep, and then went up south of Hitriver.</p>
     <p>But when the bonders were ware of his ways, they sent word to Thord at Hitness, and bade him
      take in hand the slaying of Grettir; but he hung back, yet for the prayers of men got his son
      Arnor, who was afterwards called Earls'-Skald, <pb n="179"/> to go with them, and bade them
      withal to take heed that Grettir escaped not.</p>
     <p>Then were men sent throughout all the country-side. There was a man called Biarni, who dwelt
      at Jorvi in Flysiawharf, and he gathered men together from without Hitriver; and their purpose
      was that a band should be on either bank of the river.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir had two men with him; a man called Eyolf, the son of the bonder at Fairwood, and
      a stout man; and another he had besides.</p>
     <p>First came up Thorarin of Acres and Thorfinn of Brookbow, and there were nigh twenty men in
      their company. Then was Grettir fain to make westward across the river, but therewith came up
      on the west side thereof Arnor and Biarni. A narrow ness ran into the water on the side
      whereas Grettir stood; so he drave the beasts into the-furthermost parts of the ness, when he
      saw the men coming up, for never would he give up what he had once laid his hands on.</p>
     <p>Now the Marsh-men straightway made ready for an onslaught, and made themselves very big;
      Grettir bade his fellows take heed that none came at his back; and not many men could come on
      at once.</p>
     <p>Now a hard fight there was betwixt them, Grettir smote with the short-sword with both hands,
      and no easy matter it was to get at him; some of the Marsh-men fell, and some were wounded;
      those on the other side of the river were slow in coming up, because the ford was not very
      near, nor did the fight go on long before they fell off; Thorarin of Acres was a very old man,
      so that he was not at this onslaught. But when this fight was over, then came up Thrand, son
      of Thorarin, and Thorgils Ingialdson, the brother's son of Thorarin, and Finnbogi, son of
      Thorgeir Thorhaddsen of Hitdale, and Steinulf Thorleifson from Lavadale; these <pb n="180"/>
      egged on their men eagerly to set on, and yet another fierce onslaught they made. Now Grettir
      saw that he must either flee or spare himself nought; and now he went forth so fiercely that
      none might withstand him; because they were so many that he saw not how he might escape, but
      that he did his best before he fell; he was fain withal that the life of such an one as he
      deemed of some worth might be paid for his life; so he ran at Steinulf of Lavadale, and smote
      him on the head and clave him down to the shoulders, and straightway with another blow smote
      Thorgils Ingialdson in the midst and well-nigh cut him asunder; then would Thrand run forth to
      revenge his kinsman, but Grettir smote him on the right thigh, so that the blow took off all
      the muscle, and straightway was he unmeet for fight; and thereafter withal a great wound
      Grettir gave to Finnbogi.</p>
     <p>Then Thorarin cried out and bade them fall back, "For the longer ye fight the worse ye will
      get of him, and he picks out men even as he willeth from your company."</p>
     <p>So did they, and turned away; and there had ten men fallen, and five were wounded to death,
      or crippled, but most of those who had been at that meeting had some hurt or other; Grettir
      was marvellously wearied and yet but a little wounded.</p>
     <p>And now the Marsh-men made off with great loss of men, for many stout fellows had fallen
      there.</p>
     <p>But those on the other side of the river fared slowly, and came not up till the meeting was
      all done; and when they saw how ill their men had fared, then Arnor would not risk himself,
      and much rebuke he got therefor from his father and many others; and men are minded to think
      that he was no man of prowess.</p>
     <p>Now that place where they fought is called Grettir's point to-day.</p>
    </div>

    <pb n="181"/>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="61">
     <head>How Grettir left Fairwoodfell, and of his abiding in Thorir's-dale</head>
     <p>BUT Grettir and his men took horse and rode up to the fell, for they were all wounded, and
      when they came to Fairwood there was Eyolf left; the farmer's daughter was out of doors, and
      asked for tidings; Grettir told all as clearly as might be, and sang a stave withal--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"O thou warder of horn's wave,</l>
      <l>Not on this side of the grave</l>
      <l>Will Steinulf s head be whole again;</l>
      <l>Many more there gat their bane;</l>
      <l>Little hope of Thorgils now</l>
      <l>After that bone-breaking blow;}</l>
      <l>Eight Gold-scatterers more they say,</l>
      <l>Dead along the river lay."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Thereafter Grettir went to his lair and sat there through the winter; but when he and Biorn
      met, Biorn said to him, that he deemed that much had been done; "and no peace thou wilt have
      here in the long run: now hast thou slain both kin and friends of mine, yet shall I not cast
      aside what I have promised thee whiles thou art here."</p>
     <p>Grettir said he must needs defend his hands and life, but ill it is if thou mislikest
      it."</p>
     <p>Biorn said that things must needs be as they were.</p>
     <p>A little after came men to Biorn who had lost kinsmen at Grettir's hands, and bade him not
      to suffer that riotous man to abide there longer in their despite; and Biorn said <pb n="182"
      /> that it should be as they would as soon as the winter was over.</p>
     <p>Now Thrand, the son of Thorarin of Acres, was healed; a stout man be was, and had to wife
      Steinun, daughter of Rut of Combeness; Thorleif of Lavadale, the father of Steinulf, was a
      very mighty man, and from him are come the men of Lavadale.</p>
     <p>Now nought more is told of the dealings of Grettir with the Marsh-men while he was on the
      mountain; Biorn still kept up his friendship with him, though his friends grew somewhat the
      fewer for that he let Grettir abide there, because men took it ill that their kin should fall
      unatoned.</p>
     <p>At the time of the Thing, Grettir departed from the Marsh-country, and went to Burg-firth
      and found Grim Thorhallson, and sought counsel of him, as to what to do now. Grim said he had
      no strength to keep him, therefore fared Grettir to find Hallmund his friend, and dwelt there
      that summer till it wore to its latter end.</p>
     <p>In the autumn Grettir went to Goatland, and waited there till bright weather came on; then
      he went up to Goatland Jokul, and made for the south-cast, and had with him a kettle, and
      tools to strike fire withal. But men deem that he went there by the counsel of Hallmund, for
      far and wide was the land known of him.</p>
     <p>So Grettir went on till he found a dale in the Jokul, long and somewhat narrow, locked up by
      Jokuls all about, in such wise that they overhung the dale. He came down somehow, and then he
      saw fair hill-sides grass-grown and set with bushes. Hot springs there were therein, and it
      seemed to him that it was by reason of earth-fires that the ice-cliffs did not close up over
      the vale.</p>
     <p>A little river ran along down the dale, with level shores on either side thereof. There the
      sun came but seldom, <pb n="183"/> but he deemed he might scarcely tell over the sheep that
      were in that valley, so many they were; and far better and fatter than any he had ever
      seen.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir abode there, and made himself a hut of such wood as he could come by. He took of
      the sheep for his meat, and there was more on one of them than on two elsewhere: one ewe there
      was, brown with a polled head, with her lamb, that he deemed the greatest beauty for her
      goodly growth. He was fain to take the lamb, and so he did, and thereafter slaughtered it:
      three stone of suet there was in it, but the whole carcase was even better. But when Brownhead
      missed her lamb, she went up on Grettir's hut every night, and bleated in suchwise that he
      might not sleep anight, so that it misliked him above all things that he had slaughtered the
      lamb, because of her troubling.</p>
     <p>But every evening at twilight he heard some one hoot up in the valley, and then all the
      sheep ran together to one fold every evening.</p>
     <p>So Grettir says, that a half-troll ruled over the valley, a giant hight Thorir, and in trust
      of his keeping did Grettir abide there; by him did Grettir name the valley, calling it
      Thorir's-dale. He said withal that Thorir had daughters, with whom he himself had good game,
      and that they took it well, for not many were the newcomers thereto; but when fasting time
      was, Grettir made this change therein, that fat and livers should be eaten in Lent.</p>
     <p>Now nought happed to be told of through the winter. At last Grettir found it so dreary
      there, that he might abide there no longer: then he gat him gone from the valley, and went
      south across the jokul, and came from the north, right against the midst of
      Shieldbroadfell.</p>
     <p>He raised up a flat stone and bored a hole therein, and said that whoso put his eye to the
      hole in that stone should <pb n="184"/> straightway behold the gulf of the pass that leads
      from Thorir's-vale.</p>
     <p>So he fared south through the land, and thence to the Eastfirths; and in this journey he was
      that summer long, and the winter, and met all the great men there, but somewhat ever thrust
      him aside that nowhere got he harbouring or abode; then he went back by the north, and dwelt
      at sundry places.</p>

     <head>Of the Death of Hallmund, Grettir's Friend</head>
     <p>A LITTLE after Grettir had gone from Ernewater heath, there came a man thither, Grim by
      name, the son of the widow at Kropp. He had slain the son of Eid Skeggison of the Ridge, and
      had been outlawed therefor; he abode whereas Grettir had dwelt afore, and got much fish from
      the water. Hallmund took it ill that he had come in Grettir's stead, and was minded that he
      should have little good hap how much fish soever he caught.</p>
     <p>So it chanced on a day that Grim had caught a hundred fish, and he bore them to his hut and
      hung them up outside, but the next morning when he came thereto they were all gone; that he
      deemed marvellous, and went to the water; and now he caught two hundred fish, went home and
      stored them up; and all went the same way, for they were all gone in the morning; and now he
      thought it hard to trace all to one spring. But the third day he caught three hundred fish,
      brought them home and watched over them from his shed, looking out through a hole in the door
      to see if aught might come anigh. Thus wore the night somewhat, <pb n="185"/> and when the
      third part of the night was gone by, he heard one going along outside with heavy footfalls;
      and when he was ware thereof, he took an axe that he had, the sharpest of weapons, for he was
      fain to know what this one was about; and he saw that the new-comer had a great basket on his
      back. Now he set it down, and peered about, and saw no man abroad; he gropes about to the
      fishes, and deems he has got a good handful, and into the basket he scoops them one and all;
      then is the basket full, but the fishes were so big that Grim, thought that no horse might
      bear more. Now he takes them up and puts himself under the load, and at that very point of
      time, when he was about to stand upright, Grim ran out, and with both hands smote at his neck,
      so that the axe sank into the shoulder; thereat he turned off sharp, and set off running with
      the basket south over the mountain.</p>
     <p>Grim turned off after him, and was fain to know if he had got enough. They went south all
      the way to Balljokul, and there this man went into a cave; a bright fire burnt in the cave,
      and thereby sat a woman, great of growth, but shapely withal. Grim heard how she welcomed her
      father, and called him Hallmund. He cast down his burden heavily, and groaned aloud; she asked
      him why he was all covered with blood, but he answered and sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Now know I aright,</l>
      <l>That in man's might,</l>
      <l>And in man s bliss,</l>
      <l>No trust there is;</l>
      <l>On the day of bale</l>
      <l>Shall all things fall;</l>
      <l>Courage is o'er,</l>
      <l>Luck mocks no more."</l>
     </lg>

     <pb n="186"/>
     <p>She asked him closely of their dealings, but he told her all even as it had befallen.</p>
     <p>"Now shalt thou hearken," said he, "for I shall tell of my deeds and sing a song thereon,
      and thou shalt cut it on a staff as I give it out."</p>
     <p>So she did, and he sung Hallmund's song withal, wherein is this--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"When I drew adown</l>
      <l>The bridle brown</l>
      <l>Grettir's hard hold,</l>
      <l>Men deemed me bold;</l>

     </lg>

     <p>Many other deeds of his did Hallmund sing in that song, for he had fared through all the
      land.</p>
     <p>Then spake his daughter, "A man of no slippery hand was that; nor was it unlike that this
      should hap, for in evil wise didst thou begin with him: and now what man will avenge
      thee?"</p>
     <p>Hallmund answered, "It is not so sure to know how that may be; but, methinks, I know that
      Grettir would avenge me if he might come thereto; but no easy matter will it be <pb n="188"/>
      to go against the luck of this man, for much greatness lies stored up for him."</p>
     <p>Thereafter so much did Hallmund's might wane as the song wore, that well-nigh at one while
      it befell that the song was done and Hallmund dead; then she grew very sad and wept right
      sore. Then came Grim forth and bade her be of better cheer, "<hi rend="ital">For all must fare
       when they are fetched</hi>. This has been brought about by his own deed, for I could scarce
      look on while he robbed me."</p>
     <p>She said he had much to say for it, "<hi rend="ital">For ill deed gains ill hap</hi>."</p>
     <p>Now as they talked she grew of better cheer, and Grim abode many nights in the cave, and got
      the song by heart, and things went smoothly betwixt them.</p>
     <p>Grim abode at Ernewaterheath all the winter after Hallmund's death, and thereafter came
      Thorkel Eyulfson to meet him on the Heath, and they fought together; but such was the end of
      their play that Grim might have his will of Thorkel's life, and slew him not. So Thorkel took
      him to him, and got him sent abroad and gave him many goods; and therein either was deemed to
      have done well to the other. Grim betook himself to seafaring, and a great tale is told of
      him.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="63">
     <head>How Grettir beguiled Thorir of Garth when he was nigh taking him</head>
     <p>NOW the story is to be taken up where Grettir came from the firths of the east-country; and
      now he fared with hidden-head for that he would not meet Thorir, and lay <pb n="189"/> out
      that summer on Madderdale-heath and in sundry places, and at whiles he was at Reekheath.</p>
     <p>Thorir heard that Grettir was at Reekheath, so he gathered men and rode to the heath, and
      was well minded that Grettir should not escape this time.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir was scarce aware of them before they were on him; he was just by a
      mountain-dairy that stood back a little from the wayside, and another man there was with him,
      and when he saw their band, speedy counsel must he take so he bade that they should fell the
      horses and drag them into the dairy shed, and so it was done.</p>
     <p>Then Thorir rode north over the heath by the dairy, and <hi rend="ital">missed friend from
       stead</hi>, for he found nought, and so turned back withal.</p>
     <p>But when his band had ridden away west, then said Grettir, "They will not deem their journey
      good if we be not found; so now shalt thou watch our horses while I go meet them, a fair play
      would be shown them if they knew me not."</p>
     <p>His fellow strove to let him herein, yet he went nonetheless, and did on him other attire,
      with a slouched hat over his face and a staff in his hand, then be went in the way before
      them. They greeted him and asked if he had seen any men riding over the heath.</p>
     <p>"Those men that ye seek have I seen; but little was wanting e'ennow but that ye found them,
      for there they were, on the south of yon bogs to the left."</p>
     <p>Now when they heard that, off they galloped out on to the bogs, but so great a mire was
      there that nohow could they get on, and had to drag their horses out, and were wallowing there
      the more part of the day; and. they gave to the devil withal the wandering churl who had so
      befooled them. <pb n="190"/> But Grettir turned back speedily to meet his fellow, and when
      they met he sang this stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Now make I no battle-field</l>
      <l>With the searching stems of shield.</l>
      <l>Rife with danger is my day,</l>
      <l>And alone I go my way:</l>
      <l>Nor shall I go meet, this tide,</l>
      <l>Odin's storm, but rather bide</l>
      <l>Whatso fate I next may have;</l>
      <l>Scarce, then, shalt thou deem me brave.</l>
     </lg>
     <lg>
      <l>Thence where Thorir's company</l>
      <l>Thronging ride, I needs must flee;</l>
      <l>If with them I raised the din,</l>
      <l>Little thereby should I win;</l>
      <l>Brave men's clashing swords I shun,</l>
      <l>Woods must hide the hunted one;</l>
      <l>For through all things, good and ill,</l>
      <l>Unto life shall I hold still."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Now they ride at their swiftest west over the heath and forth by the homestead at Garth,
      before ever Thorir came from the wilderness with his band; and when they drew nigh to the
      homestead a man fell in with them who knew them not.</p>
     <p>Then saw they how a woman, young and grand of attire, stood without, so Grettir asked who
      that woman would be. The new-comer said that she was Thorir's daughter. Then Grettir sang this
      stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"O wise sun of golden stall,</l>
      <l>When thy sire comes back to hall,</l>
      <l>Thou mayst tell him without sin</l>
      <l>This, though little lies therein, </l>
      <pb n="191"/>
      <l>That thou saw'st me ride hereby,</l>
      <l>With but two in company,</l>
      <l>Past the door of Skeggi's son,</l>
      <l>Nigh his hearth, O glittering one."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Hereby the new-comer thought be knew who this would be, and he rode to peopled parts and
      told how Grettir had ridden by.</p>
     <p>So when Thorir came home, many deemed that Grettir had done the bed well over their heads.
      But Thorir set spies on Grettir's ways, whereso he might be. Grettir fell on such rede that he
      sent his fellow to the west country with his horses; but he went up to the mountains and was
      in disguised attire, and fared about north there in the early winter, so that he was not
      known.</p>
     <p>But all men deemed that Thorir had got a worse part than before in their dealings
      together.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="64">
     <head>Of the ill haps at Sand-heaps, and how Guest came to the Goodwife there</head>
     <p>THERE was a priest called Stein, who dwelt at Isledale-river, in Bard-dale; he was good at
      husbandry and rich in beasts; his son was Kiartan, a brisk man and a well-grown. Thorstein the
      White was the name of him who dwelt at Sand-heaps, south of Isledale-river; his wife was
      called Steinvor, a young woman and merry-hearted, and children they had, who were young in
      those days. But that place men deemed much haunted by the goings of trolls. <pb n="192"/> Now
      it befell two winters before Grettir came into the north country that Steinvor the goodwife of
      Sand-heaps fared at Yule-tide to the stead of Isledale-river according to her wont, but the
      goodman abode at home. Men lay down to sleep in the evening, but in the night they heard a
      huge crashing about the bonder's bed; none durst arise and see thereto, for very few folk were
      there. In the morning the goodwife came home, but the goodman was gone, and none knew what had
      become of him.</p>
     <p>Now the next year wears through its seasons, but the winter after the goodwife would fain go
      to worship, and bade her house-carle abide behind at home; thereto was he loth, but said
      nathless that she must rule; so all went the same way and the house-carle vanished; and
      marvellous men deemed it; but folk saw certain stains of blood about the outer door; therefore
      they deemed it sure that an evil wight had taken them both.</p>
     <p>Now that was heard of wide through the country-side, and Grettir withal was told thereof; so
      he took his way to Bard-dale, and came to Sand-heaps at Yule-eve, and made stay there, and
      called himself Guest. The goodwife saw that he was marvellous great of growth, but the
      homefolk were exceeding afeard of him; he prayed for guesting there; the mistress said that
      there was meat ready for him, "but as to thy safety see to that thyself."</p>
     <p>He said that so he should do: "Here will I abide, but thou shalt go to worship if thou
      wilt."</p>
     <p>She answered, "Meseems thou art a brave man if thou durst abide at home here."</p>
     <p>"<hi rend="ital">For one thing alone will I not be known</hi>," said he.</p>
     <p>She said, "I have no will to abide at home, but I may not cross the river."</p>
     <p>"I will go with thee," says Guest. <pb n="193"/> Then she made her ready for worship, and
      her little daughter with her. It thawed fast abroad, and the river was in flood, and therein
      was the drift of ice great: then said the goodwife,</p>
     <p>"No way across is there either for man or horse."</p>
     <p>"Nay, there will be fords there," said Guest, "be not afeard."</p>
     <p>"Carry over the little maiden first," said the goodwife; "she is the lightest."</p>
     <p>"I am loth to make two journeys of it," said Guest, "I will bear thee in my arms."</p>
     <p>She crossed herself, and said, "This will not serve what wilt thou do with the maiden?"</p>
     <p>"A rede I see for that," said he, and therewith caught them both up, and laid the little one
      in her mother's lap, and set both of them thus on his left arm, but had his right free; and so
      he took the ford withal, nor durst they cry out, so afeard were they.</p>
     <p>Now the river took him up to his breast forthwith, and a great ice-floe drave against him,
      but he put forth the hand that was free and thrust it from him; then it grew so deep, that the
      stream broke over his shoulder; but he waded through it stoutly, till he came to the further
      shore, and there cast them a-land: then he turned back, and it was twilight already by then he
      came home to Sand-heaps, and called for his meat.</p>
     <p>So when he was fulfilled, he bade the home-folk go into the chamber; then he took boards and
      loose timber, and dragged it athwart the chamber, and made a great bar, so that none of the
      home-folk might come thereover: none durst say aught against him, nor would any of them make
      the least sound. The entrance was through the side-wall of the chamber by the gable-end, along
      which there was a <pb n="194"/> dais athwart the room; there Guest lay down, but did not put
      off his clothes, and light burned in the chamber over against the door: and thus Guest lay
      till far on in the night.</p>
     <p>The goodwife came to Isledale-river at church-time, and men marvelled how she had crossed
      the river; and she said she knew not whether a man or a troll had brought her over.</p>
     <p>The priest said he was surely a man, though a match for few; "But let us hold our peace
      hereon," he said; "maybe he is chosen for the bettering of thy troubles." So the goodwife was
      there through the night.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="65">
     <head>Of Guest and the Troll-wife</head>
     <p>NOW it is to be told of Guest, that when it drew towards midnight, he heard great din
      without, and thereafter into the hall came a huge troll-wife, with a trough in one hand and a
      chopper wondrous great in the other; she peered about when she came in, and saw where Guest
      lay, and ran at him; but he sprang up to meet her, and they fell a-wrestling terribly, and
      struggled together for long in the hall. She was the stronger, but he gave back with craft,
      and all that was before them was broken, yea, the cross-panelling withal of the chamber. She
      dragged him out through the door, and so into the outer doorway, and then he betook himself to
      struggling hard against her. She was fain to drag him from the house, but might not until they
      had broken away all the fittings of the outer door, and borne them out on their shoulders:
      then she laboured <pb n="195"/> away with him down towards the river, and right down to the
      deep gulfs.</p>
     <p>By then was Guest exceeding weary, yet must he either gather his might together, or be cast
      by her into the gulf. All night did they contend in such wise; never, he deemed, had he fought
      with such a horror for her strength's sake; she held him to her so hard that he might turn his
      arms to no account save to keep fast hold on the middle of the witch.</p>
     <p>But now when they came to the gulf of the river he gives the hag a swing round, and
      therewith got his right hand free, and swiftly seized the short-sword that he was girt withal,
      and smote the troll therewith on the shoulder, and struck off her arm; and therewithal was he
      free, but she fell into the gulf and was carried down the force.</p>
     <p>Then was Guest both stiff and weary, and lay there long on the rocks, then he went home, as
      it began to grow light, and lay down in bed, and all swollen and blue he was.</p>
     <p>But when the goodwife came from church, she thought her house had been somewhat roughly
      handled: so she went to Guest and asked what had happed that all was broken and down-trodden.
      He told her all as it had befallen: she deemed these things imported much, and asked him what
      man he was in good sooth. So he told her the truth, and prayed that the priest might be
      fetched, for that he would fain see him: and so it was done.</p>
     <p>But when Stein the priest came to Sand-heaps, he knew forthwith, that thither was come
      Grettir Asmundson under the name of Guest.</p>
     <p>So the priest asked what he deemed had become of those men who had vanished; and Grettir
      said that he thought they would have gone into the gulf: the priest said that he might not
      trow that, if no signs could be seen <pb n="196"/> thereof: then said Grettir that later on
      that should be known more thoroughly. So the priest went home.</p>
     <p>Grettir lay many nights a-bed, and the mistress did well to him, and so Yule-tide wore.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir's story is that the troll-wife cast herself into the gulf when she got her
      wound; but the men of Bard-dale say that day dawned on her, while they wrestled, and that she
      burst, when he cut the arm from her; and that there she stands yet on the cliff, a rock in the
      likeness of a woman.</p>
     <p>Now the dale-dwellers kept Grettir in hiding there; but in the winter after Yule, Grettir
      fared to Isledale-river, and when he met the priest, he said, "Well, priest, I see that thou
      hadst little faith in my tale; now will I, that thou go with me to the river, and see what
      likelihood there is of that tale being true."</p>
     <p>So the priest did; and when they came to the force-side, they saw a cave up under the cliff;
      a sheer rock that cliff was, so great that in no place might man come up thereby, and
      well-nigh fifty fathoms was it down to the water. Now they had a rope with them, but the
      priest said:</p>
     <p>"A risk beyond all measure, I deem it to go down here."</p>
     <p>"Nay," said Grettir, "it is to be done, truly, but men of the greatest prowess are meetest
      therefor: now will I know what is in the force, but thou shalt watch the rope."</p>
     <p>The priest bade him follow his own rede, and drave a peg down into the sward on the cliff,
      and heaped stones up over it, and sat thereby.</p>
    </div>

    <pb n="197"/>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="66">
     <head>Of the Dweller in the Cave under the Force</head>
     <p>NOW it is to be told of Grettir that he set a stone in a bight of the rope and let it sink
      down into the water.</p>
     <p>"In what wise hast thou mind to go?" said the priest.</p>
     <p>"I will not go bound into the force," said Grettir; "such things doth my heart
      forebode."</p>
     <p>With that he got ready for his journey, and was lightly clad, and girt with the short-sword,
      and had no weapon more. Then he leapt off the cliff into the force; the priest saw the soles
      of his feet, and knew not afterwards what was become of him. But Grettir dived under the
      force, and hard work it was, because the whirlpool was strong, and he had to dive down to the
      bottom, before he might come up under the force. But thereby was a rock jutting out, and
      thereon he gat; a great cave was under the force, and the river fell over it from the sheer
      rocks. He went up into the cave, and there was a great fire flaming from amidst of brands; and
      there he saw a giant sitting withal, marvellously great and dreadful to look on. But when
      Grettir came anigh, the giant leapt up and caught up a glaive and smote at the newcomer, for
      with that glaive might a man both cut and thrust; a wooden shaft it had, and that fashion of
      weapon men called then, heft-sax. Grettir hewed back against him with the short-sword, and
      smote the shaft so that he struck it asunder; then was the giant fain to stretch aback for a
      sword that hung up there in the cave; but therewithal. Grettir smote him afore into the
      breast, and smote off well-nigh all the breast-bone <pb n="198"/> and the belly, so that the
      bowels tumbled out of him and fell into the river, and were driven down along the stream; and
      as the priest sat by the rope, he saw certain fibres all covered with blood swept down the
      swirls of the stream; then he grew unsteady in his place, and thought for sure that Grettir
      was dead, so he ran from the holding of the rope and gat him home. Thither he came in the
      evening and said, as one who knew it well, that Grettir was dead, and that great scathe was it
      of such a man.</p>
     <p>Now of Grettir must it be told that he let little space go betwixt his blows or ever the
      giant was dead; then he went up the cave, and kindled a light and espied the cave. The story
      tells not how much he got therein, but men deem that it must have been something great. But
      there he abode on into the night; and he found there the bones of two men, and bore them
      together in a bag; then he made off from the cave and swain to the rope and shook it, and
      thought that the priest would be there yet; but when he knew that the priest had gone home,
      then must be draw himself up by strength of hand, and thus he came up out on to the cliff.</p>
     <p>Then he fared home to Isledale-river, and brought into the church-porch the bag with the
      bones, and therewithal a rune-staff whereon this song was marvellous well cut--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"There into gloomy gulf I passed,</l>
      <l>O'er which from the rock's threat it cast</l>
      <l>The swirling rush of waters wan,</l>
      <l>To meet the sword-player feared of man,</l>
      <l>By giant's hall the strong stream pressed</l>
      <l>Cold hands against the singer's breast;</l>
      <l>Huge weight upon him there did hurl</l>
      <l>The swallower of the changing whirl."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>And this other one withal--</p>
     <pb n="199"/>


     <lg>
      <l>"The dreadful dweller of the cave</l>
      <l>Great strokes and many 'gainst me drave</l>
      <l>Full hard he had to strive for it,</l>
      <l>But toiling long he wan no whit</l>
      <l>For from its mighty shaft of tree</l>
      <l>The heft-sax smote I speedily;</l>
      <l>And dulled the flashing war-flame fair</l>
      <l>In the black breast that met me there."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Herein was it said how that Grettir had brought those bones from the cave; but when the
      priest came to the church in the morning he found the staff and that which went with it, but
      Grettir was gone home to Sand-heaps.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="67">
     <head>Grettir driven from Sand-heaps to the West</head>
     <p>BUT when the priest met Grettir he asked him closely about what had happed; so he told him
      all the tale of his doings, and said withal that the priest had been unfaithful to him in the
      matter of the rope-holding; and the priest must needs say that so it was.</p>
     <p>Now men deemed they could see that these evil wights had wrought the loss of the men there
      in the dale; nor had folk hurt ever after from aught haunting the valley, and Grettir was
      thought to have done great deeds for the cleansing of the land. So the priest laid those bones
      in earth in the churchyard.</p>
     <p>But Grettir abode at Sand-heaps the winter long, and was hidden there from all the world.
       <pb n="200"/> But when Thorir of Garth heard certain rumours of Grettir being in Bard-dale,
      he sent men for his head; then men gave him counsel to get him gone therefrom, so he took his
      way to the west.</p>
     <p>Now when he came to Maddervales to Gudmund the Rich, he prayed Gudmund for watch and ward;
      but Gudmund said he might not well keep him. "But that only is good for thee," said he, "to
      set thee down there, whereas thou shouldst have no fear of thy life."</p>
     <p>Grettir said he wotted not where such a place might be.</p>
     <p>Gudmund said, "An isle there lies in Skagafirth called Drangey; so good a place for defence
      it is, that no man may come thereon unless ladders be set thereto. If thou mightest get there,
      I know for sure that no man who might come against thee, could have good hope while thou wert
      on the top thereof, of overcoming thee, either by weapons or craft, if so be thou shouldst
      watch the ladders well."</p>
     <p>"That shall be tried," said Grettir, "but so fearsome of the dark am I grown, that not even
      for the keeping of my life may I be alone."</p>
     <p>Gudmund said, "Well, that may be; but trust no man whatsoever so much as not to trust
      thyself better; for many men are hard to see through."</p>
     <p>Grettir thanked him for his wholesome redes, and then fared away from Maddervales, nor made
      stay before he came to Biarg; there his mother and Illugi his brother welcomed him joyfully,
      and he abode there certain nights.</p>
     <p>There he heard of the slaying of Thorstein Kuggson, which had befallen the autumn before
      Grettir went to Barddale; and he deemed therewithal that feeling went on fast enough.</p>
     <p>Then Grettir rode south to Holtbeacon-heath, and was minded to avenge Hallmund if he might
      meet Grim; but <pb n="201"/> when he came to Northriverdale, he heard that Grim had been gone
      two winters ago, as is aforesaid; but Grettir had heard so late of these tidings because he
      had gone about disguised those two winters, and the third winter he had been in Thorirsdale)
      and had seen no man who might tell him any news. Then he betook himself to the
      Broadfirth-dales, and dwelt in Eastriverdale, and lay in wait for folk who fared over
      Steep-brent; and once more he swept away with the strong hand the goods of the small bonders.
      This was about the height of summer-tide.</p>
     <p>Now when the summer was well worn, Steinvor of Sandheaps bore a man child, who was named
      Skeggi; he was first fathered on Kiartan, the son of Stein, the priest of Isledale-river.
      Skeggi was unlike unto his kin because of his strength and growth, but when he was fifteen
      winters old he was the strongest man in the north-country, and was then known as Grettir's
      son; men deemed he would be a marvel among men, but he died when he was seventeen years of
      age, and no tale there is of him.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="68">
     <head>How Thorod, the Son of Snorri Godi went against Grettir</head>
     <p>AFTER the slaying of Thorstein. Kuggson, Snorri Godi would have little to do with his son
      Thorod, or with Sam, the son of Bork the Fat; it is not said what they had done therefor,
      unless it might be that they had had no will to do some great deed that Snorri set them to;
      but withal Snorri drave his son Thorod away, and said he should not <pb n="202"/> come back
      till he had slain some wood-dweller; and so must matters stand.</p>
     <p>So Thorod went over to the Dales; and at that time dwelt at Broadlair-stead in Sokkolfsdale
      a widow called Geirlaug; a herdsman she kept, who had been outlawed for some onslaught; and he
      was a growing lad, Now Thorod Snorrison heard thereof, and rode in to Broadlair-stead, and
      asked where was the herdsman; the goodwife said that he was with the sheep.</p>
     <p>"What wilt thou have to do with him?"</p>
     <p>"His life will I have," says Thorod, "because he is an outlaw, and a wood-wight."</p>
     <p>She answers, "No glory is it for such a great warrior as thou deemest thyself, to slay a
      mannikin like that; I will show thee a greater deed, if thine heart is so great that thou must
      needs try thyself."</p>
     <p>"Well, and what deed?" says he.</p>
     <p>She answers, "Up in the fell here, lies Grettir Asmundson; play thou with him, for such a
      game is more meet for thee."</p>
     <p>Thorod took her talk well: "So shall it be," says he, and therewith he smote his horse with
      his spurs, and rode along the valley; and when he came to the hill below Eastriver, he saw
      where was a dun horse, with his saddle on, and thereby a big man armed, so be turned thence to
      meet him.</p>
     <p>Grettir greeted him, and asked who he was. Thorod named himself, and said,</p>
     <p>"Why asked thou not of my errand rather than of my name?"</p>
     <p>"Why, because," said Grettir, "it is like to be such as is of little weight: art thou son to
      Snorri Godi?"</p>
     <p>"Yea, yea," says Thorod; "but now shall we try which of us may do the most." <pb n="203"/>
      "A matter easy to be known," says Grettir; "hast thou not heard that I have ever been a
      treasure-hill that most men grope in with little luck?"</p>
     <p>"Yea, I know it," said Thorod; "yet must somewhat be risked."</p>
     <p>And now he drew his sword therewith and set on Grettir eagerly; but Grettir warded himself
      with his shield, but bore no weapon against Thorod; and so things went awhile, nor was Grettir
      wounded.</p>
     <p>At last he said, "Let us leave this play, for thou wilt not have victory in our strife."</p>
     <p>But Thorod went on dealing blows at his maddest. Now Grettir got aweary of dealing with him,
      and caught him and set him down by his side, and said--</p>
     <p>"I may do with thee even as I will, nor do I fear that thou wilt ever be my bane; but the
      grey old cattle, thy father, Snorri, I fear in good sooth, and his counsels that have brought
      most men to their knees: and for thee, thou shouldst turn thy mind to such things alone as
      thou mayst get done, nor is it child's play to fight with me."</p>
     <p>But when Thorod saw that he might bring nought to pass, he grew somewhat appeased, and
      therewithal they parted. Thorod rode home to Tongue and told his father of his dealings with
      Grettir. Snorri Godi smiled thereat, and said,</p>
     <p>"<hi rend="ital">Many a man lies hid within himself</hi>, and far unlike were your doings:
      for thou must needs rush at him to slay him, and he might have done with thee even as he
      would. Yet wisely has Grettir done herein, that he slew thee not; for I should scarce have had
      a mind to let thee lie unavenged; but now indeed shall I give him aid if I have aught to do
      with any of his matters."</p>
     <p>It was well seen of Snorri, that he deemed Grettir had <pb n="204"/> done well to Thorod,
      and he ever after gave his good word for Grettir.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="69">
     <head>How Grettir took leave of his Mother at Biarg, and fared with Illugi his Brother to
      Drangey</head>
     <p>GRETTIR rode north to Biarg a little after he parted with Thorod, and lay hid there yet
      awhile; then so great grew his fear in the dark, that he durst go nowhere as soon as dusk set
      in. His mother bade him abide there, but said withal, that she saw that it would scarce avail
      him aught, since he had so many cases against him throughout all the land. Grettir said that
      she should never have trouble brought on her for his sake.</p>
     <p>"But I shall no longer do so much for the keeping of my life," says he, "as to be
      alone."</p>
     <p>Now Illugi his brother was by that time about fifteen winters old, and the goodliest to look
      on of all men; and he overheard their talk together. Grettir was telling his mother what rede
      Gudmund the Rich had given him, and now that he should try, if he had a chance, to get out to
      Drangey, but he said withal, that he might not abide there, unless he might get some trusty
      man to be with him. Then said Illugi,</p>
     <p>"I will go with thee, brother, though I know not that I shall be of any help to thee, unless
      it be that I shall be ever true to thee, nor run from thee whiles thou standest up; and
      moreover I shall know more surely how thou farest if I am still in thy fellowship."</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "Such a man thou art, that I am <pb n="205"/> gladder in thee than in any
      other; and if it cross not my mother's mind, fain were I that thou shouldst fare with me."</p>
     <p>Then said Asdis, "Now can I see that it has come to this, that two troubles lie before us:
      for meseems I may ill spare Illugi, yet I know that so hard is thy lot, Grettir, that thou
      must in somewise find rede therefor; and howsoever it grieves me, O my sons, to see you both
      turn your backs on me, yet thus much will I do, if Grettir might thereby be somewhat more
      holpen than heretofore."</p>
     <p>Hereat was Illugi glad, for that he deemed it good to go with Grettir.</p>
     <p>So she gave them much of her chattels, and they made them ready for their journey. Asdis led
      them from out the garth, and before they parted she spake thus:</p>
     <p>"Ah, my sons twain, there ye depart from me, and one death ye shall have together; for no
      man may flee from that which is wrought for him: on no day now shall I see either of you once
      again; let one fate be over you both, then; for I know not what weal ye go to get for
      yourselves in Drangey, but there shall ye both lay your bones, and many will begrudge you that
      abiding place. Keep ye heedfully from wiles, yet none the less there shall ye be bitten of the
      edge of the sword, for marvellously have my dreams gone; be well ware of sorcery, for <hi
       rend="ital">little can cope with the cunning of eld</hi>."</p>
     <p>And when she had thus spoken she wept right sore.</p>
     <p>Then said Grettir, "Weep not, mother, for if we be set on with weapons, it shalt be said of
      thee, that thou hast had sons, and not daughters: live on, well and hale."</p>
     <p>Therewithal they parted. They fared north through the country side and saw their kin; and
      thus they lingered out the autumn into winter; then they turned toward Skagafirth and went
      north through Waterpass and thence to Reekpass, <pb n="206"/> and down Sæmunds-lithe and so
      unto Longholt, and came to Dinby late in the day.</p>
     <p>Grettir had cast his hood back on to his shoulders, for in that wise he went ever abroad
      whether the day were better or worse. So they went thence, and when they had gone but a little
      way, there met them a man, big-headed, tall, and gaunt, and ill clad; he greeted them, and
      either asked other for their names; they said who they were, but he called himself Thorbiorn;
      he was a land-louper, a man too lazy to work, and a great swaggerer, and much game and fooling
      was made with him by some folk: he thrust himself into their company, and told them much from
      the upper country about the folk there. Grettir had great game and merriment of him; so he
      asked if they had no need of a man who should work for them, "for I would fain fare with you,"
      says he; and withal he got so much from their talk that they suffered him to follow them.</p>
     <p>Much snow there was that day, and it was cold; but whereas that man swaggered exceedingly,
      and was the greatest of tomfools, he had a by-name, and was called Noise.</p>
     <p>"Great wonder had those of Dinby when thou wentest by e'en now unhooded, in a foul weather,"
      said Noise, "as to whether thou wouldst have as little fear of men as of the cold: there were
      two bonders' sons, both men of great strength, and the shepherd called them forth to go to the
      sheep-watching with him, and scarcely could they clothe themselves for the cold."</p>
     <p>Grettir said, "I saw within doors there a young man who pulled on his mittens, and another
      going betwixt byre and midden, and of neither of them should I be afeared."</p>
     <p>Thereafter they went down to Sorbness, and were there through the night; then they fared out
      along the strand to a <pb n="207"/> farm called Reeks, where dwelt a man, Thorvald by name, a
      good bonder. Him Grettir prayed for watch and ward, and told him how he was minded to get out
      to Drangey: the bonder said that those of Skagafirth would think him no god-send, and excused
      himself therewithal.</p>
     <p>Then Grettir took a purse his mother had given to him, and gave it to the bonder; his brows
      lightened over the money, and he got three house-carles of his to bring them out in the night
      time by the light of the moon. It is but a little way from Reeks out to the island, one
      sea-mile only. So when they came to the isle, Grettir deemed it good to behold, because it was
      grass-grown, and rose up sheer from the sea, so that no man might come up thereon save there
      where the ladders were let down, and if the uppermost ladder were drawn up, it was no man's
      deed to get upon the island. There also were the cliffs full of fowl in the summer-tide, and
      there were eighty sheep upon the island which the bonders owned, and they were mostly rams and
      ewes which they had mind to slaughter.</p>
     <p>There Grettir set himself down in peace; and by then had he been fifteen or sixteen winters
      in outlawry, as Sturla Thordson has said.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="70">
     <head>Of the Bonders who owned Drangey between them</head>
     <p>N the days when Grettir came to Drangey, these were chief men of the country side of
      Skagafirth.</p>
     <p>Hialti dwelt at Hof in Hialtidale, he was the son of Thord, the son of Hialti, the son of
      Thord the Scalp: Hialti was a great chief, a right noble man, and much <pb n="208"/>
      befriended. Thorbiorn Angle was the name of his brother, a big man and a strong, hardy and
      wild withal. Thord, the father of these twain, had married again in his old age, and that wife
      was not the mother of the brothers; and she did ill to her step-children, but served Thorbiorn
      the worst, for that he was hard to deal with and reckless. And on a day Thorbiorn Angle sat
      playing at tables, and his stepmother passed by and saw that he was playing at the knave-game,
      and the fashion of the game was the large tail-game. Now she deemed him thriftless, and cast
      some word at him, but he gave an evil answer; so she caught up one of the men, and drave the
      tail thereof into Thorbiorn's cheek-bone wherefrom it glanced into his eye, so that it hung
      out on his cheek. He sprang up, caught hold of her, and handled her roughly, insomuch that she
      took to her bed, and died thereof afterwards, and folk say that she was then big with
      child.</p>
     <p>Thereafter Thorbiorn became of all men the most riotous: he took his heritage, and dwelt at
      first in Woodwick.</p>
     <p>Haldor the son of Thorgeir, who was the son of Head-Thord, dwelt at Hof on Head-strand, he
      had to wife Thordis, the daughter of Thord Hialtison, and sister to those brothers Hialti and
      Thorbiorn Angle. Haldor was a great bonder, and rich in goods.</p>
     <p>Biorn was the name of a man who dwelt at Meadness in the Fleets; he was a friend to Haldor
      of Hof. These men held to each other in all cases.</p>
     <p>Tongue-Stein dwelt at Stonestead: he was the son of Biorn, the son of Ufeigh Thinbeard, son
      of that Crow-Hreidar to whom Eric of God-dales gave the tongue of land down from Hall-marsh.
      Stein was a man of great renown.</p>
     <p>One named Eric was the son of Holingang-Starri, the son of Eric of God-dales, the son of
      Hroald, the son of Geirmund Thick-beard; Eric dwelt at Hof in God-dales. <pb n="209"/> Now all
      these were men of great account.</p>
     <p>Two brothers there were who dwelt at a place called Broad-river in Flat-lithe, and they were
      both called Thord; they were wondrous strong, and yet withal peaceable men both of them.</p>
     <p>All these men had share in Drangey, and it is said that no less than twenty in all had some
      part in the island, nor would any sell his share to another; but the sons of Thord, Hialti and
      Thorbiorn Angle, had the largest share, because they were the richest men.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="71">
     <head>How those of Skagafirth found Grettir on Drangey</head>
     <p>NOW time wears on towards the winter solstice; then the bonders get ready to go fetch the
      fat beasts for slaughter from the island; so they manned a great barge, and every owner had
      one to go in his stead, and some two.</p>
     <p>But when these came anigh the island they saw men going about there; they deemed that
      strange, but guessed that men had been shipwrecked, and got aland there: so they row up to
      where the ladders were, when lo, the first-comers drew up the ladders.</p>
     <p>Then the bonders deemed that things were taking a strange turn, and hailed those men and
      asked them who they were: Grettir named himself and his fellows withal: but the bonders asked
      who had brought him there.</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "He who owned the keel and had the hands, and who was more my friend than
      yours."</p>
     <p>The bonders answered and said, "Let us now get our <pb n="210"/> sheep, but come thou aland
      with us, keeping freely whatso of our sheep thou hast slaughtered."</p>
     <p>"A good offer," said Grettir, "but this time let each keep what he has got; and I tell you,
      once for all, that hence I go not, till I am dragged away dead; for it is not my way to let
      that go loose which I have once laid hand on."</p>
     <p>Thereat the bonders held their peace, and deemed that a woeful guest had come to Drangey:
      then they gave him choice of many things, both moneys and fair words, but Grettir said nay to
      one and all, and they gat them gone with things in such a stead, and were ill content with
      their fate; and told the men of the country-side what a wolf had got on to the island.</p>
     <p>This took them all unawares, but they could think of nought to do herein; plentifully they
      talked over it that winter, but could see no rede whereby to get Grettir from the island.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="72">
     <head>Of the Sports at Heron-ness Thing</head>
     <p>NOW the days wore till such time as men went to the Heron-ness Thing in spring-tide, and
      many came thronging there from that part of the country, wherefrom men had to go to that Thing
      for their suits. Men sat there long time both over the suits and over sports, for there were
      many blithe men in that country-side. But when Grettir heard that all men fared to the Thing,
      he made a plot with his friends; for he was in goodwill with those who dwelt nighest to him,
      and for them he spared nought that he <pb n="211"/> could get. But now he said that he would
      go aland, and gather victuals, but that Illugi and Noise should stay behind. Illugi thought
      this ill counselled, but let things go as Grettir would.</p>
     <p>So Grettir bade them watch the ladders well, for that all things lay thereon; and thereafter
      he went to the mainland, and got what he deemed needful: he hid himself from men whereso he
      came, nor did any one know that he was on the land. Withal he heard concerning the Thing, that
      there was much sport there, and was fain to go thither; so he did on old gear and evil, and
      thus came to the Thing, whenas men went from the courts home to their booths. Then fell
      certain young men to talking how that the day was fair and good, and that it were well,
      belike, for the young men to betake them to wrestling and merrymaking. Folk said it was well
      counselled; and so men went and sat them down out from the booths.</p>
     <p>Now the sons of Thord, Hialti and Thorbiorn Angle, were the chief men in this sport;
      Thorbiorn Angle was boisterous beyond measure, and drove men hard and fast to the place of the
      sports, and every man must needs go whereas his will was; and he would take this man and that
      by the hands and drag him forth unto the playing-ground.</p>
     <p>Now first those wrestled who were weakest, and then each man in his turn, and therewith the
      game and glee waxed great; but when most men had wrestled but those who were the strongest,
      the bonders fell to talking as to who would be like to lay hand to either of the Thords, who
      have been aforenamed; but there was no man ready for that. Then the Thords went up to sundry
      men, and put themselves forward for wrestling, but <hi rend="ital">the nigher the call the
       further the man</hi>. Then Thorbiorn Angle looks about, and sees where a man sits, great of
      growth, and his face hidden <pb n="212"/> somewhat. Thorbiorn laid hold of him, and tugged
      hard at him, but he sat quiet and moved no whit. Then said Thorbiorn,</p>
     <p>"No one has kept his place before me to-day like thou hast; what man art thou?"</p>
     <p>He answers, "Guest am I hight."</p>
     <p>Said Thorbiorn, "Belike thou wilt do somewhat for our merriment; a wished-for guest wilt
      thou be."</p>
     <p>He answered, "About and about, methinks, will things change speedily; nor shall I cast
      myself into play with you here, where all is unknown to me."</p>
     <p>Then many men said he were worthy of good at their hands, if he, an unknown man, gave sport
      to the people. Then he asked what they would of him; so they prayed him to wrestle with some
      one.</p>
     <p>He said he had left wrestling, "though time agone it was somewhat of a sport to me."</p>
     <p>So, when he did not deny them utterly, they prayed him thereto yet the more.</p>
     <p>He said, "Well, if ye are so fain that I be dragged about here, ye must do so much therefor,
      as to handsel me peace, here at the Thing, and until such time as I come back to my home."</p>
     <p>Then they all sprang up and said that so they would do indeed; but Haft was the name of him
      who urged most that peace should be given to the man. This Hafr was the son of Thorarin, the
      son of Haft, the son of Thord Knob, who had settled land up from the Weir in the Fleets to
      Tongue-river, and who dwelt at Knobstead; and a wordy man was Hafr.</p>
     <p>So now he gave forth the handselling grandly with open mouth, and this is the beginning
      thereof.</p>

       betwixt all men and this same Guest who sits here, and so is named; that is to say, all men
       of rule, and goodly bonders, and all men young, and fit to bear arms, and all other men of

       for game, wrestling, and all glee, for abiding here, and going home, whether he has need to
       fare over water, or over land, or over ferry; safety shall he have, in all steads named and

       establish on behoof of us, and of our kin, friends, and men of affinity, women even as men,

       breaks the peace, or spills the troth settled; turned away and driven forth from God, and

       foreshore, ship or snow-shoes, earth or ice-mount, sea or swift steed, even as each found his

     <head>Of Grettir's Wrestling: and how Thorbiorn Angle now bought the more part of
      Drangey</head>
     <p>THEN many fell to saying that many and great words had been spoken hereon; but now Guest
      said,</p>
     <p>"Good is thy say and well hast thou spoken it; if ye spill not things hereafter, I shall not
      withhold that which I have to show forth."</p>
     <p>So he cast off his hood, and therewith all his outer clothes.</p>
     <p>Then they gazed one on the other, and awe spread over their faces, for they deemed they knew
      surely that this was Grettir Asmundson, for that he was unlike other men for his growth and
      prowess' sake: and all stood silent, but Hafr deemed he had made himself a fool. Now the men
      of the country-side fell into twos and twos together, and one upbraided <pb n="215"/> the
      other, but him the most of all, who had given forth the words of peace.</p>
     <p>Then said Grettir; "Make clear to me what ye have in your minds, because for no long time
      will I sit thus unclad; it is more your matter than mine, whether ye will hold the peace, or
      hold it not."</p>
     <p>They answered few words and then sat down: and now the sons of Thord, and Halldor their
      brother-in-law, talked the matter over together; and some would hold the peace, and some not;
      so as they elbowed one another, and laid their heads together, Grettir sang a stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"I, well known to men, have been</l>
      <l>On this morn both hid and seen;</l>
      <l>Double face my fortune wears,</l>
      <l>Evil now, now good it bears;</l>
      <l>Doubtful play-board have I shown</l>
      <l>Unto these men, who have grown</l>
      <l>Doubtful of their given word;</l>
      <l>Hafr's big noise goes overboard."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Then said Tongue-stein, "Thinkest thou that, Grettir? Knowest thou then what the chiefs will
      make their minds up to? but true it is thou art a man above all others for thy great heart's
      sake: yea, but dost thou not see how they rub their noses, one against the other?"</p>
     <p>Then Grettir sang a stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Raisers-up of roof of war,</l>
      <l>Nose to nose in counsel are</l>
      <l>Wakeners of the shield-rain sit</l>
      <l>Wagging beard to talk of it:</l>
      <l>Scatterers of the serpent's bed</l>
      <l>Round about lay head to head. </l>
      <pb n="216"/>
      <l>For belike they heard my name;</l>
      <l>And must balance peace and shame."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Then spake Hialti the son of Thord; "So shall it not be," says he; "we shall hold to our
      peace and troth given, though we have been beguiled, for I will not that men should have such
      a deed to follow after, if we depart from that peace, that we ourselves have settled and
      handselled: Grettir shall go whither he will, and have peace until such time as he comes back
      from this journey; and then and not till then shall this word of truce be void, whatsoever may
      befall betwixt us meanwhile."</p>
     <p>All thanked him therefor, and deemed that he had done as a great chief, such blood-guilt as
      there was on the other side: but the speech of Thorbiorn Angle was little and low
      thereupon.</p>
     <p>Now men said that both the Thords should lay hand to Grettir, and he bade them have it as
      they would: so one of the brothers stood forth; and Grettir stood up stiff before him, and he
      ran at Grettir at his briskest, but Grettir moved no whit from his place: then Grettir
      stretched out his band down Thord's back, over the head of him, and caught hold of him by the
      breeches, and tripped up his feet, and cast him backward over his head in such wise that he
      fell on his shoulder, and a mighty fall was that.</p>
     <p>Then men said that both those brothers should go against Grettir at once; and thus was it
      done, and great swinging and pulling about there was, now one side, now the other getting the
      best of it, though one or other of the brothers Grettir ever had under him; but each in turn
      must fall on his knee, or have some slip one of the other; and so hard they griped each at
      each, that they were all blue and bruised. <pb n="217"/> All men thought this the best of
      sport, and when they had made an end of it, thanked them for the wrestling; and it was the
      deeming of those who sat thereby, that the two brothers together were no stronger than Grettir
      alone, though each of them had the strength of two men of the strongest: so evenly matched
      they were withal, that neither might get the better of the other if they tried it between
      them.</p>
     <p>Grettir abode no longtime at the Thing; the bonders bade him give up the island, but he said
      nay to this, nor might they do aught herein.</p>
     <p>So Grettir fared back to Drangey, and Illugi was as fain of him as might be; and there they
      abode peacefully, and Grettir told them the story of his doings and his journeys; and thus the
      summer wore away.</p>
     <p>All men deemed that those of Skagafirth had shown great manliness herein, that they held to
      their peace given; and folk may well mark how trusty men were in those days, whereas Grettir
      had done such deeds against them.</p>
     <p>Now the less rich men of the bonders spake together, that there was little gain to them in
      holding small shares in Drangey; so they offered to sell their part to the sons of Thord;
      Hialti said that he would not deal with them herein, for the bonders made it part of the
      bargain, that he who bought of them should either slay Grettir or get him away. But Thorbiorn
      Angle said, that he would not spare to take the lead of an onset against Grettir if they would
      give him wealth therefor. So his brother Hialti gave up to him his share in the island, for
      that he was the hardest man, and the least befriended of the twain; and in likewise too did
      other bonders; so Thorbiorn Angle got the more part of the island for little worth, but bound
      himself withal to get Grettir away.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="75">
     <head>Thorbiorn Angle goes to Drangey to speak with Grettir</head>
     <p>WHENAS summer was far spent, Thorbiorn Angle went with a well-manned barge out to Drangey,
      and Grettir and his fellows stood forth on the cliff's edge; so there they talked together.
      Thorbiorn prayed Grettir to do so much for his word, as to depart from the island; Grettir
      said there was no hope of such an end.</p>
     <p>Then said Thorbiorn, "Belike I may give thee meet aid if thou dost this, for now have many
      bonders given up to me their shares in the island."</p>
     <p>Grettir answered, "Now hast thou shown forth that which brings me to settle in my mind that
      I will never go hence, whereas thou sayest that thou now hast the more part of the island; and
      good is it that we twain alone share the kale; for in sooth, hard I found it to have all the
      men of Skagafirth against me; but now let neither spare the other, for not such are we twain,
      as are like to be smothered in the friendship of men; and thou mayst leave coming hither, for
      on my side is all over and done."</p>
     <p>"<hi rend="ital">All things bide their day</hi>," said Thorbiorn, "and an ill day thou
      bidest."</p>
     <p>"I am content to risk it," said Grettir; and in such wise they parted, and Thorbiorn went
      home.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="76">
     <head>How Noise let the Fire out on Drangey, and how Grettir must needs go a land for
      more</head>
     <p>So the tale tells, that by then they had been two winters on Drangey, they had slaughtered
      well-nigh all the sheep that were there, but one ram, as men say, they let live; he was
      piebald of belly and head, and exceeding big-homed; great game they had of him, for he was so
      wise that he would stand waiting without, and run after them whereso they went; and he would
      come home to the hut a-nights and rub his horns against the door.</p>
     <p>Now they deemed it good to abide on the island, for food was plenty, because of the fowl and
      their eggs; but fire-wood was right hard to come by; and ever Grettir would let the thrall go
      watch for drift, and logs were often drifted there, and he would bear them to the fire; but no
      need had the brothers to do any work beyond climbing into the cliffs when it liked them. But
      the thrall took to loathing his work, and got more grumbling and heedless than he was wont
      heretofore: his part it was to watch the fire night by night, and Grettir gave him good
      warning thereon, for no boat they had with them.</p>
     <p>Now so it befell that on a certain night their fire went out; Grettir was wroth thereat, and
      said it was but his due if Noise were beaten for that deed; but the thrall said that his life
      was an evil life, if he must lie there in outlawry, and be shaken and beaten withal if aught
      went amiss.</p>
     <p>Grettir asked Illugi what rede there was for the matter, but he said he could see none, but
      that they should abide <pb n="220"/> there till some keel should be brought thither: Grettir
      said it was but blindness to hope for that. "Rather will I risk whether I may not come
      aland."</p>
     <p>"Much my mind misgives me thereof," said Illugi, "for we are all lost if thou comest to any
      ill."</p>
     <p>"I shall not be swallowed up swimming," said Grettir; "but henceforward I shall trust the
      thrall the worse for this, so much as lies hereon."</p>
     <p>Now the shortest way to the mainland from the island was a sea-mile long.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="77">
     <head>Grettir at the Home-stead of Reeks</head>
     <p>NOW Grettir got all ready for swimming, and had on a cowl of market-wadmal, and his breeches
      girt about him, and he got his fingers webbed together, and the weather was fair. So he went
      from the island late in the day, and desperate Illugi deemed his journey. Grettir made out
      into the bay, and the stream was with him, and a calm was over all. He swam on fast, and came
      aland at Reekness by then the sun had set: he went up to the homestead at Reeks, and into a
      bath that night, and then went into the chamber; it was very warm there, for there had been a
      fire therein that evening, and the heat was not yet out of the place; but he was exceeding
      weary, and there fell into a deep sleep, and so lay till far on into the next day.</p>
     <p>Now as the morning wore the home folk arose, and two women came into the chamber, a handmaid
      and the goodman's daughter. Grettir was asleep, and the bedclothes <pb n="221"/> had been cast
      off him on to the floor; so they saw that a man lay there, and knew him.</p>
     <p>Then said the handmaiden: "So may I thrive, sister! here is Grettir Asmundson lying bare,
      and I call him right well ribbed about the chest, but few might think he would be so small of
      growth below; and so then that does not go along with other kinds of bigness."</p>
     <p>The goodman's daughter answered: "Why wilt thou have everything on thy tongue's end? Thou
      art a measureless fool; be still."</p>
     <p>"Dear sister, how can I be still about it?" says the handmaid. "I would not have believed
      it, though one had told me."</p>
     <p>And now she would whiles run up to him and look, and whiles run back again to the goodman's
      daughter, screaming and laughing; but Grettir heard what she said, and as she ran in over the
      floor by him he caught hold of her, and sang this stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Stay a little, foolish one!</l>
      <l>When the shield-shower is all done,</l>
      <l>With the conquered carles and lords,</l>
      <l>Men bide not to measure swords:</l>
      <l>Many a man had there been glad,</l>
      <l>Lesser war-gear to have had.</l>
      <l>With a heart more void of fear;</l>
      <l>Such I am not, sweet and dear."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Therewithal he swept her up into the bed, but the bonder's daughter ran out of the place;
      then sang Grettir this other stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Sweet amender of the seam,</l>
      <l>Weak and worn thou dost me deem: </l>
      <pb n="222"/>
      <l>O light-handed dear delight,</l>
      <l>Certes thou must say aright.</l>
      <l>Weak I am, and certainly</l>
      <l>Long in white arms must I lie:</l>
      <l>Hast thou heart to leave me then,</l>
      <l>Fair-limbed gladdener of great men?"</l>
     </lg>

     <p>The handmaid shrieked out, but in such wise did they part that she laid no blame on Grettir
      when all was over.</p>
     <p>A little after, Grettir arose, and went to Thorvald the goodman, and told him of his
      trouble, and prayed bring him out; so did he, and lent him a boat, and brought him out, and
      Grettir thanked him well for his manliness.</p>
     <p>But when it was heard that Grettir had swam a sea-mile, all deemed his prowess both on sea
      and land to be marvellous.</p>
     <p>Those of Skagafirth had many words to say against Thorbiorn Angle, in that he drave not
      Grettir away from Drangey, and said they would take back each his own share; but he said he
      found the task no easy one, and prayed them be good to him, and abide awhile.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="78">
     <head>Of Hæring at Drangey, and the end of him</head>
     <p>THAT same summer a ship came to the Gangpassmouth, and therein was a man called Hæring--a
      young man he was, and so lithe that there was no cliff that he might not climb. He went to
      dwell with Thorbiorn Angle, and was there on into the autumn; and he was ever <pb n="223"/>
      urging Thorbiorn to go to Drangey, saying that he would fain see whether the cliffs were so
      high that none might come up them. Thorbiorn said that he should not work for nought if he got
      up unto the island, and slew Grettir, or gave him some wound; and withal he made it worth
      coveting to Hæring. So they fared to Drangey, and set the eastman ashore in a certain place,
      and he was to set on them unawares if he might come up on to the island, but they laid their
      keel by the ladders, and fell to talking with Grettir; and Thorbiorn asked him if he were
      minded now to leave the place; but he said that to nought was his mind so made up as to stay
      there.</p>
     <p>"A great game hast thou played with us," said Thorbiorn; "but thou seemest not much afeard
      for thyself."</p>
     <p>Thus a long while they gave and took in words, and came nowise together hereon.</p>
     <p>But of Hæring it is to be told that he climbed the cliffs, going on the right hand and the
      left, and got up by such a road as no man has gone by before or since; but when he came to the
      top of the cliff, he saw where the brothers stood, with their backs turned toward him, and
      thought in a little space to win both goods and great fame; nor were they at all aware of his
      ways, for they deemed that no man might come up, but there whereas the ladders were. Grettir
      was talking with Thorbiorn, nor lacked there words of the biggest on either side; but withal
      Illugi chanced to look aside, and saw a man drawing anigh them.</p>
     <p>Then he said, "Here comes a man at us, with axe raised aloft, and in right warlike wise he
      seems to fare."</p>
     <p>"Turn thou to meet him," says Grettir, "but I will watch the ladders."</p>
     <p>So Illugi turned to meet Hæring, and when the eastman saw him, he turned and fled here and
      there over the island. <pb n="224"/> Illugi chased him while the island lasted, but when he
      came forth on to the cliff's edge Hæring leapt down thence, and every bone in him was broken,
      and so ended his life; but the place where he was, lost has been called Hæring's-leap ever
      since.</p>
     <p>Illugi came back, and Grettir asked how he had parted from this one who had doomed them to
      die.</p>
     <p>"He would have nought to do," says Illugi, "with my seeing after his affairs, but must needs
      break his neck over the rock; so let the bonders pray for him as one dead."</p>
     <p>So when Angle heard that, he bade his folk make off. "Twice have I fared to meet Grettir,
      but no third time will I go, if I am nought the wiser first; and now belike they may sit in
      Drangey as for me; but in my mind it is, that Grettir will abide here but a lesser time than
      heretofore."</p>
     <p>With that they went home, and men deemed this journey of theirs worser than the first, and
      Grettir abode that winter in Drangey, nor in that season did he and Thorbiorn meet again.</p>
     <p>In those days died Skapti Thorodson the Lawman, and great scathe was that to Grettir, for he
      had promised to busy himself about his acquittal as soon as he had been twenty winters in
      outlawry, and this year, of which the tale was told e'en now, was the nineteenth year
      thereof.</p>
     <p>In the spring died Snorri the Godi, and many matters befell in that season that come not
      into this story.</p>

    <pb n="225"/>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="79">
     <head>Of the Talk at the Thing about Grettir's Outlawry</head>
     <p>THAT summer, at the Althing, the kin of Grettir spake many things concerning his outlawry,
      and some deemed he had outworn the years thereof, if he had come at all into the twentieth
      year; but they who had blood-suits against him would not have it so, and said, that he had
      done many an outlaws deed since he was first outlawed, and deemed his time ought to last
      longer therefor.</p>
     <p>At that time was a new lawman made, Stein, the son of Thorgest, the son of Stein the
      Far-sailing, the son of Thorir Autumn-mirk; the mother of Stein was Arnora, the daughter of
      Thord the Yeller; and Stein was a wise man.</p>
     <p>Now was he prayed for the word of decision; and he bade them search and see whether this
      were the twentieth summer since Grettir was made an outlaw, and thus it seemed to be.</p>
     <p>But then stood forth Thorir of Garth, and brought all into dispute again, for he found that
      Grettir had been one winter out here a sackless man, amidst the times of his outlawry, and
      then nineteen were the winters of his outlawry found to be. Then said the lawman that no one
      should be longer in outlawry than twenty winters in all, though be had done outlaw's deeds in
      that time.</p>
     <p>"But before that, I declare no man sackless."</p>
     <p>Now because of this was the acquittal delayed for this time, but it was thought a sure thing
      that he would be made sackless the next summer. But that misliked the Skagafirthers exceeding
      ill, if Grettir were to come out of his outlawry, <pb n="226"/> and they bade Thorbiorn Angle
      do one of two things, either give back the island or slay Grettir; but he deemed well that he
      had a work on his hands, for he saw no rede for the winning of Grettir, and yet was he fain to
      hold the island; and so all manner of craft he sought for the overcoming of Grettir, if he
      might prevail either by guile or hardihood, or in any wise soever.</p>

     <head>Thorbiorn Angle goes with his Foster-mother out to Drangey</head>
     <p>THORBIORN Angle had a foster-mother, Thurid by name, exceeding old, and meet for little, as
      folk deemed, very cunning she had been in many and great matters of lore, when she was young,
      and men were yet heathen; but men thought of her as of one, who had lost all that. But now,
      though Christ's law were established in the land, yet abode still many sparks of heathendom.
      It had been law in the land, that men were not forbidden to sacrifice secretly, or deal with
      other lore of eld, but it was lesser outlawry if such doings oozed out. Now in such wise it
      fared with many, that <hi rend="ital">hand for wont did yearn</hi>, and things grew handiest
      by time that had been learned in youth.</p>
     <p>So now, whenas Thorbiorn Angle was empty of all plots, he sought for help there, whereas
      most folk deemed it most unlike that help was--at the hands of his foster-mother, in sooth,
      and asked, what counsel was in her therefor.</p>
     <p>She answered, "Now belike matters have come to this, even as the saw says--<hi rend="ital"
       >To the goat-house for wool</hi>: but what could I do less than this, to think myself before
      folk of the <pb n="227"/> country-side, but be a man of nought, whenso anything came to be
      tried? nor see I how I may fare worse than thou, though I may scarce rise from my bed. But if
      thou art to have my rede, then shall I have my will as to how and what things are done."</p>
     <p>He gave his assent thereto, and said that she had long been of wholesome counsel to him.</p>
     <p>Now the time wore on to Twain-month of summer; and one fair-weather day the carline spake to
      Angle,</p>
     <p>"Now is the weather calm and bright, and I will now that thou fare to Drangey and pick a
      quarrel with Grettir; I shall go with thee, and watch how heedful he may be of his words; and
      if I see them, I shall have some sure token as to how far they are befriended of fortune, and
      then shall I speak over them such words as seem good to me."</p>
     <p>Angle answered, "Loth am I to be faring to Drangey, for ever am I of worser mind when I
      depart thence than when I come thereto."</p>
     <p>Then said the carline, "Nought will I do for thee if thou sufferest me to rule in no
      wise."</p>
     <p>"Nay, so shall it not be, foster-mother," said he; "but so much have I said, as that I would
      so come thither the third time that somewhat should be made of the matter betwixt us."</p>
     <p>"The chance of that must be taken," said the carline, "and many a heavy labour must thou
      have, or ever Grettir be laid to earth; and oft will it be doubtful to thee what fortune thine
      shall be, and heavy troubles wilt thou get therefrom when that is done; yet art thou so
      bounden hereunder, that to somewhat must thou make up thy mind."</p>
     <p>Thereafter Thorbiorn Angle let put forth a ten-oared boat, and he went thereon with eleven
      men, and the carline was in their company. <pb n="228"/> So they fell to rowing as the weather
      went, out to Drangey; and when the brothers saw that, they stood forth at the ladders, and
      they began to talk the matter over yet once more; and Thorbiorn said, that he was come yet
      again, to talk anew of their leaving the island, and that he would deal lightly with his loss
      of money and Grettir's dwelling there, if so be they might part without harm. But Grettir said
      that he had no words to make atwixt and atween of his going thence.</p>
     <p>"Oft have I so said," says he, "and no need there is for thee to talk to me thereon; ye must
      even do as ye will, but here will I abide, whatso may come to hand."</p>
     <p>Now Thorbiorn deemed, that this time also his errand was come to nought, and he said,</p>
     <p>"Yea, I deemed I knew with what men of hell I had to do; and most like it is that a day or
      two will pass away ere I come hither again."</p>
     <p>"I account that not in the number of my griefs, though thou never comest back," said
      Grettir.</p>
     <p>Now the carline lay in the stern, with clothes heaped up about and over her, and with that
      she moved, and said,</p>
     <p>"Brave will these men be, and luckless withal; far hast thou outdone them in manliness; thou
      biddest them choice of many goodly things, but they say nay to all, and few things lead surer
      to ill, than not to know how to take good, Now this I cast over thee, Grettir, that thou be
      left of all health, wealth, and good-hap, all good heed and wisdom: yea, and that the more,
      the longer thou livest; good hope I have, Grettir, that thy days of gladness shall be fewer
      here in time to come than in the time gone by."</p>
     <p>Now when Grettir heard these words, he was astonied withal, and said,</p>
     <p>"What fiend is there in the boat with them? <pb n="229"/> Illugi answers, "I deem that it
      will be the carline, Thorbiorn's foster-mother."</p>
     <p>"Curses on the witch-wight!" says Grettir, "nought worse could have been looked for; at no
      worse have I shuddered like as I shuddered at those words she spake; and well I wot that from
      her, and her foul cunning, some evil will be brought on us; yet shall she have some token to
      mind her that she has sought us here."</p>
     <p>Therewithal he caught up a marvellous great stone, and cast it down on to the boat, and it
      smote that clothes-heap; and a longer stone-throw was that than Thorbiorn deemed any man might
      make; but therewithal a great shriek arose, for the stone had smitten the carline's thigh, and
      broken it.</p>
     <p>Then said Illugi, "I would thou hadst not done that!"</p>
     <p>"Blame me not therefor," said Grettir, "I fear me the stroke has been too little, for certes
      not over-much weregild were paid for the twain of us, though the price should be one carline's
      life."</p>
     <p>"Must she alone be paid?" said Illugi, "little enough then will be laid down for us
      twain."</p>
     <p>Now Thorbiorn got him gone homeward, with no greetings at parting. But he said to the
      carline,</p>
     <p>"Now have matters gone as I thought, that a journey of little glory thou shouldst make to
      the island; thou hast got maimed, and honour is no nigher to us than before, yea, we must have
      bootless shame on bootless shame."</p>
     <p>She answered, "This will be the springing of ill-hap to them; and I deem that henceforth
      they are on the wane; neither do I fear if I live, but that I shall have revenge for this deed
      they have thus done me."</p>
     <p>"Stiff is thine heart, meseems, foster-mother," said Thorbiorn. With that they came home,
      but the carline was laid <pb n="230"/> in her bed, and abode there nigh a month; by then was
      the hurt thigh-bone grown together again, and she began to be afoot once more.</p>
     <p>Great laughter men made at that journey of Thorbiorn and the carline, and deemed he had been
      often enow outplayed in his dealings with Grettir: first, at the Spring-Thing in the peace
      handselling; next, when Hæring was lost; and now again, this third time, when the carline's
      thigh-bone was broken, and no stroke had been played against these from his part. But great
      shame and grief had Thorbiorn Angle from all these words.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="81">
     <head>Of the Carline's evil Gift to Grettir</head>
     <p>NOW wore away the time of autumn till it wanted but three weeks of winter; then the carline
      bade bear her to the sea-shore. Thorbiorn asked what she would there.</p>
     <p>"Little is my errand, yet maybe," she says, "it is a foreboding of greater tidings."</p>
     <p>Now was it done as she bade, and when she came down to the strand, she went limping along by
      the sea, as if she were led thereto, unto a place where lay before her an uprooted tree, as
      big as a man might bear on his shoulder. She looked at the tree and bade them turn it over
      before her eyes, and on one side it was as if singed and rubbed; so there whereas it was
      rubbed she let cut a little flat space; and then she took her knife and cut runes on the root,
      and made them red with her blood, and sang witch-words over <pb n="231"/> them; then she went
      backwards and widdershins round about the tree, and cast over it many a strong spell;
      thereafter she let thrust the tree forth into the sea, and spake in such wise over it, that it
      should drive out to Drangey, and that Grettir should have all hurt therefrom that might be.
      Thereafter she went back home to Woodwick; and Thorbiorn said that he knew not if that would
      come to aught; but the carline answered that he should wot better anon.</p>
     <p>Now the wind blew landward up the firth, yet the carline's root went in the teeth of the
      wind, and belike it sailed swifter than might have been looked for of it.</p>
     <p>Grettir abode in Drangey with his fellows as is aforesaid, and in good case they were; but
      the day after the carline had wrought her witch-craft on the tree the brothers went down below
      the cliffs searching for firewood, so when they came to the west of the island, there they
      found that tree</p>
     <p>drifted ashore.</p>
     <p>Then said Illugi, "A big log of firewood, kinsman, let us bear it home."</p>
     <p>Grettir kicked it with his foot and said, "An evil tree from evil sent; other firewood than
      this shall we have."</p>
     <p>Therewithal he cast it out into the sea, and bade Illugi beware of bearing it home, "For it
      is sent us for our ill-hap." And therewith they went unto their abode, and said nought about
      it to the thrall. But the next day they found the tree again, and it was nigher to the ladders
      than heretofore, Grettir drave it out to sea, and said that it should never be borne home.</p>
     <p>Now the days wore on into summer, and a gale came on with much wet, and the brothers were
      loth to be abroad, and bade Noise go search for firewood.</p>
     <p>He took it ill, and said he was ill served in that he had to drudge and labour abroad in all
      the foulest weather; but <pb n="232"/> withal he went down to the beach before the ladders and
      found the carline's tree there, and deemed things had gone well because of it; so he took it
      up and bore it to the hut, and cast it down thereby with a mighty thump.</p>
     <p>Grettir heard it and said, "Noise has got something, so I shall go out and see what it
      is."</p>
     <p>Therewithal. he took up a wood-axe, and went out, and straightway Noise said, "Split it up
      in as good wise as I have brought it home, then."</p>
     <p>Grettir grew short of temper with the thrall, and smote the axe with both hands at the log,
      nor heeded what tree it was; but as soon as ever the axe touched the wood, it turned flatlings
      and glanced off therefrom into Grettir's right leg above the knee, in such wise that it stood
      in the bone, and a great wound was that. Then he looked at the tree and said,</p>
     <p>"Now has evil heart prevailed, nor will this hap go alone, since that same tree has now come
      back to us that I have cast out to sea on these two days. But for thee, Noise, two slips hast
      thou had, first, when thou must needs let the fire be slaked, and now this bearing home of
      that tree of ill-hap; but if a third thou hast, thy bane will it be, and the bane of us
      all."</p>
     <p>With that came Illugi and bound up Grettir's hurt, and it bled little, and Grettir slept
      well that night; and so three nights slipped by in such wise that no pain came of the wound,
      and when they loosed the swathings, the lips of the wound were come together so that it was
      well-nigh grown over again. Then said Illugi,</p>
     <p>"Belike thou wilt have no long hurt of this wound."</p>
     <p>"Well were it then," said Grettir, "but marvellously has this befallen, whatso may come of
      it; and my mind misgives me of the way things will take."</p>

     <head>Grettir sings of his Great Deeds</head>
     <p>NOW they lay them down that evening, but at midnight Grettir began to tumble about
      exceedingly. Illugi asked why he was so unquiet. Grettir said that his leg had taken to
      paining him, "And methinks it is like that some change of hue there be therein."</p>
     <p>Then they kindled a light, and when the swathings were undone, the leg showed all swollen
      and coal-blue, and the wound had broken open, and was far more evil of aspect than at first;
      much pain there went therewith so that he might not abide at rest in any wise, and never came
      sleep on his eyes.</p>
     <p>Then spake Grettir, "Let us make up our minds to it, that this sickness which I have gotten
      is not done for nought, for it is of sorcery, and the carline is minded to avenge her of that

     <p>"Now must we take good heed to ourselves," said Grettir, "for Thorbiorn Angle must be minded
      that this hap shall not go alone; and I will, Noise, that thou watch the ladders every day
      from this time forth, but pull them up in the evening, and see thou do it well and truly, even
      as though much lay thereon, but if thou bewrayest us, short will be thy road to ill."</p>
     <p>So Noise promised great things concerning this. Now the weather grew harder, and a
      north-east wind came on with great cold: every night Grettir asked if the ladders were drawn
      up.</p>
     <p>Then said Noise, "Yea, certainly! men are above all things to be looked for now. Can any man
      have such a mind to take thy life, that he will do so much as to slay himself therefor? for
      this gale is far other than fair; lo now, methinks thy so great bravery and hardihood has come
      utterly to an end, if thou must needs think that all things soever will be thy bane."</p>
     <p>"Worse wilt thou bear thyself than either of us," said Grettir, "when the need is on us; but
      now go watch the ladders, whatsoever will thou hast thereto."</p>
     <p>So every morning they drave him out, and ill he bore it.</p>
     <p>But Grettir's hurt waxed in such wise that all the leg swelled up, and the thigh began to
      gather matter both above and below, and the lips of-the wound were all turned out, so that
      Grettir's death was looked for. <pb n="236"/> Illugi sat over him night and day, and took heed
      to nought else, and by then it was the second week since Grettir hurt himself.</p>
    </div>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="83">
     <head>How Thorbiorn Angle gathered Force and set Sail for Drangey</head>
     <p>THORBIORN Angle sat this while at home at Woodwick, and was ill content in that he might not
      win Grettir; but when a certain space had passed since the carline had put the sorcery into
      the root, she comes to talk with Thorbiorn, and asks if he were not minded to go see Grettir.
      He answers, that to nought was his mind so made up as that he would not go; "perchance thou
      wilt go meet him, foster-mother," says Thorbiorn.</p>
     <p>"Nay, I shall not go meet him," says the carline; "but I have sent my greeting to him, and
      some hope I have that it has come home to him; and good it seems to me that thou go speedily
      to meet him, or else shalt thou never have such good hap as to overcome him."</p>
     <p>Thorbiorn answered: "So many shameful journeys have I made thither, that there I go not ever
      again; moreover that alone is full enough to stay me, that such foul weather it is, that it is
      safe to go nowhither, whatso the need may be."</p>
     <p>She answered: "Ill counselled thou art, not to see how to overcome herein. Now yet once
      again will I lay down a rede for, this; go thou first and get thee strength of men, and ride
      to Hof to Halldor thy brother-in-law, and take counsel of him. But if I may rule in some way
      how <pb n="237"/> Grettir's health goes, how shall it be said that it is past hope that I may
      also deal with the gale that has been veering about this while?"</p>
     <p>Thorbiorn deemed it might well be that the carline saw further than he had thought she
      might, and straightway sent up into the country-side for men; but speedy answer there came
      that none of those who had given up their shares would do aught to ease his task, and they
      said that Thorbiorn should have to himself both the owning of the island and the onset on
      Grettir. But Tongue-Stein gave him two of his followers, and Hialti, his brother, sent him
      three men, and Eric of God-dales one, and from his own homestead he had six. So the twelve of
      them ride from Woodwick out to Hof. Halldor bade them abide there, and asked their errand;
      then Thorbiorn told it as clearly as might be. Halldor asked whose rede this might be, and
      Thorbiorn said that his foster-mother urged him much thereto.</p>
     <p>"That will bear no good," said Halldor, "because she is cunning in sorcery, and such-like
      things are now forbidden."</p>
     <p>"I may not look closely into all these matters beforehand," said Thorbiorn, "but in somewise
      or other shall this thing have an end if I may have my will. Now, how shall I go about it, so
      that I may come to the island?'</p>
     <p>"Meseems," says Halldor, "that thou trustest in somewhat, though I wot not how good that may
      be. But now if thou wilt go forward with it, go thou out to Meadness in the Fleets to Biorn my
      friend; a good keel he has, so tell him of my word, that I would he should lend you the craft,
      and thence ye may sail out to Drangey. But the end of your journey I see not, if Grettir is
      sound and hale: yea, and be thou sure that if ye win him not in manly wise, he leaves enough
      of folk behind to take up the blood-suit <pb n="238"/> after him. And slay not Illugi if ye
      may do otherwise. But methinks I see that all is not according to Christ's law in these
      redes."</p>
     <p>Then Halldor gave them six men withal for their journey; one was called Karr, another
      Thorleif, and a third Brand, but the rest are not named.</p>
     <p>So they fared thence, eighteen in company, out to the Fleets, and came to Meadness and gave
      Biorn Halldor's message, he said that it was but due for Halldor's sake, but that he owed
      nought to Thorbiorn; withal it seemed to him that they went on a mad journey, and he let them
      from it all he might.</p>
     <p>They said they might not turn back, and so went down to the sea, and put forth the craft,
      and all its gear was in the boat-stand hard by; so they made them ready for sailing, and foul
      enow the weather seemed to all who stood on land. But they hoisted sail, and the craft shot
      swiftly far into the firth, but when they came out into the main part thereof into deep water,
      the wind abated in such wise that they deemed it blew none too hard.</p>
     <p>So in the evening at dusk they came to Drangey.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="84">
     <head>The Slaying of Grettir Asmundson</head>
     <p>NOW it is to be told, that Grettir was so sick, that he might not stand on his feet, but
      Illugi sat beside him, and Noise was to keep watch and ward; and many words he had against
      that, and said that they would still think that life was falling from them, though nought had
       <pb n="239"/> happed to bring it about; so he went out from their abode right unwillingly,
      and when he came to the ladders he spake to himself and said that now he would not draw them
      up; withal he grew exceeding sleepy, and lay down and slept all day long, and right on till
      Thorbiorn came to the island.</p>
     <p>So now they see that the ladders are not drawn up; then spake Thorbiorn, "Now are things
      changed from what the wont was, in that there are none afoot, and their ladder stands in its
      place withal; maybe more things will betide in this our journey than we had thought of in the
      beginning: but now let us hasten to the hut, and let no man lack courage; for, wot this well,
      that if these men are hale, each one of us must needs do his best."</p>
     <p>Then they went up on to the island, and looked round about, and saw where a man lay a little
      space off the landing-place, and snored hard and fast. Therewith Thorbiorn knew Noise, and
      went up to him and drave the hilt of his sword against the ear of him, and bade him, "Wake up,
      beast! certes in evil stead is he who trusts his life to thy faith and troth."</p>
     <p>Noise looked up thereat and said, "Ah! now are they minded to go on according to their wont;
      do ye, may-happen, think my freedom too great, though I lie out here in the cold?"</p>
     <p>"Art thou witless," said Angle, "that thou seest not that thy foes are come upon thee, and
      will slay you all?"</p>
     <p>Then Noise answered nought, but yelled out all he might, when he knew the men who they
      were.</p>
     <p>Do one thing or other," says Angle, "either hold thy peace forthwith, and tell us of your
      abode, or else be slain of us."</p>
     <p>Thereat was Noise as silent as if he had been thrust <pb n="240"/> under water; but
      Thorbiorn said, "Are they at their hut, those brothers? Why are they not afoot?"</p>
     <p>"Scarce might that be," said Noise, "for Grettir is sick and come nigh to his death, and
      Illugi sits over him."</p>
     <p>Then Angle asked how it was with their health, and what things had befallen. So Noise told
      him in what wise Grettir's hurt had come about.</p>
     <p>Then Angle laughed and said, "Yea, sooth is the old saw, <hi rend="ital">Old friends are the
       last to sever</hi>; and this withal, <hi rend="ital">Ill if a thrall is thine only
       friend</hi>, whereso thou art, Noise; for shamefully hast thou bewrayed thy master, albeit be
      was nought good."</p>
     <p>Then many laid evil things to his charge for his ill faith, and beat him till he was
      well-nigh past booting for, and let him lie there; but they went up to the hut and smote
      mightily on the door.</p>
     <p>"Pied-belly<note place="foot">'Pied-belly,' the name of the tame ram told of before.</note>
      is knocking hard at the door, brother," says Illugi.</p>
     <p>"Yea, yea, hard, and over hard," says Grettir; and therewithal the door brake asunder.</p>
     <p>Then sprang Illugi to his weapons and guarded the door, in such wise that there was no
      getting in for them. Long time they set on him there, and could bring nought against him save
      spear-thrusts, and still Illugi smote all the spearheads from the shafts. But when they saw
      that they might thus bring nought to pass, they leapt up on to the roof of the hut, and tore
      off the thatch; then Grettir got to his feet and caught up a spear, and thrust out betwixt the
      rafters; but before that stroke was Karr, a home-man of Halldor of Hof, and forthwithal it
      pierced him through.</p>
     <p>Then spoke Angle, and bade men fare warily and guard <pb n="241"/> themselves well, "for we
      may prevail against them if we follow wary redes."</p>
     <p>So they tore away the thatch from the ends of the ridge-beam, and bore on the beam till it
      brake asunder.</p>
     <p>Now Grettir might not rise from his knee, but he caught up the short-sword, Karr's-loom, and
      even therewith down leapt those men in betwixt the walls, and a hard fray befell betwixt them.
      Grettir smote with the short-sword at Vikar, one of the followers of Hialti Thordson, and
      caught him on the left shoulder, even as he leapt in betwixt the walls, and cleft him athwart
      the shoulder down unto the right side, so that the man fell asunder, and the body so smitten
      atwain tumbled over on to Grettir, and for that cause he might not heave aloft the short-sword
      as speedily as he would, and therewith Thorbiorn Angle thrust him betwixt the shoulders, and
      great was that wound he gave.</p>
     <p>Then cried Grettir, "<hi rend="ital">Bare is the back of the brotherless</hi>." And Illugi
      threw his shield over Grettir, and warded him in so stout a wise that all men praised his
      defence.</p>
     <p>Then said Grettir to Angle, "Who then showed thee the way here to the island?"</p>
     <p>Said Angle, "The Lord Christ showed it us."</p>
     <p>"Nay," said Grettir, "but I guess that the accursed hag, thy foster-mother, showed it thee,
      for in her redes must thou needs have trusted."</p>
     <p>"All shall be one to thee now," said Angle, "in whomsoever I have put my trust."</p>
     <p>Then they set on them fiercely, and Illugi made defence for both in most manly wise; but
      Grettir was utterly unmeet for fight, both for his wounds' sake and for his sickness. So Angle
      bade bear down Illugi with shields, "For never have I met his like, amongst men of such
      age."</p>
     <p>Now thus they did, besetting him with beams and weapons <pb n="242"/> till he might ward
      himself no longer; and then they laid hands on him, and so held him fast. But he had given
      some wound or other to the more part of those who had been at the onset, and had slain
      outright three of Angle's fellows.</p>
     <p>Thereafter they went up to Grettir, but he was fallen forward on to his face, and no defence
      there was of him, for that he was already come to death's door by reason of the hurt in his
      leg, for all the thigh was one sore, even up to the small guts; but there they gave him many a
      wound, yet little or nought he bled. </p>
     <p>So when they thought he was dead, Angle laid hold of the short-sword, and said that he had
      carried it long enough; but Grettir's fingers yet kept fast hold of the grip thereof, nor
      could the short-sword be loosened; many went up and tried at it, but could get nothing done
      therewith; eight of them were about it before the end, but none the more might bring it to
      pass,</p>
     <p>Then said Angle, "Why should we spare this wood-man here? lay his hand on the block."</p>
     <p>So when that was done they smote off his hand at the wrist, and the fingers straightened,
      and were loosed from the handle. Then Angle took the short-sword in both hands and smote at
      Grettir's head, and a right great stroke that was, so that the short-sword might not abide it,
      and a shard was broken from the midst of the edge thereof; and when men saw that, they asked
      why he must needs spoil a fair thing in such wise.</p>
     <p>But Angle answered, "More easy is it to know that weapon now if it should be asked for."</p>
     <p>They said it needed not such a deed since the man was dead already.</p>
     <p>"Ah! but yet more shall be done," said Angle, and <pb n="243"/> hewed therewith twice or
      thrice at Grettir's neck, or ever the head came off; and then he spake,</p>
     <p>"Now know I for sure that Grettir is dead."</p>
     <p>In such wise Grettir lost his life, the bravest man of all who have dwelt in Iceland; he
      lacked but one winter of forty-five years whenas he was slain; but he was fourteen winters old
      when he slew Skeggi, his first man-slaying; and from thenceforth all things turned to his
      fame, till the time when he dealt with Glam, the Thrall; and in those days was he of twenty
      winters; but when he fell into outlawry, he was twenty-five years old; but in outlawry was he
      nigh nineteen winters, and full oft was he the while in great trials of men; and such as his
      life was, and his needs, he held well to his faith and troth, and most haps did he foresee,
      though he might do nought to meet them.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="85">
     <head>How Thorbiorn Angle claimed Grettir's Head-money</head>
     <p>"A GREAT champion have we laid to earth here," said Thorbiorn; "now shall we bring the head
      aland with us, for I will not lose the money which has been laid thereon; nor may they then
      feign that they know not if I have slain Grettir."</p>
     <p>They bade him do his will, but had few words to say hereon, for to all the deed seemed a
      deed of little prowess.</p>
     <p>Then Angle fell to speaking with Illugi,</p>
     <p>"Great scathe it is of such a brave man as thou art, that thou hast fallen to such folly, as
      to betake thee to ill deeds <pb n="244"/> with this outlaw here, and must needs lie slain and
      unatoned therefor."</p>
     <p>Illugi answered, "Then first when the Althing is over this summer, wilt thou know who are
      outlaws; but neither thou nor the carline, thy foster-mother, will judge in this matter,
      because that your sorcery and craft of old days have slain Grettir, though thou didst, indeed,
      bear steel against him, as he lay at death's door, and wrought that so great coward's deed
      there, over and above thy sorcery."</p>
     <p>Then said Angle, "In manly wise speakest thou, but not thus will it be; and I will show thee
      that I think great scathe in thy death, for thy life will I give thee if thou wilt swear an
      oath for us here, to avenge thyself on none of those who have been in this journey."</p>
     <p>Illugi said, "That might I have deemed a thing to talk about, if Grettir had been suffered
      to defend himself, and ye had won him with manliness and hardihood; but now nowise is it to be
      thought, that I will do so much for the keeping of my life, as to become base, even as thou
      art: and here I tell thee, once for all, that no one of men shall be of less gain to thee than
      I, if I live; for long will it be or ever I forget how ye have prevailed against
      Grettir.--Yea, much rather do I choose to die."</p>
     <p>Then Thorbiorn Angle held talk with his fellows, whether they should let Illugi live or not;
      they said that, whereas he had ruled the journey, so, should he rule the deeds; so Angle said
      that he knew not how to have that man hanging over his head, who would neither give troth, nor
      promise aught.</p>
     <p>But when Illugi knew that they were fully minded to slay him, he laughed, and spake
      thus,</p>
     <p>"Yea, now have your counsels sped, even as my heart would." <pb n="245"/> So at the dawning
      of the day they brought him to the eastern end of the island, and there slaughtered him; but
      all men praised his great heart, and deemed him unlike to any of his age.</p>
     <p>They laid both the brothers in cairn on the island there; and thereafter took Grettir's
      head, and bore it away with them, and whatso goods there were in weapons or clothes; but the
      good short-sword Angle would not put into the things to be shared, and he bare it himself long
      afterwards. Noise they took with them, and he bore himself as ill as might be.</p>
     <p>At nightfall the gale abated, and they rowed aland in the morning. Angle took land at the
      handiest place, and sent the craft out to Biorn; but by then they were come hard by Oyce-land,
      Noise began to bear himself so ill, that they were loth to fare any longer with him, so there
      they slew him, and long and loud he greeted or ever he was cut down.</p>
     <p>Thorbiorn Angle went home to Woodwick, and deemed he had done in manly wise in this journey;
      but Grettir's head they laid in salt in the out-bower at Woodwick, which was called therefrom
      Grettir's-bower; and there it lay the winter long. But Angle was exceeding ill thought of for
      this work of his, as soon as folk knew that Grettir had been overcome by sorcery.</p>
     <p>Thorbiorn Angle sat quiet till past Yule; then he rode to meet Thorir of Garth, and told him
      of these slayings; and this withal, that he deemed that money his due which had been put on
      Grettir's head. Thorir said that he might not hide that he had brought about Grettir's
      outlawry,</p>
     <p>"Yea, and oft have I dealt hardly with him, yet so much for the taking of his life I would
      not have done, as to make me a misdoer, a man of evil craft, even as thou hast done; <pb
       n="246"/> and the less shall I lay down that money for thee, in that I deem thee surely to be
      a man of forfeit life because of thy sorcery and wizard-craft."</p>
     <p>Thorbiorn Angle answers, "Me seems thou art urged hereto more by closefistedness and a poor
      mind, than by any heed of how Grettir was won."</p>
     <p>Thorir said that a short way they might make of it, in that they should abide the Althing,
      and take whatso the Lawman might deem most rightful: and in such wise they parted that there
      was no little ill-will betwixt Thorir and Thorbiorn Angle.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="86">
     <head>How Thorbiorn Angle brought Grettir's Head to Biarg</head>
     <p>THE kin of Grettir and Illugi were exceeding ill content when they heard of these slayings,
      and they so looked on matters as deeming that Angle had wrought a shameful deed in slaying a
      man at death's door; and that, besides that, he had become guilty of sorcery. They sought the
      counsel of the wisest men, and everywhere was Angle's work ill spoken of. As for him, he rode
      to Midfirth, when it lacked four weeks of summer; and when his ways were heard of, Asdis
      gathered men to her, and there came many of her friends: Gamli and Glum, her brothers-in-law,
      and their sons, Skeggi, who was called the Short-handed, and Uspak, who is aforesaid. Asdis
      was so well befriended, that all the Midfirthers came to aid her; yea, even those who were
      aforetime foes to Grettir; and the first man there was Thorod Drapa-Stump, and the more part
      of the Ramfirthers, <pb n="247"/> Now Angle came to Biarg with twenty men, and had Grettir's
      head with him; but not all those had come yet who had promised aid to Asdis; so Angle and his
      folk went into the chamber with the head, and set it down on the floor; the goodwife was there
      in the chamber, and many men with her; nor did it come to greetings on either side but Angle
      sang this stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"A greedy head I bring with me</l>
      <l>Up from the borders of the sea</l>
      <l>Now may the needle-pliers weep,</l>
      <l>The red-haired outlaw lies asleep;</l>
      <l>Gold-bearer, cast adown thine eyes,</l>
      <l>And see how on the pavement lies,</l>
      <l>The peace-destroying head brought low,</l>
      <l>That but for salt had gone ere now."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>The goodwife sat silent when he gave forth the stave, and thereafter she sang--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"O thou poor wretch, as sheep that flee</l>
      <l>To treacherous ice when wolves they see,</l>
      <l>So in the waves would ye have drowned</l>
      <l>Your shame and fear, had ye but found</l>
      <l>That steel-god hale upon the isle:</l>
      <l>Now heavy shame, woe worth the while!</l>
      <l>Hangs over the north country-side,</l>
      <l>Nor I my loathing care to hide."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Then many said that it was nought wonderful, though she had brave sons, so brave as she
      herself was, amid such grief of heart as was brought on her.</p>
     <p>Uspak was without, and held talk with such of Angle's <pb n="248"/> folk as had not gone in,
      and asked concerning the slayings; and all men praised Illugi's defence; and they told withal
      how fast Grettir had held the short-sword after he was dead, and marvellous that seemed to
      men.</p>
     <p>Amidst these things were seen many men riding from the west, and thither were coming many
      friends of the goodwife, with Gamli and Skeggi west from Meals.</p>
     <p>Now Angle had been minded to take out execution after Illugi, for he and his men claimed all
      his goods; but when that crowd of men came up, Angle saw that he might do nought therein, but
      Gamli and Uspak were of the eagerest, and were fain to set on Angle; but those who were wisest
      bade them take the rede of Thorvald their kinsman, and the other chief men, and said that
      worse would be deemed of Angle's case the more wise men sat in judgment over it; then such
      truce there was that Angle rode away, having Grettir's head with him, because he was minded to
      bear it to the Althing.</p>
     <p>So he rode home, and thought matters looked heavy enough, because well-nigh all the chief
      men of the land were either akin to Grettir and Illugi, or tied to them and theirs by
      marriage: that summer, moreover, Skeggi the Short-handed took to wife the daughter of Thorod
      Drapa-Stump, and therewithal Thorod joined Grettir's kin in these matters.</p>
    </div>

    <pb n="249"/>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="87">
     <head>Affairs at the Althing.</head>
     <p>NOW men rode to the Althing, and Angle's helpers were fewer than he had looked for, because
      that his case was spoken ill of far and wide.</p>
     <p>Then asked Halldor whether they were to carry Grettir's head with them to the Althing.</p>
     <p>Angle said that he would bear it with him,</p>
     <p>"Ill-counselled is that," said Halldor; "for many enough will thy foes be, though thou doest
      nought to jog the memories of folk, or wake up their grief."</p>
     <p>By then were they come on their way, and were minded to ride south over the Sand; so Angle
      let take the head, and bury it in a hillock of sand, which is called Grettir's Hillock.</p>
     <p>Thronged was the Althing, and Angle put forth his case, and praised his own deeds mightily,
      in that he had slain the greatest outlaw in all the land, and claimed the money as his which
      had been put on Grettir's head. But Thorir had the same answer for him as was told afore.</p>
     <p>Then was the Lawman prayed for a decision, and he said that he would fain hear if any
      charges came against this, whereby Angle should forfeit his blood-money, or else he said he
      must have whatsoever had been put on Grettir's head.</p>
     <p>Then Thorvald Asgeirson called on Skeggi the Shorthanded to put forth his case, and he
      summoned Thorbiorn Angle with a first summons for the witchcraft and sorcery, whereby Grettir
      must have got his bane, and then with another <pb n="250"/> summons withal, for that they had
      borne weapons against a half-dead man, and hereon he claimed an award of outlawry.</p>
     <p>Now folk drew much together on this side and on that, but few they were that gave aid to
      Thorbiorn; and things turned out otherwise than he had looked for, because Thorvald, and
      Isleif, his son-in-law, deemed it a deed worthy of death to bring men to their end by evil
      sorcery; but through the words of wise men these cases had such end, that Thorbiorn should
      sail away that same summer, and never come back to Iceland while any such were alive, as had
      the blood-suit for Grettir and Illugi.</p>
     <p>And then, moreover, was it made law that all workers of olden craft should be made
      outlaws.</p>
     <p>So when Angle saw what his lot would be, he gat him gone from the Thing, because it might
      well hap that Grettir's kin would set on him; nor did he get aught of the fee that was put on
      Grettir's head, for that Stein the Lawman would not that it should be paid for a deed of
      shame. None of those men of Thorbiorn's company who had fallen in Drangey were atoned, for
      they were to be made equal to the slaying of Illugi, but their kin were exceeding ill content
      therewith.</p>
     <p>So men rode home from the Thing, and all blood-suits that men had against Grettir fell
      away.</p>
     <p>Skeggi, the son of Gamli, who was son-in-law of Thorod Drapa-Stump, and sister's son of
      Grettir, went north to Skagafirth at the instance of Thorvald Asgeirson, and Isleif his
      son-in-law, who was afterwards Bishop of Skalholt, and by the consent of all the people got to
      him a keel, and went to Drangey to seek the corpses of the brothers, Grettir and Illugi; and
      he brought them back to Reeks, in Reek-strand, and buried them there at the <pb n="251"/>
      church; and it is for a token that Grettir lies there, that in the days of the Sturlungs, when
      the church of Reeks was moved, Grettir's bones were dug up, nor were they deemed so wondrous
      great, great enough though they were. The bones of Illugi were buried afterwards north of the
      church, but Grettir's head at home in the church at Biarg.</p>
     <p>Goodwife Asdis abode at home at Biarg, and so well beloved she was, that no trouble was ever
      brought against her, no, not even while Grettir was in outlawry.</p>
     <p>Skeggi the Short-handed took the household at Biarg after Asdis, and a mighty man he was;
      his son was Gamli, the father of Skeggi of Scarf-stead, and Asdis the mother of Odd the Monk.
      Many men are come from him.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="88">
     <head>Thorbiorn Angle goes to Norway, and thence to Micklegarth</head>
     <p>THORBIORN Angle took ship at Goose-ere, with whatso of his goods he might take with him; but
      Hialti his brother took to him his lands, and Angle gave him Drangey withal. Hialti became a
      great chief in aftertimes, but he has nought more to do with this tale.</p>
     <p>So Angle fared out to Norway; he yet made much of himself, for he deemed he had wrought a
      great deed in the slaying of Grettir, and so thought many others, who knew not how all had
      come to pass, for many knew how renowned a man Grettir had been; withal Angle told just so
      much of their dealings together as might do him honour, and let such of the tale he quiet as
      was of lesser glory.</p>
     <p>Now this tale came in the autumn-tide east to Tunsberg, <pb n="252"/> and when Thorstein
      Dromund heard of the slayings he grew all silent, because it was told him that Angle was a
      mighty man and a hardy; and he called to mind the words which he had spoken when he and
      Grettir talked together, long time agone, concerning the fashion of their arms.</p>
     <p>So Thorstein put out spies on Angle's goings; they were both in Norway through the winter,
      but Thorbiorn was in the north-country, and Thorstein in Tunsberg, nor had either seen other;
      yet was Angle ware that Grettir had a brother in Norway, and thought it hard to keep guard of
      himself in an unknown land, wherefore he sought counsel as to where he should betake himself.
      Now in those days many Northmen went out to Micklegarth, and took war-pay there; so Thorbiorn
      deemed it would be good to go thither and get to him thereby both fee and fame, nor to abide
      in the Northlands because of the kin of Grettir. So he made ready to go from Norway, and get
      him gone from out the land, and made no stay till he came to Micklegarth, and there took
      war-hire.</p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="89">
     <head>How the Short-Sword was the easier known when sought for by reason of the notch in the
      blade</head>
     <p>THORSTEIN Dromund was a mighty man, and of the greatest account; and now he heard that
      Thorbiorn Angle had got him gone from the land out to Micklegarth; speedy were his doings
      thereon, he gave over his lands into his kinsmen's hands, and betook himself to journeying and
       <pb n="253"/> to search for Angle; and ever he followed after whereas Angle had gone afore,
      nor was Angle ware of his goings.</p>
     <p>So Thorstein Dromund came out to Micklegarth a little after Angle, and was fain above all
      things. to slay him, but neither knew the other. Now had they will to be taken into the
      company of the Varangians, and the matter went well as soon as the Varangians knew that they
      were Northmen; and in those days was Michael Katalak king over Micklegarth.</p>
     <p>Thorstein Dromund watched for Angle, if in some wise be might know him, but won not the game
      because of the many people there; and ever would he lie awake, ill content with his lot, and
      thinking how great was his loss.</p>
     <p>Now hereupon it befell that the Varangians were to go on certain warfare, and free the land
      from harrying; and their manner and law it was before they went from home to hold a
      weapon-show, and so it was now done; and when the weapon-show was established, then were all
      Varangians to come there, and those withal who were minded to fall into their company, and
      they were to show forth their weapons.</p>
     <p>Thither came both Thorstein and Angle; but Thorbiorn Angle showed forth his weapons first;
      and he had the shorts-word, Grettir's-loom; but when he showed it many praised it and said
      that it was an exceeding good weapon, but that it was a great blemish, that notch in the edge
      thereof; and asked him withal what had brought that to pass.</p>
     <p>Angle said it was a thing worthy to be told of, "For this is the next thing to be said,"
      says he, "that out in Iceland I slew that champion who was called Grettir the Strong, and who
      was the greatest warrior and the stoutest-hearted of all men of that land, for him could no
      man vanquish till I came forth for that end; and whereas I had the good hap to win him, I took
      his life; though indeed he had my strength <pb n="254"/> many times over; then I drave this
      short-sword into his head, and thereby was a shard broken from out its edge."</p>
     <p>So those who stood nigh said, that he must have been hard of head then, and each showed the
      short-sword to the other; but hereby Thorstein deemed he knew now who this man was, and he
      prayed withal to see the short-sword even as the others; then Angle gave it up with good will,
      for all were praising his bravery and that daring onset, and even in such wise did he think
      this one would do; and in no Wise did he misdoubt him that Thorstein was there, or that the
      man was akin to Grettir.</p>
     <p>Then Dromund took the short-sword, and raised it aloft, and hewed at Angle and smote him on
      the head, and so great was the stroke that it stayed but at the jaw-teeth, and Thorbiorn Angle
      fell to earth dead and dishonoured.</p>
     <p>Thereat all men became hushed; but the Chancellor of the town seized Thorstein straightway,
      and asked for what cause he did such an ill-deed there at the hallowed Thing.</p>
     <p>Thorstein said that he was the brother of Grettir the Strong, and that withal he had never
      been able to bring vengeance to pass till then; so thereupon many put in their word, and said
      that the strong man must needs have been of great might and nobleness, in that Thorstein had
      fared so far forth into the world to avenge him: the rulers of the city deemed that like
      enough; but whereas there was none there to bear witness in aught to Thorstein's word, that
      law of theirs prevailed, that whosoever slew a man should lose nought but his life.</p>
     <p>So then speedy doom and hard enow did Thorstein get; for in a dark chamber of a dungeon
      should he be cast and there abide his death, if none redeemed him therefrom with money. But
      when Thorstein came into the dungeon, there was a man there already, who had come to death's
      door from <pb n="255"/> misery; and both foul and cold was that abode; Thorstein spake to that
      man and said,</p>
     <p>"How deemest thou of thy life?"</p>
     <p>He answered, "As of a right evil life, for of nought can I be holpen, nor have I kinsmen to
      redeem me."</p>
     <p>Thorstein said, "Nought is of less avail in such matters than lack of good rede; let us be
      merry then, and do somewhat that will be glee and game to us."</p>
     <p>The man said that he might have no glee of aught.</p>
     <p>"Nay, then, but let us try it," said Thorstein. And therewithal he fell to singing; and he
      was a man of such goodly voice that scarcely might his like be found therefor, nor did he now
      spare himself.</p>
     <p>Now the highway was but a little way from the dungeon, and Thorstein sang so loud and clear
      that the walls resounded therewith, and great game this seemed to him who had been half-dead
      erst; and in such wise did Thorstein keep it going till the evening.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="90">
     <head>How the Lady Spes redeemed Thorstein from the Dungeon</head>
     <p>THERE was a great lady of a castle in that town called Spes, exceeding rich and of great
      kin; Sigurd was the name of her husband, a rich man too, but of lesser kin than she was, and
      for money had she been wedded to him; no great love there was betwixt them, for she thought
      she had been wedded far beneath her; high-minded she was and a very stirring woman.</p>
     <p>Now so it befell, that, as Thorstein made him merry that <pb n="256"/> night, Spes walked in
      the street hard by the dungeon, and heard thence so fair a voice, that she said she had never
      yet heard its like. She went with many folk, and so now she bade them go learn who had that
      noble voice. So they called out and asked who lay there in such evil plight; and Thorstein
      named himself.</p>
     <p>Then said Spes, "Art thou a man as much skilled in other matters as in singing?"</p>
     <p>He said there was but little to show for that.</p>
     <p>"What ill-deed hast thou done," said she, "that thou must needs be tormented here to the
      death?"</p>
     <p>He said that he had slain a man, and avenged his brother thereby, "But I could not show that
      by witnesses," said Thorstein, "and therefore have I been cast into ward here, unless some man
      should redeem me, nor do I hope therefor, for no man have I here akin to me."</p>
     <p>"Great loss of thee if thou art slain! and that brother of thine whom thou didst avenge, was
      he a man so famed, then?"</p>
     <p>He said that he was more mighty than he by the half; and so she asked what token there was
      thereof. Then sang Thorstein this stave--</p>


     <lg>
      <l>"Field of rings, eight men, who raise</l>
      <l>Din of sword in clattering ways,</l>
      <l>Strove the good short-sword in vain</l>
      <l>From the strong dead hand to gain;</l>
      <l>So they ever strained and strove,</l>
      <l>Till at last it did behove,</l>
      <l>The feared quickener of the fight,</l>
      <l>From the glorious man to smite."</l>
     </lg>

     <p>"Great prowess such a thing shows of the man," said <pb n="257"/> those who understood the
      stave; and when she knew thereof, she spake thus,</p>
     <p>"Wilt thou take thy life from me, if such a choice is given thee?"</p>
     <p>"That will I," said Thorstein, "if this fellow of mine, who sits hereby, is redeemed along
      with me; or else will we both abide here together."</p>
     <p>She answers, "More of a prize do I deem thee than him."</p>
     <p>"Howsoever that may be," said Thorstein, "we shall go away in company both of us together,
      or else shall neither go."</p>
     <p>Then she went there, whereas were the Varangians, and prayed for freedom for Thorstein, and
      offered money to that end; and to this were they right willing; and so she brought about by
      her mighty friendships and her wealth that they were both set free. But as soon as Thorstein
      came out of the dungeon he went to see goodwife Spes, and she took him to her and kept him
      privily; but whiles was he with the Varangians in warfare, and in all onsets showed himself
      the stoutest of hearts.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="91">
     <head>Of the doings of Thorstein and the Lady Spes</head>
     <p>IN those days was Harald Sigurdson at Micklegarth, and Thorstein fell into friendship with
      him. Of much account was Thorstein held, for Spes let him lack no money; and greatly they
      turned their hearts one to the other, Thorstein and Spes; and many folk beside her deemed
      great things of his prowess. <pb n="258"/> Now her money was much squandered, because she ever
      gave herself to the getting of great friends; and her husband deemed that he could see that
      she was much changed, both in temper and many other of her ways, but most of all in the
      spending of money; both gold and good things he missed, which were gone from her keeping.</p>
     <p>So on a time Sigurd her husband talks with her, and says that she has taken to strange ways.
      "Thou givest no heed to our goods," says he, "but squanderest them in many wise; and,
      moreover, it is even as if I saw thee ever in a dream, nor ever wilt thou be there whereas I
      am; and I know for sure that something must bring this about."</p>
     <p>She answered, "I told thee, and my kinsfolk told thee, whenas we came together, that I would
      have my full will and freedom over all such things as it was beseeming for me to bestow, and
      for that cause I spare not thy goods. Hast thou perchance aught to say to me concerning other
      matters which may be to my shame?"</p>
     <p>He answers, "Somewhat do I misdoubt me that thou boldest some man or other whom thou deemest
      better than I be."</p>
     <p>"I wot not," says she, "what ground there may be thereto; but meseems thou mayest speak with
      little truth; and yet, none-the-less, we two alone shall not speak on this matter if thou
      layest this slander on me."</p>
     <p>So he let the talk drop for that time; she and Thorstein went on in the same way, nor were
      they wary of the words of evil folk, for she ever trusted in her many and wise friends. Oft
      they sat talking together and making merry; and on an evening as they sat in a certain loft,
      wherein were goodly things of hers, she bade Thorstein sing somewhat, for she thought the
      goodman was sitting at the drink, as his wont was, so she bolted the door. But, when he had
      sung a <pb n="259"/> certain while, the door was driven at, and one called from outside to
      open; and there was come the husband with many of his folk.</p>
     <p>The goodwife had unlocked a great chest to show Thorstein her dainty things; so when she
      knew who was there, she would not unlock the door, but speaks to Thorstein, "Quick is my rede,
      jump into the chest and keep silent."</p>
     <p>So he did, and she shot the bolt of the chest and sat thereon herself; and even therewith in
      came the husband into the loft, for he and his had broken open the door thereof.</p>
     <p>Then said the lady, "Why do ye fare with all this uproar? are your foes after you then?"</p>
     <p>The goodman answered, "Now it is well that thou thyself givest proof of thyself what thou
      art; where is the man who trolled out that song so well e'en now? I wot thou deemest him of
      far fairer voice than I be."</p>
     <p>She said: "Not altogether a fool is he who can be silent; but so it fares not with thee:
      thou deemest thyself cunning, and art minded to bind thy lie on my back. Well, then, let proof
      be made thereof! If there be truth in thy words, take the man; he will scarce have leapt out
      through the walls or the roof."</p>
     <p>So he searched through the place, and found him not,. and she said, "Why dost thou not take
      him then, since thou deemest the thing so sure?"</p>
     <p>He was silent, nor knew in sooth amid what wiles be was come; then he asked his fellows if
      they had not heard him even as he had. But whereas they saw that the mistress misliked the
      matter, their witness came to nought, for they said that oft folk heard not things as they
      were in very sooth. So the husband went out, and deemed he knew that sooth well enough, though
      they had not found <pb n="260"/> the man; and now for a long time he left spying on his wife
      and her ways.</p>
     <p>Another time, long after, Thorstein and Spes sat in a certain cloth-bower, and therein were
      clothes, both cut and uncut, which the wedded folk owned; there she showed to Thorstein many
      kinds of cloth, and they unfolded them; but when they were least ware of it the husband came
      on them with many men, and brake into the loft; but while they were about that she heaped up
      clothes over Thorstein, and leaned against the clothes-stack when they came into the
      chamber.</p>
     <p>"Wilt thou still deny," said the goodman, "that there was a man with thee, when such men
      there are as saw you both?"</p>
     <p>She bade them not to go on so madly. "This time ye will not fail, belike; but let me be at
      peace, and worry me not."</p>
     <p>So they searched through the place and found nought, and at last gave it up.</p>
     <p>Then the goodwife answered and said, "It is ever good to give better proof than the guesses
      of certain folk; nor was it to be looked for that ye should find that which was not. Wilt thou
      now confess thy folly, husband, and free me from this slander?"</p>
     <p>He said, "The less will I free thee from it in that I trow thou art in very sooth guilty of
      that which I have laid to thy charge; and thou wilt have to put forth all thy might in this
      case, if thou art to get this thrust from thee."</p>
     <p>She said that that was in nowise against her mind, and therewithal. they parted.</p>
     <p>Thereafter was Thorstein ever with the Varangians, and men say that he sought counsel of
      Harald Sigurdson, and their mind it is that Thorstein and Spes would not have <pb n="261"/>
      taken to those redes but for the trust they had in him and his wisdom.</p>
     <p>Now as time wore on, goodman Sigurd gave out that he would fare from home on certain errands
      of his own. The goodwife nowise let him herein; and when he was gone, Thorstein came to Spes,
      and the twain were ever together. Now such was the fashion of her castle that it was built
      forth over the sea, and there were certain chambers therein whereunder the sea flowed; in such
      a chamber Thorstein and Spes ever sat; and a little trap-door there was in the floor of it,
      whereof none knew but those twain, and it might be opened if there were hasty need
      thereof.</p>
     <p>Now it is to be told of the husband that he went nowhither, save into hiding, that he might
      spy the ways of the housewife; so it befell that, one night as they sat alone in the sea-loft
      and were glad together, the husband came on them unawares with a crowd of folk, for he had
      brought certain men to a window of the chamber, and bade them see if things were not even
      according to his word: and all said that he spake but the sooth, and that so belike he had
      done aforetime.</p>
     <p>So they ran into the loft, but when Spes heard the crash, she said to Thorstein,</p>
     <p>"Needs must thou go down hereby, whatsoever be the cost, but give me some token if thou
      comest safe from the place."</p>
     <p>He said yea thereto, and plunged down through the floor, and the housewife spurned her foot
      at the lid, and it fell back again into its place, and no new work was to be seen on the
      floor.</p>
     <p>Now the husband and his men came into the loft, and went about searching, and found nought,
      as was likely; the loft was empty, so that there was nought therein save the <pb n="262"/>
      floor and the cross-benches, and there sat the goodwife, and played with the gold on her
      fingers; she heeded them little, and made as if there was nought to do.</p>
     <p>All this the goodman thought the strangest of all, and asked his folk if they had not seen
      the man, and they said that they had in good sooth seen him.</p>
     <p>Then said the goodwife, "Hereto shall things come as is said; <hi rend="ital">thrice of yore
       have all things happed</hi>, and in likewise hast thou fared, Sigurd," says she, "for three
      times hadst thou undone my Peace, meseems, and are ye any wiser than in the beginning?"</p>
     <p>"This time I was not alone in my tale," said the goodman; "and now to make an end, shalt
      thou go through the freeing by law, for in nowise will I have this shame unbooted."</p>
     <p>"Meseems," says the goodwife, "thou biddest me what I would bid of thee, for good above all
      things I deem it to free myself from this slander, which has spread so wide and high, that it
      would be great dishonour if I thrust it not from off me."</p>
     <p>"In likewise," said the goodman, "shalt thou prove that thou hast not given away or taken to
      thyself my goods."</p>
     <p>She answers, "At that time when I free myself shall I in one wise thrust off from me all
      charges that thou hast to bring against me; but take thou heed whereto all shall come; I will
      at once free myself from all words that have been spoken here on this charge that thou now
      makest."</p>
     <p>The goodman was well content therewith, and got him gone with his men.</p>
     <p>Now it is to be told of Thorstein that he swam forth from under the chamber, and went aland
      where he would, and took a burning log, and held it up in such wise that it <pb n="263"/>
      might be seen from the goodwife's castle, and she was abroad for long that evening, and right
      into the night, for that she would fain know if Thorstein had come aland; and so when she saw
      the fire, she deemed that she knew that Thorstein had taken land, for even such a token had
      they agreed on betwixt them.</p>
     <p>The next morning Spes bade her husband speak of their matters to the bishop, and thereto was
      he fully ready. Now they come before the bishop, and the goodman put forward all the aforesaid
      charges against her.</p>
     <p>The bishop asked if she had been known for such an one aforetime, but none said that they
      had heard thereof Then he asked with what likelihood he brought those things against her. So
      the goodman brought forward men who had seen her sit in a locked room with a man beside her,
      and they twain alone: and therewith the goodman said that he misdoubted him of that man
      beguiling her.</p>
     <p>The bishop said that she might well free herself lawfully from this charge if so she would.
      She said that it liked her well so to do, "and good hope I have," said Spes, "that I shall
      have great plenty of women to purge me by oath in this case."</p>
     <p>Now was an oath set forward in words for her, and a day settled whereon the case should come
      about; and thereafter she went home, and was glad at heart, and Thorstein and Spes met, and
      settled fully what they should do.</p>
    </div>

    <pb n="264"/>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="92">
     <head>Of the Oath that Spes made before the Bishop</head>
     <p>NOW that day past, and time wore on to the day when Spes should make oath, and she bade
      thereto all her friends and kin, and arrayed herself in the best attire she had, and many
      noble ladies went with her.</p>
     <p>Wet was the weather about that time, and the ways were miry, and a certain slough there was
      to go over or ever they might come to the church; and whenas Spes and her company came forth
      anigh this slough, a great crowd was there before them, and a multitude of poor folk who
      prayed them of alms, for this was in the common highway, and all who knew her deemed it was
      their part to welcome her, and prayed for good things for her as for one who had oft holpen
      them well.</p>
     <p>A certain staff-propped carle there was amidst those poor folk, great of growth and
      long-bearded. Now the women made stay at the slough, because that the great people deemed the
      passage across over miry, and therewith when that staff-carle saw the goodwife, that she was
      better arrayed than the other women, he spake to her on this wise,</p>
     <p>"Good mistress," said he, "be so lowly as to suffer me to bear thee over this slough, for it
      is the bounden duty of us staff-carles to serve thee all we may."</p>
     <p>"What then," says she, "wilt thou bear me well, when thou mayst not bear thyself?"</p>
     <p>"Yet would it show forth thy lowliness," says he, "nor may I offer better than I have
      withal; and in all things wilt <pb n="265"/> thou fare the better, if thou hast no pride
      against poor folk."</p>
     <p>"Wot thou well, then," says she, "that if thou bearest me not well it shall be for a beating
      to thee, or some other shame greater yet."</p>
     <p>"Well, I would fain risk it," said he; and therewithal he got on to his feet and stood in
      the slough. She made as if she were sore afeard of his carrying her, yet nathless she went on,
      borne on his back; and he staggered along exceeding slowly, going on two crutches, and when he
      got midmost of the slough he began to reel from side to side. She bade him gather up his
      strength.</p>
     <p>"Never shalt thou have made a worse journey than this if thou castest me down here."</p>
     <p>Then the poor wretch staggers on, and gathers up all his courage and strength, and gets
      close to the dry land, but stumbles withal, and falls head-foremost in such wise, that he cast
      her on to the bank, but fell into the ditch up to his armpits, and therewithal as he lay there
      caught at the goodwife, and gat no firm hold of her clothes, but set his miry hand on her knee
      right up to the bare thigh.</p>
     <p>She sprang up and cursed him, and said that ever would evil come from wretched gangrel
      churles: "and thy full due it were to be beaten, if I thought it not a shame, because of thy
      misery."</p>
     <p>Then said he, "Meted in unlike ways is man's bliss; methought I had done well to thee, and I
      looked for an alms at thy hands, and lo, in place thereof, I get but threats and ill-usage and
      no good again withal;" and he made as if he were exceeding angry.</p>
     <p>Many deemed that he looked right poor and wretched, but she said that he was the wiliest of
      old churles; but whereas many prayed for him, she took her purse to her, <pb n="266"/> and
      therein was many a penny of gold; then she shook down the money and said,</p>
     <p>"Take thou this, carle; nowise good were it, if thou hadst not full pay for the hard words
      thou hadst of me; now have I parted with thee, even according to thy worth."</p>
     <p>Then he picked up the gold, and thanked her for her good deed. Spes went to the church, and
      a great crowd was there before her. Sigurd pushed the case forward eagerly, and bade her free
      herself from those charges he had brought against her.</p>
     <p>She said, "I heed not thy charges; what man dost thou say thou hast seen in my chamber with
      me? Lo now oft it befalls that some worthy man will be with me, and that do I deem void of any
      shame; but hereby will I swear that to no man have I given gold, and of no man have I had
      fleshly defilement save of my husband, and that wretched staff-carle who laid his miry hand on
      my thigh when I was borne over the slough this same day."</p>
     <p>Now many deemed that this was a full oath, and that no shame it was to her, though the carle
      had laid hand on her unwittingly; but she said that all things must be told even as they
      were.</p>
     <p>Thereafter she swore the oath in such form as is said afore, and many said thereon that she
      showed the old saw to be true, swear loud and say little. But for her, she said that wise men
      would think that this was not done by guile.</p>
     <p>Then her kin fell to saying that great shame and grief it was for high-born women to have
      such lying charges brought against them bootless, whereas it was a crime worthy of death if it
      were openly known of any woman that she had done whoredoms against her husband. Therewithal
       <pb n="267"/> Spes prayed the bishop to make out a divorce betwixt her and her husband
      Sigurd, because she said she might nowise bear his slanderous lying charges. Her kinsfolk
      pushed the matter forward for her, and so brought it about by their urgency that they were
      divorced, and Sigurd got little of the goods, and was driven away from the land withal, for
      here matters went as is oft shown that they will, and <hi rend="ital">the lower must
      lowt</hi>; nor could he bring aught about to avail him, though he had but said the very
      sooth.</p>
     <p>Now Spes took to her all their money, and was deemed the greatest of stirring women; but
      when folk looked into her oath, it seemed to them that there was some guile in it, and were of
      a mind that wise men must have taught her that way of swearing; and men dug out this withal,
      that the staff-carle who had carried her was even Thorstein Dromund. Yet for all that Sigurd
      got no righting of the matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="93">
     <head>Thorstein and Spes come out to Norway</head>
     <p>THORSTEIN Dromund was with the Varangians while the talk ran highest about these matters; so
      famed did he become that it was deemed that scarce had any man of the like prowess come
      thither; the greatest honours he gat from Harald Sigurdson, for he was of his kin; and after
      his counsels did Thorstein do, as men are minded to think.</p>
     <p>But a little after Sigurd was driven from the land, Thorstein fell to wooing Spes to wife,
      and she took it meetly, but went to her kinsmen for rede; then they held <pb n="268"/>
      meetings thereon, and were of one accord that she herself must rule the matter; then was the
      bargain struck, and good was their wedded life, and they were rich in money, and all men
      deemed Thorstein to be a man of exceeding good luck, since he had delivered himself from all
      his troubles.</p>
     <p>The twain were together for two winters in Micklegarth, and then Thorstein said to his
      goodwife that he would fain go back to see his possessions in Norway. She said he should have
      his will, so they sold the lands they had there, and gat them great wealth of chattels, and
      then betook them from that land, with a fair company, and went all the way till they came to
      Norway. Thorstein's kin welcomed them both right heartily, and soon saw that Spes was
      bountiful and high-minded, and she speedily became exceeding well befriended. Some children
      they had between them, and they abode on their lands, and were well content with their
      life.</p>
     <p>In those days was Magnus the Good king over Norway. Thorstein soon went to meet him, and had
      good welcome of him, for he had grown famous for the avenging of Grettir the Strong (for men
      scarce know of its happening that any other Icelander, save Grettir Asmundson, was avenged in
      Micklegarth); and folk say that Thorstein became a man of King Magnus, and for nine winters
      after he had come to Norway he abode in peace, and folk of the greatest honour were they
      deemed, he and his wife.</p>
     <p>Then came home from Micklegarth King Harald Sigurdson, and King Magnus gave him half Norway,
      and they were both kings therein for a while; but after the death of King Magnus many of those
      who had been his friends were ill content, for all men loved him; but folk might not abide the
      temper of King Harald, for that he was hard and was wont to punish men heavily. <pb n="269"/>
      But Thorstein Dromund was fallen into eld, though he was still the halest of men; and now was
      the slaying of Grettir Asmundson sixteen winters agone.</p>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="94">
     <head>Thorstein Dromund and Spes leave Norway again</head>
     <p>AT that time many urged Thorstein to go meet King Harald, and become his man; but he took
      not kindly to it.</p>
     <p>Then Spes spake, "I will, Thorstein," says she, "that thou go not to meet Harald the king,
      for to another king have we much more to pay, and need there is that we turn our minds to
      that; for now we both grow old and our youth is long departed, and far more have we followed
      after worldly devices, than the teaching of Christ, or the ways of justice and uprightness;
      now wot I well that this debt can be paid for us neither by our kindred or our goods, and I
      will that we ourselves should pay it: now will I therefore that we change our way of life and
      fare away from this, land and unto the abode of the Pope, because I well believe that so only
      may my case be made easy to me."</p>
     <p>Thorstein said, "As well known to me as to thee are the things thou talkest of; and it is
      meet that thou have thy will herein, since thou didst ever give me my will, in a matter of far
      less hope; and in all things will we do as thou biddest."</p>
     <p>This took men utterly unawares; Thorstein was by then sixty-seven years of age, yet hale in
      all wise.</p>
     <p>So now he bid to him all his kindred and folk allied to him, and laid before them the things
      he had determined <pb n="270"/> on. Wise men gave good words thereto, though they deemed of
      their departing as of the greatest loss.</p>
     <p>But Thorstein said that there was nought sure about his, coming back: "Now do I give thanks
      to all of you," says he, "for the heed ye paid to my goods when I was last away from the land;
      now I will offer you, and pray you to take to you my children's havings, and my children, and
      bring them up according to the manliness that is in you; for I am fallen so far into eld that
      there is little to say as to whether I may return or not, though I may live; but ye shall in
      such wise look after all that I leave behind me here, even as if I should never come back to
      Norway."</p>
     <p>Then men answered, that good redes would be plenteous if the housewife should abide behind
      to look after his affairs; but she said--</p>
     <p>"For that cause did I come hither from the outlands, and from Micklegarth, with Thorstein,
      leaving behind both kin and goods, for that I was fain that one fate might be over us both;
      now have I thought it good to be here; but I have no will to abide long in Norway or the
      Northlands if he goes away; ever has there been great love betwixt us withal, and nought has
      happed to divide us; now therefore will we depart together, for to both of us is known the
      truth about many things that befell since we first met."</p>
     <p>So, when they had settled their affairs in this wise, Thorstein bade chosen folk divide his
      goods into halves; and his kin took the half which his children were to own, and they were
      brought up by their father's kin, and were in aftertimes the mightiest of men, and great kin
      in the Wick has come from them. But Thorstein and Spes divided their share of the goods, and
      some they gave to churches for their souls' health, and some they took with them. Then they
      betook themselves Romeward, and many folk prayed well for them.</p>

     <head>How Thorstein Dromund and Spes fared to Rowe and died there</head>
     <p>NOW they went their ways till they came to Rome-town; and so when they came before him, who
      was appointed to hear the shrifts of men, they told him well and truly all things even as they
      had happed, and with what cunning and craft they had joined together in wedlock; therewithal
      they gave themselves up with great humility to such penance for the amending of their lives as
      he should lay on them; but because that they themselves had turned their minds to the atoning
      of their faults, without any urging or anger from the rulers of the church, they were eased of
      all fines as much as might be, but were bidden gently that they should now and henceforth
      concern themselves reasonably for their souls' health, and from this time forward live in
      chastity, since they had gotten them release from all their guilt; and herewith they were
      deemed to have fared well and wisely.</p>
     <p>Then said Spes, "Now, meseems, our matters have gone well and are come to an end, and no
      unlucky life have we had together; yet maybe fools will do after the pattern of our former
      life; now therefore let us make such an end to all, that good men also may follow after us and
      do the like: so let us go bargain with those who are deft in stone-craft; that they make for
      each of us a cell of stone, that we may thereby atone for what we have done against God."</p>
     <p>So Thorstein laid down money for the making of a stone cell for each of them, and for
      such-like other things as they might need, and might not be without for the keeping of <pb
       n="272"/> their lives; and then, when the stone work was done, and the time was meet therefor
      and all things were ready, they departed their worldly fellowship of their own free will, that
      they might the more enjoy a holy fellowship in another world. And there they abode both in
      their stone cells, and lived as long as God would have it, and so ended their lives. And most
      men say that Thorstein Dromund and Spes his wife may be deemed to be folk of the greatest good
      luck, all things being accounted of; but neither his children or any of his issue have come to
      Iceland for a tale to be made of them.</p>
     <p>Now Sturla the Lawman says so much as that he deems no outlawed man ever to have been so
      mighty as Grettir the Strong; and thereto he puts forth three reasons--</p>
     <p>And first in that he was the wisest of them all; for the longest in outlawry he was of any
      man, and was never won whiles he was hale.</p>
     <p>And again, in that he was the strongest in all the land among men of a like age; and more
      fitted to lay ghosts and do away with hauntings than any other.</p>
     <p>And thirdly, in that he was avenged out in Micklegarth, even as no other man of Iceland has
      been; and this withal, that Thorstein Dromund, who avenged him, was so lucky a man in his last
      days.</p>
     <p>So here ends the story of Grettir Asmundson, our fellow-countryman. Thank have they who
      listened thereto; but thank little enow to him who scribbled out the tale.</p>

     <head>NOTES.</head>
     <p>P. 29. The genealogy of Gamli of Meals, as here recorded, seems to be peculiar to Grettir's
      saga. Yet its statements are inconsistent in the matter, for it gives this twofold genealogy
      of the man. See Ed. Kaupmannahöfn: 1853.</p>
     <p>P. 22. Ranveig was the wife of Gamli, the son of <hi rend="ital">Thorald</hi>, the son of
      the <hi rend="ital">Vendlander</hi>.</p>
     <p>P. 70. And (Thorir of the Pass) sold the land at Meals to <hi rend="ital">Thorhalli</hi>,
      son of Gamli the <hi rend="ital">Widelander</hi>. His son was Gamli, who had to wife Ranveig,
      the daughter of Asmund Greyhaired.</p>
     <p>According to 'Landnáma,' this Gamli of Meals, Asmund's son-in, law, was son of Thord, and
      great-great-grandson of Thorhrolf or Thorolf Fastholding (Fasthadi), who settled lands on the
      north coast of Icefirthdeep (Isafjarðarjúp), and farmed at Snowfells (Snæfjöll). We have given
      Thorhall in our translation in both places as the man's name. Perhaps Þóraldr is nothing but a
      corruption of <hi rend="ital">Thor</hi>ólfr fasth<hi rend="ital">aldi</hi>; and Thorhalli
      again a corruption of the first. But Gamli the Vendlander or Widelander, we have no means of
      identifying.</p>
     <p>P. 30--'Now in those times there were wont to be large fire-halls at the homesteads.' The
      hall, <hi rend="ital">höll</hi>, <hi rend="ital">skáli</hi>, <hi rend="ital">stofa</hi>, was
      the principal room in every home. <hi rend="ital">Elda-skáli</hi>, or fire-hall, as the one
      alluded to at Biarg, was so called from its serving as a cooking-hall and a sitting-hall at
      once. The main features in the construction of a hall were the following: it was generally
      built from east to west, in an oblong form, having doors either at one or both ends through
      the south-side wall, where it met the gable end. These two entrances were called carles'-door
      and queens'-door (<hi rend="ital">karldyrr</hi>, <hi rend="ital">kvenndyrr</hi>), being
      respectively for the ingress and egress of men and women. Sometimes the men's-door was adorned
      with the beaks (<hi rend="ital">brandar</hi>) of a hewn-up ship, as was the case with the hall
      of Thorir of Garth, standing as door-posts on either side. The door led to a front-ball (<hi
       rend="ital">forkáli</hi>, <hi rend="ital">fortofa</hi>, <hi rend="ital">and-dyri</hi>, <hi
       rend="ital">framhús</hi>), <pb n="274"/> which, sometimes at least, seems to have been
      portioned off into an inner room (<hi rend="ital">klefi</hi>), or bay, and the vestibule
      proper. In the bay were kept victuals, such as dried fish, flour, and sometimes, no doubt,
      beer, Within, the hall fell into three main portions: the main hall, or the nave, and the
      aisles on either side thereof (<hi rend="ital">skot</hi>). The plan of the hall was much like
      that of one of our regular-built churches without chancel, say like a Suffolk Church of the
      fifteenth century, the nave being lighted by a clerestory, and the aisles running the whole
      way along the nave, and communicating behind the dais. These aisles were used for
      sleeping-places; so that along the whole length of the hall, and behind the dais, all was
      partitioned into bedsteads, open or locked,--open, that is to say, communicating with the nave
      by a doorless aperture,--locked, that is, shut out of view from the nave (<hi rend="ital"
       >lok-rekkja, lokhvíla</hi>).</p>
     <p>On the wall between nave and aisles which was covered with a panelling on its inside at
      least, were bung the shields and weapons of the chief and his retainers, or home-men.
      Sometimes it was painted with mythic subject, and adorned with fantastic carvings; on great
      occasions it was covered with hangings. Along both side-walls ran a row of seats, called
      benches (<hi rend="ital">bekkr</hi>), the north-mot of which, or the one which faced the sun,
      was called the nobler bench (<hi rend="ital">aðri bekkr</hi>), the south-most one, the less
      noble bench, <hi rend="ital">ú&#156;ðri bekkr</hi>. In the middle of either bench was a seat,
      called the high seat (<hi rend="ital">öndvegi</hi>); that of the nobler bench being occupied
      by the chief or head of the house, unless he had for his guest a man nobler than himself, in
      which case the latter took it; that of the less noble bench being allotted to the noblest
      among the guests. The nobler bench was on ordinary occasions the bench for the chief and the
      household. The less noble for the guests. In front of the chief's high-seat were the
      high-seat-poles which in the early ages of Paganism in the North were objects of much
      veneration, and must always accompany the chief if he moved his abode, and point out his new
      homestead, if he fared for it over sea, by the spot where they drifted ashore, as, when land
      was sighted, they were thrown overboard. In front of the seat-rows just described were placed
      the tables whereon the meals were put forth. And when the number of people exceeded the
      capacity of the ordinary benches, a new row of benches was placed in front of the tables, so
      that there were two rows of benches down along either side of the hall with the tables between
      them. The last-named rows of benches were called (<hi rend="ital">forsæti</hi>); and their
      occupiers, when seated at table, faced those of the upper and lower bench. In the centre of
      the hall, if of the fashion, as it probably was in early times, of a fire-hall, was a narrow
      oblong stone-pavement, probably as long as the rows of the benches, whereon fires were lit <pb
       n="275"/> for heating of the room, for cooking of food in some cases, and for the purpose of
      lighting up the hall. The smoke that rose from the burning fuel found its way out through the
      luffer or louvre, in the middle of the ridge of the roof (<hi rend="ital">ljójri</hi>); the
       <hi rend="ital">reyk-beri</hi>, reek-bearer, seems to have been a contrivance for creating
      draught to carry the smoke out through the <hi rend="ital">ljójri</hi>. In that end of the
      hall which was opposite to the entrance was the cross-bench, dais (<hi rend="ital"
      >pallr</hi>), occupied by the women. Here was also a high seat (<hi rend="ital">öndvegi á
       palli</hi>), which was generally taken by the mistress of the house, In our saga it seems
      that the hall of Sandheaps made an exception to this general rule, as it apparently had the
      dais immediately within the doorway.</p>
     <p>P. 77 (cpr. 110). It is worth observing here, that Thorvald, son of Asgeir Madpate the
      younger, dwells at As in Waterdale, about 1013, when Thorgils Makson was slain. When Grettir
      played, as a youth, on Midfirth-water (or <hi rend="ital">cca</hi>. 1010), he dwelt at
      Asgeirsriver. We mention this, because there has been some confusion about the matter. On the
      slight authority of the 'Þáttur af Isleifi biskupi,' Biskupa Sögur I. 54, it has been
      maintained that he dwelt at Asgeirsriver even as late as <hi rend="ital">cca</hi>. 1035, when
      his daughter, Dalla, was wooed by Isleif the Bishop. G. Vigfússon, 'Safn til Sögu Islands,' I.
      337. On the other hand, the statement of Hungrvaka that he farmed at As (<hi rend="ital"
       >i.e.</hi>, at the Ridge), at the time aforesaid, has given rise to the conjecture that
      thereby must be meant Valdar-As, a farm in Willowdale, near Asgeirsriver, the manor of the
      Madpate family. G. Vigfússon, in Biskupa Sögur, I. 61, note 2. It seems there is no need of
      setting aside the clear statement of our saga, that the As was As in Waterdale (see Index),
      and not Valdarás in Willowdale at all, or that Thorvald had, by 1013, moved up to the
      neighbouring country-side of Waterdale, and settled among the kin of his great-grand
      mother.</p>
     <p>P. 114, l. 1. 'The men of Meals,' would be a close translation of the original; but it is
      incorrect; for the men of Meals were Grettir's kin -in-law, and natural allies. The saga means
      the men of Meal, Kormak and his followers, and the original should be either 'Þeir Mel-menn,'
      or 'Mels-menn,' or 'Þeir Kormakr frá Mel.'</p>
     <p>P. 129, l. 10, 11. We have purposely altered the text from: en Þú öruggr í einangri, <hi
       rend="ital">i.e.</hi>, 'but thou stout in danger,' into: en Þó, i.e., 'but stout in danger
      none-the-less.' The former reading seems barely to give any sense, the last a natural and the
      required one.</p>
     <p>P. 169. Hallmund. Our saga is one among the historic sagas of Iceland which deals with
      traditions of ancient belief in the spirits of the unknown regions of the land that are
      interested in the well-being of the mere men who dwell near them. Hallmund and the giant
      Thorir <pb n="276"/> are the representatives of these powers in our saga. Of these Hallmund is
      the more interesting of the two, both for his human sympathies, his tragic end, and the poetry
      ascribed to him. At one time or other he has had a great name in the Icelandic folk-lore among
      the spirits of the land, the so-called land wights (<hi rend="ital">land-vættir</hi>), and
      there is still existing a poem of ancient type, the refrain of which is closely similar to
      that of Grettir's song on Hallmund, but which is stated to be by some cave-wight that lived in
      a deep and gloomy cavern somewhere in Deepfirth, on the north side of Broadfirth. In the
      so-called Bergbúa-Þáttr or cave-dweller's tale (Edited by G. Vigfússon in Nordiske
      Oldskrifter, xxvii., pp. 123-128, and 140-43, Copenhagen, 1860), this song is said to have
      been heard by two men, who, on their way to church, had lost their road, and were overtaken by
      the darkness of night, and, in order to escape straying too far out of their way, sought
      shelter under the lee of a sheer rock which chanced to be on their way. They soon found a
      mouth of a cave where they knew not that any cave was to be looked for, whereupon one of the
      wayfarers set up a cross-mark in the door of the cave, and then with his fellow-traveller sat
      down on two stones at the mouth of the cave, as they did not dare to risk themselves too far
      in the gloomy abode away from the cross. When the first third part of the night was spent they
      heard something come along from within the cave doorwards out to them.<note place="foot"
       >fn_19</note> They signed themselves with the sign of the cross, and prayed God's mercy to be
      on them, for they thought the doings within the deep of the cavern now grew big enough. On
      looking into the darkness they saw a sight like unto two full-moons, or huge targets, with
      some monstrous figure (unreadable in the MS.) between them. They thought this was nothing but
      two eyes, and that nowise narrow of face might he be who bore such torches. Next they heard a
      chanting of a monstrous kind and in a big voice, A lay there was sung of twelve staves, with
      the final refrain of each twice repeated.</p>
     <p>The poem seems to be a death-song over the cave-kin of the country by the new change of
      thought brought in by Christianity.</p>
     <p>P. 189. 'Grettir lay out that summer on Madderdale-heath, and in sundry places, and at
      whiles he was at Reek-heath.' A corroboration of the saga has been clearly set forth by the
      discovery of a Grettir's-lair, in Axefirth-peak, in 1862. True the saga passes over Grettir's
      doings <pb n="277"/> on these vast eastern wildernesses, but tradition has preserved the name
      for the place, and it shows by its construction and position that it must have been
      constructed by one skilled in choosing a good fighting stand, and a good and wide view at the
      same time. An Icelandic farmer has thus given an accurate and reliable description of
      Grettir's lair:</p>
     <p>'In the summer of 1850, when I came north to Axe-firth, I heard talk of a Grettir's lair
      upon Axefirth-peak . . . . . . Many who had seen it made a slight matter of it, which brought
      me to think it must have few peculiarities of antiquarian interest to show. But on the 7th of
      September, this summer (1862), I went with the rape-ruler Arni Jonsson of Wood-stead to
      inspect the lair. Walking up to it from the level ground below took us three minutes. The lair
      stands in the lower part of a slip of stones beneath some sheer rocks between a sandstone
      rock, called the carline, and the stone slip from the peak. It is built up of stones, straight
      as a line, and runs, 4 3/4 ells in length, 10 inches broad, and is, within walls, 7/8 of an
      ell deep. The half of it is deftly covered in with flat stones, the longest of which are 2
      ells 9 inches long, and about half an ell in thickness, and a little more in breadth. Small
      thin fragments of stone are wedged in between these where their junctures do not close tight,
      and so firmly are they fixed, that without instruments they may not be removed. One stone in
      the south wall is so large that we deemed it fully the task of from four to six men to move it
      when loose. The north side wall is beginning to give way, where the room is covered in. On the
      outside it is overgrown with black scurf and grey moss. The head end we deemed was the one
      which is turned to the rock and is not covered in, and evidently has been open from the
      beginning. Here the floor is overgrown with moss, grass, thyme, ferns, crow-foot, and
      lady's-mantle. In all likelihood the inmate has closed that part of the room in with hides,
      when needful. On sitting up, all who went to and fro oil the road below, must have been within
      view; not only those who came from the north of Foxplain (Melrakkaslèta) and Nupa-sveit, but
      also far toward the north he had a view even unto the open sea, nay, even unto Budlunga-haven.
      Looking southwards, he must have seen all who came up from the outer firth; for from the lair
      there is a clear view even unto Burn-river, Past which the high-road goes. A popular tradition
      says, too, that all who must needs pass this way, when Grettir was in the Peak, had taken at
      last to going over the top of the Peak, where there was no road, but the sheep-wilds of the
      Axefirthers. The lair-bider, even if he was set on by an overwhelming force, was not easily
      won, and least of all a man of such prowess as Grettir, except by shot; for he <pb n="278"/>
      might at a moment's notice take his stand in the rock above his bead, where one side only
      gives the chance of an onset, and where there is an ample supply of loose stones, large and
      small, on the Peak side of the rock to defend oneself; on three sides sheer rocks hem in the
      position, and those overhead are many times the height of a man's.'</p>
     <p>P. 208. Knave-game. Perhaps the truer rendering would have been 'nut-game,' if indeed 'hnet
      tafl' here stands not for 'hnef-tafl,' as we at first supposed. It is undoubtedly true that
      among the early games of Iceland the 'hettafl,' 'hnottafl,' was a distinct kind of game, as
      was also the 'hneftafl,' 'hnefatafl,' knave-game. If we follow the text as it stands the game
      that Thorbiorn played, is supposed to have borne some resemblance to what is now called in
      Iceland 'refskák,' fox-play, anglice 'fox and geese,' the aim of which is, by twelve pieces,
      called lambs, to bring the fox into such a position as to leave him no place to move, whichso
      way he turns.</p>
     <p>P. 240. Pied-belly we call the Ram, although the saga seems to mean that he was called
      'Autumn-belly,' which is a name of little, if of any, sense at all. We suppose that <hi
       rend="ital">haus-mögóttr</hi>, p. 16q, and <hi rend="ital">haust-magi</hi> p. 184, is one and
      the same thing, the I having spuriously crept into the text from a scribe's inadvertence.</p>
     <p>P. 243 (cpr. 207, 225, 272).--'In such wise Grettir lost his life, &amp;c.' The hardest
      thing to account for, or to bring to an intelligible issue in Grettir's saga, is the
      incongruity between the statements as to his age at his death and the number of years of his
      outlawry, as compared with the truthful account of the events told in the saga itself. From
      the time when Grettir slew his first man, all the events of the Saga may be traced clearly
      year for year up to his death, and their truthfulness is borne out whensoever they chance to
      run parallel to events mentioned in other trustworthy sagas, and they fall in with the right
      time nearly without an exception. But the statement on the page referred to above, that he was
      fourteen years old when he slew Skeggi, that he was twenty when he dealt with Glam;
      twenty-five when he fell into outlawry, and forty-four when he was slain, is utterly confuted
      by the chronology of the saga itself,</p>
     <p>These number,; given above are obviously made to fall in with the story in page 225 about
      the talk of the time of his outlawry at the Thing. The question is stated to have been this:
      whether he had been a fraction of the twentieth year an outlaw, his friends hoping that in
      such case a part might count <hi rend="ital">pro toto</hi>. But the truth of the matter was
      that he had neither been an outlaw for a fraction of the twentieth year, nor even for anything
      like nineteen years. He was outlawed at the Thing held in 1016, his year of outlawry dated
      from Thing to Thing; <pb n="279"/> this talk befell in 1031, consequently he had been full
      fifteen year, and no fraction of a year in outlawry. The story, therefore, of the twenty
      years, or nineteen years and a fraction, of outlawry falls utterly to the ground when brought
      to the test of the actual facts as recorded in the saga.</p>
     <p>But, despite of this, it is not to be supposed that this episode at the Thing in 1031 is
      brought in at random and without any cause. There are two obvious reasons for assigning twenty
      years to the length of Grettir's outlawry, and for bringing into the tale a discussion oil
      that subject just where it is done. The one we may call the reason of traditional belief, the
      other the reason of dramatic effect. Grettir was indisputably for all reasons the greatest of
      Icelandic outlaws, and the fond imagination of his biographers at all times urged them to give
      the longest endurance to the time of his outlawry above all outlaws, without inquiring closely
      as to whether it agreed with the saga itself or not. The other, or the dramatic motive, lies
      in bringing in the discussion on this long outlawry just at this particular Thing of 1031; for
      it was obviously the teller's object to suggest to the reader the hope of the great outlaw's
      legal restoration to the cherished society of man just before the falling of the crushing
      blow, in order to give an enhanced tragic interest to his end, and he undoubtedly succeeds in
      doing this. To these reasons, besides others less obvious, we imagine this main inconsistency
      in Grettir's saga is to be ascribed.</p>
     <p>Nevertheless, it is worth observing that blunders of scribes may have in a measure been at
      work here. If we are not mistaken most of the existing MSS. of our saga state that when he
      fell (p. 243) I he was one winter short of--<hi rend="ital">var hánum vetri fátt
      á</hi>--whatever number of years they give as his age. And we venture the suggestion that
      originally the passage ran thus: var hánum vetri fátt iv<hi rend="super">tugum</hi>,<note
       place="foot">fn_20</note>
      <hi rend="ital">i.e.</hi>, he lacked one winter of thirty-five years, when he was slain, If a
      subsequent scribe committed the easy blunder of dropping I before V, the reading of our
      original (Edition, 53) would be the natural result, and an offspring of that same blunder
      would also as easily be the other reading, common to one class of the Grettir MSS., var hánum
      vetri fátt í v<hi rend="super">tugum</hi> or í hinum v. tug, by dropping the syllable 'hálf.'
       <pb n="280"/> If the whole passage on page 243, beginning with the words quoted in the
      commencement of this note be not indeed a later interpolation, we believe that all that
      follows the words, 'till the time when he dealt with Glam, the Thrall,' must, indeed, be taken
      as an interpolation of later commentators.</p>
     <p>Our suggestion recommends itself in this at least, that it brings about full harmony between
      the statements, here treated of, and the saga itself, for when Grettir left the land in 1011
      he was fourteen years of age, and twenty years later, or 1031, he fell. How far his age thus
      given agrees or not with the decrepitude of his father, who died in 1015, having been
      apparently already a bedridden man for some time, is a matter of itself, and need not affect
      the accuracy of our suggestion, which, however, we only put forth as a conjecture, not having
      within reach the MSS. of Grettir's saga. A critical examination of these might, perhaps, allow
      of a more positive discourse on this vexed point, which to all commentators on Grettir has
      hitherto remained an insoluble riddle.</p>

      corrected agreeably to Landnáma, and other records of her family.</p>
