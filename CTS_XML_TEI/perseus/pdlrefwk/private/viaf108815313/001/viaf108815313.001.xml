        <head>Introduction to the Historical Overview in Perseus</head>
        <p>The Historical Overview provides a brief summary of the history of ancient Greece from
          approximately 1200 B.C., the period when Mycenaean civilization perished, to 323 B.C., the
          death of Alexander the Great. These limits were chosen to complement the emphasis of the
          Greek texts included in this version of Perseus, most of which fall between Homer and
          Aristotle. The epic poems <title>The Iliad</title> and <title>The Odyssey</title> of Homer
          were composed in the eighth century B.C., but their stories belong to the much earlier
          period of the Trojan War, which has often been dated to the years not long after 1200.
          Whether there ever was an actual Trojan War and, if so, when it took place, are questions
          still debated, as is the question of how much reliable historical information the Homeric
          epics may provide on this early period. The historical overview begins where it does in
          the hope that users of Perseus will find this background helpful in studying later Greek
          civilization, namely that of the Greek city-state (<term>polis</term> ). The
            <term>polis</term> began to emerge as a new form of social and political organization in
          the eighth century B.C., and the emphasis of the Overview is on the history of the
            <term>polis</term>, particularly during the fifth century (the so-called Golden Age of
          Athens, the largest and best documented of Greek city-states). The overview ends where it
          does because 323 has traditionally been identified as the end of the Classical period in
          ancient Greek history. After this date the monarchies founded by Alexander's successors
          tended to overshadow or even dominate the city-states in international politics. The
          significance of 323 as a turning point in Greek history is in fact just as problematic on
          several grounds as is the history of the Trojan War, but at least ending the Overview at
          this conventional date allows the survey to conclude roughly in the period of the life of
          the fourth-century philosopher and polymath Aristotle (died 322), who tutored the young
          Alexander for a while.</p>
        <p>There can be no such thing as an authoritative history of ancient Greece, not least
          because the surviving evidence is often so thin. Many interpretations expressed in the
          Overview obviously would not win universal assent, but not all such points of potential
          controversy can be marked in a survey that is meant to be brief. Users of Perseus should
          regard the Overview as a source intended to provide a series of jumping-off points for
          learning through discovery in the many other resources of Perseus.</p>
        <p><emph>NB</emph>: Users of Perseus are reminded that the Overview is under separate
          copyright and that use of the Overview is governed by the regulations pertaining to
          copyrighted material as well as by the terms of the Perseus licensing agreement.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="2">
        <head>Geographical and Historical Introduction</head>
        <p>This brief section is intended to serve as a jumping-off point for the Overview by
          providing a summary description of the physical environment of the Greek world and a very
          short sketch of the end of Mycenaean civilization, which had flourished in <emph>mainland

          </note> for several hundred years before the period following 1200 B.C., with which the
          main part of the Overview commences. The atlas in Perseus offers an alternative resource
          for understanding the landscape of Greece visually.</p>
        <div type="section" n="1">
          <head>The Landscape</head>
          <p>The Greek homeland lay in and around the Aegean Sea. This section of the Mediterranean
            Sea is dotted with numerous islands both large and small and flanked on the west by the
            land mass called the Balkan Peninsula, which today forms the territory of the modern
            nation of Greece, and flanked on the east by the coast of modern Turkey. Greeks also
            came to live in the western Mediterranean and on the coast of north Africa, and some of
            the most famous and prosperous of Greek cities were founded in southern Italy and on the
            island of <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> (an area commonly referred to
            by the Latin name “Magna Graecia”).</p>
          <p>The <emph>landscape of mainland <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName></emph><note>
              <bibl n="Thuc. 1.2.1">Thuc. 1.2.1</bibl>
            </note> is dominated by mountains, many of which run in ranges along the Balkan
            Peninsula in a northwest-southeast orientation. A chain of rugged peaks also fences
            Greece from the northern Balkan peninsula and the region that was <placeName
              key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName><note>
              <bibl n="PersEnc Macedonia">Perseus Encyclopedia entry for Macedonia</bibl>
            </note> in antiquity. Although none of the mountains wrinkling the landscape of the
            Greek mainland looms higher than 10,000 feet, their steep slopes were difficult to
            traverse and operated as barriers separating communities. Some regions, such as
              <emph>Thessaly</emph><note>
              <bibl n="PersEnc Thessaly">Perseus Encyclopedia entry for Thessaly</bibl>
            </note> in eastern central Greece, <emph>Messenia</emph><note><bibl n="PersEnc Messenia"

                from="Site|Region|Messenia" n="Messenian Sites" n="U"/></note> in
            southwestern Greece, the island of <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName><note>
              <bibl n="PersEnc Crete">Perseus Encyclopedia entry for Crete</bibl>
            </note> southeast of the mainland, and the island of Sicily, had large plains, but much
            of Greek territory lacked such large-scale open areas. Settlements tended to spring up
            where there were pockets of arable land nestled among the mountains or along the coast
            where good harbors could be found. Greece's rivers were practically useless for trade
            and communication because most of them slowed to a trickle during the many months each
            year during which little or no rainfall occurred.</p>

            Mediterranean Sea allowed Greek entrepreneurs to use it as a highway for contact with
            one another and for potentially lucrative international trade with, in particular, Egypt

          <p>The climate of Greece is what meteorologists call “Mediterranean,”
            meaning intermittent heavy rain during a few winter months and hot, dry summers. Snow
            falls on the upper ranges of the mountains in Greece, but most Greek communities
            received little snow. Winters could be cold and blustery, however. Since the amount of

            bust, with drought and flood both to be feared. Like the modern residents of southern

            today referred to as “palaces.” These structures held many rooms,
            often elaborately decorated with wall paintings, and were outfitted with luxuries like

            redistributed throughout the society on a predetermined scheme rather than through free
            markets. Writing, done in a syllabic script known today as Linear B, was used in
            Mycenaean society primarily to record the transactions of this process, and presumably
            only the scribes in charge of this record keeping knew how to write. Mycenaean society
            seems to have been hierarchical, with social differentiation among people marked by
            wealth, clothing, and titles. No written literature—prose or

        <head>The Early Greek Dark Age and Revival in the Near East</head>
        <p>Many city-states and kingdoms in the Near East and Greece were weakened or obliterated in
          the disruptions of the period 1200-1000 B.C., and these misfortunes brought grinding
          poverty to many of the people who did survive the troubles of this age. Enormous
          difficulties impede our understanding of the history of this troubled period and of the
          period of recovery that followed because few literary or documentary sources exist to
          supplement the incomplete information provided by archaeology. Both because conditions
          were so gloomy for so many people and because we have only a dim view of what happened in
          these years, it is customary to refer to the era beginning in the twelfth/eleventh
          centuries as a Dark Age: the fortunes of the people of the time seem generally dark, as
          does our understanding of the period. The Near East recovered its strength much sooner
          than did Greece, ending its Dark Age by around 900 B.C. The Greeks did not fully recover
          until perhaps a hundred and fifty years after that.</p>

          <head>The Loss of Writing</head>
          <p>The depressed economic conditions in Greece after the fall of Mycenaean civilization
            present a dramatic example of the desperately reduced circumstances of life which so
            many people in the Mediterranean and Near Eastern world had to endure during the worst
            years of the Dark Age. Mycenaean society collapsed because the complex economic system
            was destroyed on which its prosperity had depended. The most startling indication of the
            severe conditions of life in the early Dark Age is that the Greeks apparently lost their
            knowledge of writing when Mycenaean civilization was destroyed, although it has recently
            been suggested that the loss was not total. In any case, the loss of the common use of a
            technology as vital as writing is explicable because the linear B script used by the
            Mycenaeans was difficult to master and probably known only by a restricted group of
            specialists, the scribes who worked in the palaces keeping records. They employed
            writing only for recording the flow of goods into the palaces and then out again for
            redistribution. When the redistributive economy of Mycenaean Greece was destroyed, there
            was no longer a place for scribes or a need for writing. The oral transmission of the
            traditions of the past allowed Greek culture to survive this loss by continuing its
            stories and legends as valuable possessions passed on from generation to generation.

            than at the height of Mycenaean prosperity. No longer did powerful rulers ensconced in
            fortresses of stone preside over several towns and far-flung but tightly organized
            territories, with their redistributive economies providing a tolerable standard of
            living for farmers, herders, and a wide array of craft workers. The Greek ships filled
            with adventurers, raiders, and traders that had plied the Mediterranean during the
            second millennium now numbered a paltry few. Developed political states no longer
            existed in Greece in the early Dark Age, and people eked out their existence as herders,
            shepherds, and subsistence farmers bunched in tiny settlements as small as twenty people
            in most cases. Prosperous Mycenaean communities had been many times larger. Indeed, the
            entire Greek population was far smaller in the early Dark Age than it had been
            previously. As the population shrank, less land was cultivated, leading to a decline in
            the production of food. The decreased food supply in turn tended to encourage a further
            decline in the population. By reinforcing one another, these two processes multiplied
            their effects.</p>
          <p>The withering away of agriculture led more Greeks than ever before to herd animals as a
            larger part of their living in what remained nevertheless a complex agricultural
            economy. This increasingly pastoral way of life meant that people became more mobile
            because they had to be prepared to move their herds to new pastures once they had
            overgrazed their current location. If they were lucky, they might find a new spot that
            allowed them to grow a crop of grain if they stayed there long enough. As a result of
            this less-settled lifestyle, people built only simple huts as their houses and got along
            with few possessions. Unlike their Mycenaean forebears, Greeks in the Dark Age no longer
            had monumental architecture, and they ceased depicting people and animals in their

            communities were largely egalitarian. Archaeologists have recently analyzed evidence
            from burials, however, which suggests that Greek society had once again begun to develop
            a hierarchical system perhaps as early as 1050 B.C. The revival of a social hierarchy in
            Dark Age Greece clearly shows up in the tenth century B.C. at a site now known as
              <placeName key="perseus,Lefkandi">Lefkandi</placeName> on the island of Euboea, off
            the eastern coast of the Greek mainland. There archaeologists have discovered the richly
            furnished burials of a man and woman, who died about 950 B.C. Their riches included
            goods of Near Eastern manufacture and style, testifying to the ongoing contacts between
            Greece and the Near East in the Dark Age. These contacts deeply influenced Greek
            mythology and religion as well as commerce. The dead woman wore elaborate gold ornaments
            that testify to her exceptional wealth. The couple were buried under a building more
            than 150 feet long with wooden columns on the exterior. The striking architecture and
            riches of their graves suggest that they enjoyed high social status during their lives
            and perhaps received a form of ancestor worship after their death. Such wealthy and
            powerful people were probably still few in number at this date, but their existence at
            Lefkandi proves that marked social differentiation had once again emerged in the Greek
            world. Stresses in this hierarchical organization of Greek society, as we shall see,
            were to set the stage for the emergence of Greece's influential new political form, the
            self-governing city-state of free citizens.</p>

      <div type="chapter" n="4">
        <head>Remaking Greek Civilization</head>
        <p>In Greece, the Dark Age of depopulation and poverty persisted longer than in the Near
          East. Although Greek economic improvement is evident as early as about 900 B.C., it was
          not until the period around 750 B.C. that political states, now of a new kind, developed
          again and the Dark Age can be seen as ended. The obscure history of Greece in years
          between these general dates laid the foundation for the pronounced social, political, and
          intellectual changes associated with the creation of the Greek city-state. Throughout this
          period, continued contact with the Near East greatly influenced Greece, not only in
          commerce and trade but also in the exchange of ideas. Entrepreneurs from the Near East
          apparently often made their way to Greece, bringing with them both the knowledge of new
          technologies, such as iron working, and of ideas that Greeks took over and made their own
          in mythology and religion.</p>
        <div type="section" n="1">
          <head>The Start of Economic Revival</head>
          <p>The evidence from burials shows that Greeks in more and more locations had become
            conspicuously wealthy by about 900 B.C. A hierarchical arrangement of society was
            evidently spreading throughout Greece, and the few men and women at the pinnacle of
            society had the riches to have expensive material goods placed in their tombs with them.
            In the earlier part of the Dark Age, the best grave offerings a dead person could expect
            were a few clay pots. The exceptional contents of rich graves point to significant
            economic changes already under way by the ninth century B.C.</p>

          <head>Technological Change: Using Iron</head>
          <p>Metallurgical technology eventually helped bring about the end of the Greek Dark Age.
            Archaeology allows us to see this trend, as in the evidence from the burial of a male
            about 900 B.C., which consisted of a pit into which was placed a clay pot to hold the
            dead man's cremated remains. Surrounding the pot were metal weapons including a long
            sword, spearheads, and knives. The inclusion of weapons of war in a male grave was a
            continuation of the burial traditions of the Mycenaean Age, but these arms were forged
            from iron, not bronze, which had been the primary metal of the earlier period (often
            referred to therefore as the Bronze Age). This difference reflects a significant shift
            in metallurgy, which took place throughout the Mediterranean region during the early
            centuries of the first millennium B.C.: iron displacing bronze as the principal metal
            used to make tools and weapons. Greeks probably <emph>learned to work iron</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Hes. Th. 862">Hes. Th. 862</bibl>
            </note> from voyaging Near Eastern entrepreneurs who brought their skills with them from
            their homelands. The island of Cyprus seems to have been particularly important as a
            place where this new technology developed and then was passed on to other places further
            west. In keeping with the habit of characterizing periods of history from the name of
            the metal most used at the time, the Dark Age can also be referred to as the Early Iron
            Age in Greece.</p>
          <p>The Greeks, like others in the Near East, turned to iron because they could no longer

          <p>Better and more plentiful farming implements of iron eventually helped to increase the

            This grave, from about 850 B.C., held the remains of a woman and her treasures,
            including gold rings and earrings, a necklace of glass beads, and an unusual chest of
            baked clay. The necklace was an imported item from Egypt or Syria, and the technique of

            increased as the Dark Age came to an end in the next century. The most intriguing object
            from the burial is the woman's terracotta storage chest. It was painted with
            characteristically intricate and regular designs, whose precision has led modern art
            historians to give the name Geometric to this style of the late Dark Age. On its top
            were sculpted five beehive-like urns that are miniature models of granaries (structures
            for storing <emph>grain</emph><note><xptr type="Coin" from="Dewing 380" n="Dewing 380"

            objects of special value, we can deduce that actual granaries and the grain they held
            were valuable commodities in real life. This deduction in turn means that already by 850
            B.C. agriculture had begun to recover from its devastation in the early Dark Age, when
            herding animals had become more prevalent and cultivation had decreased. Whether the
            woman was the owner of grain fields we cannot know, but from her sculpted chest we can
            glimpse the significance of farming for her and her contemporaries.</p>

          <head>Repopulation</head>
          <p>Increased agricultural production in this period accompanied a growth in population. It
            is impossible to determine whether a rise in population preceded and led to the raising
            of more grain or, conversely, whether improvements in agricultural technology and the
            placing of more fields under cultivation spurred a consequent growth in the population
            by increasing the number of people the land could support. These two developments
            reinforced one another: as the Greeks produced more food, the better-fed population
            reproduced faster, and as the population grew, more people could produce more food. The
            repopulation of Greece in the late Dark Age established the demographic conditions under
            which the new political forms of Greece were to emerge.</p>

            best.” Although the use of this term is traditional in accounts of ancient
            Greek history, it is important to remember that “aristocracy” in
            this context does not mean what it often means in,for example, French or English
            history. That is, ancient Greece never had an aristocracy that was an officially
            recognized nobility, whose members inherited their status regardless of their wealth or
            other socio-economic characteristics. Rather, the term as used in ancient Greek history
            refers to the social elite, whose status depended on a combination of factors, of which
            wealth and public conduct were very important. When one speaks of a Greek aristocrat,
            then, it is crucial to understand this designation as meaning “a member of the
            social elite.” Aristocrats in ancient Greece seem to have possessed more
            wealth than others in their communities, but birth was also a criterion in their
            enjoying general acknowledgment as the “best” in their society
            — that is, the people with the greatest social status and political influence.
            We can only speculate about the various ways in which families might have originally
            gained their designation as aristocratic and thus became entitled to pass on this status
            to those born into them. Some aristocratic families in the Dark Age might have inherited
            their status as descendants of the most prominent and wealthy families of the Mycenean
            Age; some might have made themselves aristocrats during the Dark Age by amassing wealth
            and befriending less fortunate people who were willing to acknowledge their benefactors'
            superior status in return for material help; and some might have acquired aristocratic
            status by monopolizing control of essential religious rituals.</p>

            self were beginning to be channeled into a new context appropriate for a changing
            society. This sort of assertion of the importance of communal interests was another

            poet from the region of Boeotia in central Greece, employed myth to reveal the divine
            origin of justice. His long poem <title>The Theogony</title> (“The Genealogy
            of the Gods”) details the birth of the race of gods from primordial Chaos
            (“void” or “vacuum”) and Earth, the mother of
            Sky and numerous other children. This myth about the succession of the gods owed its
            inspiration to Near Eastern myths, another example of the importance of contact with
            that region for the cultural as well as economic development of Greece as it emerged
            from its Dark Age. Hesiod explained that, when Sky began to imprison his siblings, Earth
            persuaded her fiercest male offspring, Kronos, to overthrow him by violence because

          <p>Aristocratic men dominated the distribution of justice in Dark Age society. They
            exercised direct control over their family members and household servants. Others
            outside their immediate households would become their followers by acknowledging the
            aristocrats' status as leaders. An aristocrat's followers would grant him a certain
            amount of authority because, as the followers were roughly equal in wealth and status
            among themselves, they needed a figure invested with authority to settle disputes and
            organize defense against raids or other military threats. In anthropological terms,
            aristocrats operated as <emph>chiefs of bands</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Hom. Il. 18.503">Hom. Il. 18.503</bibl>

            duties, oversaw the distribution of rewards and punishments, and usually headed the
            religious rituals deemed essential to the security of the group. At the same time, a
            chief's actual power to coerce unwilling members of his band was limited. When decisions
            affecting the entire group had to be made, his leadership depended on being capable of
            forging a consensus by persuading members of the band about what to do. The poet Hesiod
            describes how an effective chief exercised leadership: <emph>“When his people
              in their assembly get on the wrong track, he gently sets matters right, persuading
              them with soft words.”</emph><note>

            </note> provides a fictional illustration of the kind of abusive aristocratic behavior
            that chiefs could exhibit in the period before the city-state emerged. According to the
              <title>Iliad</title>, when Agamemnon, the aristocratic leader of the Greek army
            besieging Troy, summoned the troops to announce a decision to prolong the war, now in
            its tenth year, an ordinary soldier named Thersites spoke up in opposition. Thersites
            could express his opinion because Agamemnon led the Greeks as a Dark Age chief led a
            band, which required that all men's opinions be heard with respect. Thersites criticized
            Agamemnon as unjustly greedy. “Let's leave him here to digest his
            booty,” Thersites shouted to his fellow soldiers in the ranks. Odysseus,
            another chief, immediately rose up to support Agamemnon, saying to Thersites,
            “If I ever find you being so foolish again, may my head not remain on my body
            if I don't strip you naked and send you back to your ship crying from the blows I give
            you.” Odysseus thereupon cowed Thersites with a blow to his back, which drew
            blood.</p>
          <p>In this fictional episode, the assembled soldiers approve of Odysseus' inequitable
            treatment of Thersites, who admittedly speaks without moderation or tact. For the
            city-state to be created as a political institution in which all free men had a stake,
            the idea that all men had the right to speak their minds, even rudely, had to emerge in
            the real world. Non-aristocratic men had to insist that they deserved equitable
            treatment, even if aristocrats were to remain in leadership positions and carry out the
            policies agreed on by the group. </p>

            of small farms, who might own a slave or two, oxen to work their fields, and other
            movable property of value) in the eighth century. Their property made peasants the most
            influential group among the men ranging from poor to moderately well-off who made up the
            bands of followers of aristocratic chiefs in late Dark Age Greece. Assuming the
            perspective of a peasant farming a small holding, the poet insisted that the divine
            origin of justice should be a warning to <emph>“bribe-devouring

        <p>The term Archaic Age, meaning the “Old-Fashioned Age” and designating
          Greek history from approximately 750 to 500 B.C., stems from art history. Modern scholars
          of Greek art judged the style of works from this period as looking more old fashioned than
          the more naturalistic art of the following period (the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.),
          which they saw as producing models of beauty and therefore named the Classical Age.
          Archaic sculptors, for example, made free-standing figures who stood stiffly, staring
          straight ahead in imitation of Egyptian statuary. By the Classical Age, sculptors depicted
          their subjects in more varied and lively poses. During the Archaic Age the Greeks
          developed the most widespread and influential of their new political forms, the

            hundred years, Greek colonies were established in areas that are today southern France,
            Spain, Sicily and southern Italy, and along North Africa and the coast of the Black Sea.
            Eventually the Greek world had perhaps as many as 1,500 different city-states. A

            building commercially-motivated settlements throughout the western Mediterranean. Within

            settlement on the site of modern Cadiz in Spain had become a city thriving on economic
            and cultural interaction with the indigenous Iberian population. </p>

          <p>Like other peoples of the eastern Mediterranean, Greeks also established their own
            trading posts abroad. Traders from Euboea, for instance, had already established
            commercial contacts by 800 B.C. with a community located on the Syrian coast at a site
            now called Al Mina. Men wealthy enough to finance risky expeditions by sea ranged far

            entrepreneurial commodity trading. In the <title>Odyssey</title> , the goddess Athena
            once appears disguised as a metal trader to hide her identity from the son of the poem's
            hero: <emph>“I am here at present,” she says to him, “with

          <p>Commercial interests perhaps first induced Greeks to emigrate, but greater numbers of

            the population explosion in the late Dark Age had caused a scarcity of land available

            Africa) in about 630 B.C. reveals how full of tensions the process of colonization could
            be. The people of the <term>polis</term> of Thera, on an island north of Crete,
            apparently were unable to support their population. Sending some people out as colonists
            to Cyrene therefore made sense as a solution to population pressures. A later
            inscription purports to tells us what happened at the time of colonization and reveals
            the urgency of the situation at the time: “One adult son [from each family] is
            to be conscripted....If any man is unwilling to leave when the <term>polis</term> sends
            him, he shall be subject to the death penalty and his property shall be
            confiscated.” (M. Crawford and D. Whitehead, <title>Archaic and Classical
              Greece: A Selection of Ancient Sources in Translation</title>, Cambridge, 1983, no.
            16B) Evidently the young men of Thera were reluctant to leave their home for the new
            colony. This evidence shows, then, that colonization in response to population growth
            was not always a matter of individual choice of the people feeling the pressure. The
            possibility of acquiring land in a colony on which a man could perhaps grow wealthy
            obviously had to be weighed against the terrors of being torn from family and friends to
            voyage over treacherous seas to regions filled with unknown dangers. Greek colonists had
            reason to be scared about their future. Moreover, in some cases, colonies were founded
            to rid the metropolis of undesirables whose presence was causing social unrest. The

          <p>The participation of Greeks in international trade and in colonization increased their
            contact with the peoples of Anatolia, Egypt, and the Near East. They admired and envied
            these older civilizations of the eastern Mediterranean for their wealth, such as the
            gold of the Phrygian kingdom of <emph>Midas</emph><note>

            </note>, and their cultural accomplishments, such as the lively pictures of animals on
            Near Eastern ceramics, the magnificent temples of Egypt, and the alphabets of the
            Phoenician cities. During the early Dark Age, Greek artists had stopped portraying
            people or other living creatures in their designs. The pictures they saw on pottery
            imported from the Near East in the late Dark Age and early Archaic Age influenced them
            to begin once again to depict figures in their paintings on pots. The style of Near
            Eastern reliefs and free-standing sculptures also inspired creative imitation in Greek
            art of the period. When the improving economy of the later Archaic Age allowed Greeks to
            revive monumental architecture in stone, temples for the worship of the gods emulating
            Egyptian architectural designs represented the most prominent examples of this new trend
            in erecting large, expensive buildings. The Greeks began to mint coins in the sixth
            century B.C., a technology they learned from the Lydians, <emph>who invented coinage in
              the seventh century</emph><note>

            </note>. Long after this innovation, however, much economic exchange continued to be

            centuries to develop.</p>
          <p>Knowledge of writing was the most dramatic contribution of the ancient Near East to
            Greece as it emerged from its Dark Age. The Greeks probably originally learned the

            well, but they soon started to employ it to record literature such as Homeric poetry.
            Since the ability to read and write remained unnecessary for most purposes in the
            predominately agricultural economy of archaic Greece and there were no schools, few
            people at first learned the new technology of letters.</p>

            Since ships plying the east-west sea lanes of the Mediterranean preferred to avoid the
            stormy passage around the tip of southern Greece, they commonly off-loaded their cargoes
            for transshipment on a special roadbed built across the isthmus and subsequent reloading
            on different ships on the other side. Small ships may even have been dragged over the

            operated for a limited number of days over nine months of the year, and demand for its

            a clear interpretation of this complex process is that the surviving evidence for the
            change mainly concerns Athens, which was not a typical city-state in significant
            aspects, as in the large size of its population. Much of what we can say about the
            reasons for the emergence of the city-state therefore applies solely to Athens. Other
            city-states certainly emerged under varying conditions and with different results.
            Nevertheless, it seems possible to draw some general conclusions about the slow process
            through which city-states began to emerge starting around 750 B.C.</p>
          <p>The economic revival of the Archaic Age and the growth in the population of Greece
            evident by the eighth century B.C. certainly gave momentum to the process. Men who
            managed to acquire substantial property from success in agriculture or commerce could
            now demand a greater say in political affairs from the hereditary aristocrats, who
            claimed status based on their family lines. Theognis of Megara, a sixth-century poet
            whose verses also reflect earlier conditions, gave voice to the distress of aristocrats
            at the emergence of new avenues to social and political influence: “... men
            today prize possessions, and noble men marry into “bad” [that is,
            non-aristocratic] families and “bad” men into noble families. Riches
            have mixed up lines of breeding ... and the good breeding of the citizens is becoming
            obscured.” The increase in population in this era probably came mostly in the
            ranks of the non-aristocratic poor. Such families raised more children, who could help
            to farm more land, which had been empty for the taking after the depopulation of the
            early Dark Age. <emph>Like the Zeus of Hesiod's <title>Theogony</title> , who acted in
              response to the injustice of Kronos</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Hes. Th. 501">Hes. Th. 501</bibl>
            </note>, the growing number of poorer non-aristocrats apparently reacted against what
            they saw as unacceptable inequity in the leadership of aristocrats, who sometimes acted
            as if they were petty kings in their local territory and dispensed what seemed
              <emph>“crooked”</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Hes. WD 264">Hes. WD 264</bibl>
            </note> justice to those with less wealth and power. This concern for equity and

            the population.</p>

            the concept of citizenship as the basis for the city-state and the extension of citizen
            status to non-aristocrats responded to that demand. Citizenship above all carried
            certain legal rights, such as access to courts to resolve disputes, protection against

            requirement that reveals their inequality under the law. The traditional paternalism of
            Greek society—men acting as “fathers” to regulate the
            lives of women and safeguard their interests as defined by men—demanded that

          <head>The so-called Hoplite Revolution</head>
          <p>Despite the only limited equality characteristic of the Greek city-state, the creation
            of this new form of political organization nevertheless represented a significant break
            with the past, and the extension of at least some political rights to the poor stands as
            one of the most striking developments in this process of change. Unfortunately we cannot
            identify with certainty the forces that led to the emergence of the <term>polis</term>
            as a political institution in which even poor men had a vote on political matters. The
            explanation long favored by many makes a so-called hoplite revolution responsible for
            the general widening of political rights in the city-state, but recent research has
            undermined the plausibility of this theory as a completely satisfactory explanation.

            </note>, and they constituted the main strike force of the citizen militias that
            defended Greek city-states in the period before navies became important. Men armed as
            hoplites marched into combat shoulder to shoulder in a rectangular formation called a
              <emph>phalanx</emph><note>
              <xptr type="EnglishClassicsSearch" from="phalanx" n="References to phalanx"
                n="U"/>
            </note>. Staying in line and working as part of the group was the secret to successful
            phalanx tactics. A good hoplite, in the words of the seventh-century B.C. poet
            Archilochus, was “a short man firmly placed upon his legs, with a courageous
            heart, not to be uprooted from the spot where he plants his feet.” Greeks had
            fought in phalanxes for a long time, but until the eighth century B.C., only aristocrats
            and a relatively small number of their non-aristocratic followers could afford the
            equipment to serve as hoplites. In the eighth century B.C., however, a growing number of
            men had become sufficiently prosperous to buy metal weapons, especially since the use of
            iron had made them more readily available. Presumably these new hoplites, since they
            paid for their own equipment and trained hard to learn phalanx tactics to defend their
            community, felt they, too, were entitled to political rights. According to the theory of
            a hoplite revolution, these new hoplite-level men forced the aristocrats to share
            political power by threatening to refuse to fight and thereby cripple the community's
            military defense.</p>
          <p>The theory correctly assumes that new hoplites had the power to demand an increased
            political say for themselves, a development of great significance for the development of
            the city-state as an institution not solely under the power of a small circle of
            aristocrats. The theory of a hoplite revolution cannot explain, however, one crucial
            question: why were poor men as well as hoplites given the political right of voting on
            policy in the city-state?</p>

          <head>Non-hoplites as Citizens</head>
          <p>Most men in the new city-states were too poor to qualify as hoplites. It is usually
            assumed that poor men most likely could contribute little to military defense because
            they lacked hoplite armor and metal weapons and Greek armies at this date made scant use
            of <emph>light-armed troops</emph><note><bibl n="Hdt. 7.158.4">Hdt. 7.158.4</bibl>,

            </note>. Nor had the Greeks developed navies yet, the military service for which poor
            men would provide the manpower in later times when a fleet was a city-state's most
            effective weapon. If being able to make a contribution to the city-state's defense as a

            </note> was the only grounds for meriting the political rights of citizenship, the
            aristocrats along with the old and new hoplites had no obvious reason to grant poor men
            the right to vote on important matters. Yet poor men did become politically empowered
            citizens in many city-states, with some variations on whether a man had to own a certain
            amount of land to have full political rights or whether eligibility for higher public
            offices required a certain level of income. In general, however, all male citizens,
            regardless of their level of wealth, eventually were entitled to attend, speak in, and
            cast a vote in the <emph>communal assemblies</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 19">Aristoph. Ach. 19</bibl>
            </note> in which policy decisions for the city-states were made. That poor men gradually
            came to participate in the assemblies of the city-states means they were citizens

            development of the city-state above all because it cannot account for the extension of
            this right to the poor. Furthermore, the emergence of large numbers of men wealthy
            enough to afford hoplite armor seems to belong to the middle of the seventh century
            B.C., well after the period when the city-state as an innovative form of political
            organization was first coming into existence.</p>

            free poor—the workers in agriculture, trade, and crafts—contributed
            much to the economic strength of the city-state, but it is hard to see how their value

              <bibl n="Hdt. 2.167.2">Hdt. 2.167.2</bibl>

            society certainly did not extend the rights of citizenship to the poor out of any
            romanticized vision of poverty as spiritually noble. As one contemporary put it,
            “Money is the man; no poor man ever counts as good or honorable.”
            One significant boost to extending political rights to the poor perhaps came from the
            sole rulers, called <emph>tyrants</emph><note>
              <bibl n="TRM OV 6.16">TRM OV 6.16</bibl>
            </note>, who seized power for a time in some city-states and whose history will be
            discussed subsequently. Tyrants could have used grants of citizenship to poor or
            disenfranchised men as a means of marshaling popular support for their regimes. Another,
            more speculative possibility is that the aristocrats and <emph>hoplites</emph><note>
              <bibl n="TRM OV 5.16">TRM OV 5.16</bibl>
            </note> had simply become less cohesive as a political group in this period of dramatic
            change, thereby weakening opposition to the growing idea that it was unjust to exclude
            the poor from political participation. When the poor agitated for power in the citizen
            community, on this view, there would have been no united front of aristocrats and
            hoplites to oppose them, making compromise necessary to prevent destructive civil
            unrest. Or it may be that we underestimate the significance of lightly-armed combatants
            in the eighth century, when hoplites were presumably not as numerous as in later times
            and perhaps the sheer force of the numbers of poor men—wielding staves,
            throwing rocks, employing farming implements as weapons—could have helped
            their city-state's contingent of hoplites to sway the tide of battle against an opposing
            force.</p>

            Aristocrats continued to be powerfully influential in Greek politics even after

            non-aristocratic men came to enjoy in city-states constituted the most remarkable

            This process was gradual, as city-states certainly did not suddenly emerge fully formed
            around 750 B.C. Three hundred years after that date, for example, the male citizens of

            members of the owners' households. They live under virtually the same conditions as
            their superiors and enjoy a family life of their own. If the language of this poetry

          <head>The Synergy between Slavery and Freedom</head>
          <p>The creation of citizenship as a category to define membership in the exclusive group
            of people constituting a <term>polis</term> inevitably highlighted the contrast between
            those included in the category of citizens and those outside it. Freedom from control by
            others was a necessary precondition to become a citizen with full political rights,
            which in the city-states meant being a free-born adult male. The strongest contrast
            citizenship produced, therefore, was that between free and unfree. In this way, the
            development of a clear idea of personal freedom in the formation of the city-state as a
            new political form may ironically have encouraged the complementary development of
            chattel slavery in the Archaic Age. The rise in economic activity in this period
            probably also encouraged the importation of slaves by increasing the demand for labor.
            In any case, slavery as it developed in the Archaic Age reduced unfree persons to a
            state of absolute dependence; they were the property of their owners. As Aristotle later

            meaningless sounds “bar, bar.” Greeks, like Thracians and other
            slave-holding peoples, found it easier to enslave people whom they considered different
            from themselves and whose ethnic and cultural otherness made it easier to disregard
            their shared humanity. Greeks also enslaved fellow Greeks, however, especially those
            defeated in war, but these Greek slaves were not members of the same <term>polis</term>
            as their masters. Rich families prized Greek slaves with some education because they
            could be made to serve as tutors for children, for whom there were no publicly-financed
            schools in this period.</p>

          <head>The Extent of Slavery</head>
          <p>Chattel slavery became widespread in Greece only after about 600 B.C. Eventually,
            slaves became cheap enough that <emph>people of moderate means could afford one or

            slaves like those who maintained Rome's water system under the Roman Empire or worked
            large plantations in the southern United States before the American Civil War.
            Maintaining a large number of slaves year around in ancient Greece would have been
            uneconomical because the cultivation of the crops grown there called for short periods
            of intense labor punctuated by long stretches of inactivity, during which slaves would
            have to be fed even while they had no work to do.</p>
          <p>By the fifth century B.C., however, the number of slaves in some city-states had grown
            to as much as one-third of the total population. This percentage still means that most
            labor was performed by small land-owners and their families themselves, sometimes hiring
            free workers. The special system of <emph>slavery in Sparta</emph><note>

            child, perhaps as young as five. The betrothal was an important public event conducted
            in the presence of witnesses. The guardian on this occasion repeated the phrase that

            urgency in the reduced economic circumstances of the Dark Age. Hesiod, for instance,

            so that he can sire children to serve as his support system in his waning years and to
            preserve his holdings after his death by inheriting them. Women, according to Greek

        <head>The Late Archaic City-State</head>
        <p>Although the Greek city-states differed among themselves in size and natural resources,
          over the course of the Archaic age they came to share certain fundamental political
          institutions and social traditions: citizenship, slavery, the legal disadvantages and
          political exclusion of women, and the continuing influence of aristocrats in society and
          politics. During this time, however, different city-states developed these shared
          characteristics in strikingly different ways. Monarchy had died out in Greece with the end
          of Mycenaean civilization, except for the dual kingship that existed in Sparta as part of
          its complex oligarchic system rather than as a monarchy in the ordinary sense. In Sparta
          and some other Greek city-states, only a rather restricted number of men exercised
          meaningful political power (thus creating a political system called an oligarchy, meaning
          “rule by the few.”) Other city-states experienced periods of
          domination by the kind of sole ruler who seized power in unconstitutional fashion and whom
          the Greeks called a tyrant. Tyranny, passed down from father to son, existed at various
          times across the breadth of the Greek world from city-states on the island of Sicily in
          the west to Samos off the coast of Ionia in the east. Still other city-states created
          early forms of democracy (“rule by the people”) by giving all male
          citizens the power to participate in governing. Assemblies of men with some influence on
          the king had existed in certain early states in the ancient Near East, but Greek democracy
          broke new ground with the amount of political power that it invested in its male citizen
          body. The Athenians established Greece's most renowned democracy, in which the individual
          freedom of citizens flourished to a degree unprecedented in the ancient world. By
          examining these different paths of political and social development, we can grasp the
          great challenge faced by the Greeks as they struggled to construct a new way of life
          during the Archaic Age. In the course of this struggle, they also began to formulate new
          ways of understanding the physical world, their relations to it, and their relationships
          with each other.</p>

            after one village began to serve as the center of the new city-state. One apparent
            result of the compromises required to forge Spartan unity was that the Spartans retained
            not one but two hereditary military leaders of high prestige, whom they called kings.

            the leaders of the two dominant villages, served as the religious heads of Sparta and
            commanders of its army. The kings did not enjoy unfettered power to make decisions or
            set policy, however, because they operated not as pure monarchs but as leaders of the
            oligarchic institutions that governed the Spartan city-state. Rivalry between the two
            royal families periodically led to fierce disputes, and the initial custom of having two
            supreme military commanders also paralyzed the Spartan army when the kings disagreed on
            strategy in the middle of a military campaign. The Spartans therefore eventually decided
            that the army on campaign would be commanded by only one king at a time.</p>

            to an assembly of all free adult males. This assembly had only limited power to amend
            the proposals put before it; mostly it was expected to approve the council's plans.
            Rejections were rare because the council retained the right to withdraw a proposal when
            the reaction to it by the crowd in the assembly presaged a negative vote. “If
            the people speak crookedly,” according to Spartan tradition, “the
            elders and the leaders of the people shall be withdrawers [of the proposal].”

            evolved their law-based political system during the period from about 800 to 600 B.C.
            Unlike other Greeks, the Spartans never had their laws written down. Instead, they
            preserved their system from generation to generation with a distinctive, highly
            structured way of life based on a special economic foundation.</p>

            had conquered in war and enslaved to exploit economically but who outnumbered them
            greatly. To maintain their position of superiority over their conquered neighbors, from
            whom they derived their subsistence, Spartan men had to turn themselves into a society
            of soldiers constantly on guard. They accomplished this transformation by a radical
            restructuring of traditional family life enforced by strict adherence to the laws and
            customs governing practically all aspects of behavior. Through constant, daily
            reinforcement of their strict code of values, the Spartans ensured their survival
            against the enemies they had created by subjugating their neighbors. The seventh-century
            poet Tyrtaeus, whose verses exemplify the high quality of the poetry produced in early
            Sparta before its military culture began to exclude such accomplishments, expressed that
            code in his ranking of martial courage as the supreme male value: “I would
            never remember or mention in my work any man for his speed afoot or wrestling skill, not
            if he was as huge and strong as a Cyclops or could run faster than the North Wind, nor
            more handsome than Tithonus or richer than Midas or Cinyras, nor more kingly than
            Pelops, or had speech more honeyed than Adrastus, not even if he possessed every

            of a soldier on campaign. For example, they were not allowed to speak at will. (Our word

              (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">sussition</foreign>), each of which had about fifteen members.
            If not blackballed when he applied, the new member was admitted on the condition that he
            contribute a regular amount of barley, cheese, figs, condiments, and wine to the mess
            from the produce provided by the <term>helots</term> working on his family plot. Some
            meat was apparently contributed, too, because Spartan cuisine was infamous for a black,
            bloody broth of pork condemned as practically inedible by other Greeks. Perhaps it was
            made from the wild boars Spartan men loved to hunt, an activity for which messmates were
            formally excused from the compulsory communal meals. If any member failed to keep up his
            contributions, he was expelled from the mess and lost his full citizen rights. The
            experience of spending so much time in these common messes schooled Sparta's young men
            in the values of their society. There they learned to call all older men
              <emph>“father”</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Xen. Const. Lac. 6.1">Xen. Const. Lac. 6.1-2</bibl>
            </note> to emphasize that their primary loyalty was to the group and not to their
            genetic families. There they were chosen to be the special favorites of males older than
            themselves to build bonds of affection, including physical love, for others at whose
            side they would have to march into deadly battle. There they learned to take the rough
            joking of army life for which Sparta was well known. In short, the common mess took the
            place of a boy's family and school when he was growing up and remained his main social
            environment once he had reached adulthood. Its function was to mold and maintain his
            values consistent with the demands of the one honorable occupation for Spartan men: a
            soldier obedient to orders. Tyrtaeus enshrined the Spartan male ideal in his poetry:
            “Know that it is good for the <term>polis</term> and the whole people when a
            man takes his place in the front row of warriors and stands his ground without
            flinching.”</p>

            Greeks regarded it as scandalous that Spartan girls exercised with boys and did so
            wearing minimal clothing. Women at Sparta were supposed to use the freedom from labor
            provided by the helot system to keep themselves physically fit to bear healthy children
            and raise them to be strict upholders of Spartan values. A metaphorical formulation of
            the male ideal for Spartan women appears, for example, in the poetry of Alcman in the
            late seventh century, who wrote songs for the performances of female and male choruses
            that were common on Spartan civic and religious occasions. The dazzling leader of a
            women's chorus, he writes, “stands out as if among a herd of cows someone
            placed a firmly-built horse with ringing hooves, a prize winner from winged

            women with property enjoyed special status as a result of the Spartan law forbidding the
            division of the portion of land originally allotted to a family. This law meant that, in
            a family with more than one son, all the land went to the eldest son. Fathers with
            multiple sons therefore needed to seek out brides for their younger sons who had
            inherited land and property from their fathers because they had no brother surviving.

            power by force rather than inheriting it like legitimate kings, they then established
            family dynasties to maintain their tyranny, with sons inheriting their fathers' position

            coups. In places where propertyless men may have lacked citizenship or at least felt
            substantially disenfranchised in the political life of the city-state, tyrants perhaps
            won adherents by extending citizenship and other privileges to these groups. Tyrants

            by becoming popular with the masses: “he became one of the most admired of
            Corinth's citizens because he was courageous, prudent, and helpful to the people, unlike
            the oligarchs in power, who were insolent and violent,” according to a later
            historian. Cypselus engineered the overthrow of Bacchiad rule with popular support and a
            favorable oracle from Delphi. He then ruthlessly suppressed rival aristocrats, but his
            popularity with the people remained so high that he could govern without the protection
            of a bodyguard. Corinth added to its economic strength during Cypselus' rule by
            exporting large quantities of fine pottery, especially to markets in Italy and Sicily.
            Cypselus founded additional colonies along the sailing route to the western
            Mediterranean to promote Corinthian trade in that direction.</p>
          <p>When Cypselus died in 625 B.C., his son <emph>Periander</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Hdt. 5.92f">Hdt. 5.92f.1</bibl>
            </note> succeeded him. Periander aggressively continued Corinth's economic expansion by
            founding colonies on the coasts both northwest and northeast of Greek territory to
            increase trade with the interior regions there, which were rich in timber and precious
            metals. He also pursued commercial contacts with Egypt, an interest commemorated in the
            Egyptian name Psammetichus he gave to one of his sons. The city's prosperity encouraged
            flourishing development in crafts, art, and architecture. The foundations of the great
            stone temple to Apollo begun in this period can still be seen today. Unlike his father,
            however, Periander lost the support of Corinth's people by ruling harshly. He kept his
            power until his death in 585 B.C., but the hostile feelings that persisted against his
            rule led to the overthrow of his successor, Psamettichus, within a short time. The
            opponents of tyranny thereupon installed a government based on a board of eight
            magistrates and a council of eighty men.</p>

          <p>By working in the interests of their peoples, some tyrannies, like that founded by
            Cypselus at Corinth, maintained their popularity for decades. Other tyrants experienced
            bitter opposition from aristocrats jealous of the tyrant's power or provoked civil war
            by ruling brutally and inequitably. The poet Alcaeus of the city-state of Mytilene on
            the island of Lesbos in the northeastern Aegean, himself a rebellious aristocrat,
            described such strife around 600 B.C.: “Let's forget our anger; let's quit our
            heart-devouring strife and civil war, which some god has stirred up among us, ruining
            the people but bestowing the glory on our tyrant for which he prays.” In
            short, the title <term>tyrant</term> in Archaic Greece did not automatically label a
            ruler as brutal or unwelcome, as the use of the same word in English implies. Greeks
            evaluated tyrants as good or bad depending on their behavior as rulers.</p>

          <head>The Athenian Population in the Dark Age</head>
          <p>Unlike most other important sites inhabited in the Mycenaean period, Athens had
            apparently not suffered any catastrophic destruction at the end of the Mycenaean period.
            Nevertheless, it is difficult to believe that Athens wholly escaped the troubles of this
            period, and its population shrank in the early Dark Age. By around 850 B.C., however,
            archaeological evidence such as the model <emph>granary from a woman's burial</emph><note>
              <bibl n="TRM OV 4.3">TRM OV 4.3</bibl>
            </note> mentioned elsewhere in the Overview shows that the Athenian agricultural economy
            was reviving. When the population of Attica apparently expanded at a phenomenal rate
            during the century from about 800 to 700 B.C., the free peasants constituted the
            fastest-growing segment of the population as economic conditions improved in the early
            Archaic Age. These small agricultural producers apparently began to insist on having a
            say in making Athenian policies because they felt justice demanded at least a limited
            form of political equality. Some of these modest land owners became wealthy enough
            afford to afford <emph>hoplite</emph><note>

          <head>The Beginnings of Athenian Democracy</head>
          <p>By the late seventh century B.C., Athens' male citizens rich, middle-class, and poor
            had established the <emph>first beginnings of a limited form of democratic
              government</emph><note><bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 3">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 3-4</bibl>,
                <bibl n="Plut. Thes. 24.2">Plut. Thes. 24.2</bibl></note>. Determining why they
            moved toward democracy instead of, for example, toward a narrow oligarchy like that of
            Sparta remains a difficult problem. Two factors perhaps encouraging the emergence of the
            Athenian <term>polis</term> as an incipient democracy were rapid population growth and a
            rough sense of egalitarianism among male citizens that survived from the frontier-like
            conditions of the early Dark Age, when most people had shared the same meager existence.
            These same factors, however, do not necessarily differentiate Athens from other
            city-states that did not evolve into democracies because the same conditions pertained
            across the Greek world in the Archaic Age. Perhaps population growth was so rapid among
            Athenian peasants that they had greater power than at other places to demand a share in
            governing. Their power and political coherence was evident, for example, in about 632
            B.C. when they rallied “from the fields in a body” to foil the
            attempted coup of an Athenian nobleman named <emph>Cylon</emph><note><bibl n="Hdt. 5.71"

            Athenian political organization. Organized in their demes, the male citizens
            participated directly in the running of their government: they kept track in deme
            registers of which males were citizens and therefore eligible at eighteen to attend the
            assembly to vote on laws and public policies. The demes in turn were grouped for other
            administrative functions into ten so-called tribes (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek"
              >phylai</foreign> ), replacing an earlier division into four tribes. Cleisthenic
            democracy used its ten tribes for purposes such as choosing fifty representatives by lot
            from each tribe to serve for one year on the council (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek"
              >boule</foreign> ) of five hundred, which replaced Solon's council of four hundred.
            The number of representatives from each deme was proportional to its population.
            Athenian men were also called up for service in the citizen militia by tribal
            affiliation. Most importantly, the ten men who served each year as
            “generals” (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">strategoi</foreign> ), the
            officials with the highest civil and military authority, were elected one from each
            tribe. Cleisthenes' reorganization was complex, but its general aim seems to have been
            to undermine existing political alliances among aristocrats in the interests of greater
            democracy.</p>

          <head>Persuasion and Cleisthenic Democracy</head>
          <p>By about 500 B.C. Cleisthenes had succeeded in devising an Athenian democracy based on
            direct participation by as many adult male citizens as possible. That he could put such
            a system in place successfully in a time of turmoil and have it endure, as it did, means
            that he must have been building on pre-existing conditions favorable to democracy.
            Certainly, as an aristocrat looking for popular support, Cleisthenes had reason to
            invent the kind of system he thought ordinary people wanted. That he based his system on
            the demes, the great majority of which were country villages, suggests that some
            conditions favoring democracy may have stemmed from the traditions of village life.
            Possibly, the notion of wide-spread participation in government gained support from the
            custom village residents often have of dealing with each other on relatively egalitarian
            terms. That is, each man in a village is entitled to his say in running local affairs
            and must persuade, not compel, others of the wisdom of his recommendations. Since many
            aristocrats increasingly seem to have preferred to reside in the city, their ability to
            dominate discussion in the demes was reduced. In any case, the idea that

            privately and giving public lectures. They also used writing to record their doctrines,
            and some of them developed prose in Greek to express their new ways of thought. Some
            Ionian thinkers composed poetry as well to explain their theories and gave public
            recitations of their works. People who studied with these thinkers or heard their

          <p>Knowledge from the ancient Near East influenced the Ionian thinkers, just as it had

            plants; Greek sculptors produced narrative reliefs like those of Assyria and statues

            east to west, information about the regular movements of the stars and planets developed
            by astronomers in Babylonia proved especially important in helping Ionian thinkers reach

            arrangement that is beautiful (hence our word “cosmetic”). The order
            characteristic of the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">cosmos</foreign>, perceived as lovely
            because it was ordered, encompassed not only the motions of the heavenly bodies but also
            everything else: the weather, the growth of plants and animals, human health and
            psychology, and so on. Since the universe was ordered, it was intelligible; since it was
            intelligible, explanations of events could be discovered by thought and research. The
            thinkers who conceived this view believed it necessary to give reasons for their
            conclusions and to persuade others by arguments based on evidence. They believed, in
            other words, in logic (a word derived from the Greek term <emph>

            tradition explaining events as the work of gods lived on alongside the new ideas.</p>

            important preoccupation in the lives of the majority of ordinary people, who retained
            their notions that gods and demons frequently and directly affected their fortunes and
            health as well as the events of nature. Despite their perhaps limited immediate effect
            on the ancient world at large, the Ionian thinkers had initiated a tremendously
            important development in intellectual history: the separation of scientific thinking
            from myth and religion. Some modern scholars call this development the birth of
            rationalism, but it would be unfair to label myths and religious ways of thought as
            irrational if that term is taken to mean “unthinking” or
            “silly.” Ancient people realized that their lives were constantly
            subject to forces beyond their control and understanding, and it was not unreasonable to
            attribute supernatural origins to the powers of nature or the ravages of disease. The
            new scientific ways of thought insisted, however, that observable evidence had to be
            sought and theories of explanation had to be logical. Just being old or popular no
            longer bestowed veracity on a story purporting to explain natural phenomena. In this
            way, the Ionian thinkers parted company with the traditional ways of thinking of the
            ancient Near East as found in its rich mythology and repeated in the myths of early
            Greece.</p>

          and cultural flowering during the fifth century B.C. The enduring fame of the drama, art,
          architecture, historical writing, and philosophy produced at Athens in these years by
          Athenians and non-Athenians, who had been attracted to the city by its economic and
          cultural vitality, has impelled historians to refer to the fifth century after the Persian
          Wars as the “Golden Age of Athens.” This Athenian Golden Age coincides
          with the first part of the so-called Classical period of ancient Greek history, a modern
          designation that is conventionally fixed between about 500 B. C., when the Greeks began to
          come into conflict with the kingdom of Persia to the east, and the death of the Macedonian
          king and conqueror Alexander the Great in 323 B.C. This section of the Overview will
          concentrate on the military, political, economic, and cultural history of Athens during
          this most famous span of Greek history, the Golden Age. The focus on Athens in this period
          reflects both the traditional fame that the city and its people have acquired in later
          times and the undeniable fact that far more ancient evidence has survived concerning
          Athens than any other ancient Greek state.</p>

          <head>The Major Conflicts of Fifth-Century Greece</head>
          <p>As the association of the Classical period's opening chronological boundary with
            clashes against Persian forces and of its close with the military expeditions of
            Alexander reveals, the Classical period of Greek history was an age often marked by
            turbulence and war. The Golden Age of Athens was no exception, and one bloody conflict
            after another raged in mainland Greece during the fifth century, beginning with war
            against the great kingdom of Persia, whose heartland lay in what is today southern Iran.
            The kingdom of Persia had by around 500 expanded far enough westward that the Greeks
            were becoming aware of its enormous might, but neither the Persians nor the Greeks,
            especially those on the mainland, yet knew much about each other. Their mutual ignorance
            opened the door to explosive misunderstandings and a deadly war. When the Greeks allied
            against the Persians managed by 479 to defeat their more numerous foe and expel its
            invading army from the Greek mainland, the way was opened to the full blossoming of the
            Golden Age. After their success in the war with the Persians, however, the two major
            powers in mainland Greece—<emph><placeName key="perseus,Sparta"
                >Sparta</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, who had
              cooperated in fighting the Persians</emph>—gradually became more and more
            hostile to each other in the course of the fifth century. Eventually, their mutual
            suspicions and hostilities erupted into open warfare of Greek against Greek, culminating
            in the drawn-out and destructive Peloponesian War (431-404) between Athens and Sparta
            and their allies. This catastrophic struggle lasted for twenty-seven bitter years.
            Athens' defeat in this war brought an end to the Athenian Golden Age.</p>

            Athens' prosperity and cultural achievement came to an end as a result of the terrible
            defeat inflicted on Athens by Sparta and its allies in the Peloponnesian War. Sparta,

            the sixth century by the development of greater democracy at Athens under the leadership
            of Cleisthenes after 507. The Spartan leaders feared that the increasing

            </note>, that Athens marshalled against the Persian army, the Spartan leaders
            increasingly saw Athens as more than just a theoretical threat to their state's
            dominance. The majority of men at Athens reciprocated this feeling of suspicion and
            feared the Spartan army, Greece's most formidable infantry force, as a threat to their
            international ambitions and security. The allies of Athens and Sparta also contributed
            signficantly to the friction between the two powers by complaining to their respective
            leaders about real and imagined grievances against the other leading state.</p>

              >Perseus Encyclopedia entry for Persians</bibl></note> that erupted just after 500
          B.C. and continued intermittently for decades. The Persian Kingdom outstripped mainland
          Greece in every imaginable category of material resources, from precious metals to beasts
          of burden. But, above all, it had a preponderance of the ancient world's most precious
          resource, human beings. No resource was harder to replace than people because the
          populations of antiquity were constantly at risk from disease and regional scarcities of
          food to a degree unknown in the modern Western world. Death was not a phenomenon expected
          under ordinary conditions to afflict only the old, as today; illness, injury, and
          malnutrition could and did carry off people at every age all the time. The imbalance in
          demographic resources made the wars between Persians and Greeks seemingly into a contest
          between an elephant and a mouse. No one could have reasonably expected the mouse to
          prevail. The unexpectedness of the result—a Greek victory—contributed
          mightily to the feeling of self-confidence that characterized the Athenian Golden Age, for
          good and for ill.</p>

          <head>Athenian Mission for a Persian Alliance</head>
          <p>The greatest military danger ever to threaten ancient Athens began with a diplomatic
            misunderstanding. In 507 B.C the <emph>Athenians sent ambassadors</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Hdt. 5.73">Hdt. 5.73</bibl>
            </note> to ask for a protective alliance with the king of Persia, Darius I (ruler
            between 522-486 B.C.), because they feared that the Spartans would try to intervene in
            support of the Athenian aristocratic faction opposed to democracy, which opposed the
              <emph>political reforms of the time promoting added democracy at Athens that were the
              brainchild of the Athenian Cleisthenes.</emph><note><bibl n="Hdt. 5.66">Hdt.
                5.66</bibl>, <bibl n="Hdt. 5.69">Hdt. 5.69</bibl></note> This ill-fated diplomatic
            mission unwittingly set in motion a sequence of events that culminated in invasions of
            mainland Greece by the huge army and navy of the king of Persia, who could summon vast
            numbers of fighting men from the many different peoples under his rule.</p>

                <bibl n="Hdt. 5.73">Hdt. 5.73</bibl>

                  >Hdt. 5.69</bibl></note> against possible Spartan intervention. Seeking security
              through an alliance with Persia made sense because the Persian Kingdom (or Persian
              Empire, as it is more often called, despite its monarch being referred to as a king,
              not an emperor) had become the richest, largest, and most militarily powerful state in
              the ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern world. Since Athens had never before had
              any official contacts with the Persian Kingdom, the diplomatic mission necessarily had
              to be sent off without precise instructions. The Athenian diplomats would simply have
              to feel their way as best they could in dealing with the <emph>Persians</emph><note>

              </note>because they had no idea what to expect. The Athenian emissaries met with a
              representative of the king at Sardis, the Persian headquarters in western Anatolia
              (today Turkey). When the royal representative, who served as the governor of the
              surrounding territory for the king, had heard the Athenians' plea for an alliance to
              help protect them against the Spartans, he first replied, <emph>“But who in

            <head>Sowing a Seed of Conflict between Athens and Persia</head>
            <p>The reply of the Persian king's representative to the Athenian ambassadors revealed
              that, from the Persian perspective, the Athenians were so insignificant that he had
              never even heard of them before, despite his having been posted as a provincial
              governor on the western fringe of the Persian Empire, as close to Greek territory as
              Persians usually got. Still less would the king in the distant heartland of Persia
              (modern Iran) far to the east know anything of Athens. The king's representative
              immediately demanded of the Athenian ambassadors the <emph>symbolic offerings of earth
                and water</emph><note>
                <bibl n="Hdt. 5.73">Hdt. 5.73</bibl>
              </note>, which the king customarily required from all the peoples under his dominion.
              These tokens symbolized submission to the king, who recognized no one as his equal; he
              did not make alliances as if between partners, the kind of agreements that the Greek
              ambassadors, ignorant of Persian diplomatic procedure, had naively assumed they could
              make because that was how Greeks made alliances. Afraid to return to Athens
              empty-handed, they complied with the demand for earth and water. When the Athenian
              assembly (in Greek, the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">ekklesia</foreign>, the body of
              free-born male citizens over eighteen years old, who met regularly to make policy
              decisions and laws for Athens) heard what its ambassadors had done, <emph>it angrily
                censured them</emph><note>
                <bibl n="Hdt. 5.73">Hdt. 5.73</bibl>
              </note>—but it sent no message to Sardis to repudiate their actions. The
              outrage the Athenian assembly felt when their ambassador reported that they had
              offered tokens of submission revealed the intensity of the feelings the Athenians had
              developed for the political independence enjoyed by their city-state (<foreign
                xml:lang="xgreek">polis</foreign> in Greek—a political unit defined by an
              urban center surrounded by countryside, which often also had smaller settlements
              scattered throughout it). Although the Athenians had heard amazing tales of the
              resources of the Persian king, they were unwilling to buy his protection at the cost
              of yielding their freedom. The Athenians, then, continued to think of themselves as
              independent, but as far as the king of Persia was concerned, they were foreigners who
              had now voluntarily submitted to his representative and owed him the same loyalty he
              expected from all his other subjects. The dynamics of this diplomatic incident expose
              a sigificant source of the wider conflicts that would dominate the military and
              political history of mainland Greece during the fifth century B.C.: failed diplomacy
              emerging from mutual misunderstanding that opened the way to conflict.</p>

            The Greeks indeed often used the term “Mede” to refer to Persians.
            The ancestral homeland of the Persians themselves was found to the south of what is now
            the country of Iran. The Iranian language of today remains a descendant of ancient
            Persian, in contrast to the Arabic now spoken in neighboring Iraq and other countries of
            the Near East. By the reign of <emph>Darius I</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Hdt. 3.67">Becomes king-Hdt. 3.67</bibl>
            </note> from 522 to 486, the Persian Kingdom had expanded to encompass a vast territory
            of heterogeneous populations stretching east-west from what is now Afghanistan to
            Turkey, and north-south from the southern territory of the former U.S.S.R. to Egypt and
            the Indian Ocean. The Persian king governed this immense area through a system of
            provincial organization, whose chief administrators were governors, called
              <emph>satraps</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Hdt. 3.89">Hdt. 3.89</bibl>

            <head>The Resources of Persia</head>
            <p>By 500 B.C the Persian Kingdom had millions of subjects. The Persian kings exacted

              </note> in different ways in different regions. Tax revenues could be levied in the
              form of food stuffs, precious metals as bullion or coinage, and other valuable
              commodities. The various provinces were also responsible for supplying soldiers to
              staff the royal army. The material and human revenues of the immense kingdom made the
              Persian kings wealthy beyond the Greek imagination. Although the Persians did not
              regard their king as a god, everything about him was meant to emphasize his grandeur
              and superiority to ordinary mortals. His purple robes were of the most splendid
              fabric; red carpets were spread for him alone to walk upon; his servants held their
              hands before their mouths in his presence to muffle their breath so that he would not
              have to breathe the same air; he was depicted as larger than any other human being in
              the sculpture adorning his palace. To display his concern for his loyal subjects, as
              well as the gargantuan scale of his resources, the king provided meals for some 15,000
              nobles, courtiers, and other followers every day, although he himself ate hidden from
              the view of his guests. The Greeks, in awe of the Persian monarch's power and

              Unlike the Greeks, the Persians avoided animal sacrifice. Fire, kindled on special
              altars, formed an important part of their religious rituals. Although the language of
              ancient Persia has survived in its homeland in the form of modern Iranian, the

            perspective. What is truly remarkable about the Persian Wars, however, is that the
            citizen militias of the thirty-one Greek city-states decided to fight in the first

            themselves. Instead, eager to defend their freedom despite the risks and encouraged to
            fight by the citizens of their communities, these Greeks chose to strive together
            against apparently overwhelming odds. Since the Greek forces included not only
            aristocrats and hoplites (who had to be financially capable of supplying their own armor
            and weapons), but also thousands of poorer men who rowed the warships, the effort

          united Greek military forces. Their attempt to continue this cooperation after the repulse
          of the Persians, however, ended in failure. Out of this failure arose the so-called
          Athenian Empire, a modern label invented to point out the political and economic dominance
          Athens came to exercise over other Greek states in an alliance originally set up as a
          voluntary association of its members against Persia.</p>

            attack the Persian outposts that still existed in far northern Greece and western
            Anatolia, especially Ionia. The Spartans naturally assumed leadership of this alliance,
            continuing the position that they had held at the had of the Greek coalition formed to
            resist the invasion of Xerxes. The <emph>conduct of the Spartan commander,

            however, and Athens soon took over the position of hegemon (leader by consensus) of the

              Spartan leadership among the Greek allies. This kind of outrageous conduct was to
              prove common in the future for Spartan men in positions of power when away from home.
              Their regimented training in Sparta apparently left them ill prepared to operate
              humanely and effectively once they had escaped from the constraints imposed by their
              austere way of life as “<emph>Equals</emph><note><bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.3.5"

              under scrutiny by one another in their homeland. Spartan kings, too, who grew up under
              a freer regimen than did ordinary Spartan men, tended to lose sight of the Spartan
              tradition of austerity and just behavior when they campaigned abroad for long periods.
              Not even they were immune to the corrupting influence of the desire for luxury, which
              the austere life of Spartans at home in Sparta excluded as a matter of principle and

            annual magistrates, officials who saw to much of the adminstration of the city-state,
            had been chosen by lot rather than by election since 487 B.C. The use of the lot made
            access to those offices a matter of random and therefore democratic chance rather than
            liable to domination by wealthy aristocrats, who could afford major electoral campaigns.
            But even democratically selected magistrates were susceptible to corruption, as were the
            members of the Areopagus. A different judicial system was needed if those men who
            decided cases were to be insulated from pressure by socially prominent people and from

            <p>The threat ostracism was meant to combat could also come from a man's great personal
              prominence, if he became so prominent that he could appear to overshadow all others on
              the political scene and thus threaten the egalitarian principles of Athenian
              democracy, in which no one man was supposed to dominate the making of policy. This
              point is illustrated by a famous <emph> anecdote concerning
                  Aristides,</emph><note><bibl n="Plut. Arist. 7">Plut. Arist. 7</bibl>, <bibl
                  n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22.7">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22.7</bibl></note> who set the dues
              for the Delian League. This Aristides had the nickname “The Just" because he
              was reputed to be so fair-minded. On the balloting day for an ostracism, an illiterate
              man from the countryside handed Aristides a potsherd, asking him to scratch on it the
              name of the man's choice for ostracism. “Certainly,” said
              Aristides; “Which name shall I write?”
              “Aristides,” replied the countryman. “Very
              well,” remarked Aristides as he proceeded to inscribe his own name.
              “But tell me, why do you want to ostracize Aristides? What has he done to
              you?” “Oh, nothing; I don't even know him,” sputtered
              the man. “I'm just sick and tired of hearing everybody refer to him as
              ‘The Just.’”</p>

            <head>Ostracism and personal prominence</head>
            <p>The anecdote about Aristides and the illiterate voter may well be apocryphal, but
              Aristides was indeed ostracized in 482 B.C. (and <emph>recalled early in 480 B.C. to

              that the right way to protect democracy was, even in cases in which an individual
              might be unfairly penalized, to rely on the judgment of the mass of ordinary male
              citizens as expressed in a majority vote. This conviction required making allowances
              for irresponsible types like the kind of man depicted in the story about Aristides. It
              rested on the belief that the cumulative political wisdom of the majority of male
              citizens would outweigh the eccentricity and irresponsibility of the few. And personal
              prominence certainly did not usually lead to ostracism.

          <p>The idea that democracy was best served by involving a cross-section of the male
            citizenry received further backing in the 450s B.C. from the measures proposed to the
            assembly by a wealthy aristocract named Pericles (c. 495-429 B.C.), whose mother had
            been the niece of the famous democratic reformer Cleisthenes. <emph>Pericles
              successfully proposed that state revenues be used to pay a daily

            on juries, in the Council of the Five Hundred, and in other public offices filled by
            lot. The stipend was modest, in fact less than a skilled worker could have made on a
            good day. Without the stipend, however, poorer men would have found it virtually
            impossible to leave their regular work to serve in these positions, which required much
            of a man's time. By contrast, the board of ten annually elected <emph>generals</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 61.1">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 61.1-2</bibl>
            </note>—the most influential public officials, who had broad responsibilities
            for the city-state's military, civil, and financial affairs—were to receive no
            stipends despite the heavy demands of their post. Mainly rich men like Pericles won
            election as generals because they were supposed to have been able to afford the
            education and training required to handle this top job and to have the personal wealth
            to serve without financial compensation. They were compensated by the prestige conferred
            by election to their office. Like Cleisthenes before him, Pericles was an aristocrat who
            became the most influential leader in the Athens of his era by devising innovations to
            strengthen the egalitarian tendencies of Athenian democracy. Pericles and others of his
            economic status had inherited enough wealth to spend their time in politics without
            worrying about money, but remuneration for poorer men serving in public offices was an
            essential foundation of Athenian democracy, if it was truly going to be open to the
            majority of men, who, along with their wives and children, had to work to support
            themselves and their families. Above all, Pericles' proposal that jurors receive state
            stipends made him overwhelmingly popular with the mass of ordinary male citizens.
            Consequently, he was able to introduce dramatic changes in Athenian domestic and foreign
            policy beginning in the 450s B.C.</p>

            <head>The Citizenship Law of Pericles </head>
            <p>In 451 B.C. Pericles introduced one of most striking proposals with his sponsorship

              non-Athenian women were granted citizenship. Aristocratic men in particular had tended
              to marry rich foreign women, as Pericles' own maternal grandfather had done. Pericles'
              new law enhanced the status of Athenian mothers and made Athenian citizenship a more
              exclusive category, definitively setting Athenians off from all others. Not long
              thereafter, a review of the citizenship rolls was conducted to expel any who had
              claimed citizenship fraudulently. Together these actions served to limit the number of
              citizens and thus limit dilution of the advantages which citizenship in Athens'
              radical democracy conveyed on those included in the citizenry. Those advantages
              included, for men, the freedom to participate in politics and juries, to influence
              decisions that directly affected their lives, to have equal protection under the law,
              and to own land and houses in Athenian territory. <emph>Citizen women</emph><note>

            <p>Once he had gained political prominence in the 450s at Athens, Pericles devoted his

              encompassed dual goals: 1) continuing military action against the Persian presence in
              Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean and 2) greater attention to Athenian relations and

              “Fine,” he retorted, “I will pay for the buildings
              myself and put my name on them instead of the people's.” Shamed by the
              implication that they lacked pride in their city-state, the men in the assembly

                styles that have often been imitated in modern buildings. The facade of the United

                seventeen instead of thirteen along the sides. These dimensions gave it a massive
                look conveying an impression of power. Since perfectly rectilinear architecture
                appears curved to the human eye, the Parthenon's architects ingeniously designed
                subtle curves and inclines in its architecture to produce an optical illusion of
                completely straight lines: the columns were given a slight bulge in their middles;
                the corner columns on the corners of the temple's raised platform were installed at
                a slight incline and closer together; the platform itself was made slightly convex.
                These technical refinements made the Parthenon appear ordered and regular in a way a
                building built entirely on straight lines would not. By overcoming the distortions
                of nature, the Parthenon's sophisticated architecture made a confident statement
                about human ability to construct order out of the entropic disorder of the natural

              </note> with particular meaning for the people of the locale in which temple had been

              the sea, engaged in a contest to see who would become the patron deity of the
              Athenians by bestowing on them the greater blessing. The Parthenon frieze, however,
              achieved a new level of local reference. It made a unique statement about the
              relationship between Athens and the gods by showing its citizens in the company of the
              gods, even if the assembled deities carved in the frieze at the temple's eastern end
              were understood to be separated from and perhaps invisible to the humans in the
              procession depicted in the frieze. A temple adorned with pictures of citizens,

                <figure n="1987.02.0002"/>
              </note>, amounted to a claim of special intimacy between the city-state and the gods,
              a statement of confidence that these honored deities favored the Athenians. Presumably
              this claim reflected the Athenian interpretation of their success in helping to turn
              back the Persians, in achieving leadership of a powerful naval alliance, and in
              controlling, from their <placeName key="perseus,Laurion">silver mines</placeName><note>

              its neighbors in mainland Greece. The Parthenon, like the rest of the Periclean
              building program, paid honor to the gods with whom the city-state was identified and
              expressed the Athenian view that the gods looked favorably on their empire. Their

        <p>Unprecedented changes occurred in many areas of the lives of the Athenians in the Golden
          Age, but at the same time central aspects of Athenian society remained unchanged. The
          result was a mix of innovation and continuity. The most conspicuous continuity was in
          traditional Greek religion, which permeated public and private life. For most people,
          their religious beliefs and practices remained largely the same as they had always been.

            humans both as individuals and as groups <emph>paid honors to the gods</emph><note><bibl

            and to receive blessings in return. Those honors consisted of sacrifices, gifts to the
            gods' sanctuaries, and festivals of songs, dances, prayers, and processions. A
            seventh-century B.C. bronze statuette, now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, which a
            man named Mantiklos gave to a (now unknown) sanctuary of Apollo to honor the god, makes
            clear why individuals gave such gifts. On the statuette's legs Mantiklos inscribed his
            understanding of the transaction: “Mantiklos gave this from his share to the
            Far Darter of the Silver Bow [i.e., Apollo]; now you, Apollo, do something for me in
            return.” This idea of reciprocity between gods and humans underlay the Greek
            understanding of the divine. Gods did not love human beings, except sometimes literally
            in mythological stories of gods taking earthly lovers and producing half-divine
            children. Rather, gods supported humans who paid them honor and avoided offending them.
            Gods whom humans offended sent calamities in response, such as famines, earthquakes,
            epidemic diseases, or defeat in war.</p>

              their dealings with one another but essentially care-free in their immortality. The
              twelve most important of the gods, headed by Zeus, were conceived as assembling for

              pantheon (“collectivity of gods”). They as well as some other,
              lesser deities were conceived in anthropomorphic form, both female and male. Like the
              human aristocrats of the stories of Homer, the gods were much concerned with slights
              to their honor. “I am well aware that the gods are full of envy and

              descended from the practice of prehistoric hunters, who perhaps felt that they might
              somehow suffer retribution from supernatural powers for taking the lives of animals,
              living creatures like themselves, to feed themselves and their human community. The
              rite of sacrifice perhaps expressed their uneasiness about the paradox of having to
              kill animals in order to secure the means to keep themselves alive and their
              consequent attempt to show respect and honor to the divine forces concerned with
              animals. The Greeks of the classical period often sacrificed valuable domestic animals
              such as cattle, which their land supported in only small numbers. Looking back on
              fifth-century Athens, the orator Lysias explained the necessity for public sacrifice:
                <emph>“Our ancestors handed down to us the most powerful and prosperous
                community in Greece by performing the prescribed sacrifices. It is therefore proper
                for us to offer the same sacrifices as they, if only for the sake of the success
                which has resulted from those rites.”</emph><note>

              occasions such as the Panathenaic festival, whose procession was portrayed on the

                of the roasted meat of the sacrificed animal, for the worshippers to benefit
                personally from a good realtionship with the gods. The feasting that followed a
                blood sacrifice was especially meaningful in this latter sense because meat was
                comparatively rare in the Greek diet. The actual sacrificing of the animal proceeded
                along strict rules meant to ensure the purity of the occasion. The elaborate
                procedures required for a blood sacrifice show how seriously and solemnly the Greeks
                regarded the killing of animals for sacrifice. The victim had to be an unblemished
                domestic animal, specially decorated with garlands, and induced to approach the
                altar as if of its own volition. The assembled crowd had to maintain a strict
                silence to avoid possibly impure remarks. The sacrificer sprinkled water on the
                victim's head so it would, in shaking its head in response to the sprinkle, appear
                to consent to its death. After washing his hands, the sacrificer scattered barley
                grains on the altar fire and the victim's head and then cut a lock of the animal's
                hair to throw on the fire. Following a prayer, he swiftly cut the animal's throat
                while musicians played flute-like pipes and female worshippers screamed, presumably
                to express the group's ritual sorrow at the victim's death. The carcass was then
                butchered, with some portions thrown on the altar fire so their aromatic smoke could
                waft its way upwards to the god of the cult. The majority of the meat was then
                distributed among the worshippers.</p>

            <p>Greek religion encompassed many activities besides those of the cults of the twelve
              Olympian deities. In private life, prayers, sacrifices, and rituals marked important
              occasions like birth, marriage, and death. Ancestors were honored by offerings made at
              their tombs. Seers were consulted for the meanings of dreams and omens. Magicians
              offered spells to improve one's love life or curses to harm one's enemies.
              Particularly important both to the community and to individuals were what we call
              hero-cults, rituals performed at the tomb of a man or woman, usually from the distant
              past, whose remains were thought to retain special power. This power was local,
              whether for revealing the future through oracles, for healing injuries and disease, or
              for providing assistance in war. For example, Athenian soldiers in the battle of

              from all over the Greek world. The central rite of this cult was called the Mysteries,
              a series of ceremonies of initiation into the secret knowledge of the cult. If they
              were free of pollution, all speakers of Greek from anywhere in the
              world—women and men, adults and children—were eligible for
              initiation, as were some slaves who worked in the sanctuary. Initiation proceeded in
              several stages. The main stage took place during an annual festival lasting almost two
              weeks. So important were the Eleusinian Mysteries that an international truce of
              fifty-five days was proclaimed to allow travel to and from the festival even from the
              distant corners of the Greek world. Initiates expected that they would enjoy added

            <p>The Eleusinian Mysteries were not the only mystery cult of the Greek world, nor were
              they unique in their concern with what lay beyond death for human beings. Most mystery
              cults emphasized protection for initiates in their daily lives, whether against
              ghosts, illness, poverty, shipwrecks, or the countless other everyday dangers of
              ancient Greek life. Such protection came, however, from appropriate human behavior,
              not from any abstract belief in the gods. For the ancient Greeks, gods expected honors
              and rites, and Greek religion required action from its worshippers. Prayers had to be
              said, sacrifices had to be performed, and purifications had to be undergone. These
              rituals represented an active response to the precarious conditions of human life in a
              world in which early death from disease, accident, or war was commonplace.

              to the end, and to how it turns out. For god has given prosperous happiness to many
              people, but afterwards uprooted them utterly.” As a result of their belief
              in the capability of the gods for bestowing both good and evil on human beings, the
              Greeks had no expectation that paradise would be achieved at some future time when
              evil forces would at last be vanquished forever. Their assessment of human existence
              made no allowance for change in the nature of the relationship between the human and
              the divine. That relationship encompassed sorrow as well as joy, punishment in the
              here and now, with the uncertain hope for favored treatment both in this life and in
              an afterlife for initiates of the Eleusinian Mysteries.</p>

            These plays, still read, translated, and produced on stage today around the world, were
            presented in ancient Athens as part of a drama contest, in keeping with the competitive
            spirit characteristic of many events held in the gods' honor. The earliest tragedies
            were composed in the late sixth century, but Athenian tragedy reached its peak as a
            dramatic form in the fifth century.</p>

              and characters that represented powerful forces, both divine and human. Tragedies were
              written in verse in elevated, solemn language and often based on stories about the

              human beings. Tragic plots frequently were mainly constructed from myths, although a

              theater of Dionysus held around 14,000 spectators overlooking an open, circular area
              in front of a slightly raised stage platform. To ensure fairness in the competition,
              all tragedies were required to have the same size cast, all of whom were men: three
              actors to play the speaking roles of all male and female characters and fifteen chorus
              members. Although the chorus' leader sometimes engaged in dialogue with the actors,
              the chorus primarily performed songs and dances in the circular area in front of the
              stage, called the orchestra (“dancing area”). Since all the
              actors' lines were in verse with special rhythms, the musical aspect of the chorus'
              role enhanced the overall poetic nature of Athenian tragedy.</p>

              heart of a tragedy, in which dialogue and long speeches were far more common than
              physical action. Special effects were, however, part of the spectacle. For example, a
              crane allowed actors playing the roles of gods to fly suddenly onto stage, like
              superheroes in a modern movie. The actors playing the lead roles, called the

              other for the designation of best actor. So important was it to have a first-rate lead
              actor to provide a successful tragedy that protagonists were assigned by lot to the
              competing playwrights of the year to give all three of them an equal chance to have
              the finest cast. Great protagonists, who had to have prodigious vocal skills, became
              enormously popular figures, although, unlike many playwrights, they were not usually
              aristocrats and generally did not move in upper-class social circles, or, if they did
              have aristocratic friends, they were not on an equal footing with them in terms of
              social status.</p>

              Salamis; the epitaph on his tombstone, which says nothing of his great success as a
              playwright, reveals how highly he valued his contribution to his city-state as a
              citizen-soldier: <emph> “Under this stone lies Aeschylus the Athenian, son

                symbolically burying the allegedly traitorous brother, her uncle condemns her to
                die. He only realizes his error when sacrifices to the gods go wrong. His decision
                to punish Antigone ends in personal disaster when his son and then his wife kill
                themselves in despair. In this horrifying story of anger and death, Sophocles
                deliberately exposes the right and wrong on each side of the conflict. Although
                Antigone's uncle eventually acknowledges a leader's responsibility to listen to his
                people, the play offers no easy resolution of the competing interests of
                divinely-sanctioned moral tradition expressed by a woman and the political rules of
                the state enforced by a man.</p>

                an unknown sculptor of a female (perhaps the goddess of love Aphrodite) adjusting
                her diaphanous robe with one upraised arm. The message these statues conveyed to
                their ancient audience was one of energy, motion, and asymmetry in delicate balance.
                Archaic statues impressed a viewer with their appearance of stability; not even a
                hard shove looked likely to budge them. Free-standing statues of the classical
                period, by contrast, showed greater range in a variety of poses and impressions. The
                spirited movement of some of these statues suggests the energy of the times but also

              labor that helped sustain them. Women's property rights in classical Athens reflected
              both the importance of the control of property by women as well as the predisposition
              of Athenian society to promote the formation and preservation of households headed by
              property-owning men. Under Athenian democracy, women could control property, even
              land—the most valued possession in their society—through
              inheritance and <emph>dowry</emph><note><bibl n="Lys. 32.6">Lys. 32.6</bibl>, <bibl

              <head>Inheritance and Dowry</head>
              <p>Athenian men and women were supposed to preserve their property as best they could
                so that it could be handed down to their children. Parents who spent all of their
                cash and disposed of their other property for their own personal pleasure without
                due regard for the ultimate consequences for their offspring incurred social
                disgrace. Daughters did not inherit a portion of their father's property if there
                were any living sons, but demographic patterns meant that perhaps one household in
                five had only daughters, to whom the father's property then fell. Women could also
                inherit from other male relatives who had no male offspring. A woman's regular share
                in her father's estate came to her in her dowry at marriage. A son whose father was
                still alive at the time of the son's marriage similarly often received a share of
                his inheritance at that time to allow him to set up a household. A bride's husband
                had legal control over the property in his wife's <emph>dowry</emph><note><bibl

                    n="Dem. 45.28">Dem. 45.28</bibl></note>, and their respective holdings freqently
                became commingled. In this sense husband and wife were co-owners of the household's
                common property, which only <emph>had to be alloted between its separate owners if
                  the marriage was dissolved</emph><note><bibl n="Isaeus 3.35">Isaeus 3.35</bibl>,
                    <bibl n="Dem. 59.52">Dem. 59.52</bibl></note>. The husband was legally
                responsible for preserving the dowry and using it for the support and comfort of his
                wife and her children. A man often had to put up valuable land of his own as
                collateral to guarantee the safety of his wife's dowry. Upon her death, the dowry
                became the inheritance of her children. The expectation that a woman would have a
                dowry tended to encourage marriage within groups of similar wealth and status. As
                with the rules governing women's rights to inheritances, customary dowry
                arrangements supported the society's goal of enabling males to establish and
                maintain households because daughters' dowries were usually smaller in value than
                their brothers' inheritances and therefore kept the bulk of a father's property
                attached to his sons.</p>

              <head>Heiresses</head>
              <p>Like the rules concerning inheritance and dowry, <emph>Athenian law concerning
                  heiresses</emph><note>
                  <bibl n="Isaeus 3.64">Isaeus 3.64</bibl>
                </note> also supported the goal of providing resources to enable as many male
                citizens as possible to form households. Under Athenian law, if a father died
                leaving only a daughter to survive him, his property devolved upon her as his
                heiress, but she did not own it in the modern sense of being able to dispose of it
                as she pleased. Instead, the law (in the simplest case) required her father's
                closest male relative —her official guardian after her father's
                death—to marry her himself, with the aim of producing a son. The inherited
                property then belonged to that son when he reached adulthood. This rule
                theoretically applied regardless of whether the heiress was already married (without
                any sons) or whether the male relative already had a wife. The heiress and the male
                relative were both supposed to divorce their present spouses and marry each other,
                although in practice the rule could be circumvented by legal subterfuge. This rule
                about heiresses preserved the father's line and kept the property in his family,
                prevented rich men from getting richer by engineering deals with wealthy heiresses'
                guardians to marry them and therefore merge their estates, and, above all, prevented
                property from piling up in the hands of unmarried women. At Sparta, <emph>Aristotle
                  reported</emph><note>

                </note>, precisely this kind of agglomeration of wealth took place as women
                inherited land or received it in their dowries without—to Aristotle's way
                of thinking—adequate regulations promoting remarriage. He claimed that
                women in this way had come to own forty percent of Spartan territory. The law at
                Athens was more successful at regulating women's control over property in the
                interests of forming households headed by property-owning men.</p>

              would escort her, but more often she was accompanied only by a servant, which left
              more opportunity for independent action. Social protocol also dictated the way in
              which men dealt with women. For example, custom demanded that men not speak the names
              of women in public conversations and speeches in court unless practical necessity
              demanded it or the women were not socially respectable, as in the case of prostitutes.
              Presumably, many upper-class women valued their limited contact with men outside the
              household as a badge of their superior social status. In a gender-segregated society
              such as that of the wealthy at Athens, the primary opportunities for personal
              relationships in a wealthy woman's life probably came in her contact with her children

              virginity of daughters. Given the importance attached to citizenship as the defining
              political structure of the city-state and of a man's personal freedom, it was
              crucially important to be certain a boy truly was his father's son and not the
              offspring of some other man, who could conceivably even be a foreigner or a slave.
              Furthermore, the preference for keeping property in the father's line could be
              maintained only if the boys who inherited a father's property were his legitimate
              sons. In this patriarchal system, the value attached to citizenship for men and its
              accompanying rights to property therefore led to restrictions on women's freedom of
              movement in society. Women who did bear legitimate children, however, immediately
              earned a higher social standing and greater freedom in the family, as explained, for

              with the ability to sing and play musical instruments at mens' dinner parties (which
              wives never attended). Many “companions” lived precarious lives
              subject to exploitation or even violence at the hands of their male customers. The
              most accomplished “companions,” however, could attract lovers from
              the highest levels of society and become sufficiently rich to live in luxury on their
              own. This independent existence strongly distinguished them from citizen women, as did
              the freedom to control their own sexuality.</p>

              ability that they claimed to be able to impart to students. The sophists were offering
              just what every ambitious young man wanted to learn because the greatest single skill
              that a man in democratic Athens could possess was to be able to persuade his fellow
              male citizens in the debates of the assembly and the council or in lawsuits before
              large juries. For those unwilling or unable to master the new rhetorical skills of
              sophistry, the sophists for hefty fees would compose speeches to be delivered by the
              purchaser as his own composition. The overwhelming importance of persuasive speech in
              an oral culture like that of ancient Greece made the sophists frightening figures to
              many, for the new teachers offered an escalation of the power of speech that seemed

                spent most of his career there. His oratorical ability and his upright character so
                impressed the men of Athens that they soon chose him to devise a code of laws for a
                new colony to be founded in Thurii in southern Italy in 444 B.C. Some of Protagoras'
                ideas eventually aroused considerable controversy, such as his agnostic position
                concerning the gods: “Whether the gods exist I cannot discover, nor what
                their form is like, for there are many impediments to knowledge, [such as] the

                simply is warm to one and cool to the other. Protagoras summed up his subjectivism

              <head>The Perceived Dangers of Relativism</head>
              <p>Two related views taught by sophists aroused special controversy: the idea that
                human institutions and values were only matters of convention, custom, or law
                  (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">nomos</foreign>) and not products of nature (<foreign
                  xml:lang="xgreek">physis</foreign>), and the idea that, since truth was relative,
                speakers should be able to argue either side of a question with equal
                  <emph>persuasiveness</emph><note>
                  <bibl n="plat. gorg. 452">plat. gorg. 452</bibl>
                </note>. Since the first idea implied that traditional human institutions were
                arbitrary rather than grounded in immutable nature and the second made rhetoric into
                an amoral skill, the combination of the two seemed very dangerous to a society so
                devoted to the spoken word because it threatened the shared public values of the
                  <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">polis</foreign> with unpredictable changes. Protagoras
                himself insisted that his doctrines were not hostile to democracy, especially
                because he argued that every person had an innate capability for
                “excellence” and that human survival depended on the rule of law
                based on a sense of justice. Members of the community, he argued, should be
                persuaded to obey the laws not because they were based on absolute truth, which did
                not exist, but because it was expedient for people to live by them. A thief who
                claimed, for instance, that in his opinion a law against stealing was not
                appropriate, would have to be persuaded that the law forbidding theft was to his
                advantage, both to protect his own property and to allow the community to function
                in which he, like all human beings, had to live in order to survive.</p>

              deal with the moral and political issues that Thucydides saw as central for

              <p>The disputes over Athenian action against Megara and Potidaea reflected the larger
                issues of power motivating the hostility between Athens and Sparta. The Spartan
                leaders feared that the Athenians would use their superiority in long-distance
                offensive weaponry—the naval forces of the Delian League—to
                destroy Spartan control over the members of the Peloponnesian League. The majority
                in the Athenian assembly, for their part, resented Spartan interference in their
                freedom of action. For example, <emph>Thucydides portrays Pericles as making the

                male citizens to reject the Spartan demands even if that means war: “If we
                do go to war, harbor no thought that you went to war over a trivial affair. For you
                this trifling matter is the assurance and the proof of your determination. If you
                yield to their demands, they will immediately confront you with some larger demand,
                since they will think that you only gave way on the first point out of fear. But if
                you stand firm, you will show them that they have to deal with you as equals ...
                When our equals, without agreeing to arbitration of the matter under dispute, make
                claims on us as neighbors and state those claims as commands, it would be no better

              was unequal to the task of broaching such walls. Consequently, no matter what damage
              was done to the agricultural production of Attica in the course of the war, the
              Athenians could feed themselves by importing food by ship through their fortified
              port. They could pay for the food with the huge financial reserves they had

              </note> The Athenians could also retreat safely behind their walls in the case of
              attacks by the superior Spartan infantry. From this impregnable position, they could
              launch surprise attacks against Spartan territory by sending their ships to land
              troops behind enemy lines. Like aircraft in modern warfare before the invention of
              radar warning systems, Athenian warships could swoop down unexpectedly on their

              simple: avoid set battles with the Spartan infantry even if it ravaged Athenian

              the island represented both the richest prize and the largest threat. In the debate
              preceding the vote on the expedition, Alcibiades and his supporters argued that the
              numerous war ships in the fleet of Syracuse represented an especially serious
              potential threat to the security of the Athenian alliance because they could sail from
              Sicily to join the Spartan alliance in attacks on Athens and its allies. Nicias led
              the opposition to the proposed expedition, but his arguments for caution failed to
              counteract the enthusiasm for action that Alcibiades generated with his speeches. His
              aggressive dreams of martial glory especially appealed to young men, who had not yet
              experienced the realities of war for themselves. The assembly resoundingly backed his
              vision by voting to send to Sicily the greatest force ever to sail from Greece. The

              a limited time, as in the earlier years of the war when the annual invasions
              dispatched from Sparta could never linger longer than forty days in Athenian
              territory. The presence of the garrison made agricultural work in the fields of Attica

            <p>The turmoil in Athenian politics and revenues resulting from the Sicilian defeat
              opened the way for some influential Athenian men, who had long harbored contempt for
              the broad-based democracy of their city-state, to stage what amounted to an oligarchic
              coup d'état. They insisted that a small group of elite leaders could manage
              Athenian policy better than the democratic assembly. <emph>Alcibiades furthered their
                cause by promising to make an alliance with the Persia satraps in western Anatolia
                and secure funds from them for Athens if only the democracy would be overturned and
                an oligarchy installed.</emph><note><bibl n="Thuc. 8.47">Thuc. 8.47-54</bibl>, <bibl

              want to go home again because his negotiations with the satraps had by now aroused the
              suspicions of the Spartan leaders, who rightly suspected that he was intriguing in his
              own interests rather than theirs. <emph>He had also made Agis, one of Sparta's two

              Athens to play on the assembly's hopes by holding out the lure of Persian gold.
                <emph>In 411 they succeeded in having the assembly members turn over all power to a

          <head>Social and cultural life at Athens in war time</head>
          <p>The Peloponnesian War exacted a toll on the domestic life of Athenians as well as on
            their city-state's political harmony and international power. The Spartan invasions of
            the Athenian countryside forced crowds of country dwellers into the cramped confines of
            the city behind its defensive walls. Many people both urban and rural found their
            livelihoods threatened by the economic dislocations of the war. Women without wealth
            whose spouses or male relatives were killed in the war experienced particularly
            difficult times because dire necessity forced them to seek work outside the home to
            support themselves and their children. The expenses of the war drained the state
            treasury. Often reflecting in its plots the social, economic, and political tensions
            created by the war, Athenian comedy as a public art form revealed the depth of anxiety
            that the war's difficulties created and an indomitable confidence in the ingenuity and
            initiative of the people of Athens in finding solutions to their problems.</p>

            <head>Crowding in the city of Athens</head>
            <p>Perhaps the most ruinous personal losses and disruptions caused by wartime conditions
              at Athens were imposed on the the many people who usually lived in the countryside
              outside the walls of the urban center. <emph>These country dwellers periodically had
                to take refuge inside the city walls</emph><note>

              </note> while the Spartan invaders wrecked their homes and damaged their fields. If
              they did not also own a house in the city or have friends who could take them in,
              people whose normal residences were outside the walls of Athens simply had to camp in
              public areas in the city in uncomfortable and unsanitary conditions. The crowded
              conditions in the city created by the influx of uhnappy and anxious country dwellers
              led to friction between city dwellers and the refugees from the rural areas.</p>

            <head>Athenian comedy during the war</head>
            <p>The stresses of everyday life during the exceedingly trying times of the
              Peloponnesian War were reflected in Athenian comedies produced during this period.
              Comic plays were the other main form of dramatic art in ancient Athens besides
              tragedies. Like tragedies, comedies were composed in verse and had been presented
              annually since early in the fifth century B.C. They formed a separate competition in
              the Athenian civic festivals in honor of Dionysus in the same outdoor theater used for
              tragedies. It is uncertain whether women could attend. The all-male casts of comic
              productions consisted of a chorus of twenty-four members in addition to regular
              actors. Unlike tragedy, comedy was not restricted to having no more than three actors
              with speaking parts on stage at the same time. The beauty of the soaring poetry of the
              choral songs of comedy was matched by the ingeniously imaginative fantasy of its
              plots, which almost always ended with a festive resolution of the problems with which
              they had begun. The story of the <emph> Birds by Aristophanes</emph><note><bibl

            <head>The humor and plots of Athenian comedy</head>
            <p>The immediate purpose of a comic playwright naturally was to create beautiful poetry
              and raise laughs at the same time in the hope of winning the award for the festival's
              best comedy. Much of the humor of Athenian comedy had to do with sex and bodily
              functions, and much of its ribaldry was delivered in a stream of imaginative
              profanity. The plots of fifth-century Athenian comedies primarily dealt with current

              </note> of 411 B.C., named after the female lead character of the play. It portrays
              the women of Athens as teaming up with the women of Sparta to force their husbands to
              end the Peloponnesian War. To make the men agree to a peace treaty, the women first
              seize the Acropolis, where Athens' financial reserves are kept, and prevent the men
              from squandering them further on the war. They then beat back an attack on their
              position by the old men who have remained in Athens while the younger men are out on
              campaign. When their husbands return from battle, the women refuse to have sex with
              them. This sex strike, which is portrayed in a series of risqué episodes,
              finally coerces the men of Athens and Sparta to agree to a peace treaty. </p>
            <p>The <title>Lysistrata</title> presents women acting bravely and aggressively against
              men who seem bent both on destroying their family life by staying away from home for
              long stretches while on military campaign and on ruining the city-state by prolonging
              a pointless war. In other words, the play's powerful women take on masculine roles to
              preserve the traditional way of life of the community. Lysistrata herself emphasizes
              this point in the very speech in which she insists that women have the intelligence
              and judgment to make political decisions. She came by her knowledge, she says, in the
              traditional way: <emph>“I am a woman, and, yes, I have brains. And I'm not
                badly off for judgment. Nor has my education been bad, coming as it has from my
                listening often to the conversations of my father and the elders among the
                men.”</emph><note>
                <bibl n="Aristoph. Lys. 1124">Aristoph. Lys. 1124</bibl>
              </note> Lysistrata was schooled in the traditional fashion, by learning from older
              men. Her old-fashioned training and good sense allowed her to see what needed to be
              done to protect the community. Like the heroines of tragedy, Lysistrata is literally a
              reactionary; she wants to put things back the way they were. To do that, however, she
              has to act like a revolutionary. Ending the war would be so easy that women could do
              it, Aristophanes is telling Athenian men, and Athenians should concern themselves with
              preserving the old ways, lest they be lost.</p>

          the Classical period and the beginning of the Hellenistic period (which is not covered in
          the Historical Overview). On this traditional scheme of reckoning the Hellenistic period
          is made to reach until 30 B.C., the death of Cleopatra VII, queen of Egypt and the last
          descendant of the Macedonian royal house. In the Hellenistic period Rome became the
          foremost power in the Mediterranean region and eventually made Greece a Roman
          province.</p>
        <p>The city-states of Greece had already been overshadowed as international powers by the
          rise of the kingdom of Macedonia under Philip II and his son Alexander in the latter half
          of the fourth century, and after Alexander's death in 323 the Hellenistic kingdoms that
          sprang up to control what had been his short-lived empire continued to dominate the Greek
          world in terms of military and economic power. The basic institutions of the Greek
          city-state remained in place, however, in the Hellenistic period, and in many respects
          little changed in the lives of the majority of Greeks— those who worked on the
          land. The story of Greece in the fourth century— a continuing tale of disunity
          and strife— provides the background for the loss of political and military
          dominance by the Greek city-states to the warrior society of Macedonia and its successor
          kingdoms.</p>

          <p>Many Athenian households lost fathers, sons, or brothers to the violence of battle in
            the Peloponnesian War, but resourceful families found ways to compensate for the
            economic strain that such personal tragedies could create. An Athenian named
              <emph>Aristarchus</emph><note>

            experienced financial difficulty because the turmoil of the war had severely diminished
            his income and also caused his sisters, nieces, and female cousins to come live with
            him. He found himself unable to support this swollen household of fourteen, not counting
            the slaves. Aristarchus's friend Socrates (469-399 B.C.) thereupon reminded him that his
            female relatives knew quite well how to make men's and women's cloaks, shirts, capes,
            and smocks, “the work considered the best and most fitting for

            But others did make a living by selling such clothing or by baking and selling bread,
            Socrates pointed out, and Aristarchus could have the women in his house do the same. The
            plan was a success, but the women complained that Aristarchus was now the only member of
            the household who ate without working. <emph>Socrates advised his friend</emph><note>

            century B.C., became perhaps the most infamous event in the history of Athens after the
            Peloponnesian War because his life had been devoted to combating the idea that justice
            should be equated with power to work one's will. Coming, as it did, during a time of
            social and political turmoil, his death indicated the fragility of Athenian justice in
            practice. His passionate concern to discover valid guidelines for leading a just life
            and to prove that justice is better than injustice under all circumstances gave a new
            direction to Greek philosophy: an <emph>emphasis on ethics</emph><note>

            serve as a hoplite in the army and support a wife and several children. He may have
            inherited some money, and he also received gifts from wealthy admirers. He paid so
            little attention to his physical appearance and clothes that many Athenians regarded him
            as eccentric. Sporting, in his words, a stomach <emph>“somewhat too large to

            resembled his fellow Athenians, who placed great value on the importance and pleasure of
            speaking with each other at length. He wrote nothing; our knowledge of his ideas comes
            from others' writings, especially those of his pupil <emph>Plato</emph><note><bibl

              1.30.3</bibl></note>. Plato's dialogues, so called because they present Socrates and
            others in extended conversation about philosophy, portray Socrates as a relentless
            questioner of his fellow citizens, foreign friends, and various sophists. Socrates's
            questions had the unsettling aim of making his interlocutors— his partners in
            the conversation— examine the basic assumptions of their way of life.
            Employing what has come to be called the Socratic method, Socrates never directly
            instructs his conversational partners; instead, he leads them to draw conclusions in
            response to his probing questions and refutations of their assumptions.</p>
          <p>Socrates typically began one of his conversations by asking the interlocutor for a
            definition of an abstract quality such as happiness or a virtue such as courage. For
            instance, in the dialogue entitled <emph>
              <title>Laches</title>

            that name who appears as one of the dialogue's interlocutors, Socrates asks Laches and
            another distinguished military commander what makes a citizen a brave soldier. Socrates
            then proceeds by further questioning to show that the definitions of courage and
            instances of courageous behavior stated by the interlocutors actually conflict with
            their other beliefs about the behavior that constituted courage.</p>

          <p>This indirect method of searching for the truth often left Socrates's interlocutors in
            a state of puzzlement because they were forced to conclude that they were ignorant of
            what they began by assuming they knew very well. Socrates insisted that he, too, was
            ignorant of the best definition of virtue but that <emph>his wisdom consisted of knowing

            improve rather than undermine his interlocutors' beliefs in morality, even though, as

              <bibl n="Plat. Meno 80a">Plat. Meno 80a</bibl>

            justified morality. He especially attacked the view of the sophists that proclaimed

            </note> was justified because it created happiness. Essentially, he seems to have argued

              <bibl n="Plat. Crito 48b">Plat. Crito 48b</bibl>
            </note>, regardless of their material success. Since Socrates believed that knowledge
            itself was sufficient for happiness, he therefore asserted that no one knowingly behaved
            unjustly and that behaving justly was always in the individual's interest. It might
            appear, he maintained, that individuals could promote their interests by cheating or
            using force on those weaker than themselves, but this appearance was deceptive. It was
            in fact ignorance to believe that the best life was the life of unlimited power to
            pursue whatever one desired. Instead, the most desirable human life was concerned with
            virtue and guided by rational <emph>reflection</emph><note>

            </note>, his effect on many people was as upsetting as the relativistic doctrines of the
            sophists had been. Indeed, Socrates's refutation of his fellow conversationalists' most
            cherished certainties, indirectly expressed through his method of questioning, made some
            of his interlocutors decidedly uncomfortable. Unhappiest of all were the fathers whose
              <emph>sons, after listening to Socrates reduce someone to utter bewilderment, came
              home to try the same technique on their parents</emph><note><bibl n="Plat. Apol. 23"

            education between parent and child— the son was supposed to be educated by the
            father— had cause to feel that Socrates's effect, even if it was not his
            intention, was to undermine the stability of society by questioning Athenian traditions
            and inspiring young men to do the same with the passionate enthusiasm of their youth. We
            cannot say with certainty what Athenian women thought of Socrates or he of them.

            </note>, and he perhaps believed that women and men both had the same basic capacity for
            justice. Nevertheless, the realities of Athenian society meant that Socrates circulated
            primarily among men and addressed his ideas to them and their situations. He is,

            the accusers had to convince the jurors in the case that what Socrates had done was a
            crime. No judge presided to rule on what evidence was admissible or how the law should
            be applied, as usual in Athenian trials. Speaking for themselves as the prosecutors, as
            also required by Athenian law, the accusers argued their case against Socrates before a
            jury of 501 men that had been assembled by lot from that year's pool of eligible jurors,
            drawn from the male citizens over thirty years old. The prosecution had both a religious
            and a moral component. Religiously, they accused Socrates of not believing in the gods
            of the city-state and of introducing new divinities. Morally, they charged, he had led
            the young men of Athens away from Athenian conventions and ideals. After the conclusion
            of the prosecutors' remarks, Socrates spoke in his own defense, as required by Athenian
            legal procedure. Plato presents Socrates as taking this occasion not to rebut all the
            charges or beg for sympathy, as jurors expected in serious cases, but to reiterate
              <emph>his unyielding dedication to goading his fellow citizens into examining their

            the jurors to decide between alternative penalties proposed by the prosecutors and the
            defendant. Anytus and his associates proposed death. In such instances the defendant was
            then expected to offer exile as the alternative, which the jury would then usually

        <p>One of the reasons that the sophists, who had flocked to Athens in the fifth century
          B.C., had stirred up controversy was that their teachings seemed to many to undermine
          time-honored moral traditions. Their relativistic doctrines implied that justice actually
          meant, to paraphrase the fifth-century historian Thucydides describing Athenian war-time
          behavior, the strong seizing all they have the power to obtain and the weak enduring what
          they had to accept. Attacking this doctrine was one of the many different subjects
          undertaken by the philosopher Plato in the fourth century B.C. Plato's famous pupil,
          Aristotle, combined his teacher's passion for theoretical philosophy with a scientific
          curiosity about all the phenomena of the natural world. Their thought helped create a new
          foundation for ethical and scientific inquiry. Their philosophical interests seemed too
          distant from the concrete concerns of a public career to men like the orator Isocrates,
          however, who insisted that a proper education centered on rhetoric and practical
          wisdom.</p>

            rising above narrow self-interest to knowledge of any universal truth. In his works

            justifiable system of government. Instead, he sketched what he saw as the philosophical
            basis for ideal political and social structures among human beings. His utopian vision

            in astronomy, mathematics, and metaphysics (theoretical explanations for phenomena that
            cannot be understood through direct experience or scientific experiment). After Plato's
            death, his ideas attracted relatively little attention among philosophers for the next
            two centuries, until they were revived as important points for debate in the Roman era.
            Nevertheless, the sheer intellectual power of Plato's thought and the controversy it has
            engendered ever since his lifetime have won him fame as one of the world's greatest

            their guide. The Academy became so famous as a gathering place for intellectuals that it

            of a stick two feet long, for example, is evident when it is compared with another

          <p>Plato refused to accept the relativity of the virtues as reality. He developed the
            theory that the virtues cannot be discovered through experience; rather, the virtues are
            absolutes that can be apprehended only by thought and that somehow exist independently
            of human existence. The separate realities of the pure virtues Plato referred to in some

              >idea</foreign> , plur. <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">ideai</foreign> ); among the Forms were
            Goodness, Justice, Beauty, and Equality. He argued that the Forms were invisible,
            invariable, and eternal entities located in a higher realm beyond the empirical world of
            human beings. The Forms such as Goodness, Justice, Beauty, and Equality are, according
            to Plato, true reality; what humans experience with their senses are the impure shadows
            of this reality.</p>
          <p>Each Form, Plato seems to say, is an essential quality, one that people experience only
            through contrast between opposites. For example, that a stick embodies equality to
            another of the same length but inequality to a stick of a different length demonstrates
            equality only through contrast with the unequal stick. The Form Equality, however, is
            the pure essence of equality, which under no circumstances can be unequal or possess the
            quality of inequality. Such a pure Form is beyond human experience. The same reasoning
            applies to the other virtues such as goodness or beauty or justice.</p>
          <p>Plato's concept of Forms required the further belief that knowledge of them came
            through the human soul, which must be immortal. When a soul is incarnated in its current
            body, it brings with it knowledge of the Forms. The soul then uses reason in argument
            and proof, not empirical observation through the senses, to recollect its pre-existent
            knowledge.</p>
          <p>Plato was not consistent throughout his career in his views on the nature or the
            significance of Forms, and his later works seem quite divorced from the theory.
            Nevertheless, Forms provide a good example of both the complexity and the wide range of
            Platonic thought. With his theory of Forms, Plato made metaphysics a central issue for
            philosophers ever since.</p>

            separateness of soul and body would play an influential role in later philosophical and
            religious thought. In a dialogue written late in his life, Plato said the pre-existing
            knowledge possessed by the immortal human soul is in truth the knowledge known to the
            supreme deity. Plato called this god the <emph>Demiurge</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 40c">Plat. Tim. 40c</bibl>
            </note> (“craftsman”) because the deity used knowledge of the Forms
            to craft the world of living beings from raw matter. According to this doctrine of
            Plato, a knowing, rational God created the world, and the world therefore has order.
            Furthermore, its beings have goals, as evidenced by animals adapting to their
            environments in order to flourish. The Demiurge wanted to reproduce in the material
            world the perfect order of the Forms, but the world as crafted turned out not to be
            perfect because matter is necessarily imperfect. Plato suggested that the proper goal
            for human beings is to seek perfect order and purity in their own souls by making
            rational desires control their irrational desires. The latter cause harm in various
            ways. The <emph>desire to drink wine to excess</emph><note>

            to come the next day. Those who are governed by irrational desires thus fail to consider
            the future of both body and soul. Finally, since the soul is immortal and the body is
            not, our present, impure existence is only one passing phase in our cosmic

          <p>Plato employed his theory of Forms not only in metaphysical speculation about the
            original creation of the everyday world in which people live but also in showing the way
            human society should be constructed in an ideal world. One version of Plato's utopian
            vision is found in his most famous dialogue, the <title>Republic</title>. This work,
            whose Greek title (<emph>

            primarily concerns the nature of justice and the reasons that people should be just

            the actual practice of his times. Indeed, never before in Western history had anyone
            proposed— even in fantasy— that work be allocated in human society
            without regard to gender. Moreover, to minimize distraction,

            </note>. Male and female guardians are to live in houses shared in common, to eat in the
            same mess halls, and to exercise in the same gymnasiums. The children are to be raised
            as a group in a common environment by special caretakers. Although this scheme is meant
            to free women guardians from child-care responsibilities and enable them to rule equally
            with men, Plato fails to consider that women guardians would in reality have a much
            tougher life than the men because they would have to be pregnant frequently and undergo
            the strain and danger of giving birth. At the same time, he evidently does not believe
            they are disqualified for ruling on this account. The guardians who achieved the highest
            level of knowledge in Plato's ideal society would qualify to rule over the ideally just
            state as philosopher-kings.</p>
          <p>To become a guardian, a person from childhood must be educated for many years in
            mathematics, astronomy, and metaphysics to gain the knowledge that Plato in the
              <title>Republic</title> presented as necessary if one was to rule for the common good.
            Plato's specifications for the education of guardians in fact make him the first thinker
            to argue systematically that education should be the training of the mind and the
            character rather than simply the acquisition of information and practical skills. Such a
            state would necessarily be authoritarian because only the ruling class would possess the
            knowledge to determine its policies and make decisions determining who is allowed to
            mate with whom to produce the best children.</p>

            political science, ethics, literary criticism. Apparently an inspiring teacher,
            Aristotle encouraged his followers to conduct research in numerous fields of specialized
            knowledge. For example, he had student researchers compile <emph>reports</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Aristot. Ath. Pol. 2.1">Aristot. Ath. Pol. 2.1</bibl>
            </note> on the systems of government of 158 Greek states. He also worked out a
            sophisticated system of logic for precise argumentation. Creating a careful system to
            identify the forms of valid arguments, Aristotle established grounds for distinguishing
            a logically sound case from a merely persuasive one. He first gave names to contrasts
            such as premise <foreign xml:lang="la">versus</foreign> conclusion and the universal
              <foreign xml:lang="la">versus</foreign> the particular that have been commonplaces of
            thought and speech ever since. He also studied the process of explanation itself,
            formulating the influential <emph>doctrine of four causes</emph><note><bibl
                n="Aristot. Met. 2.994a">Aristot. Met. 2.994a 1</bibl>, <bibl

            Aristotle, four different categories of explanation exist that are not reducible to a
            single, unified whole: form (defining characteristics), matter (constituent elements),
            origin of movement (similar to what we commonly mean by “cause”),
            and <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">telos</foreign> (aim or goal). This analysis exemplifies
            Aristotle's care never to oversimplify the complexity of reality. Some of Aristotle's
            most influential discussions concentrated on understanding qualitative concepts that
            human beings tend to take for granted, such as time, space, motion, and change. Through
            careful argumentation he probed the philosophical difficulties that lie beneath the
            surface of these familiar notions, and his views on the nature of things exercised an
            overwhelming influence on later thinkers.</p>

          <head>Aristotle's Methods</head>
          <p>Much of Aristotle's philosophical thought reflected the influence of Plato, but he also
            refined and even rejected ideas that his teacher had advocated. He denied the validity

              7.1028b</bibl></note>, for example, on the grounds that the separate existence that
            Plato postulated for them failed to make sense. This position typified Aristotle's
            general preference for explanations based on common sense rather than metaphysics. By
            modern standards his scientific thought paid relatively limited attention to
            mathematical models of explanation and quantitative reasoning, but mathematics in his
            time had not yet reached the level of sophistication appropriate for such work. His
            method also differed from that of modern scientists because it did not include
            controlled experimentation. Aristotle believed that investigators had a better chance of
            understanding objects and beings by observing them in their natural setting than under
            the artificial conditions of a laboratory. His coupling of detailed investigation with
            perceptive reasoning served especially well in such physical sciences as biology,
            botany, and zoology. For example, as the first scientist to try to collect all the
            available information on the animal species and to classify them, Aristotle recorded the
            facts about more than five hundred different kinds of animals, including insects. Many
            of his descriptions represented significant advances in learning. His recognition that
            whales and dolphins were mammals, for instance, which later writers on animals
            overlooked, was not rediscovered for another two thousand years. His gynecology,
            however, in contrast to much of his other learning, was seriously flawed.</p>

            we might call an end or a function. To explain a phenomenon, Aristotle said that one
            must discover its goal— to understand “that for the sake of
            which” the phenomenon in question existed. A simple example of this kind of
            explanation is the duck's webbed feet. According to Aristotle's reasoning, ducks have
            webbed feet for the sake of swimming, an activity that supports the goal of a duck's
            existence, which is to find food in the water so as to stay alive. Aristotle argued that

            into existence to meet the human need to live together, since individuals living in

            possible an orderly life of virtue for its citizens. The means to achieve this ordered
            life were the rule of law and the process of citizens' ruling and being ruled in

            inferior to men. His view of the inferiority of women was based on faulty notions of
            biology. He wrongly believed, for example, that in procreation the male with his semen
            actively gave the fetus its form, while the female had only the passive role of
            providing its matter. His assertion that females were less courageous than males was
            justified by dubious evidence about animals, such as the report that a male squid would
            stand by as if to help when its mate was speared but that a female squid would swim away
            when the male was impaled. Although his erroneous biology led Aristotle to evaluate
            females as incomplete males, he believed that human communities could be successful and
            happy only if they included the contributions of both women and men. Aristotle argued

            equated with the simple-minded pursuit of pleasure, stems from fulfilling human
            potentialities. These potentialities can be identified by rational choice, practical
            judgment, and recognition of the value of choosing the mean instead of extremes. The
            central moral problem is the nearly universal human tendency to want to “get
            more,” to act unjustly whenever one has the power to do so. The aim of
            education is to dissuade people from this inclination, which has its worst effects when
            it is directed at acquiring money or honor. In this context Aristotle was thinking of
            men in public life outside the home, and he says that the dangerous disorder caused by
            men's desire for “getting more” occurs both in democracies and
            oligarchies. <emph>The greatest threat to democracy was the teaching of the sophists

          <p>Aristotle regarded science and philosophy not as abstract subjects isolated from the
            concerns of ordinary existence but rather as the disciplined search for knowledge in
            every aspect of life. That search epitomized the kind of rational human activity that
            alone could bring the good life and genuine happiness. Some modern critics have replied
            that Aristotle's work lacks a clear moral code, but he did the study of ethics a great
            service by insisting that standards of right and wrong have merit only if they are
            grounded in character and aligned with the good in human nature and do not simply
            consist of lists of abstract reasons for behaving in one way rather than another. An
            ethical system, that is, must be relevant to the actual moral situations that human
            beings continually experience in their lives. In ethics, as in all his scholarship,
            Aristotle distinguished himself by the insistence that the life of the mind and
            experience of the real world were inseparable components in the quest to define a
            worthwhile existence for human beings.</p>

            practical wisdom and training that had direct application to the public lives of
            upper-class male citizens in a swiftly changing world. The most important subject in
            this education was rhetoric, the skill of persuasive public speaking, which itself
            depended not only on oratorical techniques but also on the knowledge of the world and of
            human psychology that speakers required to be effective. The ideas about education and

            Plato rejected as utterly wrong. Isocrates was born to a rich family and studied with
            sophists and thinkers including Socrates. Since he lacked the voice to address large
            gatherings, Isocrates composed speeches for other men to deliver and sought to influence
            public opinion and political leaders at Athens and abroad by publishing speeches of his
            own in writing. He regarded <emph>education</emph><note>

            </note> as the preparation for a useful life doing good in matters of public importance.
            He sought to develop an educational middle ground between the theoretical study of
            abstract ideas and purely crass training in rhetorical techniques for influencing others
            to one's own personal advantage. In this way he stood between the ideals of Plato and
            the promises of unscrupulous sophists.</p>
          <p>Rhetoric was the skill that Isocrates sought to develop, but that development, he
            insisted, could come <emph>only with natural talent and the practical experience of

            trained men with developed consciences. Women were of course excluded from participation
            because they could not take part in politics. The Isocratean emphasis on rhetoric and
            its application in the real world of politics won many more adherents among men in Greek
            and, later, Roman culture than did the Platonic vision of the philosophical life, and it
            would have great influence when revived in Renaissance Europe, two thousand years

            friction between the richer communities and the many poor areas in Greece. Isocrates

            than did most men, soon after the age of twenty, because the instability of the kingship

            greatness consisted of his ability to inspire his men to follow him into hostile,
            unknown regions where they were reluctant to go, beyond the borders of civilization as
            they knew it. Alexander inspired his troops with his reckless disregard for his own
            safety. He often plunged into the enemy at the head of his men, sharing the danger of
            the common soldier. No one could miss him in his plumed helmet, vividly colored cloak,
            and armor polished to reflect the sun. So intent on conquering distant lands was
            Alexander that <emph>he had rejected advice to delay his departure from Macedonia until

            principal adviser, an experienced older man, by giving away virtually all his land and
            property in order to strengthen the army, thereby creating new landowners who would
            furnish troops. “What,” he was asked,” do you have left
            for yourself?” “My hopes,” Alexander replied. Those hopes
            centered on constructing a heroic image of himself as a warrior as glorious as the
            incomparable Achilles of Homer's <title>Iliad</title>. Alexander always kept a copy of
            the <title>Iliad</title> under his pillow, along with a dagger. Alexander's aspirations

            women whom soldiers had taken as mates along the way and their children, entertainers,

            wanted. Friendly armies expected local people to sell or donate food to its supply
            officers and also to the merchants trailing along. These entrepreneurs would set up
            markets to resell locally obtained provisions to the soldiers. Since most farmers in
            antiquity had practically no surplus to sell, they found this expectation—
            which was in reality a requirement— a terrific hardship. The money the farmers
            received was of little use to them because there was nothing to buy with it in the
            countryside, where their neighbors had also had to participate in the forced marketing
            of their subsistence.</p>

          <p>From the heartland of Persia, <emph>Alexander in 329 B.C. marched northeastward into

            mobile locals, who avoided pitched battles in favor of the guerrilla tactics of attack
            and retreat, Alexander settled for an alliance that he sealed by marrying the Bactrian
            princess Roxane in 327 B.C. In this same period, Alexander completed the
              <emph>cold-blooded suppression of both real and imagined resistance to his

            accusations of treachery or disloyalty as justification for the execution of those
            Macedonians he had come to distrust. These executions, like the destruction of Thebes in
            335 B.C., demonstrate Alexander's appreciation of terror as a disincentive to
            rebellion.</p>

            edge of the farthest land on the earth, which Aristotle, whom Philip had once employed
            as the young Alexander's tutor, had taught was a sphere. Seventy days of marching
            through monsoon rains, however, finally shattered the nerves of Alexander's soldiers. In

            was forced to agree to lead them in the direction of home. When his men had balked

            westward along the coast to explore for possible sites for new settlements and harbors.
            Alexander himself led the contingent that braved the desert, planning to surpass earlier
            Persian kings by marching through territory that they had found impossible. There a
            flash flood wiped out most of the noncombatants following the army. Many of the soldiers
            also died on the march through the desert, expiring from lack of water and the heat,
            which has been recorded at 127 degrees in the shade in that area. Alexander, as always,
            shared his men's hardships. In one legendary episode from this horrible ordeal, a few
            men were said to have brought him a helmet containing some water they had found.
            Alexander spilled the water out onto the sand rather than drink when his men could not.
              <emph>The remains of the army finally reached safety in the heartland of Persia in 324

          <head>Alexander's Last Plans</head>
          <p>When he had returned to Persia, Alexander promptly began to formulate plans for an
            invasion of the Arabian peninsula and, to follow that, all of North Africa west of
            Egypt. By the time of his return to Persia, Alexander had dropped all pretense of ruling
            over the Greeks as anything other than an absolute monarch. Despite his earlier promise
            to respect the internal freedom of the Greek city-states, he impinged on their autonomy
            by sending a peremptory <emph>decree ordering them to restore to citizenship the large
              number of exiles from the Greek city-states</emph><note><bibl n="Din. 1.82">Din.
                1.82</bibl>, <bibl n="Diod. 17.109.1">Diod. 17.109.1-2</bibl></note>, who had been
            created over the previous decades of war in Greece and whose status as wandering,
            stateless persons was creating unrest. Even more striking was his communication that
              <emph>he wished to receive the honors due a god</emph><note>
              <bibl n="Din. 1.94">Din. 1.94</bibl>
            </note>. Initially dumbfounded by this request, the leaders of most Greek states soon
            complied by sending honorary delegations to him as if he were a god. The Spartan Damis
            pithily expressed the only prudent position on Alexander's deification open to the cowed
            Greeks: “If Alexander wishes to be a god, we agree that he be called a
            god.” Scholars continue to debate Alexander's motive for desiring the Greeks
            to acknowledge him as a god, but few now accept a formerly popular theory that he sought
            divinity because he believed the city-states would then have to obey his orders as
            originating from a divinity, whose authority would supersede that of all earthly
            regimes. Personal rather than political motives best explain his request. He almost
            certainly had come to believe that he was the son of Zeus; after all, <emph>Greek
              mythology told many stories of Zeus producing children by mating with a human
              female.</emph><note>

            </note> Most of those legendary offspring were mortal, but Alexander's conquest showed
            that he had surpassed them. His feats must be superhuman, he could well have believed,
            because they exceeded the bounds of human possibility. Alexander's accomplishments
            demonstrated that he had achieved godlike power and therefore must be a god himself.
            Alexander's divinity was, in ancient terms, a natural consequence of his power.</p>

          <head>The Aims of Alexander</head>
          <p>Alexander's overall aims can best be explained as interlinked goals: the conquest and
            administration of the known world and the exploration and possible colonization of new
            territory beyond. Conquest through military action was a time-honored pursuit for
            Macedonian aristocrats like Alexander. He included <emph>non-Macedonians</emph><note>

            wished to promote an abstract notion of what has sometimes been called “the
            brotherhood of man.” Alexander's explorations benefited numerous scientific
            fields from geography to botany because he took along scientifically minded writers to
            collect and catalogue the new knowledge that they encountered. <emph>The far-flung new

            territory and provide warnings to headquarters in case of local uprisings. They also

            produced in the Mediterranean region.</p>

            suffering for months from depression brought on by the death of his best friend,
            Hephaistion. Close since their boyhoods, Alexander and Hephaistion were probably lovers.
            When Hephaistion died in a bout of excessive drinking, Alexander went wild with grief.
            The depth of his emotion was evident when he planned to build an elaborate temple to
            honor Hephaistion as a god. Meanwhile, Alexander threw himself into preparing for his
            Arabian campaign by exploring the marshy lowlands of southern Mesopotamia. Perhaps it
            was on one of these trips that he contracted the malaria-like fever that, exacerbated by
            a two-day drinking binge, killed him.</p>
          <p>Like Pericles, Alexander had made no plans about what should happen if he should die
            unexpectedly. His wife Roxane was to give birth to their first child only some months
            after Alexander's death. When at Alexander's deathbed his commanders asked him to whom
            he bequeathed his kingdom, he replied, <emph>“To the most

            fabulous exploits attributed to him became popular folk tales throughout the ancient
            world, even reaching distant regions where Alexander had never trod, such as deep into
            Africa. The popularity of the legend of Alexander as a symbol of the height of
            achievement for a masculine warrior-hero served as one of his most persistent legacies
            to later ages. That the worlds of Greece and the Near East had been brought into closer
            contact than ever before represented the other long-lasting effect of his astonishing
