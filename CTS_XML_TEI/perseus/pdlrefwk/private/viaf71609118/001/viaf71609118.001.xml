<p>I. </p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">pole/mou kai\ ma/xhs</lem></app>: Socrates and Chaerephon come just after Gorgias has finished his lecture. Callicles receives them with a jest, the point of which lies in the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(/tw</foreign>. In the double expression, the more general precedes, as is natural, the more definite.</p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">metalagxa/nein</lem></app>: occurs also in <title>Rep.</title> 429 a with <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pisth/mhs</foreign>, and <title>Leg.</title> 873 c with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai)sxu/nhs</foreign>. It is rare.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">to\ lego/menon</lem></app>: in appos. with the sentence. See G. 137, 3; H. 626 b.</p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">kato/pin e(orth=s</lem></app>: proverbial, like post festum. This would call up to the Greek mind their public exhibitions, and the banquets with which they closed. Here is probably also an allusion to the extravagant enthusiasm which led the Athenians to designate as festivals those days on which Gorgias lectured. See Introd.  § 4 end
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">kai\ ma/la g'  a)stei/as</lem></app>: Hirschig remarks the frequency of such answers as these, which avoid the repetition of the last word of the preceding question. <title>Cf. Theaet.</title> 168 e <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ll'  ou)/ toi sou= ge, w)= *qeo/dwre, a)/meinon</foreign>, <title>Crat.</title> 391 b.</p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)ttei/as</lem></app>: properly <gloss>belonging to a city.</gloss> It became an adj. of quality inasmuch as city festivals and celebrations are naturally superior to those of the country. It is used here in a good sense, though it may also mean “citified.”
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)pedei/cato</lem></app>: the aor. is necessitated by the time-limit (<foreign xml:lang="greek">o)li/gon pro/teron</foreign>).</p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o)li/gon pro/teron</lem></app>: the first word is an acc. of extent; the second is adverbial. <pb n="34"/>
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tou/twn</lem></app>: the pl. refers to the fact and its consequences.</p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o(/de</lem></app>: is deictic.</p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)n a)gora=|</lem></app>: the omission of the art. shows that this was a phrase like ‘in town,’ ‘on change.’ By this time, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)gora/</foreign> had come in Athens to mean simply the exchange, or marketplace, where people assembled not for public debate (that was in the Pnyx), but for business. It was a favorite resort of Socrates, since there the concourse of people offered him the best opportunity for prosecuting his god-given vocation (cf. Introd. to <title>Apol.</title> § 25, and <title>Apol.</title> 33 a ff.). Cf. Xen. <title>Mem.</title> i. I. 10 <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)lla\ mh\n e)kei=no/s ge a)ei\ me\n h)=n e)n tw=| fanerw=|: prwi/ te ga\r ei)s tou\s peripa/tous kai\ ta\ gumna/sia h)/|ei kai\ plhqou/shs a)gora=s e)kei= fanero\s h)=n, kte(.</foreign> </p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)nagka/sas</lem></app>: the literal meaning is not to be pressed. Chaerephon as the constant companion of Socrates took the liveliest interest in all his actions.

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="447b">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ou)de\n pra=gma</lem></app>: shows the asyndeton of ordinary conversation.— </p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)gw\ ga\r kai\ i)a/somai</lem></app>: prob. contains some allusion to the story of Telephus, who when wounded by Achilles received from the oracle the assurance <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( trw/sas</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)a/setai</foreign>. The myth was made the subject of a noted  tragedy by Euripides.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">w(/ste e)pidei/cetai</lem></app> <foreign xml:lang="greek">: w(/ste</foreign>, when combined with the ind., can for all practical purposes be treated as if it were compounded of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(/tws</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">te/</foreign>. Cf. Lat. <foreign xml:lang="la">itaque</foreign>. See on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 458d"> 458 d</bibl>.</p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)pidei/cetai</lem></app>: here used absolutely in the same sense as above. The fut. has two sides, one corresponding to each condition; thus it is equiv. to (1) <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)qe/lei e)pidei/knusqai ei) dokei=</foreign>, and (2) <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pidei/cetai e)a\n bou/lh|</foreign>. Cf. a different case in <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 502b"> 502 b</bibl>, with note.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ti/ de/</lem></app>: the question shows that Chaerephon had not anticipated any great eagerness on Socrates' part.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)p'  au)to/</lem></app>: the pronoun is emphatic. See on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 458a"> 458 a</bibl>. The emphasis is heightened by <foreign xml:lang="greek">ge/</foreign>.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o(/tan bou/lhsqe</lem></app> <foreign xml:lang="greek"> kte(.</foreign>: contains an invitation, the basis of which is given by the clause with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ga/r</foreign>. The original conclusion of the condition was to be <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pidei/cetai</foreign>, but in the course of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ga/r</foreign> clause the speaker lost sight of this and continued with the co-ordinate construction.</p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">par'  e)me\ h(/kein oi)/kade</lem></app>: this shows that the speakers are neither in nor before the house of Callicles. On the place of meeting, see Introd. § 17. <pb n="35"/>

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="447c">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)qelh/seien a)/n</lem></app>: Socrates uses the opt. with <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> a great deal, esp. when he first meets a person. It is the mood of courtesy, but not of argument. In this dialogue the opt. preponderates at the beginning, but the subjv. overtakes it in the argumentative passage 471, 472; while in the whole dialogue the proportion of subjs. to opt. is 3 to 2.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">dialexqh=nai</lem></app>: emphasized in order to contrast Socrates' method with the <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi/deicis</foreign> of Gorgias.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">du/namis</lem></app> (vis): i.e. the power and inner meaning of the art, with which the <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pa/ggelma</foreign> should correspond,—the scope or compass.</p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)pagge/lletai</lem></app> <foreign xml:lang="greek"> kte(.</foreign>: cf. <title>Apol.</title> 33 b <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(=n mh/te u(pesxo/mhn ma/qhma mh/te e)di/daca. e)pagge/llesqai</foreign> is the regular word in Greek for ‘advertise,’ ‘profess.’
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">th\n de\ a)/llhn e)pi/deicin</lem></app>: it does not follow from this that Socrates considered the <foreign xml:lang="greek">dialexqh=nai</foreign> as a kind of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi/deicis</foreign>. It is only an example of the idiomatic Greek usage of <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/llos</foreign>, which does not include but excludes the word with which it is connected. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 473c"> 473 c</bibl> <foreign xml:lang="greek">politw=n kai\ a)/llwn ce/nwn</foreign>, <title>Apol.</title> 36 b. See G. 142, 2, N. 3; H. 705. We must use a circumlocution, or another word, in English. In Cal licles' answer, however, the attributive force is regained.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">w(/sper su\ le/geis</lem></app>: const. closely with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)sau=qis</foreign>, as referring to the invitation of Callicles to come to his home.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ou)de\n oi(=on to\ au)to\n e)rwta=n</lem></app>: <hi rend="italic">there is nothing like asking the man himself.</hi> The articular infinitive is a favorite with Plato. He uses it most commonly in the acc. The nom. comes next in frequency, with the gen. a close third. The dat. is much less frequent. The pr. tense occurs nine times oftener than the aor., showing a great advance on Pindar. See <title>Am. Jour. Phil.</title> III. 193-201.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">au)tw=|</lem></app>: on account of its meaning (“the master,” Kr. 51. 5, 4; H. 681 c) is placed in this emphatic position. On the matter itself see Introd. § 7, and the passage from <title>Meno</title> quoted Introd. N. 12. Auditors are present also at the following dialogue (cf. Introd. § 17 end).</p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)ke/leue</lem></app>: imperf., because the same bidding or invitation was given to the different members of the group. <title>He bade us all.</title>
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">kalw=s le/geis</lem></app>: expresses more satisfaction than <foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)= le/geis</foreign> just before. <pb n="36"/>

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="447d">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ti/ e)/rwmai</lem></app>: deliberative subjunctive.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o(/stis e)sti/n</lem></app>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/stis</foreign> is regularly used to ask the question ‘who’ after a neg. (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 524e"> 524 e</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 526b"> 526 b</bibl>); but in all cases it may be used to express the idea of quality. See on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 453b"> 453 b</bibl>.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">w(/sper a)\n . . . a)pekri/nato a)/n</lem></app>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/sper a)\n ei)</foreign> is phraseological, and the second <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> comes in unconsciously with the conditional apodosis. The use of the aor. with <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> in the apodosis, following an imperf. with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)</foreign> in the protasis, where both refer to the same sphere of time, is not uncommon. In Plato, according to GMT. 414, it appears to be confined to such phrases as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)=pon a)/n, a)pekrina/mhn a)/n</foreign>. But similar constructions with other verbs are found in Dem., Aristoph., Soph., Eur., Xen., <hi rend="italic">etc. Cf.</hi> Dem. xix. 162, Ar. <title>Eq.</title> 507.</p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">dhmiourgo/s</lem></app>: see on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 452a"> 452 a</bibl>.

<milestone n="2" unit="part"/></p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">manqa/nw</lem></app>: one example suffices  to make the idea of Socrates clear to Chaerephon; two are not enough for Polus. This is, however, due to the fact that Chaerephon is familiar with Socrates' methods, while they are new and strange to Polus.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)pokri/nesqai</lem></app> <foreign xml:lang="greek"> kte(.</foreign>: this is the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/</foreign> of Socrates' question above in c. The tense shows that it is a general standing announcement.
</p></div>
<div type="section" n="448a">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">h)= pou a)/ra</lem></app> <foreign xml:lang="greek"> kte(.</foreign>: spoken in a wondering, admiring tone which expects an answer. “Surely, then, you must have but little difficulty in re-plying, Gorgias.” The irony lies in (the inferential) <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/ra</foreign> as well as in <foreign xml:lang="greek">r(a|di/ws</foreign>. On the pushing nature and insolence of Polus, see Introd. § 14. What is said generally in <title>Meno</title> 70 b (see Introd. N. 12) of the pupils of Gorgias applies excellently to him.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)mou=</lem></app>: by a very natural shift, <pb n="37"/>  after <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou/tou</foreign>.—‘Gor. <hi rend="italic">You may try the experiment if you please, Chaerephon.</hi> Pol. <title>Yes</title>, '<hi rend="italic">egad, and upon me too, if you like, Chaerephon.</hi>’ Cope.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">kai\ a)peirhke/nai</lem></app>: gives the ground of Polus' offer. Possibly he may also wish to intimate that Gorgias may now fairly retire, and yield the field to another.

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="448b">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ti/ de\ toi=to</lem></app>: sc. <foreign xml:lang="greek">diafe/rei</foreign>. “What difference does this make?” Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 497e"> 497 e</bibl>. Polus does not wish to slight his master, but only to win admiration for himself.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">(*hro/dikos</lem></app>: this brother of Gor gias (see Introd. § 4) must not be confounded with another physician of the same name who came from Selymbria (<title>Rep.</title> iii. 406 a, <title>Phaedr.</title> 227 d, <title>Prot.</title> 316 d), and was famed as the first to insist upon the value of gymnastics for health.
</p></div>
<div type="section" n="448c">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o(/per</lem></app>: after <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/na</foreign> by an easy transfer to the actual idea,—‘name.’

Aristophon's brother was thecelebrated painter Polygnotus of Thasus.

Polus speaks as from a book— perhaps from his own book  <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 462b">(462 b)</bibl>. <pb n="38"/>

 He overdoes the use of those figures, with which Gorgias also was accustomed to amuse himself, i.e. ‘paronomasia’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\ te/xnhn . . . kata\ tu/xhn</foreign>) and other phonetic figures in regard to the names of which theorists themselves were not at one. He uses the poetic <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai)w=na</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="greek">bi/on</foreign>. His statements are indefinite and cloudy, and finally he brings forward a wholly general attribute—as Socrates proves in e by the distinction between <foreign xml:lang="greek">poi/a</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/s</foreign>—of the matter in question, instead of its name. To speak of rhetoric as <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalli/sth tw=n texnw=n</foreign> is furthermore dialectically inappropriate, although it well agrees with the artistic design by drawing attention thus early to this idea. For other examples of similar mannerisms, see the speeches which go under the name of Gorgias (i.e. in the appendix to Blass' edition of Antiphon), and which, whether genuine or not, show admirably the peculiarities of the  Gorgianic school.

<milestone n="3" unit="part"/></p></div>
<div type="section" n="448d">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">pareskeua/sqai ei)s</lem></app>:  <gloss>equipped for</gloss>.  The phrase is a military one; hence <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gous</foreign> is almost equiv. to the later <foreign xml:lang="greek">logomaxi/an</foreign>, ‘disputation.’ The reference is to the readiness with which Polus begins his harangue.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ti/ ma/lista</lem></app>: <hi rend="italic">how so, pray?</hi> To Gorgias' view the question has been well answered.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">8</lem></app> f. </p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ou)k . . . a)lla/</lem></app>: the construction is colloquial. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)k</foreign> is to be translated <hi rend="italic">no!</hi> The following clause with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ge/</foreign> serves to give the reason for <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)k</foreign>, “that is, if.” The negative color of the whole complex causes the speaker to ground his position by <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)lla/</foreign> where one would more naturally find <foreign xml:lang="greek">ga/r</foreign>. It is not necessary to fill out the ellipsis with <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)\n h(/dion se/</foreign> either in Greek or English.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">dh=los ga/r moi</lem></app>: on the personal construction, see on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 449b"> 449 b</bibl>. <pb n="39"/>
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">diale/gesqai</lem></app>: the most unassuming name by which Socrates can characterize his practice, so completely the reverse of the commonly used rhetoric. The inf. is an acc. verbal noun.

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="448e">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">w(/sper tino\s ye/gontos</lem></app>: equiv. to <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/sper a)\n ei)/ tis e)/yege</foreign>.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">u(petei/nato</lem></app>: cf. the Eng. use of ‘lay down a proposition or principle’ to serve as analogy for future guidance. Note the asyndeton which appears somewhat harsh, but is not uncommon in clauses with <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/sper</foreign>. <title>Cf. Alcib. I.</title> 108 d <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/ ou)=n to\ kata\ tau/thn o)rqw=s gigno/meno/n e)stin</foreign>; <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/sper e)kei= e)gw/ soi to\ kata\ th\n te/xnhn e)/legon o)rqw=s, th\n gumnastikh/n, kai\ su\ dh\ ou)=n ou(/tws</foreign>  <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)ntau=qa ti/ fh/|s</foreign>;

<div type="section" n="449a">
<p>Socrates accepts tentatively the statement which has been so continually advanced, that <foreign xml:lang="greek">r(htorikh/</foreign> is a species of art, in order to proceed with the discussion. The correctness of this statement is brought under question later.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)gaqo/n ge</lem></app>: the self-satisfaction of Gorgias is so great that he speaks like a Homeric hero. Note the condescension (perhaps unconscious) in the following <foreign xml:lang="greek">ka/lei dh/</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">you may call me so, then</hi>), of which, however, Socrates takes no notice.</p><p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ei) dh/</lem></app>: <hi rend="italic">if . . . really.</hi> <pb n="40"/>

<div type="section" n="449b">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)/lloqi</lem></app>: on these travels, see Introd. § 5. The vagueness of the adverb stamps the whole statement as somewhat boastful.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">to\ de\ mh=kos tw=n lo/gwn</lem></app>: Socrates does not mean that the answers should be restricted to a certain length; but he wishes to exclude those answers which, instead of keeping strictly to the question under discussion, branch off and lose themselves in different trains of thought. By using <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai/</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="greek">*pw=los</foreign>, Socrates gives us to understand that he fears something similar from Gorgias.

</p></div>
<div type="section" n="449c">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)nagkai=ai . . . polei=sqai</lem></app>: the personal construction proceeds from the ‘prolepsis’ of the subject of the inf.,—a common occurrence with <foreign xml:lang="greek">di/kaios</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">dh=los</foreign>. The real subject of the infinitive is then <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)ni/as tw=n a)pokri/sewn</foreign>. Of this construction Plato affords other examples. <title>Cf.

In translation the adj. must be made neuter, or a circumlocution must be used. “There are certain answers in which it is necessary for one to deliver himself more at length.” See H. 944 a; Rid. § 230.

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">mhde/na a)\n . . . ei)pei=n</lem></app>: the use of <foreign xml:lang="greek">mh/</foreign> here is not to be considered as due <pb n="41"/>  to indir. disc. which would require <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)</foreign>, but as being in an inf. clause which is in apposition with <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(/n</foreign>.

<p>VII. The scolion was a peculiar kind of drinking-songs, <foreign xml:lang="greek">paroi/nia</foreign>,  sung at banquets. The one here alluded to is mentioned by Plato in <title>Euthyd.</title> 279 a, <title>Phileb.</title> 48 d, <title>Legg.</title> 631 c, 661 a. It probably was composed by Simonides, although according to some it was by Epicharmus. After Bergk's (Poet. Lyr. Gr. iii.^{4} 645) rhythmical changes the words acc. to the Scholiast read as follows:

<foreign xml:lang="greek">*(ugiai/nein me\n a)/riston a)ndri\ qnatw=|, deu/teron de\ fua\n kalo\n gene/sqai, to\ tri/ton de\ ploutei=n a)do/lws, kai\ to\ te/tarton h(ba=n meta\ tw=n fi/lwn</foreign>.

Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 455b"> 455 b</bibl>. It is noteworthy that only such things are enumerated as, like the assumed result of rhetoric, were reckoned among external advantages; for rhetoric, according to the view of Gorgias, should procure in the state either high office or honors. Hence the scolion is very applicable. Socrates brings forward the physician, the bodytrainer, and the banker, in order to contrast with the subjective judgment  of Gorgias the subjective opinions of others, and thus to show the subjectivity of the answer.

Zeuxis, the celebrated painter and contemporary of Socrates, was a native of Heraclea in Lower Italy. He was the pupil of Apollodorus, <pb n="53"/>  who, by a more delicate appreciation and application of the principles of light and shade in painting, greatly furthered the development of the art, and obtained for himself the surname of ‘Sciagraph.’ The paintings of Zeuxis, who belonged to the Ionic school, were noted for their delicacy and fine coloring. Besides the Helena which he painted for the Crotoniates (Cic. <hi rend="italic">de Inv.</hi> ii. 1. 1), his most celebrated picture was the Penelope, wherein he depicted with great success pure matronly modesty. The story of his contest with his rival Parrhasius is well known.
</p>

</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">kai\ pou=</lem></app>: Socrates wishes here to make clear that if we wish to define an object exactly, i.e. so as to make it easily recognizable, it is not sufficient to give the characteristic which it has in common with other objects, but rather it is necessary to mention that characteristic which belongs to it alone and distinguishes it from all other objects. So, for example, it is not sufficient to say that Zeuxis is a painter, i.e. one who either paints or has painted pictures; but in order to distinguish him from other painters, who also paint or have painted pictures, we must state more nearly the kind of pictures which he has painted (<foreign xml:lang="greek">poi=a</foreign>), as ‘he who painted the Helena or the Penelope.’ But even this is not entirely sufficient, for  there are still other painters who have painted these same objects; but when we say, ‘he who painted the Helena in Croton (<foreign xml:lang="greek">pou=</foreign>),’ we have definitely defined Zeuxis. <foreign xml:lang="greek">pou=</foreign> could also, and more naturally, refer to the scene of his labors,—where he had his studio. We must note (1) that <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( ta\ zw=|a gra/fwn</foreign> is only the common designation of all painters, by which they are distinguished from the <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gous</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">no/mous</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">suggra/mmata gra/fontes</foreign>, (2) that <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( gra/fwn</foreign> can and must be understood in the same way in which we so often understand <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( a)dikw=n, o( kratw=n</foreign>, etc., i.e. as a generic word, not limited in time (H. 827), (3) that <foreign xml:lang="greek">poi=os</foreign> is often scarcely to be distinguished from <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/s</foreign> (cf. Xen. <title>Anab.</title> iii. 1. 14 <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)gw\ ou)=n to\n e)k poi/as po/lews strathgo\n prosdokw= tau=ta pra/cein; poi/an d'  h(liki/an e)mautw=| e)lqei=n a)name/nw</foreign><hi rend="italic">;</hi>). With these points understood, we see that the present example suffices to show that to define rhetoric as <foreign xml:lang="greek">peiqou=s dhmiourgo/s</foreign>, i.e. <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( th\n peiqw\ a)pergazome/nh te/xnh</foreign> is insufficient, so long as the <foreign xml:lang="greek">peiqw/</foreign> wrought by it is not more exactly specified in order to distinguish it from that wrought by other arts which come under the same general definition. Cf. moreover the answer of Gorgias, below, <bibl n="Plat.

The idea here is this: “I thought you meant that, but still I asked; and you must not be surprised if I again ask something which seems to be evident enough; for it is absolutely essential for our argument that we proceed upon definitely expressed statements, and not upon mere suspicions, which may prove to be misunderstandings.” In the construction the speaker proceeds well enough until he is thrown off the track by <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)gw\ d'  e)panerwtw=</foreign>.

<p>XXXVII. On the role assigned to Callicles here, see Introd. § 15. After Polus has shown himself in capable of maintaining his views of rhetoric against the superior dialectical skill of Socrates, Callicles enters the discussion with a thought quite similar to the one with which Polus had entered it in <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 461b"> 461 b</bibl>. The view of life on which all of Socrates' deductions rest is so abhorrent to his innermost nature and all his hitherto cherished ideas that he cannot be brought to look upon the principles here advocated as the earnest convictions of a reasonable man. He does not, however, rush into the lists so roughly as Polus, but, being a more polished man of the world, turns first to Chaerephon, who is thoroughly acquainted with Socrates' views. He, however, wittily refers him to the master, in the same words with which Callicles himself had in <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 447c"> 447 c</bibl> referred Socrates to Gorgias. <pb n="132"/>

Artistically also his words form the text for the discussion which follows.

Callicles cleverly illustrates his exposition of the opposition between the principles of practical life and this theoretical philosophizing by reference again to the already cited <title>Antiope</title> of Euripides. Antiope had borne to Zeus twin sons, Amphion and Zethus, but was afterwards taken by her uncle Lycus to Thebes, where she suffered for a long time the most cruel treatment at the hands of Ly<pb n="147"/>  cus' wife, Dirce. Meanwhile, her sons were being brought up by a herdsman in the forest. Amphion devoted himself entirely to music, while the active and restless Zethus spent his time in hunting and the care of his herds. Finally Antiope escapes from her prison, and hurries to her sons. Dirce pursues, overtakes her, and is just in the act of having her bound to a wild steer, when the sons, who had been informed of their parentage by the herdsman, appear on the scene, rescue their mother from the hands of Dirce, and bind her to the steer instead. Dirce was then changed into a fountain. Amphion and Zethus attain the sovereignty in Thebes, and fortify it with walls. In this work Zethus contributed his great bodily strength, while Amphion's lyre drew after him the stones. This difference in character as related in the myth (Apollod. iii. 5. 5 <foreign xml:lang="greek">*zh=qos me\n ou)=n e)pemelei=to bouforbi/wn, *)amfi/wn de\ kiqarw|di/an h)/skei</foreign>) suggested to Euripides a dialogue between the brothers, wherein each praises his own calling to the disparagement of the other's. Callicles applies Euripides' words to the opposition between political and philosophical activity.
</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">5</lem></app> f. The words of Euripides are  given by Nauck. <title>Eur. frag.</title>^{2} 185, as follows:—

Yet these lines do not contain all that seems poetical in this passage.

Now that Callicles has stated exactly the manner in which he looks at life, Socrates proceeds to contrast that view with his own, not directly <pb n="167"/> indeed, but by a series of comparisons and similes, which serve the double purpose of calming the feelings of the listeners and readers after the impassioned speech of Callicles and, by presenting these pictures to the fancy, of preparing their minds for the following dialectical argument.

Socrates was acquainted with the Pythagorean teaching probably only orally, from association with his Theban friends Simmias and Cebes. For this reason Plato implies by the manner of expression that this  knowledge, which Socrates himself in nowise valued, was as general as possible. See Thompson.

It is not all <hi rend="italic">choric</hi> lyric which is condemned, but only that part of it which from its connexion with the Dionysus cult had found entrance into Athens and had there been much fostered by the state, which entrusted both native and foreign musicians with the arrangement and production of the dithyramb at the Dionysiac festivals, where contests (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)gw=nes</foreign>) took place in it. The  founder of dithyrambic melic was the just-named Arion of Methymne (B.C. 600), who resided at the court of Periander of Corinth. He was said to have introduced the <hi rend="italic">strophic</hi> arrangement, and the so-called <hi rend="italic">cyclic</hi> chorus (consisting of fifty members), which was thus named because the chorus was arranged in a circle around the altar. The second period of the dithyramb begins with the settling in Athens of Lasus of Hermione, a contemporary of the Pisistratidae and a teacher of Pindar. But it soon degenerated in Athens by excessive over-refinement and fantastic cultivation, until it received a new impulse towards the end of the Peloponnesian war by the more artistic cultivation of the dramatic and musical elements by Philoxenus of Cythera.

And he succeeded in a way, for he was ridiculed by the comic <pb n="195"/>  poets Strattis (who composed a comedy upon him), Plato Comicus, and also Aristophanes in the <title>Clouds</title> and the <title>Frogs</title>, as a sinner against art and taste,—one of those who are called in <title>Nub.</title> 333 <foreign xml:lang="greek">kukli/wn xorw=n a)|smatoka/mptai</foreign>.

It was full of sententious sayings, and thereby aroused Plato's interest to the highest degree. He flourished during the Persian war, under the government of Gelo.

But when the Athenians were dismissed in so humiliating a manner at Ithome, his opponent, Pericles, turning to account the indignation of the people, succeeded in effecting his banishment in B.C. 461. The term of banishment by ostracism was limited by law to ten years. But Cimon was recalled about B.C. 457, also at the instance of Pericles. Since ostracism (Herm. <title>Gr. Alter.</title> i. § 130) was properly not a punishment, Socrates, in the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(/na au)tou= de/ka e)/th mh\ a)kou/seian</foreign>, is merely making a point against the influence of Cimon in the state.

Themistocles was banished in  B.C. 471, and went to Argos. Here he was accused by the Spartans of participation in the treason of Pausanias, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">mhdismo/s</foreign>, and to escape investigations fled to the Persian king, a step which was followed by the confiscation of his magnificent property at Athens.

On the other hand, a lack of care will subject the body to the evil effect of outside evil influences, and thereby to deterioration; <foreign xml:lang="greek">paqh/mata</foreign> are the results of this outside influence. The soul is not susceptible of improvement, being perfect at the outset; but lack of care will, just as in the case of the body, subject the soul to the influence of outside forces.
