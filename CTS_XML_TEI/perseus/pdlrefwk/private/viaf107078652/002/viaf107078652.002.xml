            The festival is the Bendideia (354 A) and it is perhaps safest to acquiesce in the usual
            view that Bendis is here meant. “Alii Minervam intelligunt, quae vulgo

            commercial purposes in the Piraeus, which at all times contained a large admixture of
            foreign population. It was part of Athenian policy to encourage commercial settlers by
            allowing them to exercise their own cults (Foucart <title xml:lang="fr">des assoc. relig.
              chez les Grecs</title> p. 131). Foucart holds that the worship of the Thracian goddess
            Bendis was brought to the Piraeus by Thracian merchants (p. 84). Others have supposed
            that <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( *qra=|kes</foreign> refers to envoys from Thrace, or
            Thracian mercenaries, the survivors of those who came to Athens in 414 B.C. (Thuc. VII

            in question was of the kind alluded to in Hdt. VIII 98 and elsewhere as held in honour
            of Hephaestus. The competition was not between one individual and another, but between
            different lines of competitors, the torch being passed on from man to man. Victory fell
            to the chain whose torch, still burning, first reached the goal. The well-known figure

          <p>328B - 328E The scene at the house of Polemarchus. Socrates begins to interrogate

            than Lysias (infra 331 D), and we are to infer that at this time Cephalus lived with
            him. There is no reason why we should (with Blass <title>Att. Ber.</title> p. 338)
            reject Plato's statement that Polemarchus had a house in the Piraeus: the words of
            Lysias (12. 16), which Blass relies upon as shewing that Polemarchus lived not in the
            Piraeus, but in Athens, refer to 404 B.C. and do not prove it even for that year. Lysias
            probably lived at this time in a house of his own in the Piraeus, as in 404 B.C. (<bibl
              n="Lys. 12.8">Lys. 12. 8</bibl>): it is to be noted that he is mentioned along with

            archaic dative in <foreign xml:lang="greek">-oisi</foreign> is tolerably often used by
            Plato. In the <title>Republic</title> alone it recurs in 345 E, 388 D, 389 B, 468 D
            (Homer), 560 E, 564 C, 607 B (<foreign xml:lang="greek">-aisi</foreign>) (poetic): see also
            Schneider on III 389 B, and for the usage of inscriptions Meisterhans^{3} p. 126. In
            this particular passage the archaic ending suits the age of the speaker; but it should
            be remembered that Plato's style (at least in his more mature dialogues) is not a mere
            reproduction of the vernacular Attic, but also in no small measure a literary language
            or ‘Kunstsprache,’ in which Ionisms and poetic and archaic forms are
            occasionally employed: see especially Hirzel <title>Der Dialog</title> I pp.
            246—250 notes Hirzel (ib. p. 34 note 1) gives reasons for holding that a sort
            of <foreign xml:lang="greek">koinh\ dia/lektos</foreign>, resembling the dialect of
            Herodotus, was actually spoken in certain cultivated circles at Athens in the Periclean
            age, e.g. by Anaxagoras and his group, by the Ionian sophists and their followers etc.,
            and some of Plato's Ionisms may be inherited from this source. Cf. VII 533 B note</p>

            claims the right to inherit his <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gos</foreign> as Cephalus'

          <p>331E - 332B The second half of the definition of Justice which Socrates deduced from
            Cephalus' remarks is now taken up and discussed in the form in which it was expressed by
            Simonides— ‘rendering to each man his due.’ In the present
            section Socrates confines himself to eliciting the meaning of ‘due.’
            As between friends, it is something good; as between enemies, something evil; in general
            terms it is that which is suitable or appropriate. Simonides in fact meant that Justice
            consists in doing good to friends and ill to foes.</p>
          <p>ff. By <foreign xml:lang="greek">dikaiosu/nh</foreign>, it should be noted, is here meant
            man's whole duty to his fellows, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(sio/ths</foreign> is right
            conduct in relation to the gods. In this wide sense the word was commonly understood by
            the Greeks (cf. Theog. 147 <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n de\ dikaiosu/nh| sullh/bdhn pa=s'
              a)reth\ e)/ni</foreign>); and even in the scientific study of ethics, the word still
            retained the same wider connotation, side by side with its more specific meanings
            (Arist. <title>Eth. Nic.</title> v 3. 1129^{b} 11 ff.). The view that Justice consists
            in doing good to friends and harm to enemies, is a faithful reflection of prevalent
            Greek morality (Luthardt <title>Die Antike Ethik</title> p. 19). It is put into the
            mouth of Simonides as a representative of the poets, on whose writings the young were
            brought up: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 316D"><title>Prot.</title> 316 D</bibl>, 325 E, 338

            refuting Xenophon, but rather criticising an all but universal view. See
            Nägelsbach <title>Nachhom. Theol.</title> pp. 246 ff. It is seldom that a voice
            is raised in protest, as by Pittacus (according to D. L. I 4. 78) in the memorable words
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">fi/lon mh\ le/gein kakw=s, a)lla\ mhde\ e)xqro/n</foreign>.
            Plato was the first Greek who systematically protested against the doctrine, and
            supported his protest with arguments drawn from a loftier view of man's nature and work.

              us good and good men bad, Justice will often consist in benefiting bad men, and
              harming good, i.e. in wronging those who do no wrong; or conversely, if we refuse to
              accept this conclusion, and hold that it is just to benefit the just and hurt the
              unjust, it will often be just to hurt friends and benefit enemies, viz. when our
              friends are bad, and our enemies good</hi> (334 C—334 E).</p>
          <p><title>Polemarchus hereupon amends his explanation of</title> ‘<hi
              rend="italic">friend</hi>’ <hi rend="italic">and</hi> ‘<hi
              rend="italic">enemy</hi>’ <hi rend="italic">into</hi> ‘<hi

            >and</hi> ‘<hi rend="italic">him who both seems and is bad</hi>’<hi
              rend="italic">: and the definition now becomes</hi>, ‘<hi rend="italic">It
              is just to benefit a friend if he is good, and injure an enemy if he is bad</hi> (335
            A).’</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">To this amended definition Socrates now addresses himself. He first
              proves by the analogy of the other arts that to hurt a human being is to make him
              worse in respect of human excellence, i.e. Justice, in other words to make him more
              unjust, and afterwards by means of similar analogical reasoning, that no one can be
              made more unjust by one who is just. Simonides' saying, if Polemarchus has explained
              it aright, was more worthy of a tyrant than of him</hi> (335 A—336 A).</p>

            The argument is in the form of a dilemma: either a it is just to injure those who do us

            the second directly opposed to Simonides' view. Socrates suppresses the words which I
            have put in brackets, because they lessen rather than increase the immorality of the

            Polemarchus' theory indeed points to a division of men into three classes: friends,

            in 413, three years before the probable date of action of the <title>Republic</title>
              (<title>Introd.</title> § 3), after proving himself a fickle friend and foe
            to the Athenians during the Peloponnesian war. Ismenias is mentioned again in <bibl

            with the Ismenias who (see <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 3.5.1">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> III 5.
            1</bibl>) in 395 took money from Timocrates the Rhodian, envoy of the Persian King, in
            order to stir up war against Sparta, and who in 382, when the Spartans had seized the
            Cadmea, was condemned on this charge among others (<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 5.2.35">Xen.
                <title>Hell.</title> V 2. 35</bibl>; Plut. <title>Pelop.</title> 5. 2). Plato
            implies that Ismenias kept enough Persian gold to enrich himself. he was no true Greek
            if he did not. But what is meant by saying that he had received the money of
              <title>Polycrates</title>? This question has been much discussed. Possibly
            ‘the money of Polycrates’ (with allusion, of course, to the riches
            of the Samian tyrant) was a sarcastic expression current in Athens for ‘the
            money of Timocrates’: this is perhaps the more likely as we are informed that
            the Athenians got no share of it themselves (<title>Hell.</title> III 5. 2). Plato would
            naturally avail himself of such a political gibe to express his dislike of a man who
            took gold from the natural enemy of Greece (<title>Rep.</title> V 470 C) to stir up not
            war, but sedition (ib. 470 B), and withdraw Agesilaus from fighting with the barbarian:
            for his political ideal in foreign policy was that of Cimon. See also on V 471 B. It is
            not however likely, I think, that the present passage was written after Ismenias' death,
            for Plato is not given to reviling his contemporaries after their death. That the other
            three persons cited by Plato were already dead would only make his reproof of the living
            more marked and scathing. The present passage—so far as it goes—is
            on the whole in favour of Teichmüller's view (<title>Lit. Fehd.</title> I p.

          <p>337A - 339B After some wrangling, Thrasymachus finally declares justice to be
            ‘the interest of the stronger.’ Rulers are stronger than those whom
            they rule: and in every state they pass laws in their own interest: and what is done in
            their own interest they call just.</p>
          <p>ff. The natural history definition of justice (<foreign xml:lang="greek">o( fu/sei o(/ros
              tou= dikai/ou</foreign>
            <title>Laws</title> IV 714 C) is here for the first time mentioned in the
              <title>Republic.</title> It is to be noticed that the theory is presented by
            Thrasymachus not—in the first instance —as a rule of conduct for the
            individual, but as a political theory: his object is to describe the actual practice of
            Greek states (338 D ff.). We are thus for the first time introduced to the <hi
              rend="italic">political</hi> aspect of <foreign xml:lang="greek">dikaiosu/nh</foreign>.
            The same view of the definition is taken in <title>Laws</title> 714 C ff., and it is the
            same theory which is afterwards (in II 358 E ff.) represented by Glauco as an hypothesis
            on which not Thrasymachus only but many others (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*qrasuma/xou kai\
              muri/wn a)/llwn</foreign> 358 C) explained the origin and constitution of existing
            states: cf. also <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 483A"><title>Gorg.</title> 483 A</bibl> ff. We are
            therefore justified in supposing that the definition which Plato puts into the mouth of
            Thrasymachus represents a theory current in the politics of the day. The conduct of
            Athens towards her allies furnished many examples of the practical application of this
            rule of government; and, if we may trust Thucydides, similar principles were frankly
            laid down by Athenian statesmen in their speeches: see for example I 76. 2 <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a)ei\ kaqestw=tos to\n h(/ssw u(po\ tou= dunatwte/rou
            katei/rgesqai</foreign>, and cf. I 77. 4, V 89 and 105. 2 <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\

            a)/rxein</foreign>. It is indeed not too much to say that ‘Might is
            Right’ was the only argument by which the existence of the Athenian empire
            could be defended before the tribunal of Greek public opinion, which regarded the
            independent <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lis</foreign> as the only legitimate form of civic
            life. Hence the dominion of Athens is often in Thucydides called a <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >turanni/s</foreign>, from which the Spartans claimed to be liberating their
            countrymen: see III 37. 2 <foreign xml:lang="greek">turanni/da e)/xete th\n
            a)rxh/n</foreign>, 62. 5 ff., IV 85. 6, and cf. Henkel <title>Studien zur Gesch. d. gr.
              Lehre vom Staat</title> pp. 126—128. The most conspicuous assertion of the
            principle before Plato's time was found in Pindar's much-quoted fragment (Bergk 169 and
            ap. Pl. <title>Gorg</title> 484 B) <foreign xml:lang="greek">no/mos o( pa/ntwn
            basileu\s</foreign> | <foreign xml:lang="greek">qnatw=n te kai\

            biaio/taton</foreign> | <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(perta/ta| xeiri/
            ktl.</foreign>, though it may well be doubted (with Dümmler <hi rend="italic"
              >Prolegomena zu Platon's Staat</hi> p. 34) whether Pindar intended to suggest any such
            view. It is in order to refute this theory, as expounded by Glauco and Adimantus,
            Thrasymachus' successors in the argument (see on <foreign xml:lang="greek">pai=des e)kei/nou
              tou= a)ndro/s</foreign> II 368 A) that Socrates finds it necessary to draw a picture
            of an Ideal State (ib. 368 D ff.), so that the <hi rend="italic">political</hi> theory
            of Plato's <title>Republic</title> may truly be said to commence here. For more on this
            subject see Chiappelli <title>Per la storia della Sofistica Greca</title> in

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">sarda/nion</lem></app>. Plato uses this expression as

              >sarda/nion ma/la toi=on</foreign> (of Odysseus among the suitors). Among later
            authors it more frequently denotes the forced smile which disguises the sufferer's own
            pain; and so apparently Simonides used the phrase (<bibl n="Plat. Fr. 202A"
              ><title>Fr.</title> 202 A</bibl> Bergk). The explanations volunteered by the ancients
            apply only to the non-Homeric usage: the Scholiast, however, at the end of his note on
            this passage correctly remarks, <foreign xml:lang="greek">mh/pote ou)=n to\ *(omhriko/n,

              <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 242C"><title>Phaedr.</title> 242 C</bibl>, <bibl
              n="Plat. Tim. 26B"><title>Tim.</title> 26 B</bibl>. It seems better to explain these
            usages on the same principle. The view that <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s</foreign> is
            exclamatory will not account for II 366 C, and is not specially appropriate in the other
            places. Neither is it easy to make <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s</foreign>=<foreign

            Schneider (on II 366 C) regards <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s</foreign> as nearly equivalent
            to <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> (cf. note on II 365 D). Probably <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">w(s</foreign> is in reality consequential (like the English
            ‘so’), the relative retaining its original demonstrative sense. This
            explanation will, I believe, suit all the passages in question.</p>

          <p>339B - 341A Now that the meaning of the definition has been explained, Socrates
            proceeds to attack it. Even if we assume that rulers seek their own advantage, yet they
            often err, and enact laws to their own disadvantage: therefore, as it is just for
            subjects to obey their rulers, Justice will sometimes consist in doing what is not the
            interest of the stronger. Socrates reiterates this objection and is supported by
            Polemarchus. It is urged by Clitophon that Thrasymachus meant by ‘the interest
            of the stronger’ what was thought—whether rightly or
            wrongly— by the stronger to be to their interest. Thrasymachus declines to
            avail himself of this suggestion, and explains that, strictly speaking, rulers, qua
            rulers, cannot err. This statement he supports by arguing from the analogy of medical
            practitioners and others, pleading that his earlier concession was but a popular way of
            expressing the fact that rulers seem to err. Therefore the original definition was
            strictly correct. Justice is the interest of the stronger, since rulers make laws in
            their own interest, and, qua rulers, are infallible.</p>
          <p>On the reasoning of Thrasymachus in these two chapters see 341 A note</p>

            it is just to do <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ a)cu/mfora toi=s a)/rxousin</foreign> as
            often as the rulers unwillingly prescribe what is evil for themselves and so long as
            Thrasymachus says it is just for subjects to do what the rulers have prescribed. Desire
            for brevity and balance leads Plato to put both clauses under the government of <foreign

            ‘whenever’ is the more appropriate conjunction for introducing the

            the rulers. The suggested reading <foreign xml:lang="greek">fh/|s</foreign> for <foreign

          <p>341A - 342E Socrates now meets Thrasymachus on his own ground, and attacks his
            definition according to the ‘strictest form’ of argument. He shews
            by analogy that every ruler qua ruler seeks the good of those whom he rules, since every
            art aims at the good of its own peculiar charge or object, and not at its own, for qua
            art there is nothing lacking to it.</p>
          <p>ff. It is to be noted that the discussion is now transferred from the region of facts
            into an atmosphere of idealism. For this, Thrasymachus is primarily responsible. The
            theory that the ruler <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> ruler makes no mistakes, is no doubt
            true ideally, but practically it is of little moment, since he will suffer <hi
              rend="italic">qua</hi> ruler for the errors which he commits in moments of aberration.
            The strength of Thrasymachus' theory lay in its correspondence with the facts (real or
            apparent) of experience; it is the temptation to defend his theory against the criticism
            of Socrates which leads him to abandon facts for ideas; and as soon as he is refuted on
            the idealistic plane, he descends to facts again (343 A ff.). The vein of idealism
            struck by Thrasymachus is worked to some purpose by Socrates. To assert that rulers <hi
              rend="italic">qua</hi> rulers always seek the good of their subjects is in reality to
            set before us a political ideal, and Plato's Ideal Commonwealth is intended to be its
            embodiment in a state. Plato was probably the first to develope and elaborate this
            principle of political science, but the legislations of Solon and other early lawgivers
            furnish examples of its application to practical politics (see especially Arist.
              <title>Rep. Ath.</title> ch. 12 and Solon's verses there cited), and it is formulated
            by the historical Socrates in Xen. <title>Mem.</title> III 2, with which compare

            retained this reading, in deference to the MSS, but it is open to grave objection. As
            the sentence stands, the meaning is that every art (as well as every object of an
            art—this is implied by <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai/</foreign>) has <hi
              rend="italic">one</hi>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">sumfe/ron</foreign>, viz. to be as perfect as it can, but no
            other. In the sequel this is interpreted to mean that no art needs any additional
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)reth/</foreign>; since it is (<hi rend="italic">qua</hi> art)
            perfect already: <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)/te ga\r ponhri/a ou)/te a(marti/a ou)demi/a
              ou)demia=| te/xnh| pa/restin ktl.</foreign> (342 B). But the words of the sentence
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)=r' ou)=n—tele/an ei)=nai</foreign> have to be taken
            very loosely in order to admit of this interpretation. We must suppose them equivalent
            to ‘No art has a <foreign xml:lang="greek">sumfe/ron</foreign> of its own, unless
            you are to call the fact that it is perfect its <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >sumfe/ron</foreign>.’ If Plato had written the passage as it stands in <hi
              rend="italic">q</hi> and in the margin of Flor. U (both MSS probably of the fifteenth
            century), it would be open to no objection: <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)=r' ou)=n kai\

            “Platonem non solum potuisse, sed etiam debuisse vel haec ipsa vel consimilia
            scribere.” The same sense, expressed more briefly, may be obtained by the
            insertion of <foreign xml:lang="greek">dei=</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >ei)=nai</foreign>: ‘has every art also a <foreign xml:lang="greek"

          <p>343A - 344C Thrasymachus with much insolence of tone now abandons the idealistic point
            of view, and takes an example from experience. The shepherd does not, as a matter of
            fact, seek the good of his flock, but fattens them for his own or his master's
            advantage. In like manner it is their own advantage that is aimed at by rulers who
            deserve the name. Justice is ‘other men's good’ (<foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a)llo/trion a)gaqo/n</foreign>), whereas Injustice is one's own: the just
            man comes off second best everywhere, alike in commercial and in political transactions.
            That it is far more to one's interest to be unjust than to be just, we may see from the
            case of tyrants, who represent Injustice in its most perfect form. All men envy them.
            Finally, Thrasymachus reiterates his original theory with the remark that Injustice on a
            sufficiently large scale is at once stronger, more worthy of a freeman, and more
            masterly and commanding than Justice.</p>
          <p>ff. It should be noted that Thrasymachus has in no way changed his theory, but only
            reverts to his original standpoint, that of experience. In the panegyric on Injustice in
            the present chapter, the new and important point is the appeal to the evidence of
            tyranny and the emotions which it roused in the mind of the Greeks. See on 344 B.</p>

        <div type="section" n="344D">
          <p>344D - 347E The reply of Socrates falls into two parts. In the first (344 D—
            347 E), after emphatically expressing his dissent from Thrasymachus' views, and
            protesting against the Sophist's retractation (in the example of the shepherd and his
            sheep) of the doctrine that every ruler seeks the good of his subjects, Socrates reverts
            to the stricter form of reasoning to which Thrasymachus had formerly challenged him, and
            points out that no rulers, properly so called, rule willingly: they require wages. When
            any kind of rule, e.g. an art, is attended with advantage to the ruler, the advantage
            comes from the concomitant operation of the ‘art of wage-earning,’
            and not from the rule itself. Medicine produces health; the art of wages, wages; the
            doctor takes his fee, not qua doctor, but qua wage-earner. Thus it is not the ruler, qua
            ruler, but the subjects, as was already said, who reap the advantage. The wages which
            induce a man to rule, may be money, or honour, or the prospect of a penalty if he should
            refuse. The most efficacious penalty, in the case of the best natures, is the prospect
            of being ruled by worse men than themselves. In a city of good men, freedom from office
            would be as eagerly sought for as office itself is now. Herewith ends for the present
            the refutation of the theory that Justice is the interest of the stronger. Socrates
            promises to resume the subject on another occasion.</p>
          <p>ff. The ensuing discussion is not a new argument (see 345 C <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/ti
              ga\r ta\ e)/mprosqen e)piskeyw/meqa</foreign>) in support of Socrates' view, but a
            restatement of his theory, with an addition necessitated by Thrasymachus' example of the
            shepherd. The shepherd (says Socrates) is no shepherd, when he fattens his sheep for his
            own gain, nor the ruler a ruler, when he enriches himself at the expense of his
            subjects. On such occasions both shepherd and ruler are in reality <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >misqwtikoi/</foreign>—professors of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >misqwtikh/</foreign>, an art which is distinct from that of ruling, though usually
            associated with it. This analysis is new and valuable in itself; it also enables
            Socrates (in 347 D) to make the first explicit allusion in the <title>Republic</title>
            to an ideal state, and to formulate what afterwards becomes a leading principle of the
            Platonic commonwealth—the reluctance of the ruling class to accept office.</p>

            It is surely much to the point to make Thrasymachus repudiate the imputation of
            trifling. His doctrine appears all the more dangerous when he confesses that it is no
              <pb n="42"/> sophistic paradox, but a rule of life. I can see nothing to justify

          <p>ff. The second division of Socrates' reply begins here. Though professedly attacking
            the section of Thrasymachus' speech contained in 343 C— 344 C, and summed up
            in the theory that the life of the Unjust is better than that of the Just (347 E), it is
            not till 352 D that Socrates directly grapples with this theory. In the meantime,
            certain further deliver<pb n="49"/> ances of Thrasymachus on the nature of Injustice are
            refuted by means of arguments which have an indirect bearing on the question at issue
            (see 352 D <foreign xml:lang="greek">fai/nontai me\n ou)=n kai\ nu=n, w(s e)moi\ dokei=, e)c
              w(=n ei)rh/kamen: o(/mws d' e)/ti be/ltion skepte/on</foreign>). This part of
            Socrates' reply may therefore be regarded as itself subdivided into two
            parts—the first being an indirect, the second a direct refutation of
            Thrasymachus. Cf. 352 D note</p>

            conclusion which “praeter exspectationem emergit et elucet.” The
            pervading fallacy in the discussion is akin to the <hi rend="italic">a dicto secundum
              quid ad dictum simpliciter.</hi> Thus ‘like’ and
            ‘unlike’ are used absolutely, and each of them is equated with
            itself. The wise man is held to be good, because one is good in that in which one is
            wise (this might however be justified on the “stricter mode of
            reasoning”). Finally, the just man is inferred to be wise and good, on the
            principle that one is what one resembles: but whether the resemblance be in essence or
            in accident, we are not told. The argument should be regarded as a dialectical <hi

          <p>350C - 352D Socrates now attacks the second assertion made by Thrasymachus in 349 A,
            viz. that Injustice is strong. Justice (he argues) is stronger than Injustice, both
            because it is (as we have seen) virtue and wisdom, and because in its effects it is the
            antithesis of Injustice, which infuses hatred and sedition, both into aggregates of
            individuals, and into the individual himself. Injustice weakens by preventing community
            of action; it makes men collectively and individually hateful to themselves and to the
            just, among whom are the gods. When Injustice seems to be strong, it is in virtue of
            some latent Justice which it still retains.</p>

            observed that the argument “marks an era in philosophy. It is a first reading
            of the central facts of society, morality, and nature. In social analysis it founds the
            idea of organization and division of labour....In morality it gives the conception of a
            distinctively human life which is the content or positive end of the distinctively human
            will. And for natural knowledge it suggests the connection between function and
            definition, and consequently between purpose and reality, which is profoundly developed
            in the sixth and seventh books. These conceptions become corner-stones of Aristotle's
            Philosophy, and still, when seen in their connection, form the very core of the best

            and implicitly assumes a psychological theory like that in Book IV, where soul is shewn
            to have ‘parts’ (435 C ff.). Further, in Book IV, Plato first
            describes justice in the State, and afterwards justice in the individual, using the
            larger aggregate to assist him to find it in the smaller. The same method is observed
            here in the description of injustice, and afterwards in Books VIII and IX, where the

          <p>352D - 354C The argument here reverts to 347 E, and the rest of the book offers a
            direct refutation of the view that Injustice is more advantageous than Justice, in other
            words, that the life of the unjust man is better than that of the just. An indirect
            refutation, says Socrates, is afforded by the recent discussion (from 348 B to 352 D);
            the direct is as follows. Everything has its peculiar work or product (<foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)/rgon</foreign>)—that, namely, which it alone produces, or
            which it produces better than aught else. Everything moreover has its own peculiar
            excellence, without which it will not do its work well. Now the work of soul is to
            deliberate, to rule, to live: its excellence is Justice. Therefore the just soul will
            live well, and to live well is to be blest and happy. And as this is more advantageous
            than to be miserable, Injustice can never be more advantageous than Justice. In
            conclusion, Socrates sums up regretfully: until we know what Justice is, we are not
            likely to discover whether it is a virtue or a vice, and whether its possessor is happy
            or unhappy.</p>
          <p>ff. The view that everything has its own peculiar function, which it can perform better
            than anything else, afterwards becomes one of the cardinal principles of the Ideal State
            (II 369 E ff.); and the statement that everything has an excellence or virtue of its own
            is reaffirmed <pb n="58"/> in Book X, where we are also told that everything has its own
            peculiar vice, that of soul being <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)diki/a</foreign> (608 E ff.).</p>

          <p>The tone of the concluding summary recalls the usual finish of the earlier and
            professedly negative Socratic dialogues, like the <title>Charmides</title> (175
            B—176 A). The only section of the dialogue which Socrates passes over in
            silence is the refutation of the statement that Injustice is strong (350 D—352
            C). The original question—the <hi rend="italic">quid sit</hi> of
            Justice—is abandoned at 347 E: the <hi rend="italic">quale sit</hi> occupies
            the rest of the dialogue, and Socrates enquires first whether Justice is vicious and
            ignorant, or wise and good (347 E— 350 C), next whether it is strong or weak
            (350 D—352 C), and lastly whether it is more or less advantageous than
            Injustice (352 D—354 A). To speculate on the <hi rend="italic">quale sit</hi>
            of a thing before determining its <hi rend="italic">quid sit</hi> is condemned by Plato
            in <bibl n="Plat. Meno 71B"><title>Men.</title> 71 B</bibl>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(\ de\ mh\ oi)=da ti/ e)sti, pw=s a)\n o(poi=o/n ge ti
            ei)dei/hn;</foreign> cf. <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> 86 D and 100 B. The words with
            which the first book concludes lead us to expect that in the remaining books the problem
            will be discussed in proper logical order—the essence first, and afterwards
            the quality, of Justice. The expectation is duly fulfilled; and Book I is therefore in
            the full sense of the term a <foreign xml:lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign> to the whole
            work. <pb n="62"/>

          <p>The question whether <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=| qew=|</foreign> here and in 328 A is
            Bendis or Athena is not so simple as it appears.</p>
          <p>In favour of Athena it may be urged (1) that <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( qeo/s</foreign>
            regularly means Athena in Attic literature (see for example <bibl n="Aristoph. Kn. 656">Ar.
                <title>Eq.</title> 656</bibl>, 903 al., and Plato <title>Laws</title> 806 B): (2)
            that in view of the relation between the <title>Republic</title> and the
            <title>Timaeus</title> it is difficult to separate <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=|
            qew=|</foreign> here from <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n qeo/n</foreign> and <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">th=s qeou=</foreign> in <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 21A"><title>Tim.</title> 21
            A</bibl> and 26 E, where the goddess is certainly Athena, (3) that it is dramatically
            appropriate for an Athenian to dedicate his ideal city to the patron goddess of Athens.
            Plato's perfect city would thus become in a certain sense a <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >basilei/a th=s qeou=</foreign>.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the goddess and the festival are mentioned so closely together that
            (if we have regard to the <title>Republic</title> by itself) we are scarcely justified
            in interpreting <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=| qew=|</foreign> without reference to <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">th\n e(orth/n</foreign>, and it is quite in harmony with Socrates'
            principles that he should be among the first to pay his vows at the shrine of the new
            goddess as soon as the <foreign xml:lang="greek">no/mos po/lews</foreign> received her. See
              <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 1.3.">Xen. <title>Mem.</title> I 3. </bibl>I, IV 3. 16. It is
            therefore safer to accept the usual view that Plato is thinking of Bendis. </p>

              (<title>Kl. Schr.</title> IV pp. 326 ff.), with whom Zahlfleisch (<hi rend="italic"
              >Zeitschr. f. öst. Gymn.</hi> Vol. XXVIII 1877, pp. 603 ff.) and others
            agree. Boeckh points out that <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ laqei=n</foreign> (sc. <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">no/son</foreign>, according to his view) suggests (from its notion of
            clandestine cunning) the idea of stealing. This may be admitted, but the idea of
            stealing is much more forcibly suggested (as Stallbaum points out), if <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">kai\ laqei=n</foreign> is construed with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(=tos
              deino/tatos ktl.</foreign>, and this involves the necessity of changing (with
            Schneider) <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)mpoih=sai</foreign> of the MSS to <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)mpoih/sas</foreign>, for the construction <foreign xml:lang="greek">laqei=n
              e)mpoih=sai</foreign>, though retained by Campbell, is destitute of authority. <pb
              n="63"/></p>
          <p>Even if Schneider's emendation be adopted, the argument is (as stated in the notes)
            fantastical and inconclusive. In order that the conclusion <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/tou
              tis a)/ra deino\s fu/lac, tou/tou kai\ fw\r deino/s</foreign> should be valid,
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">fula/casqai</foreign> should be <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >fula/cai</foreign>, and the objects of the two verbs in proposition (1) should be
            identical, as well as those in propositions (2) and (3). As it is, if we express
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">fula/casqai</foreign> in terms of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >fula/cai</foreign>, they are not identical: for in (1) it is the enemy whom you smite,
            but yourself whom you guard: in (2) it is yourself (or your patient) whom you guard, but
            the disease which you secretly implant: in (3) you guard your own army, but steal the
            enemy's plans, etc. Nevertheless Schneider's emendation is preferable to the traditional
            reading, which not only contains all the same fallacies as the other, but leaves the
            three stages of the argument in comparative isolation, attaches the first hint of
            ‘stealing’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">laqei=n</foreign>) to the wrong
            member of the clause, and involves the use of the somewhat strained expression <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">laqei=n no/son</foreign>. It should be added that the change from
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)mpoih=|sai</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >e)mpoih/sas</foreign> is not greater than the insertion of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >kai/</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)mpoih=sai</foreign>, and that <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)mpoih/sas</foreign> was very likely to be corrupted under the influence
            of <foreign xml:lang="greek">deino\s fula/casqai</foreign> just before. The emphatic
            position of <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ laqei=n</foreign> is necessary to call attention
            to the first suggestion of the idea contained in <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >kle/yai</foreign>; nor can I agree with J. and C. that in Schneider's emendation
            “the emphasis falls on the wrong word.” In <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >laqei=n e)mpoih/sas</foreign>, which is virtually a single expression, <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">laqei=n</foreign> is more important, in view of the conclusion <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">kai\ kle/ptein deino/s</foreign>, than <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >e)mpoih/sas</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Hartman condemns the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ laqei=n</foreign>, and thinks
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/stis</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(=tos</foreign>
            have changed places: “cum enim ubique <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\
            fula/casqai</foreign> urgeatur (<foreign xml:lang="greek">o( pata/cai deino/tatos, ou(=tos
              kai\ fula/casqai—o(/sper kle/yai..., o( au)to\s fu/lac a)gaqo/s</foreign>),
            requiritur <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(=tos deino\s fula/casqai, o(/stis deino/tatos

              xml:lang="greek">o(/tou tis a)/ra deino\s fu/lac, tou/tou kai\ fw\r
            deino/s</foreign>.” Tucker revives the old conjecture <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >kai\ a)lqei=n</foreign> (‘heal’) instead of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >kai\ laqei=n</foreign>, and suggests (as an alternative) that <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >laqei=n</foreign> should be <foreign xml:lang="greek">maqei=n</foreign> (i.e. <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">kai\ maqei=n ou(=tos deino/tatos e)mpoih=sai</foreign> ‘clever
            at learning how to implant’). None of these conjectures appears to me so

          <p>In this difficult passage Schneider takes <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/</foreign> as
            ‘than,’ and <foreign xml:lang="greek">prosqei=nai</foreign> as
            equivalent to a comparative with a verb; but no exact parallel has hitherto been
            adduced, and the idiom even if admissible is exceedingly harsh. Neither the suggestion
            of Stephanus (<foreign xml:lang="greek">prosqei=nai tw=| dikai/w| a)/llws h)\</foreign>) nor
            that of Richards (to insert <foreign xml:lang="greek">ple/on</foreign> after <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">h)/</foreign>) carries conviction. It should also be remarked that the
            words <foreign xml:lang="greek">nu=n pro\s tou/tw| w(=de le/gein</foreign> follow somewhat
            awkwardly as an explanation of <foreign xml:lang="greek">prosqei=nai tw=| dikai/w|</foreign>
            if <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)\ w(s</foreign> is interpreted in Schneider's way.
            Stallbaum's <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)\ w(s—to\n de\ e)xqro\n kakw=s; nu=n pro\s
              tou/tw| w(=de le/gein</foreign>, is very unpleasing, not so much from the <pb n="64"/>
            necessity of understanding <foreign xml:lang="greek">le/gein</foreign> after <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">h)/</foreign> (‘or to say, as we said at first’ etc.)
            as because it is extremely violent to separate <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/</foreign> from
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">nu=n pro\s tou/tw| w(=de le/gein</foreign>. Faesius' proposal
            (in which he is followed by Ast, Madvig, and several editors) to eject <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">h)/</foreign> gives the required sense (‘do you bid us add to
            the view of justice which etc.,’ <foreign xml:lang="greek">prosqei=nai</foreign>
            being explained by <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\s tou/tw| w(=de le/gein</foreign>), but it
            fails to account for the presence of <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/</foreign> in the MSS. It
            may seem an objection to the view which I take that <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/</foreign>
            in a sentence of this kind would naturally introduce an alternative, whereas <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">pro\s tou/tw| w(=de le/gein</foreign> only explains <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >prosqei=nai</foreign>. This objection, such as it is, applies with still greater
            force to the view that <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/</foreign> is
            ‘than.’ Some will probably regard the whole clause from <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">h)/—le/gein</foreign> as a marginal commentary on <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">prosqei=nai</foreign>; but this is much too drastic. Possibly <foreign

            >kai/</foreign>—the corruption is said to be common (Bast <title>Comment.

            would have added <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi)/esqai/ ge xrh/</foreign>. The same way of
            writing, dictated of course by the desire to emphasize the <foreign xml:lang="greek"

          <p>358E - 359B Glauco will first describe the origin and nature of Justice according to
            the theory which he has undertaken to maintain. According to nature, to commit injustice
            is a good, to suffer injustice an evil. But as there is more evil in suffering than good
            in committing injustice, experience causes men to enter into a compact neither to commit
            nor suffer wrong. The collective prescriptions of this compact are called Law and
            Justice. Justiceis accordingly a compromise between the best policy, i.e. doing wrong
            without incurring any penalty, and the worst, i.e. suffering wrong without being able to
            exact vengeance. No one will accept the compromise who is strong enough to do wrong
            successfully.</p>
          <p>ff. In thus resuscitating the theory of Thrasymachus, Glauco removes a serious
            stumbling-block by introducing the distinction between <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >fu/sis</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">no/mos</foreign>. Civilisation revolts
            against the anti-social doctrines of Thrasymachus in their application to itself, but
            receives them more favourably when its own existence is safeguarded by relegating them
            to an age anterior to society. The view maintained by Glauco is allied to that of
            Callicles in <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 482E"><title>Gorg.</title> 482 E</bibl> ff.; and it
            has already been pointed out (on 1 337 A, 344 B) that similar views were tolerably
            widely entertained in Plato's time. To the evidence previously adduced may be added
              <title>Laws</title> 690 B, 889 E, <bibl n="Eur. Phoen. 509">Eur. <title>Phoen.</title>

                ><title>Gorg.</title> 483 C</bibl>, cf. 488 D—489 D), Glauco's theory
            endeavours to solve this difficulty by postulating a social contract. A kindred solution
            is ascribed by Aristotle to the Sophist Lycophron: <title>Pol.</title>

            tacitly to contradict a prevalent misconception, or (more probably) because his readers
            might be presumed to know or to be capable of inferring that the ancestor of Gyges the

            far better than that of the just. Let us suppose that each is the perfect embodiment of
            his character—the one a consummate artist in iniquity, able to coerce where
            needful, and so apt at concealment that he enjoys the highest reputation for justice,
            while guilty of the worst acts of injustice; the other wishful not to be esteemed, but
            to be, good, and labouring until he dies under the imputation of the worst injustice,
            although he remains just. Only by means of this supposition can we make sure that the
            just man has not been attracted by the rewards of justice, but by justice itself. What
            will be the result? The just will be wholly miserable and unsuccessful, the unjust
            wholly prosperous and happy, doing good to their friends and evil to their foes; nay
            more, the unjust will be dearer to the gods than the just, because they have wherewith

            optative of wish (though in a subordinate clause): ‘it is not clear therefore

            obscure, and unsupported by other examples. J. and C. remark that “the

            ‘it is not clear then, say they, whether he was just,’ etc. Glauco

          <p>362C - 363E At this point Glauco gives way to Adimantus. Glauco had maintained the
            superiority of Injustice over Justice by directly praising Injustice: Adimantus will
            uphold the same thesis by describing the arguments usually advanced in favour of
            Justice. In the first place, when parents and friends exhort the young to follow
            Justice, they do not praise Justice herself, but the rewards which Justice earns from
            men and gods. Homer and Hesiod describe the benefits derived from Justice in this
            present life, while Musaeus and his son guarantee to her votaries sensual bliss
            hereafter, and others promise to the pious a long line of descendants, but relegate the

            Injustice, men say, is in general the best policy: they admire the vicious rich, and
            despise the virtuous poor. Strangest of all, the gods themselves are said to be
            sometimes kind to the wicked, and unkind to the good; and seers profess to have power
            from the gods to atone for unjust dealing by pleasurable rites, and undertake to damage
            enemies for a trifling expenditure of money. In support of such teaching they quote the

            are encouraged to practise Injustice, while outwardly pretending to be just. To escape
            detection by their fellow-men, they form political clubs, and employ persuasion and
            force. The gods they can afford to ignore; for either there are no gods, or they regard
            not man, or— according to those who are the sole authorities for their
            existence—they can be propitiated out of the proceeds of Injustice. There are
            special rites and gods who can deliver us from punishment after death: so the gods' own
            children say. So strong are the arguments in favour of Injustice that even those who can
            refute them make allowances, recognising that no one is voluntarily just except from
            innate goodness of disposition or scientific knowledge.</p>

            Dobree and Boeckh (with a few inferior MSS): but the text is sound. We are dealing with
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">tau=ta pa/nta— lego/mena ktl.</foreign>; and it has
            not been said that it is useless to be just, unless one is also believed to be just

            been urged is that Justice is in itself never advantageous, although its <foreign

              di/kaios ei)=nai</foreign>, is the Greek idiom. This meaning suits exactly. What has
            to be established is that <foreign xml:lang="greek">dokei=n</foreign> prevails over <foreign

              rend="italic">be</hi> unjust, and <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> just is bliss (see 362

            remarks on the magnitude of the task before him—none other than the defence of
            Justice against her slanderers. As the weak-sighted are better able to recognise small
            letters at a distance if they have previously studied the same letters on a larger scale
            and on an ampler ground, so (says Socrates) let us first study Justice in magno, that
            is, in a state, and afterwards look for her lineaments in parvo, in other words, in the
            Individual. The contemplation of a State in process of creation will shew us Justice and

            This image is in fact one of the links by means of which Plato binds the dialogue
            together: as Polemarchus is heir to Cephalus (331 E), so Glauco and Adimantus are heirs
            to Thrasymachus. In explaining <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)kei/nou tou= a)ndro/s</foreign>
            of Thrasymachus, Stallbaum is therefore not “ridiculous” (as J. and

            Individual “writ large.” Plato, however, laid stress upon this view,
            as tending to cement the union between the citizen and the State, which was rapidly
            dissolving in his day. This is well brought out by Krohn <title>Plat. Frag.</title> p.

            <hi rend="italic">A city is called into being by the fact that the individual is not
              self-sufficient. We may regard it as the union of many men mutually helping one
              another in one place. The individual gives and takes because he thinks it better for
              himself to do so.</hi>

            <hi rend="italic">Now man's first need is food, his second housing, his third clothing
              and the like. The smallest possible State will therefore consist of a farmer, a
              builder, a weaver and a shoemaker etc.—four or five men in all. Each of
              these must work for all, because Nature has adapted different men for different kinds
              of work, and because every kind of work has its critical moment when it must be done
              and cannot be neglected. Our principle is — One man, one work. We shall
              accordingly require carpenters and smiths to make instruments for the farmer, weaver,
              and shoemaker, as well as various kinds of herdsmen, to furnish cattle for ploughing
              and carrying, together with hides and fleeces for the makers of clothing. Since it is

            <hi rend="italic">make the city self-supporting, we shall require middlemen to introduce
              imports; and as imports necessarily imply exports, the number of farmers and
              manufacturers in our city will increase, and we shall need travelling merchants to
              dispose of their produce. Owners of transport-ships will also be necessary, if there
              is traffic by sea.</hi>
          </p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Moreover, to facilitate exchange within the city, there must be a
              market, and coined money, and retail traders to act as middlemen between the producer
              and the consumer. The retail traders should be those who are physically unfit to
              engage in any other pursuit. There will also be hired labourers in our city.</hi>

              Adimantus suggests that we should look for them in the reciprocal intercourse of the
              various classes in the city. Let us see, says Socrates. The citizens will live the
              simple easy-going life of vegetarians, satisfying only the modest demands of their
              natural appetites. On a hint from Glauco, a few additional vegetarian luxuries are

            is ostensibly an historical account of the genesis of society, and from this point of
            view should be compared with <title>Laws</title> III 676 A ff. Some of the features are
            derived from an analysis of the industrial basis of society as it exists in civilised
            times: others (see 372 B—D), are semi-mythical and idyllic, recalling pictures
            of the golden age such as we find in <bibl n="Plat. Plt. 269C"><title>Pol.</title> 269
            C</bibl> ff., and in the caricatures of the comedians (e.g. ap. Athen. VI 267 E ff.).
            But the prevailing atmosphere is not historical or legendary, but idealistic (note
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">dei=</foreign> in 369 E and elsewhere), and Plato's <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">prw/th po/lis</foreign> (Arist. <title>Pol.</title>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">*d</foreign> 4. 1291^{a} 17) should primarily be regarded
            as—in its essential features—a preliminary and provisional
            description of the industrial foundation on which the higher parts of his own ideal city
            are to rest. Cf. also on 372 B, D, Rettig <title>Proleg. in Plat. remp.</title> p. 42

            by Phrynichus) must also be admitted (though rarely) in prose: see the instances cited

            mentioning the “reciprocal liability of injury” among the generative
            causes of civic life; but this (as well as assistance against external aggression) is

            II—IV is a <foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\ fu/sin oi)kisqei=sa po/lis</foreign>.
            What is meant by <foreign xml:lang="greek">fu/sis</foreign>? Not inorganic Nature, but the
            ‘nature’ of a <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lis</foreign> or aggregate of
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">poli=tai</foreign>, i.e. (as the unit in a city is the man)
            human nature, in other words, the nature of the human soul, which, according to Plato
            and Socrates, constitutes a man's true and proper individuality. It is not however human
            nature as it is, but as it ought to be, which is the foundation on which the Platonic
            State is built; so that, although the doctrine of transcendent Ideas is excluded from
            the first four books (see on III 402 C), Idealism at all events is present. See also

          <p>It will be observed that the inhabitants of this ‘First City’
            subsist upon a vegetable diet. Cattle are used for ploughing and carrying, and supply
            wool and skins to make clothing and shoes (370 D, E), but animal food is unknown. It is
            improbable that Plato deliberately borrowed this trait from the current legends about
            the golden age (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Plt. 271D"><title>Pol.</title> 271 D</bibl> ff.): for
            he allows the slaughter of cattle for skins, whereas in the golden age animal life was
            held sacred (see Empedocles ap. Arist. <title>Rhet.</title> I 13. 1373^{b} 14 ff. and
            Robertson Smith <title>Religion of the Semites</title> pp. 282 ff.). But he no doubt
            regarded vegetarianism as characteristic of the primitive innocence of a pastoral
            community (<title>Laws</title> 782 A—D). In Plato's days, as now, the Greek
            peasant was almost a vegetarian. To argue from this and kindred passages (esp. <bibl
              n="Plat. Tim. 77A"><title>Tim.</title> 77 A</bibl>—C and 80 E) as
            Teichmüller does (<title>Lit. Fehd.</title> II pp. 187—202), that
            Plato was himself a vegetarian, is somewhat hazardous. Whether Plato wished his farmers
            to be vegetarians or not, he permits the soldiers to eat flesh: cf. III 404 B ff. <pb

          <p>372D - 373C Glauco protests against the swinish character of such a life: more comfort,
            he thinks, should be allowed. While expressing his opinion that the healthy State is
            that which he has already described, Socrates is willing to describe the
            ‘inflamed’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">flegmai/nousa</foreign>) City, in
            case Justice and Injustice should be discovered in it (372 D—372 E).</p>

            <hi rend="italic">Some will not be satisfied with the provisions of our first city, but
              will demand a variety of physical comforts and delicacies, and artistic delights. A
              crowd of hunters and imitative artists of different kinds will accordingly spring up,
              and the race of middlemen will be largely increased. As a flesh diet will come into
              fashion, swineherds will be in demand, and cattle will multiply. The new style of

          <p>ff. The provisions of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">prw/th po/lis</foreign> are
            insufficient for the satisfaction of human needs: for there is <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >qumo/s</foreign> as well as <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)piqumi/a</foreign> in the soul of
            man. Hence we must advance a stage further. Plato's method is as follows. He begins by
            enumerating many of the features of ordinary Greek life, as he found it, without
            distinguishing the good from the bad. The resulting picture he calls a <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">trufw=sa</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">flegmai/nousa
            po/lis</foreign>. The next step is to purge this <foreign xml:lang="greek">trufw=sa
            po/lis</foreign> (cf. III 399 E <foreign xml:lang="greek">lelh/qame/n ge diakaqai/rontes
              pa/lin h(\n a)/rti trufa=n e)/famen po/lin</foreign>) by excluding some of the
            features, and correcting and regulating others, both by prescriptive enactments and
            still more by the influence of education. It is this <foreign xml:lang="greek">kekaqarme/nh
              po/lis</foreign> which forms what we may call Plato's <foreign xml:lang="greek">deute/ra
              po/lis</foreign> (II 372 E—IV): his third and crowning effort, the City of
            the Rulers, is contained in Books V—VII. Cf. VIII 543 E note and Hirzel <hi

            Antisthenes' ideal commonwealth (on which see Susemihl in <title>Fl. Jahrb.</title> 1887
            pp. 207—214). This conjecture requires us to interpret Plato's first sketch of
            a State as wholly ironical and intended ‘to warn us against the false ideal of
            a Nature-City’ (Zeller l. c.). I agree with Henkel (<title>Stud. zur Gesch. d.
              Gr. Lehre vom Staat</title> pp. 8 f.) in thinking that there is no solid ground for
            Zeller's theory. The <foreign xml:lang="greek">prw/th po/lis</foreign> is not of course
            Plato's ideal republic, and his description of it is plentifully bestrewn with irony,
            but it is nevertheless the foundation on which his city is built, and, in point of fact,
            although some of its features are implicitly corrected or superseded in the sequel, it
            still remains on the whole, and as far as it goes, a not unpleasing picture of the life
            of the lowest stratum in Plato's city, and it is nowhere expressly cancelled or
            abolished. See also on 369 B and 372 E. The <foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)xerh\s

          <p>373D - 376C In consequence of the increase of population we shall require more land. We
            must accordingly appropriate some of our neighbours' territory, just as under similar
            conditions they will lay hands upon ours. Herein we have the genesis of War. The duties
            of War— according to our principle of the subdivision of labour—will
            involve us in a standing army of professional soldiers or
            ‘Guardians.’ Now as War demands not only concentration and
            application, but also a certain natural aptitude, our Guardians must be qualified by
            Nature for their duties: that is to say, like generous dogs, they must be quick to
            perceive, swift to pursue, and strong in actual fight. They should also be brave and
            spirited, but gentle to their fellow-citizens and one another. The union of gentieness
            with spirit in the same nature is rare, but not unknown among men, any more than it is
            among dogs. Our Guardians must in fact be ‘philosophic’ (<foreign
              xml:lang="greek">filo/sofoi</foreign>), like the dog, who is a true philosopher when he

            held—is the root of all evil. This explanation is due to Schleiermacher;
            others (Schneider, Stallbaum, J. and C. as an alternative) refer <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >e)c w(=n</foreign> to war and the like=‘ex cuiusmodi rebus’
            (Stallbaum). It is an objection to such a view that it makes Plato say that evils come
            from War (and the like), directly after he has declined to say anything of the sort
              (<foreign xml:lang="greek">mhde/n ge/ pw — e)rga/zetai</foreign>). Further, if
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(=n</foreign> referred to war, the sentiment would in itself be
            a platitude and almost deserve to be expunged from the text, as it is by Herwerden. On
            the other hand <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)c w(=n—gi/gnhtai</foreign> is on
            Schleiermacher's view quite consistent with <foreign xml:lang="greek">mhde/n ge/
              pw— &lt;*&gt;rga/zetai</foreign>, for although war arises from that
            which harms a State, in itself it may (and does) actually do good. Good in other words
            may come out of evil; which is exactly the principle on which Plato evolves his ideal

            The Cynics were themselves very fond of pointing the moral from the lower animals to man
            (Dümmler <title>Proleg.</title> p. 58 note 2), and Plato here paints them not
            unkindly in colours of their own. It should be noted that throughout II—IV
            Plato uses <foreign xml:lang="greek">filo/sofos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >filosofi/a</foreign> with less of an intellectual than of a moral connotation. In the
            earlier books the word is for the most part connected with a gentle considerate
            disposition or character, whether naturally implanted or the result of culture (cf III
            410 E, 411 C, 411 E): in 407 C the sense is somewhat different. See Nettleship in
              <title>Hellenica</title> pp. 77—79, and Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> p. 71.
            It is not until the latter part of Book V (473 B ff.) where Plato is proposing to enter
            on the third and final stage of his ideal city, viz. the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >kata/stasis tw=n a)rxo/ntwn</foreign>, that the intellectual aspect of the word
            begins to predominate over the moral. Cf. IV 439 D note <pb n="109"/></p>

              to a censorship, and most of our present legends rejected. Caricatures of the gods,
              like the stories about Cronus and Uranus, Zeus and Cronus, are not only false in
              themselves, but ought not, even if they were true, to be told to children, lest they
              breed inhumanity and filial impiety; nor should children be persuaded by Poetry or

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">trufw=sa po/lis</foreign>, and thereby helps to complete Plato's
            second picture of an ideal city: see on 372 D ff. For the correct understanding of these
            regulations it is well to bear in mind (1) that Plato's object in this preliminary
            discipline is to train the character rather than the intellect (cf. IV 430 C note), and
            (2) that all the guardians have to pass through this curriculum. The higher scheme of
            education (in Book VII), on the other hand, is confined to those guardians who are to be
            made Rulers in the State, and its express aim is to educate the intellect rather than
            the will. See especially VI 502 E, VII 521 D—522 A notes The best discussion
            on Plato's theory of education in its broader aspects is still, I think, Nettleship's

            different: see 382 B note ‘Lies’ are necessary—so Plato
            holds—in education: only they must be moral lies. Under
            ‘lies’ he includes stories (<foreign xml:lang="greek">mu=qoi</foreign>)
            about the gods, about the daemons and heroes long since dead, about a future

            passed over by Plato, because he could not state his view without anticipating the

            <title>Homer</title> p. 89. In Plato's day the Cynics were the chief exponents of this

            whose rivalry with Plato is well known: but there is nothing to suggest any personal

            does <title>Genet. Entwick.</title> II p. 121) that the existence of the Idea of Good is
            already presupposed, unless it is shewn that Plato could not have purified his theology
            except by metaphysics. In point of fact, Plato might have written the end of Book III
            even if he had never thought of the Ideas at all.</p>

            explained as referring to the Theomachy (<title>Il.</title> XX 1—74), which
            was caused by Zeus and Themis in the sense that Zeus sent Themis to summon the gods to
            the council at which it was <pb n="117"/> sanctioned (<hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 4). But
            (1) Themis' part in causing the Theomachy is very small, (2) the simplest and most
            natural meaning of <foreign xml:lang="greek">kri/sis</foreign> is not
            ‘contention,’ but ‘judgment’ or
            ‘decision,’ and (3) the Theomachy in Homer is not productive of evil
            to men, but only to the gods themselves: its citation here would therefore be quite
            irrelevant. W. R. Hardie (in <title>Cl. Rev.</title> IV p. 182) is, I believe, right in
            supposing that the strife of the goddesses three and Paris' judgment is meant. <foreign

            regularly thus used: e.g. <bibl n="Eur. IA 1307">Eur. <title>I. A.</title> 1307</bibl>

            (so also Wilamowitz <title>Hom. Unters.</title> p. 367 note 46), which traced the war of
            Troy to the judgment of Paris, and that to Zeus' deliberations with Themis (<foreign

            Thetis, at which the three goddesses quarrelled, was an episode of the poem, and Thetis
            could hardly therefore have been privy to the plot. See Kinkel l. c. pp. 20, 22 and
            Jebb's <title>Homer</title> p. 153). Themis was Zeus' <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)rxai/a

            <title>Choeph.</title> 309—314, 400 —404, 886, 927: in Sophocles and

            ‘punish.’ In Plato punishment is remedial. Ignorance or vice is in
            the soul what disease is in the body (IV 444 C, cf. IX 591 A, B), and the judge is the
            soul's physician (III 409 E ff., <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 478D"><title>Gorg.</title> 478

            changeless, since He is the best. That which is the best cannot be changed by others,
            and will not change itself, for it can only change to what is worse. Homer and the other
            poets err in attributing changefulness to the gods. Neither can God deceive, for while
            the true or veritable lie, that is to say, ignorance of truth within the soul, is
            hateful alike to gods and men, the spoken lie, which is but an image of the other, is

            here— the disproof of each of the two members of the opposite
            alternative—recalls the arguments by which Parmenides established the
            attributes of Being (see RP.^{7} §§ 95, 98); but the resemblance is
            not close enough to suggest that Plato was thinking of Parmenides when he wrote this
            chapter. Although the unchangeableness of God was taught by Xenophanes and the Eleatics,
            there are few if any traces of such a doctrine outside the philosophers before
          Plato.</p>

            For other assertions of this view in Plato see Simson <hi rend="italic">der Begriff d.

            liar,’ viz. ignorance, and of which the spoken lie is an imitation. It is a
            tolerably accurate definition of a lie to call it ‘an imitation of ignorance
            in the soul’: cf. IV 443 C note The spoken lie is ‘not a wholly
            unmixed lie,’ because it implies that the speaker <hi rend="italic">knows</hi>
            the truth: in a certain sense therefore it is mixed with truth. It is <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">u(/steron gegono/s</foreign>, because the spoken lie cannot be uttered
            until the truth is known. Inasmuch as the spoken lie is mixed with truth, it is better
            than the ‘veritable lie.’ We have here nothing but a special
            application of the old Socratic paradox <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( e(kw\n a(marta/nwn
              a)mei/nwn</foreign> (see on I 334 A). I have placed a comma after <foreign

              a)/kraton yeu=dos</foreign> shews. The distinction between veritable and spoken lies
            savours, no doubt, of idealism: but it enables Plato to call his ideal archons ideally
            truthful, even when practically they tell lies, and it is with this object in view that
            the distinction is introduced. See III 389 B.</p>

            Schneider conjectures, from Aeschylus' <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(/oplwn kri/sis</foreign>,
            in which Thetis was one of the characters (Schol. on <bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 883">Ar.

              fo/rmigga</foreign>) appears as present at the marriage of Thetis also in Homer
              (<title>Il.</title> XXIV 62, 63). Plato accommodates the beginning of the quotation to
            his own sentence: in Aeschylus perhaps it ran <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( d' e)nedatei=to
              ta\s e)ma\s eu)paidi/as</foreign> (so Butler, quoted by Schneider). <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)ndatei=sqai</foreign>, ‘to dwell upon or
            emphasize,’ is elsewhere always used in an ominous sense (see Jebb on <bibl
              n="Soph. OT 205">Soph. <title>O. T.</title> 205</bibl>): and here too, perhaps, it
            strikes a foreboding note. The words <foreign xml:lang="greek">makrai/wnas bi/ous</foreign>
            were doubted by Stephanus, who suggested <foreign xml:lang="greek">makrai/wnos
            bi/ou</foreign> (so Euseb. <title>Praep. Ev.</title> XIII 3. 35) or <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">makrai/wnas bi/ou</foreign>: but Apollo's prophecies did not refer to
            Achilles only, so that the plural is justified. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >a)pei/rous</foreign> should be taken not with <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >eu)paidi/as</foreign>, but with <foreign xml:lang="greek">bi/ous</foreign>, which is in
            apposition to <foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)paidi/as</foreign>. In the next line <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">qeofilei=s e)ma\s tu/xas</foreign> depends on the compound expression
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">paiw=n' e)phufh/mhsen</foreign>—a construction

          <p>Most of the emendations (e.g. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*gu/gh| tw=| tou= *ludou=
            progo/nw|</foreign>) which have been suggested in order to bring the present passage
            into harmony with the allusion in Book X 612 B, assume that the Gyges of
            ‘Gyges' ring’ is identical with the famous Gyges (who reigned about
            687—654 B.C.), founder of the third or Mermnad dynasty of Lydian kings (Hdt. I
            8—13). On this assumption <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou= *ludou=</foreign> cannot
            mean ‘Lydus’ (the eponymous ruler of Lydia: see Hdt. I 7), but must
            mean ‘the Lydian’ i.e. (according to the usual interpretation)
            Croesus, who was the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pe/mptos a)po/gonos *gu/gew</foreign> (Hdt. I
            13). There is however no proof to shew that <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( *gudo/s</foreign>
            could without further specification denote Croesus; and on this ground alone Wiegand's
            proposal (adopted by Hermann, Baiter, and Hartman) <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=|</foreign>
              [<foreign xml:lang="greek">*gu/gou</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou= *ludou=

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=| *kroi/sou tou= *ludou= progo/nw|</foreign>, and <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">*gu/gh| tw=| *kroi/sou tou= *ludou= progo/nw|</foreign>, although
            satisfactory in point of sense, fail to account for the disappearance of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">*kroi/sou</foreign>. The proposals of Ast— <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">tw=| *gu/gh| tou= *ludou=</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >*ludw=n</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">progo/nw|</foreign>, and [<foreign
              xml:lang="greek">tw=|</foreign>] <foreign xml:lang="greek">*gu/gou tou= *ludou=</foreign>
              [<foreign xml:lang="greek">progo/nw|</foreign>]—will hardly win favour, while
            Stallbaum's <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=| *gu/gh|</foreign> [<foreign xml:lang="greek">tou=
              *ludou= progo/nw|</foreign>] merely cuts the knot.</p>
          <p>There is however no solid reason for connecting the Gyges of the proverb with the
            historical Gyges. In narrating the adventures of the latter, Herodotus makes no mention
            of a magic ring; but if such a legend had been told of the founder of the Mermnadae,
            Herodotus is hardly likely to have ignored it. In Plato's narrative, on the other hand,
            everything hangs on the ring. Nor is the magic ring known to Nicolaus Damascenus, whose
            account of Gyges seems to follow a different tradition from that of Herodotus: see
            Müller's <title>Frag. Hist. Graec.</title> III pp. 382—386. It is
            therefore possible that Plato's story refers not to Herodotus' Gyges, but to some
            homonymous ancestor of his, perhaps (as Stein suggests on Hdt. I 13) the mythical
            founder of the family, whose name may have survived in the <foreign xml:lang="greek">li/mnh
              *gugai/h</foreign> (Hdt. I 93). The Gyges of history was not the first member of his
            family to bear that name: his great-grandfather at least was also called Gyges (Nic.
            Dam. l.c.). The resemblance between the two stories—that of Herodotus and that
            of Plato—is confined to two incidents, viz. the joint murder of the reigning
            sovereign by the queen <pb n="127"/> and her paramour, and their succession to the
            throne. In these two features the history of the later Gyges may well have been
            embellished from the legends about his mythical namesake, or he may actually have copied
            his ancestor's example. It is noticeable that Cicero says nothing to shew that he
            identified the Gyges of Plato's story with the Gyges of history; and in a poem by
            Nizámí (as Mr J. G. Frazer has pointed out to me), where Plato
            tells the story of the ring, the name of Gyges is not even mentioned. (See Prof.
            Cowell's article in the <title>Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</title>, Vol. 30
            pp. 151—157. Prof. Cowell thinks Nizámí became
            acquainted with the legend through Arabic translations of the <title>Republic.</title>)
            Thinking it probable, therefore, that the proverbial ring of Gyges belonged not to
            Herodotus' Gyges, but to one of his ancestors bearing the same name, I have retained the
            MS reading. I do not think that the suppression of the name is a difficulty, though it
            would be easy to write (as I formerly did) <foreign xml:lang="greek">&lt;tw=|
              *gu/gh|&gt;, tw=| *gu/gou tou= *ludou= progo/nw|</foreign>. See
            <title>Introd.</title> § 5. Such a solution would bring the text into strict
            verbal harmony with X 612 B, with Cicero <title>De off.</title> III 38 (where the story
            is related, not of an ancestor of Gyges, but of Gyges himself—<hi
              rend="italic">hinc ille Gyges inducitur a Platone</hi>), with Lucian
            <title>Nav.</title> 41 and <title>Bis Acc.</title> 21, and with Philostratus <title>Vit.
              Apoll.</title> 101. In each of these places we hear of ‘Gyges'
            ring,’ not of ‘Gyges' ancestor's ring.’ But it is better
            to adhere to the almost unanimous testimony of the MSS, especially as in this particular
            passage they are reinforced by Proclus. Schneider can hardly be right in supposing that
            the older Gyges is an invention of Plato's, although in other respects his note is
            deserving of attention: “Platoni vero licebat alterum Gygen fingere, ingenio
            et fortuna similem interfectori Candaulae, quem ideo genus ab illo ducentem facit,
            prioris nomen, quippe quod commune ei cum posteriori esset, reticens.” </p>

            ‘had.’</p>
          <p>Dr Jackson proposes to read <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou/tou</foreign> for <foreign

            out’ (<title>Proceedings of the Cambridge Philol. Soc.</title> Vol. II 1882,
            p. 12). In favour of this view he urges that ‘the nudity of the corpse is not
            mentioned, either in Cicero's paraphrase <hi rend="italic">de Officiis</hi> III 9
            § 38, or in that of Nizámí’ (see
            <title>App.</title> I). Philostratus is also silent on the subject
            (<title>Heroic.</title> 28). If the principle of this solution is correct, I should
            prefer to retain <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou=ton</foreign>: for there seems to be no
            reason why <foreign xml:lang="greek">periairei=sqai</foreign> should not take two
            accusatives like <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)fairei=sqai, perikrou/ein,

          <p>Dr Jackson's view of the passage, in which I formerly concurred, gives excellent sense,
            and may be right. But it is to be noticed (1) that our chief authority for <foreign

            is quite independent of Paris A and constantly enables us to restore lacunae in that MS,
            and (2) that there are other examples in Paris A of the omission of a single word
            without the excuse of homoioteleuton. See <title>Introd.</title> § 5. <foreign

            gives the right sense, but the change from the singular to the plural (in <foreign

            Muretus read <foreign xml:lang="greek">bla/yai</foreign>, depending, like <foreign

            possible that each of these readings is due to conjecture, and we can scarcely hope to
            restore the hand of Plato with certainty in this passage.</p>
          <p>I formerly (with Bekker and others) printed <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)d'
            h(mi=n</foreign>. The meaning is satisfactory, but the correction does not seem probable
            in itself. The same may be said of (3) and (4). I have now followed Stallbaum in
            supposing that <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/</foreign> was accidentally omitted after the
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">-ei</foreign> of <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/lei</foreign>. Such a
            slip is easy enough, and would be most likely to be corrected by the introduction of a
            negative, as in (2) and (3). Moreover, as Stallbaum says, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/ kai\
              h(mi=n</foreign> “huius sermonis alacritati plane est
            accommodatum,” and <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai/</foreign> is, I think,
            sufficiently justified by the obvious contrast between the gods and ourselves. Tucker
            objects that ‘“If the gods do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> care, why
            should we <hi rend="italic">also</hi> care?” is as bad in Greek as in
            English’: but <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai/</foreign> is hardly so much as
            ‘also’: it merely points the contrast. Cf. III 414 E note There is
            no difficulty in <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)kou=n</foreign> followed by a question, so
            long as the question is merely rhetorical. Hermann proposes <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ou)/koun—kai\ h(mi=n melhte/on</foreign>, but the negative would require to
            be reinforced before <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(mi=n</foreign>. I can see no probability in
            Tucker's conjecture, viz. <foreign xml:lang="greek"

              censure. Fearinspiring names like Cocytus must be discarded, as well as lamentations
              put into the mouths of famous men: for the good man has no cause to bewail the death
              of a good comrade, either for his comrade's sake or for his own. Homer offends against
              this canon when he represents Achilles and Priam as indulging in lamentations over
              their dead; and still more when he makes the gods, and even the greatest of the gods,
              give way to grief. Moreover, as excessive mirth is apt to rebound into the opposite
              extreme, our youths must not be laughterloving. Homer errs in depicting good men and

            the best both in point of sense, and because it might easily pass into <foreign

            Achilles sorrowing for Patroclus in <title>Iliad</title> XXIV 10—12. Plato
            accommodates the Homeric narrative to his own <foreign xml:lang="greek">poiei=n</foreign>,
            and reads <foreign xml:lang="greek">plwi+/zont' — a)truge/toio</foreign> instead
            of <foreign xml:lang="greek">dineu/esk' a)lu/wn para\ qi=n' a(lo/s</foreign>, which appears
            in our Homer. <foreign xml:lang="greek">plwi/zw</foreign> elsewhere is always used of

              e)kplw/ein</foreign> in Hdt. VI 12), but it cannot bear such a meaning here. If the
            MSS are right, <foreign xml:lang="greek">plwi+/zont)</foreign> must be regarded (with
            Schneider) as a metaphor, the agitated movements of Achilles being compared to the
            unsteady motion of a ship upon the sea. Achilles is so to speak ‘at
            sea’ and shews it in his gait; cf. the metaphorical sense of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">xeima/zomai</foreign>. The picture savours of the burlesque, and Howes
            suggests that <foreign xml:lang="greek">plwi/zwn</foreign> may be a deliberate parody on
            Plato's part (<title>Harvard Studies</title> etc. VI p. 202). As no other example of
            such a use of <foreign xml:lang="greek">plwi/zw</foreign> has been adduced, the word is

              xml:lang="greek">ai)a/zont)</foreign> (Herwerden and Naber) is better in point of sense,
            but the alteration is too great. I have thought of <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/ll'

              xml:lang="greek">w)/</foreign>’ and not <foreign xml:lang="greek">w)/zeis</foreign>
            is the spelling of the Codex Mediceus in <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 124">Aesch.
              <title>Eum.</title> 124</bibl>), or <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)floi/zont)</foreign> (cf.
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)floismo/s</foreign> in <title>Il.</title> XV 607). Perhaps,
            however, <foreign xml:lang="greek">plwi+/zont)</foreign> conceals some word meaning
            ‘to rush wildly from his tent,’ <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\
            qi=n)</foreign> being probably for <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ qi=na</foreign>, not for
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ qini/</foreign>. There is apparently a contrast between
            Achilles' anguish within his tent and without, and some word is needed to mark his exit.
            Nothing can be made of the variant <foreign xml:lang="greek">pla/zont)</foreign> (in a few

            certainly open to doubt. The balance of MS evidence is in its favour, although a few
            inferior MSS and one MS of Stobaeus (<title>Flor.</title> 46. 95), agree with A^{1} in
            omitting it. It must either mean rulers who act <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)p' w)feli/a|
              th=s po/lews</foreign>, or else such rulers as Plato's. The former alternative is not
            altogether satisfactory, and it is difficult not to believe that Plato was in reality
            referring to his own rulers. The serious objection to this view is that we have not yet
            heard anything of Plato's rulers: they are not described till 412 B. I think the
            solution may be that the present section on truth is a later addition made by Plato
            after he had written his first account of the rulers in Book III. See also App. I.</p>

          <p>392C - 394D We have now finished our treatment of the subject-matter of poetry, and
            have next to discuss its form. All composition is in a certain sense narrative,
            narrating things past, present or future. Narration in this sense may be either (1)
            simple and unmixed, (2) imitative, (3) both simple and imitative. Homer furnishes <pb
              n="144"/> an example of the third kind: his poetry is purely narrative, when he is
            speaking in propria persona, it is imitative, when he puts his words into the mouth of
            any of his characters. Tragedy and Comedy exemplify the imitative style. The best
            example of the purely narrative is the Dithyramb, of the third or mixed variety, the
            Epic. Which of these forms shall we admit, and on what occasions?</p>
          <p>ff. That Poetry and Art are a species of <foreign xml:lang="greek">mi/mhsis</foreign>, was
            an accepted canon in Greece even before the time of Plato: see Butcher <hi rend="italic"
              >Aristotle's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art</hi>^{2} p. 121. Starting from this
            principle, Plato gradually deepens and intensifies the connotation of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">mi/mhsis</foreign> as the dialogue advances. At first, the word denotes a
            specific variety of style— the dramatic as opposed to the narrative (392
            D—394 D). But as according to Plato style is at once the expression of, and
            also exercises a reflex influence on, the soul (400 D note), <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >mi/mhsis</foreign> begins to assume an ethical import and is used to express
            imitation or assimilation in matters appertaining to or bearing upon character and
            conduct (394 E, 395 C notes: cf. also 401 B—404 C). Finally, in Book X, after
            the psychological point of view has been superseded by the metaphysical, the word
            acquires an ontological or metaphysical significance: see on X 595 C. On the subject
            generally, reference may be made to the dissertation of Abeken <hi rend="italic">de</hi>

          <p>394E - 397D Our guardians must not be prone to imitation. We have agreed that one man
            can do but one thing well, and it is impossible for one man even to imitate two things
            aright, as we may see from the special instances of poetical composition and acting. The
            sole duty of our guardians is to make and keep the city free; if they practise imitation
            at all, their models must be such as are appropriate to the free—that is to
            say, men of brave and virtuous character, for imitation means assimilation. Dramatic
            poetry continually offends against this canon. In general, the good man will not make
            use of imitation except when he is narrating the sayings or deeds of the virtuous, or
            some lapse of the vicious into virtue, or sometimes in mere play. His style of speech
            will combine plain narrative and imitation, but he will use the latter sparingly;
            whereas the bad man will imitate more often than narrate, and no kind of imitation will
            come amiss to him. In respect of mode and time, the language of Virtue will be nearly

            theoretically, therefore, and ideally, the tragedian is also capable of writing a

            Some may be inclined to regard <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/trios a)nh/r</foreign> as a

            therefore says that the good man's <foreign xml:lang="greek">le/cis</foreign> will resemble
            Homer's in partaking of all three varieties. This is a cumbrous and unnecessary

            believe that Plato wrote <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(plh=s</foreign>. The good man's style

            >xelidonismo/s</foreign> of which we read in Athenaeus (VIII 360 B ff.), remarking that
            in the swallow song ‘the custom seems to have been to carry some sort of
            symbolic swallow from house to house.’ It is perhaps more probable (as Mr J.
            G. Frazer suggests to me) that “the ceremony of anointing the swallows and
            crowning them with wool was performed on the children who went from door to door in
            spring, singing the swallow song and apparently personating the swallow.” But
            the tone of the whole passage, with its air of studiously exaggerated politeness and
            compliment, as well as the particular expressions <foreign xml:lang="greek">proskunoi=men,
              i(ero/n</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">qaumasto/n</foreign>, are strongly in
            favour of Proclus' interpretation, although Plato's thoughts may have dwelt for a moment
            on the practices connected with the <foreign xml:lang="greek">xelidonismo/s</foreign> when
            he wrote the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)pope/mpoimen—

          <p>398C - 399E We have now to treat of lyric poetry. Song involves three factors, viz.
            words, a certain musical mode, and a certain movement or time. Our regulations about
            words when unaccompanied by music apply equally to words when sung, and the musical mode
            and time must conform to the words. Now we proscribed all lamentation in our city, so
            that we must exclude the lugubrious modes; and those which are relaxing in their effects
            must be rejected on similar grounds. In short, we shall retain two modes and no more,
            one to imitate the brave man's utterances in times of stress and strain, the other to
            imitate his accents in seasons of peace and calm. We shall deal similarly with
            instruments of music, forbidding all those which lend themselves to a variety of modes.
            It is thus that we purge our ‘luxurious city.’</p>

            hitherto confined itself chiefly to tragedy and comedy. It remains to discuss lyrical
            poetry also on its formal side. Now the chief formal characteristic of lyric poetry is
            its invariable association with music. It is therefore necessary to lay down canons for
            musical composition. This is the justification for the sections on
            ‘harmony’ and rhythm, which are wrongly pronounced to be irrelevant

            Plato in this chapter seems to me to point to the existence of four leading or simple
            modes, viz. Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian and Ionian (the last two having each two varieties,
            a <foreign xml:lang="greek">su/ntonos</foreign> and a <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            careful reader will note that Plato begins a chiasmus with <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            prepare us to <pb n="159"/> find their construction in the sequel. Had he written
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)tuxou/ntwn, dustuxou/ntwn, a)ndrei/wn, swfro/nwn</foreign>
            the double chiasmus would have compelled us to connect the genitives with <foreign

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">panarmoni/ou</lem></app>. In Plato the noun <foreign

            instrument of any kind. Here the word is sometimes understood of a particular and
            definite musical instrument, but a careful study of the context shews that it does not
            bear this meaning even here. Plato has decided to admit only two modes, the Dorian and
            the Phrygian. ‘Consequently,’ he continues, ‘we shall have
            no need in our songs and melodies of <foreign xml:lang="greek">poluxordi/a</foreign> or
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">panarmo/nion</foreign>, and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi>
              (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/ra</foreign>) we shall dispense with <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >tri/gwnoi, phkti/des</foreign> etc., with all instruments, in short, which are
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">polu/xorda</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >poluarmo/nia</foreign>.’ The prohibition of certain musical instruments is an
            inference from the general principle that <foreign xml:lang="greek">poluxordi/a</foreign>
            and <foreign xml:lang="greek">panarmo/nion</foreign> are unnecessary, so that <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">panarmo/nion</foreign> cannot itself be a particular musical instrument.
            Probably, as Mr Archer-Hind has suggested to me, the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >panarmo/nion</foreign> was “not a mode or modes, but a style of composition,
            in which the ‘Tondichter’ passed freely from <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >dwristi/</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="greek">frugisti/</foreign> and <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ludisti/</foreign> and as many others as he chose. The name may even have
            been given to well-known compositions in this style—cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >no/mos poluke/falos</foreign>—the fantasia with many subjects. The effect,
            I should think, may have been analogous to a series of bold and sudden modulations in
            modern music.” See also on <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)ta\ ta\

            told by Paus. IX 12. 5 (cited by Monro l.c. p. 38: cf. Ath. XIV 631 E) that it was one

            panharmonic melodies could be played (cf. Proclus <hi rend="italic">in remp.</hi> p. 63
            ed. Kroll): but we must beware of translating (with D. and V.) ‘the

            some later lexicographers appear to have supposed. The gloss in Hesychius <foreign

            quite clear, and may conceivably refer to a whole class of instruments, but Photius
            apparently thought that there was a special instrument called <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >panarmo/nion</foreign>. His note (p. 388, 26 ed. Porson) is as follows: <foreign

            discarded it. This legend may be an attempt to reconcile the two conflicting stories,

          <p>399E - 401A Let us now continue the purgation of our city by laying down rules for
            rhythm and time. Our rhythm must not be varied or manifold; for time as well as tune
            should conform to words, and not conversely. It is agreed that there are certain rhythms
            expressive of sobriety and courage. These and these only will be admitted into our city.
            For particulars, we shall apply to Damon; but we can enunciate the general principle
            ourselves. Rhythm and Mode reflect style, and style expresses character. It is to
            promote the growth of character that we shall require the young to pursue the beautiful
            throughout the realms alike of Art and Nature.</p>
          <p>The section on Rhythms is hardly less difficult than that on Modes. Westphal translates
            it with a short commentary in his <title>Gr. Rhythmik</title> pp. 237—239, but
            without shedding any light upon the darkest places. Schneider and Stallbaum give little
            help. I have found Gleditsch's summary account of <hi rend="italic">die Metrik der
              Griechen</hi> (in Iwan Müller's <title>Handbuch</title>) a most useful guide
            in dealing with the subject.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ba/seis</lem></app>. The word <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ba/sis</foreign> in the technical writers on Rhythm generally means a dipody or
            combination of two feet under one main ictus: cf. Schol. in Heph. I 3. 1 p. 124 ed.
            Westphal <foreign xml:lang="greek">ba/sis de/ e)sti to\ e)k du/o podw=n sunesthko/s, tou=
              me\n a)/rsei, tou= de\ qe/sei paralambanome/nou</foreign>. Such a technical use of the
            word would be out of place here, especially in the mouth of Socrates; and the word is
            employed throughout as equivalent simply to ‘step’ or
            ‘foot.’ Even technical writers sometimes so use it: cf. the
            Scholiast already cited <foreign xml:lang="greek">de/cetai de\</foreign> (sc. the Iambic
            metre) <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n me\n th=| prw/th| ba/sei i)/ambon kai\

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfro/nwn a)ndrei/wn</foreign>, and would seem to point to the
            necessity of two kinds of rhythm, one to go with the Phrygian mode and express sobriety
            and self-control, the other to join the Dorian mode in expressing courage. On the
            ethical qualities of Greek rhythm in general, consult Westphal <title>Gr.

            (Ast): 2. the four notes of the tetrachord, which was probably the historical and at all
            events the ‘theoretical unit of the scale’ (Stallbaum, Jowett and
            Campbell): 3. “the four ratios which give the primary musical
            intervals—viz. the ratios 2:1, 3:2, 4:3 and 9:8, which give the octave, fifth,
            fourth, and tone” (Monro l.c. p. 106 note; cf. also <title>Dict. Ant.</title>

            cannot be right, unless we suppose that <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(rmoni/ai</foreign> here
            includes scales of double compass, which is most unlikely. Westphal's explanation is

            view: see note 116 in his translation.) I do not think that Stallbaum has hit the truth,
            for Plato's language is not suggestive of any allusion to the origin of the octave from

            refers to the composite character of the rhythm. as described, for example, by the

            peculiarity was <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pisu/nqetos</foreign> (Gleditsch p. 746).
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">da/ktulon</foreign> must be understood as a foot, not as a
            rhythm, although the <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)no/plios cu/nqetos</foreign> certainly, and
            probably also the <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(rw=|os</foreign>, are rhythms. There is no
            difficulty about this, provided we remember that Plato is quoting (or pretending to
            quote) isolated technical expressions from Damon's lecture. The ingenious, though
            hazardous, proposal of Blaydes, to read <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ &lt;kata\&gt;
              da/ktulon</foreign> (cf. <title>Clouds</title> 651), would confine the instances to
            rhythms until we reach <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)/ambon</foreign>. Dr Jackson suggests
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">daktuliko/n</foreign> in place of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >da/ktulon</foreign>. It is tempting (with J. and C.) to take <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >h(rw=|os</foreign> as ‘spondee,’ but there seems to be no
            authority for such a use of the word. The <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(rw=|os pou/s</foreign>
            is apparently a dactyl; although the <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(rw=|os r(uqmo/s</foreign>
            admits of the spondee. Unless, therefore, we take <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >h(rw=|os</foreign> as a rhythm, the spondee seems to be altogether excluded. It is
            unnecessary to do more than allude to Hartman's excision of <foreign xml:lang="greek"

              ‘placed’—<foreign xml:lang="greek">tiqe/ntos</foreign> is
            not ‘assuming’ as <foreign xml:lang="greek">diakosmou=ntos</foreign>
            shews—the former in a diagram above the latter, in some such way as <foreign

              >ka/tw kai\ a)/nw</foreign>—shews that Plato is speaking of the dactyl and
            spondee which replace the anapaest in the anapaestic rhythm: for in the dactylic rhythm
            proper the ictus falls on the first syllable (see Gleditsch p. 693). Now the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)no/plios</foreign> is also anapaestic, so that it looks as if Damon had

            inaccuracy involved in saying <foreign xml:lang="greek">gigno/menon</foreign>, where
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">teleutw=nta</foreign> (cf. VI 511 C) would have been more
            precise, is perhaps in keeping with the airy nonchalance of Socrates' description. The
            construction is missed by Westphal (<title>Rhythmik</title> p. 237) and the English
            translators and editors. <foreign xml:lang="greek">gigno/menon</foreign> agrees with
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(rw=|on</foreign>: the <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(rw=|os r(uqmo\s

            denoted by <foreign xml:lang="greek">te kai/</foreign>. I have sometimes felt disposed to
            take the words as referring to the iambus, and place them just before <foreign

            to <foreign xml:lang="greek">gigno/menon</foreign>, I am not convinced that the MSS are
            wrong. Hartman also suggests the transposition of <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai/</foreign>,

            included. <pb n="164"/> The meaning is simply ‘and he assigned them longs and
            shorts,’ i.e. to each one long, and one short. This clause is in favour of
            keeping <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)s braxu/—gigno/menon</foreign> in its place;
            if we transpose (as suggested in the last note), the short and long of the iambus will

            beauty of reason. The value of a musical training lies in its peculiar power of
            imparting grace and beauty to the soul. It enables the learner to discriminate between
            the fair and the foul in other spheres, admitting only that which is beautiful and fair,
            at first instinctively, but afterwards, when reason comes, with fullest consciousness,
            and joyful recognition of the beauty to which he is himself akin. No one is truly imbued
            with musical culture until he can recognise the originals of virtue wherever they are
            found, as well as their copies everywhere. Such an one will love supremely the union of
            a beautiful soul with physical beauty, but will let inner beauty atone in part for
            outward defect, and his passion will be pure from sensual taint. Our account of Music is
            now ended: for the end of Music is the love of Beauty.</p>

            describes in glowing language, like that of the <title>Symposium</title>, Plato's ideal
            of art. He does not desire to banish art, as is sometimes asserted, but rather idealises
            it by effecting—as he believed—its reconciliation with beauty and
            truth. Art aspired to be <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalo/n</foreign> in his day: Plato wished
            it to be so in the fullest sense of the word: and his idea of beauty is sufficiently
            comprehensive to include moral and spiritual beauty as well as physical. Plato was
            doubtless unfair in the application of his principle to some of the Greek artists and
            poets, but in itself his ideal—the love of spiritual beauty —is one
            to which the best and most enduring art—which alone can find a place in an
            ideal city—consciously or unconsciously ever seeks to conform. See Nettleship

            656 D, E. Nettleship (<title>Hell.</title> pp. 117 f.) remarks on the fact that
            “Plato in his criticism of <pb n="166"/> Greek art has almost ignored the
            painters and sculptors, and confined his assaults to the musicians and still more to the
            poets.” This is true, although the present passage shews that his canons were
            intended to regulate painting, sculpture, architecture, and the minor arts as well as
            music and poetry. Among other reasons, Nettleship plausibly suggests that Plato
            “did not see in the sculptors and architects of his time the signs of
            degeneracy which drew his attention to the poets and musicians.” Cf. 401
          C.</p>

            words without thinking of Olympia; no Athenian without recalling the glories of the
            Acropolis. It was probably in the spirit of this ideal that
            Epaminondas—himself a man of Platonic sympathies, if not a
            Platonist— hinted to his countrymen that their city could not be truly great
            until the Propylaea crowned their citadel (Aesch. <foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\

            115—123). Partly on grounds of style, and partly for grammatical reasons, I
            believe that Plato wrote <foreign xml:lang="greek">tis</foreign> and not <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ti</foreign> (see cr. n.). ‘Whenever <hi rend="italic"
            >anything</hi> strikes on their eyes or ears from fair works of art’ sounds

            Translate ‘Whensoever from beautiful works of art there smites upon their eyes
            or ears as it were a salubrious breath from healthful regions.’ In the same

            (as opposed to <foreign xml:lang="greek">dusxerai/nwn</foreign> just before) ‘and

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> Plato's Ideas? So Zeller (II^{4} 1 p. 560
            note), and many other critics, understand the word; nor can it be denied that the
            language of Plato, <hi rend="italic">if interpreted in the light of Book VII</hi>, can
            bear this meaning. Nevertheless we are bound in the first instance to interpret this
            passage by itself, and not by Book VII, the more so as the doctrine of transcendent or
            separate (<foreign xml:lang="greek">xwristai/</foreign>) Ideas appears nowhere else in
            I—IV, and seems to be expressly reserved by Plato for his philosophical, as
            distinct from his musical education (see IV 435 D and VI 504 B note). What is meant by
            the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)ko/nas au)tw=n</foreign>? The context shews
            conclusively that <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)ko/nes</foreign> refers to copies (sc. of the
            virtues <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign> etc.) represented in poetry and the
            fine arts (so also Krohn <title>Pl. Frage</title> p. 47). On any other interpretation
            the introduction of these <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)ko/nes</foreign> is irrelevant in a
            discussion on the rules which imitative art must obey. This being so, if <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> means the Ideas, Poetry will be a direct imitation of
            the Ideas, which is inconsistent with X 595 C —598 D. Or does Plato mean to
            suggest that Poetry and Art in his ideal city are really to imitate the Ideas directly?
            This is a bold and attractive solution, and there are several hints elsewhere to the
            same or nearly the same effect, but Plato expressly speaks of the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ei)/dh</foreign> here only as immanent, and not transcendent (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >e)no/nta e)n oi(=s e)/nestin</foreign>), and we must therefore suppose that the
            artist copies from the life (cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n th=| yuxh=| kala\ h)/qh
              e)no/nta</foreign> D). The word <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> is repeatedly
            used by Plato without reference to transcendent Ideas, as has been amply proved by Krohn
              (<title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 65, 66), Pfleiderer (<hi rend="italic">Zur
            Lösung</hi> etc. p. 17), and Campbell (II pp. 296 ff.). Here it does not mean
            ‘varieties’ (as if there were more than one variety of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign>), but simply ‘forms’ or
            ‘kinds,’ in the sense in which the immanent reality which every
            general notion attempts to express is a ‘form’ or
            ‘kind’—a genus or species—of the totality of
            things. Cf. IV 435 B note The genitives are genitives of definition. The use of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> in the sense of “immanente
            Seinsformen” (Krohn) is interesting as a harbinger of the Ideal theory of VI
            and VII—a sort of half-way house between the Socratic <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >lo/goi</foreign> and Plato's ideas. It recurs in IV 434 D, 435 B, 437 D. See further
            Krohn <title>Pl. Frage</title> pp. 54—58, and cf. VI 504 D note But although
            the separatists have (as I think) made out their claim that transcendent Ideas do not
            appear in Books I—IV, I agree with Hirmer (<title>Entst. u. Komp. d. Pl.

            very son. It should be noted that in Plato's <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/rws</foreign> it
            is the elder who loves, and the younger who is loved; and that the aim and purpose of
            Platonic love is <foreign xml:lang="greek">to/kos e)n kalw=|</foreign> (<bibl
              n="Plat. Sym. 206B"><title>Symp.</title> 206 B</bibl>)—the bringing to
            birth of noble thoughts and aspirations from the beautiful soul of youth. Socrates was
            the embodiment of Plato's ideal in this respect (<bibl n="Plat. Sym. 216D"

            and not yet the transcendent Idea of the Beautiful, the contemplation of which demands a

          <p>403C - 405A Let us now discuss the subject of physical training. We may safely entrust
            the duty of making specific rules to the intelligences which we train, and content
            ourselves with tracing outlines. Every kind of excess or self-indulgence in eating,
            drinking, and the other appetites, must be forbidden. Gymnastic must be
            ‘simple’ like her sister Music. Complexity in the one case breeds
            disease, in the other vice; so that doctors and judges rise in public estimation, and
            chicanery and medicine give themselves airs.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">gumnastikh=| ktl.</lem></app> Plato's statements on
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">gumnastikh/</foreign> have been carefully collected and
            expounded by Kanter <hi rend="italic">Platos Anschauungen über Gymnastik</hi>,
            Graudenz 1886. Admirable remarks on the whole subject will be found in Nettleship
              <title>Hell.</title> pp. 132—134: cf. also his <title>Lectures and
            Remains</title> II pp. <pb n="171"/> 123—126. Plato deals here chiefly with
            the hygienic aspect of gymnastic—a subject which was much discussed in his
            day: see <title>Dict. Ant.</title> I p. 929, where we are reminded that gymnasia were
            dedicated to Apollo, father of Asclepius, and himself a god of healing. In his
            interesting treatise <hi rend="italic">Die Platonischen Dialoge in ihrem
              Verhältnisse zu den Hippokratischen Schriften</hi> (Landshut 1882)
            Poschenrieder has shewn that Plato was strongly influenced throughout this passage by
            the views of Hippocrates and his school. See also Häser <title>Lehrb. d. Gesch.

            Blümner l. c. p. 359 note 1). Plato holds that the increase of citizen doctors
            points to the spread of self-indulgence among the free-born population.</p>
          <p>405A - 410A It is a sign of bad education when we require first-rate physicians and
            judges; still more shameful is it to pride oneself on escaping the <pb n="174"/>
            punishment of wrong-doing by the aid of legal subterfuges. We should also be ashamed to
            enlarge the terminology of medicine by our self-indulgence. It was otherwise with
            medical science in the time of Homer, although Herodicus has now invented a new sort of
            treatment, whose only result is to prolong the process of dying. Asclepius knew better;
            for he saw that work was more than life. We recognise this fact in the case of artisans
            and mechanics; but Asclepius knew that rich men also have a work to do, and in the

            Legends to the contrary effect are false. Yet we cannot dispense with doctors and
            judges: only they must be good doctors and good judges. The most skilled physicians are
            those who, besides having learnt their art, have had the largest experience of disease
            in their own persons; but no one can be a good judge whose soul is not unstained. Our
            judges must be old, and gain their knowledge of crime by science, not by personal
            experience. The vicious judge cannot recognise innocence when he sees it. Vice will
            never know Virtue, but Virtue may be taught to know Vice as well as herself. Our doctors
            will permit the physically incurable to die; the morally incurable our judges will put
            to death.</p>

            themselves these words can only mean that Machaon and Podalirius (the two chief army
            doctors to the Greek host, <title>Il.</title> XI 833) found no fault with the damsel who
            gave the wounded Eurypylus an inflammatory potion, or with Patroclus, who was curing
            him, for directing or permitting her to do so. In our Homer, however, the potion is
            given, not to Eurypylus but to the wounded Machaon, by <pb n="176"/> Hecamede, Nestor's
            slave (<title>Il.</title> XI 624); and this is correctly related in <title>Ion</title>
            538 B. The inconsistency led Ast to suspect the genuineness both of <foreign

            little doubt that the text is sound. We must suppose either that Plato is confused, or
            else that in his text of Homer such a potion was administered, not only to the wounded
            Machaon (as in the <title>Ion</title> l.c.), but also to the wounded Eurupylus, with
            Patroclus' sanction. The first alternative is possible, and approved by Howes
              (<title>Harvard Studies</title> etc. VI p. 198): but as it is clear from the
              <title>Ion</title>— if the <title>Ion</title> is genuine—that
            Plato was familiar with the story of Machaon's treatment, I think it more likely that
            Plato's Homer related a similar incident in connexion with the treatment of Eurypylus
            also. For the healing of Eurypylus see <title>Il.</title> XI 844 ff., XV 394.</p>

            loose structure of the whole sentence, and seems to me to add a certain didactic
            impressiveness here: cf. 409 B. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ d'

            now dispute that <foreign xml:lang="greek">deiknu/oien a)/n</foreign> is a gloss. Besides
            Schneider's suggestion, which I adopt, two other proposals merit consideration: (1)
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">dh=loi, h)=n d' e)gw/, kai\ oi( pai=des au)tou= o(/ti toiou=tos
              h)=n</foreign> (Sauppe, comparing <title>Crito</title> 44 D), (2) <foreign

              o(ra=|s ktl.</foreign> (Madvig). The first, though regarded as possible by Schneider
              (<title>Addit.</title> p. 25), involves what is, to say the least, a very exceptional
            use of <foreign xml:lang="greek">dh=los</foreign>, with which “subiectum
            sententiae verbo <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/ti</foreign> incipientis idem esse solet quod
            sententiae primariae” (Hartman). Sauppe's parallel from the
            <title>Crito</title> is a doubtful exception to Hartman's rule. Moreover <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ou)x o(ra=|s ktl.</foreign> is too lively: we should expect <foreign

              >toiou=toi</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/</foreign>), but would be improved
            by making a third, viz. <foreign xml:lang="greek">dh=loi</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >dh=lon</foreign>. The minimum of dislocation which yields a satisfactory sense is the
            reading which suggested itself to Schneider, although he did not himself adopt it. Some

          <p>410A - 412B Our young men will seldom need the help of judges and doctors, thanks to
            their education in Music and Gymnastic. They will pursue both arts with a view to the
            cultivation of the soul rather than of the body. Exclusive devotion to one of the two
            makes men in the one case hard and fierce, in the other, effeminate and mild. The
            psychological elements of Spirit and the Love of Knowledge must be attuned to one
            another. Music and Gymnastic are intended to effect this harmony: and excess or
            deficiency in either of these educative instruments reflects itself in morbid and
            degenerate phases of character. He who can best blend Music with Gymnastic is the true
            musician; and such an one we must provide in our city, if it is to last.</p>

            concisely the aim and underlying principle of Plato's earlier scheme of education. Its
            object is to produce citizens who shall combine gentleness and
            strength—sensibility and courage—intellectual activity and moral
            stedfastness. It is an ideal in which the distinctive virtues of Athens and
            Sparta—of Greece and Rome—are united and transfigured. See II 375 C
            and the passages referred to there. The ideal of Pericles (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >filosofei=n a)/neu malaki/as</foreign>) in many ways resembles Plato's (Thuc. II 40).

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pixe/wn</foreign> would preserve the metaphor, which is

          <p>412B - 414B So much for Education. It remains to ask ‘Which of the guardians
            are to be our rulers?’ The elder shall rule the younger, and the better the
            worse. Now the best guardians are those who care most for their country and her
            interests. We shall make our selection on this principle; and we must further try those
            whom we select and see whether their patriotism is proof against all seductive
            influences. Every true opinion or belief —and the belief on which patriotism
            rests is true,—like everything else which we call good, is unwillingly
            discarded, but may be forcibly expelled by persuasion or forgetfulness, by pain,
            pleasure and the like. We shall apply these tests to prove our guardians. Those who
            emerge unscathed will become our rulers. They are the true Guardians; the others should
            be called Auxiliaries.</p>
          <p>ff. This is the first appearance of the Rulers in Plato's State, if we except the
            passing allusion in 389 C. Their presence is necessary to take the place of the original
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">nomoqe/ths</foreign> when the State has once been founded (VI
            497 D); they represent in fact the Royal or Kingly art, whose business it is to
            prescribe to others their specific good or end. See on 410 A and Nohle <hi rend="italic"
              >die Statslehre Platos</hi> pp. 47 f., 85 ff., 113 ff. Such is their duty according to
            the later books; but here it is not so described, and the whole subject is treated in an
            exoteric way. The full and esoteric discussion of this subject is reserved for VI and
            VII. To this later treatment reference is made in 414 A and 416 B. The advocates of the
            original unity of the <title>Republic</title> justly lay stress upon the tentative and
            provisional nature of the regulations here laid down (e.g. Susemihl <title>Gen.
            Entw.</title> p. 143, Zeller^{4} II 1. p. 560 note); whereas the separatists hold that
            Plato's wider conception of the Ruling class is chronologically later than the account
            now given (Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 28—31). An excellent defence of
            the conservative view will be found in Hirmer <title>Entst. u. Komp. d. pl. Pol.</title>

            “the intellect is subordinated to the moral powers, and with the education of
            the character in richly-endowed natures the fruits of insight ripen of

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou=to</foreign> looks like the commencement of an explanatory

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">proqeme/nois e)/rga</lem></app>. It is clear that Plato
            is referring to specific tests, and not (as Bosanquet seems to think) to the duties of
            war and the public service generally. So also Susemihl (<title>Gen. Entw.</title> II p.
            143), and Steinhart (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 173), the latter of whom compares, not
            very aptly, the tests of the Pythagorean brotherhood and the appalling spectacles
            displayed in the mysteries. Three kinds of tests are required: (1) <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >kloph/</foreign>, (2) <foreign xml:lang="greek">bi/a</foreign>, (3) <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >gohtei/a</foreign>. Examples of the second kind are furnished by the severer
            discipline of gymnastic, the chase etc.: cf. <pb n="192"/>
            <title>Laws</title> 633 B ff., where the probationary value of these and similar
            exercises is appropriately insisted on by the Spartan stranger. It was fully recognised
            in the Spartan <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)gwgh/</foreign> (Plut. <title>Lyc.</title> 17. 4
            ff.). The third order of tests may be illustrated from <title>Laws</title> 634 A, B, 635
            C, 647 D ff., 649 A, 673 E ff. <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( e)n oi)/nw| ba/sanos</foreign>

              swfronei=n e(/neka mele/ths</foreign> 673 E). Plato gives no account of the first
            variety; but a good illustration of one species of it (cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou\s
              metapeisqe/ntas</foreign> 413 B) is provided by the speeches of self-seeking statesmen
            and unpatriotic sophists and poets. It is a curious fact that Plato's <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">kloph/</foreign> still leaves a loophole by which vicious poetry may
            creep in again. On the general question, Plato does well to insist on the educational
            value of temptation; the theory and practice of modern times recognises it in connexion
            with <foreign xml:lang="greek">bi/a</foreign>, but experience too often shews that <foreign

          <p>414B - 415D In order to establish all these regulations in the city, we must have
            recourse to a heroic falsehood. We shall tell the citizens that they were only dreaming
            when they believed themselves to be trained by us. In reality, they were being moulded
            and fashioned in the womb of Earth, they and all their equipments; so that it is their
            duty to defend their country like a mother, and regard their fellow-citizens as brothers
            born of Earth. We shall add that in creating some to be rulers, God mingled in their
            substance gold; silver he put in the auxiliaries; iron and copper in the farmers and
            artisans. The citizens will for the most part produce children like themselves; but
            silver offspring will sometimes come from gold, or gold from silver and the like. It is
            the first and foremost duty of the Rulers to lift and degrade children into their proper
            classes, alleging an oracle that the city shall perish when iron or copper becomes its
            guardian. It may be impossible to convince the first generation of our citizens that the
            lie is true; but their posterity may credit it.</p>
          <p>ff. After discrediting the current mythological and religious views, Plato now proceeds
            to replace them by something more in harmony with his own principles. Throughout this
            episode he is making legend in accordance with II 382 D <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ to\
              mh\ ei)de/nai o(/ph| ta)lhqe\s e)/xei peri\ tw=n palaiw=n, a)fomoiou=ntes tw=|
              a)lhqei= to\ yeu=dos o(/ ti ma/lista ou(/tw xrh/simon poiou=men</foreign>. His
            particular object is to give a religious and quasi-historical sanction to the sentiment
            of patriotism and the institution of caste. With this aim in view he frames a <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">mu=qos</foreign> in which the belief of many Greek communities
            (especially the Athenians: cf. Isocr. <title>Paneg.</title> 24 f., <bibl
              n="Eur. Fr. 362">Eur. <title>Fr.</title> 362</bibl>) in an autochthonous ancestry is
            skilfully combined with the popular association of different metals with different
            degrees of merit, as in the Hesiodic ages of man. Cf. Hirzel <title>Der Dialog</title>
            pp. 263 f. The episode should not be understood as ironical: without it, the present
            sketch of a State would be incomplete. We require some guarantee for the permanence of
            the city and its institutions; and nothing could be more in keeping with the
            prevailingly moral and religious spirit of Plato's ‘musical’
            education than that he should find that guarantee in faith rather than in reason. The
            case is different when the Platonic city attains its full maturity, and it is equally
            appropriate that Reason, embodied in the Rulers, should then become the final guarantee.</p>

            Hesiod enumerates five ages of men (interposing the age of heroes between those of
            copper and iron), but the older legend probably recognised four only: see Rohde
              <title>Psyche</title>^{2} I p. 87. Plato makes the golden and the other classes
            coexist—a truer and profounder view than Hesiod's. In other respects, the myth
            (as Jackson has pointed out in Susemihl and Hicks <title>Politics of Aristotle</title>
            p. 244) is not to be pressed: for “it does not recognise the promotion of

            to contain admixtures, both of gold and silver, such as are to be Rulers receiving more
            gold than silver, and conversely; but the Greek does not favour this idea. Iron again
            seems to be exclusively (though less emphatically) reserved for the farmers, and copper
            for the artisans: cf. infra B, C, VIII 547 A, B, and Arist. <title>Pol.</title> B 5.

            corner-stone of Plato's State, and as soon as it gives way, the edifice is doomed (VIII
            546 E—547 A). It is only by the elevation of the worthy and the degradation of
            the unfit that class-distinctions can be made to coincide with those of Nature (cf. IV
            423 D); and unless they do, the foundation of the city, which is <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >to\ e(autou= pra/ttein</foreign>, is sapped. Hence the emphasis with which Plato
            introduces this subject. His theory, it should be noted, conforms at least as much to
            the interest of the individual as to that of the State; for it provides congenial work
            for all according to their natural capacities, and uncongenial labour, whether above or
            below one's powers, is a fertile source of misery and crime. Aristotle
            (<title>Pol.</title> B 4. 1262^{b} 27) seems to doubt if Plato's scheme was feasible.

            much difficulty. See also IV 423 E ff. We are not of course to suppose that the child
            was once for all assigned to his class at birth; he would be watched and tested again
            and again, before being finally disposed of, so that the likelihood of mistakes on the

            (V 470 E) to entertain in course of time a view which has so many points of contact with
            Greek tradition. Here Plato seems to hint that even his Rulers (for <foreign

            believe; the Rulers of VI—VII might teach the legend as an <foreign

            curriculum, the principal guarantee which Plato provides against the abuse of political
            power on the part of his Guardians (Nohle <hi rend="italic">die Statslehre Platos</hi>
            pp. 129 ff.). At the present stage Socrates gives only a brief and exoteric account of
            the system, reserving the full and final exposition for Book V. Plato may have been
            thinking of certain Spartan and Pythagorean institutions when he framed some of the
            regulations in this section: but his communism is much more thorough-going than anything
            of the kind before his day. See Steinhart <title>Einleitung</title> pp.

            reply to Aristotle, Plato might have pointed to his regulations about the interchange of
            classes (415 B ff.), which would have the effect of binding them together more securely.
            Moreover, where each individual has the work to do for which he is best qualified, one
            fruitful cause of discontent and sedition is removed. The wives and families of the

          <p>III 389 B—D. The section on truth offers some serious difficulties.
            Throughout the whole of this division of the <title>Republic</title> (377
            A—392 A) Plato is laying down precepts to which the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >mu=qoi</foreign> of poets are to conform (cf. 377 B and 392 A), and in each case it
            is pointed out how the precept in question has been violated by Homer and other poets.
            Here, however, nothing is said to shew that we are prescribing for the poets, and no
            illustrations, either of our precept or of its violation, are cited from them.
            Schneider, indeed, attempts to extort this meaning from the section; but his theory,
            strictly understood, would require us to suppose that <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)atroi=s
              dote/on, i)diw/tais ou)x a(pte/on, prosh/kei yeu/desqai, ou)x a(pte/on tou=
            toiou/tou</foreign> in B, <foreign xml:lang="greek">yeu/sasqai, yeudo/menon</foreign> in C,
            and <foreign xml:lang="greek">kola/sei</foreign> in D refer not to Plato's own city, but to
            poetical representations; that <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=s po/lews</foreign> in B is not
            Plato's city, but any city figuring in poetry; and that <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou\s
              toiou/tous a)/rxontas</foreign> in C are not Plato's rulers, but others. Such a
            supposition is hardly possible, if <foreign xml:lang="greek">toiou/tous</foreign> in C is
            genuine (see note ad loc.), and in any case it is neither natural nor obvious. It may
            with safety be asserted that if the section had occurred in any other context no one
            would have supposed it to contain rules for poetical fables: in itself it merely lays
            down the duty of the lower classes to speak the truth, with the conditions under which
            the rulers may lie. Cf. Rettig <title>Proleg.</title> pp. 62, 63 and notes on 389 D.
            Rettig, following up a hint of Schleiermacher's, thinks the section was introduced to
            prepare the way for the rulers' ‘lie’ about the origin of the State;
            while Susemihl (<title>Genet. Entw.</title> II p. 120) in some mysterious way appears to
            connect it with the theory of Ideas “as the true and higher Measure of the
            correct representation of Gods, Daemons, Heroes and the lower world.” The
            latter view is altogether fanciful; and neither of these explanations justifies Plato
            for having inserted the passage in this particular connexion, where he is discussing
            poetical legend, however much Rettig may extol the “art” with which
            he has concealed his art. The following seems to me a more probable explanation. We are
            professedly dealing with poetical representations of the gods and heroes, and we should
            expect Plato to require the poets to represent them as truthful and to enforce his
            remarks by poetical illustrations. He does not do so, because it has <pb n="202"/>
            already been done in II 382—383. Instead of this, he reverts to 382 C
              (<foreign xml:lang="greek">to/te a)potroph=s e(/neka w(s fa/rmakon xrh/simon
            gi/gnetai</foreign> SC. <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ e)n toi=s lo/gois yeu=dos</foreign>),
            and emphasizes, more than he has hitherto done, the reason why truthfulness must be
            ascribed to the gods, viz. in order to encourage the virtue among men. That Plato laid
            the greatest stress upon the virtue of Truth appears from the fine passage in
              <title>Laws</title> 730 B, C, beginning <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)alh/qeia dh\ pa/ntwn
              me\n a)gaqw=n qeoi=s h(gei=tai, pa/ntwn de\ a)nqrw/pois</foreign>: thus it is not
            unnatural that he should recur to the subject here. The section should be taken as a
            kind of afterthought to 382—383, which it is intended partly to explain and
            partly to supplement. The whole section on Truth is for this and other reasons possibly
            later than the context in which it appears: see also on <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou\s
              toiou/tous a)/rxontas</foreign>, 389 C.</p>
          <p>A further question has been raised as to what Plato intended by the virtue of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a)lh/qeia</foreign>. Rettig (l.c. pp. 61 and 65 ff.) and Stallbaum,
            anxious to find in all this a preliminary sketch of the cardinal virtues, interpret it
            as a sort of wisdom; but in that case, why did not Plato call it by its name? He is
            content to use the names of two other cardinal virtues, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >a)ndrei/a</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign>, although they have
            not yet been defined. Nor does this account of <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)lh/qeia</foreign>
            contain any of the distinctive features of Wisdom, either in its popular sense or in the
            sense which it bears in Book IV. There is no reason to suppose that Plato means anything
            but what he says, and he himself describes the virtue as ‘speaking the
            truth.’ The whole attempt to see in this division of the dialogue a
            foreshadowing of the psychological theory of the virtues is, I believe, a mistake: only
            two of the virtues are named at all, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ndrei/a</foreign> and
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign>, and these quite without any ulterior
            meaning or motive. Plato is simply describing in a somewhat desultory way (<foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o(/ph| a)\n o( lo/gos w(/sper pneu=ma fe/rh|</foreign>)—since a
            rigid plan is not necessary here—the kind of character which Poetry should
            endeavour to foster: a character which shall honour gods and parents, set value on
            reciprocal friendship (386 A), be courageous, truthful, and distinguished for
            self-control. To force this description into the strait-jacket of the cardinal virtues
            would be pedantic. As it is, no essential feature of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalo\s

          <p>III 398 E—399 B. Plato enumerates in all six scales in three groups. The
            first group is <foreign xml:lang="greek">qrhnw=des</foreign>, and includes Mixo-Lydian,
            Syntono-Lydian, and such like; the second is <foreign xml:lang="greek">malako/n</foreign>,
            and embraces Chalaro-Ionian and Chalaro-Lydian; to the third, which occupies a middle
            position between the other two, belong Dorian and Phrygian. Chalaro-Ionian seems further
            to imply the existence of Syntono-Ionian, and we read of both in Pratinas <bibl

              (<title>Harmonik</title> p. 186. See also Monro <title>Modes of Greek Music</title>
            pp. 5, 6). It has been supposed that Plato's <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >micoludisti/</foreign> is only <foreign xml:lang="greek">suntonoiasti/</foreign> under
            another name; but the name Mixo-Lydian seems rather to point to a compromise between two
            distinct modes, one of which was the Lydian. Possibly the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >suntonoiasti/</foreign> is included under <foreign xml:lang="greek">toiau=tai/
            tines</foreign>, as von Jan holds <title>Fl. Jahrb.</title> 1867 p. 823.</p>
          <p>According to Westphal (l.c. pp. 215 ff.), whose theory is partly based upon what must,
            I fear, be regarded as a speculative deduction from Aristides Quintil. I pp. 21, 22 ed.
            Meibom, Plato's <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(rmoni/ai</foreign> were as follows:—</p>
          <p>(1) Mixo-Lydian <figure/></p>
          <p>(2) Syntono-Lydian <figure/></p>
          <p>(3) Chalaro-Ionian <figure/></p>
          <p>(4) Chalaro-Lydian <figure/></p>
          <p>(5) Dorian <figure/></p>
          <p>(6) Phrygian <figure/></p>
          <p>It will be observed that Westphal's scales are all of them <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >a(rmoni/ai</foreign> in the strict sense of the term, i.e. they differ in the order
            of their intervals; and that the Syntono-Lydian begins a major third higher than the
            Chalaro-Lydian.</p>
          <p>An entirely different theory has been propounded by von Jan (<title>Fl. Jahrb.</title>
            1867 pp. 815 ff.), who gives the following series of scales:—</p>
          <p>(1) Mixo-Lydian <figure/></p>
          <p>(2) Syntono-Lydian <figure/></p>
          <p>(3) Chalaro-Ionian <figure/></p>
          <p>(4) Chalaro-Lydian <figure/></p>
          <p>(5) Dorian <figure/></p>
          <p>(6) Phrygian <figure/></p>
          <p>According to this view, the Syntono-Lydian and the Chalaro-Lydian are in reality the
            same mode, differing from one another only in pitch. Plato's language appears to me to
            point to such a conclusion (see on 398 C, E), but it is not altogether easy for us to
            believe that the difference of a semitone in pitch could have converted <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">to\ qrhnw=des</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\
            sumpotiko/n</foreign>. It will further be remarked that if we take the Dorian as the
            original and fundamental <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(rmoni/a</foreign> (<bibl
              n="Plat. Lach. 188D"><title>Lach.</title> 188 D</bibl>), the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >qrhnw/deis a(rmoni/ai</foreign>, according to von Jan's theory, can be made from it
            by tuning different strings a semitone higher, and the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >xalarai/</foreign> by tuning different strings a semitone lower. <pb n="204"/></p>
          <p>Von Jan's hypothesis is severely censured by Westphal (l.c. pp. 209— 215),
            and strong arguments can be urged against it from the standpoint of modern music. I have
            quoted it in this Appendix because of its symmetry, and also because, so far as it goes,
            it seems to me to be more in harmony with the scanty indications furnished by Plato's
            language than the theory of Westphal. It is true, as Westphal urges, that Plato applies
            the term <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(rmoni/a</foreign> to Syntono-Lydian and Chalaro-Lydian
            as well as to Dorian, Phrygian etc.; but I do not think it follows that SyntonoLydian
            and Chalaro-Lydian differed in the arrangement of intervals: for <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >su/ntonos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">xalara/</foreign> ought to refer to
            pitch alone: and <foreign xml:lang="greek">suntonoludisti/</foreign> or <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">xalaraludisti/</foreign> may have been called a <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >a(rmoni/a</foreign> not <hi rend="italic">qua</hi>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">su/ntonos</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">xalara/</foreign>,

            properly called <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(rmoni/ai</foreign> as being varieties of

            they can call their own— none of the contributing factors of individual or
            personal gratification. In reply, it is not admitted that the Guardians will be unhappy,
            but even supposing that they are, our purpose was, not to make happy Guardians, but to
            found a happy City, in order to discover Justice within its borders. Our Guardians must
            not be made happy at the cost of efficiency in their peculiar duty. Wealth is hardly
            less unpropitious to the exercise of arts and professions than Poverty. When our city is
            at war with two communities, she will not lack resources; for she will make alliance
            with one of the two by promising to it the other's wealth. Nor will she be in danger
            from her ally afterwards. Other States are each of them not one but manifold, and our

            is an old controversy, the echoes of which have hardly yet died away. Schubart
              (<title>Fl. Jahr.</title> 1874, pp. 20 ff.) and others prefer to take <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a)ndria/ntas</foreign> merely as ‘likenesses of men,’
            but the word was regularly, if not indeed always, used of statues. That the surface of
            archaic statues was regularly painted is now no longer doubtful: see Gardner
              <title>Handbook of Greek Sculpture</title> pp. 28 ff. During the best period, in the
            case of marble or other polished surfaces, the painting was regularly confined to the
            eyes, eyelids, eyebrows, hair and the like. See on the whole subject Sittl's
              <title>Arch. der Kunst</title> (in Iwan Müller's <title>Handbuch</title>) pp.
            413, 414. <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/lani</foreign> does not necessarily mean jet black,
            but only some dark and quiet colour. In point of fact, the eyes of the early marble
            statues on the Acropolis “are painted with a dark pigment, almost
            black” (Gardner l.c. p. 30). The use—regular in Greek—of
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">gra/fein</foreign> for painting is an interesting survival of
            the time when decorative art was little beyond carving in relief (Sittl l.c. p. 416).

            note 7 and Darbishire <title>Relliq. Philol.</title> p. 78. The word suggests a banquet
            with all the formalities, and heightens the incongruity of the situation, like the
            purple robes and golden crowns of the farmers. Schneider's exhaustive discussion seems
            to me conclusive in favour of writing <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ decia/</foreign> as
            two words. Casaubon has been followed by most of the editors (except Schneider) in
            taking <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pide/cia</foreign> as an
            adverb=‘commode’ (Ast), ‘commode et eleganter’
            (Stallbaum etc.), or ‘dexterously,’ ‘cleverly’
            (J. and C.); but it may well be doubted if the word could mean
            ‘commode,’ and ‘dexterously’ is inappropriate.

            cannot, like ourselves, be speaking of a <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lis</foreign>, but of
            something else. This is logical and gives an excellent sense: cf. 422 E <foreign

            (not guardians, but since he gives them <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)groi/</foreign> 419 A) a

            573 C, <title>Laws</title> 780 C, and cf. ib. 723 D. Now it is probable from the

              po/lis</foreign>. (Herwerden, <hi rend="italic">more suo</hi>, cancels <foreign

              >pa/mpollai</foreign> may be allowed in a pun on <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >po/leis</foreign>, especially as the Epic plural of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >polu/s</foreign> is sometimes found with feminine nouns. It should be remarked also
            that the first hand in Paris A wrote <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/mpolai</foreign> (see cr.
            n.), though this may be merely accidental. What the ordinary application of the proverb
            was, we cannot say: presumably it was generally employed, as here by Plato, in speaking
            of a city divided against itself. The origin of the saying is to be sought in the
            variety of <foreign xml:lang="greek">pettei/a</foreign> known as <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >po/leis pai/zein</foreign>, an expression which, according to the Scholiast on this
            passage of Plato, as well as Suidas s.v. <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lis</foreign>, and
            Hesychius s.v. <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/leis pai/zein</foreign>, had itself also a
            proverbial signification. In this game the abacus was divided into 60 spaces, each of
            which was called <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lis</foreign> in ancient times (Photius s.v.
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/leis pai/zein</foreign> ed. Porson. Porson's alteration of
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">c/</foreign> i.e. 60 into <foreign xml:lang="greek">z/</foreign> is
            a gratuitous change, as Schneider hints. See also Eustathius on <title>Od.</title> I p.
            29. 13 ff., ed. Lips., quoted by Schneider). The name <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >po/lis</foreign> was moreover sometimes applied to the game itself (Cratinus <foreign

              <hi rend="italic">abacus</hi> on which it was played (Pollux IX 98). There is also, I
            think, some reason <pb n="212"/> for believing that each of the players' sides was
            called collectively his <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lis</foreign>. In Susemihl and Hicks
              <title>Politics of Aristotle</title> p. 148 note, Dr Jackson remarks that the words
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/mpollai po/leis, a)ll' ou) po/lis</foreign> make it likely
            “that a compact body of pieces was called <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >po/lis</foreign>.” If we may go further, and suppose that the <hi
              rend="italic">whole</hi> of a player's side was called his <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >po/lis</foreign>, the words of Plato <foreign xml:lang="greek">du/o

              e(kate/ra| pa/nu pollai/</foreign> receive additional point by becoming an exact
            counterpart of the game. A defeated player, gazing ruefully at his depopulated squares,
            each of which, as well as the whole of his side, is a ‘city,’ might
            therefore well exclaim, ‘Cities upon cities, but no city!’ for there
            can be no city without men (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/rhmos a)ndrw=n mh\ cunoikou/ntwn

            <bibl n="Soph. OT 57">Soph. <title>O. T.</title> 57</bibl>). I have thought of other
            possibilities, but this hypothesis as to the origin of the proverb suits the words of
            Plato better than any other which I can devise. For a different view see Hoffmann in

              >po/leis</foreign> in this passage, but only a jest about making one into many (cf.

            Like every natural organism, it should grow to the limits prescribed for it by nature
            (cf. 424 A note); but Plato probably conceived of it even in its maturity as relatively

            we have regard only to the preceding discussion) it must be allowed that this is the
            natural interpretation of Plato's words. At the same time, it is not easy to see how the
            musical education of II and III would enable the guardians to grasp such a conception as
            the community of wives and children. And in the later books Plato expressly declares
            that the training necessary for the Rulers was inadequately discussed before: see VI 497
            C ff., 502 D. For these reasons we must, I think, suppose that Plato when he wrote these

            proposal to omit <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ fi/lwn</foreign> has much in its favour. It
            is more elegant to suggest than quote so familiar a proverb; and the note <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ta\ fi/lwn</foreign> might well have been added by a scribe upon the
            margin. In V 449 C on the other hand the addition of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o)rqo/tata ktl.</lem></app> Adimantus accepts the
            principle, both here and in V 449 C. The doubts which he expresses later concern not the
            principle, but the <foreign xml:lang="greek">tro/pos th=s koinwni/as</foreign> (ib.). It is
            obvious that the principle <foreign xml:lang="greek">koina\ ta\ fi/lwn</foreign> might be
            applied to marriage etc. in a sentimental kind of way, without involving such a kind of
            community as is afterwards described. As Rettig points out (<title>Proleg.</title> p. 95
            note), Adimantus takes <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/ ti ma/lista</foreign> as “in
            quantum fieri posset maxime.”</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)/rxetai ktl.</lem></app>: ‘goes on growing
            like a circle.’ So Schneider, rightly. Others take <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ku/klos</foreign> (1) as a hoop or wheel—“goes on with
            accumulating force like a wheel” (J. and C.), or (2) as an ever-widening
            circle in ruffled water (Krohn, Herwerden etc.). As to (2), <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ku/klos</foreign> cannot mean a circle in water, unless we insert <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)n u(/dati</foreign>, which Herwerden has the audacity to do. If we
            adopt the first solution, we make <pb n="215"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">ku/klos</foreign> a specific kind of circle: but nothing in the
            context warrants this. It is also very doubtful if <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >au)canome/nh</foreign> can= ‘with accumulating force’: certainly
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ku/klos au)ca/netai</foreign> could not bear this meaning; and
            to exclude <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)canome/nh</foreign> from the comparison (as J. and
            C. also suggest) renders <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/sper ku/klos</foreign> practically
            otiose. The fact is that the growth of a natural (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\
            fu/sin</foreign>) city is just like the drawing of a circle in Plato's way of thinking.
            Like a circle it grows and expands, like a circle too, when its zenith is passed, it
            narrows to the inevitable end. Here it is only the growth which is dwelt upon; but
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/sper ku/klos</foreign> seems to warn us of impending decay
            and foreshadow Books VIII—IX. For more on this point see my <title>Number of
              Plato</title> pp. 58—62. <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)canome/nh</foreign> is
            ‘growing’ in the widest sense i.e. reaching its full maturity of
            size and strength and beauty; but in what follows Plato characteristically confines
            himself to what he conceived to be a city's truest growth, the improvement of the
            citizens.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">trofh\ ga\r ktl.</lem></app> Plato seems therefore to
            hold that acquired characters can be transmitted to posterity. The general sentiment may
            be illustrated by the quaint catches sung by choirs of old men, men in their prime, and
            boys at Sparta: (1) <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(ame\s po/k: h)=mes a)/lkimoi

              diqurambiko/s, tragiko/s</foreign>. They were called <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >tro/poi</foreign> (according to Aristid. Quint. p. 30 Meib.) because they expressed
            different psychical characters (<foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ to\ sunemfai/nein pws to\

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">mimh/mata tro/pwn</foreign>. Plato's <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >mousikh=s tro/poi</foreign> need not however be confined to Aristides' three
            varieties. On the connexion between musical and political changes see
            <title>Laws</title> 700 A—701 D. The connexion was recognised universally
            throughout Greece, and particularly at Sparta, where—as Pausanias (III 12. 10)
            tells us—Timotheus had his lyre confiscated for adding to it four new strings:
            cf. also Cic. <hi rend="italic">de Leg.</hi> II 39. Wherever in the ancient Greek
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lis</foreign> the conception of the individual is hardly
            separated from that of the citizen, moral and political changes are believed to go hand
            in hand; and the effect of music on morality is explained in III 400 D—401 A:
            cf. <title>Laws</title> 673 A <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ me\n toi/nun th=s fwnh=s me/xri

              mousikh/n</foreign>. Bosanquet raises the question whether musical innovations are the
            cause or only the symptoms of political. Plato, I think, regarded them primarily as the
            cause (<title>Laws</title> ll.cc.). We can better understand their effect if we remember
            that they were accompanied by changes not only in rhythm, but also in the quality,
            ethical and otherwise, of the words sung; and if we also bear in mind the enormous
            influence of the theatre in Greek life. The latter point is emphasized in this connexion
            by Plato (ll.cc.) and Aristoxenus (ap. Ath. XIV 31). See on the whole subject Newman's

          <p>424D - 427A Our Guardians must above all things guard against changes in musical
            education. Musical innovations even if sanctioned only in play soon make themselves felt
            in every quarter of the State. The spirit of law and virtue must be infused into
            children even through their pastimes. For this reason, we should not neglect details of
            dress and manners, although they call for no special enactments, but will readily
            conform to the spirit of our rules about education. Many other individual points may
            safely be left to our guardians, if only God vouchsafes to them the preservation of our
            laws; otherwise it is in vain for them to pass law upon law, acting like those who hope
            to cure their diseases by continually changing their medicines. As nothing but a
            complete change in their habits will benefit such men, so only a revolution will cure a
            state which is similarly situated. Such cities honour and make proud the men who
            minister to their desires; but the true statesman does not care to cut the Hydra. In a

            is to come from the guardians he has educated. One reason is that laws on matters of
            this kind can never be final: cf. <title>Laws</title> 769 D. If the guardians are true
            to the spirit of Plato's commonwealth, they will easily frame such minor regulations,
            and re-adjust them—should it prove necessary—from time to time. The

            special connexion of Ionians with Apollo would be out of place, particularly as <foreign

              >e)chghtai/</foreign> formed a college of three members, charged with religious
            duties. According to Schöll (in <title>Hermes</title> VI pp. 36 ff.) the

              e)chghth/s</foreign>; apparently the Athenians chose nine, out of whom three were
            selected—one from each triad —by the representatives of the god:
            whence their designation <foreign xml:lang="greek">puqo/xrhstoi</foreign>. It is on this

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">pa=sin a)nqrw/pois</lem></app>. Delphi is then a
            religious centre, not for Greeks only, but for all mankind. It was certainly the nearest
            approach to such a centre that antiquity provided, for it commanded the homage of
            barbarians as well as Greeks. See Middleton <title>Journ. of Hell. Studies</title> IX p.

            oraculum,” Cicero <hi rend="italic">pro Font.</hi> 30 “oraculum
            orbis terrae,” and gives examples of the offerings paid by foreigners at
            Apollo's shrine. Even now, perhaps, Plato would deny that the oracle is dumb,
            though—true to its own principle of worshipping <foreign xml:lang="greek">no/mw|

            the earth.” Two gold eagles stood at its sides, representing the eagles which,
            according to the legend, met there, having been despatched simultaneously by Zeus from
            the extreme East and West of the world (Strabo IX 3. 6). The <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            for example ImhoofBlumner and P. Gardner in <title>J. H. S.</title> VIII p. 18, and
            Plate LXXIV vii. Middleton, on whose article “The Temple of Apollo at

              xml:lang="greek">o)mfh/</foreign>, a voice, because the divine voice was heard
            there.” If this is true, the legends associating the shrine with the
            ‘navel’ or centre of the earth may be due to popular etymology.
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)mfalo/s</foreign>, ‘navel,’ is an
            Indo-Germanic word (Brugmann <title>Grundriss</title> II p. 187). Herwerden's excision
            of the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n me/sw|</foreign> betrays ignorance of what the

            cardinal virtues we mean those which make up the sum of perfect goodness) is expressly
            enunciated. The doctrine may of course be Pythagorean, but evidence is wanting, and it
            is doubtful whether Pindar's <foreign xml:lang="greek">te/ssares a)retai/</foreign>
            <title>Nem.</title> III 74 are to be interpreted as the cardinal virtues: see Bury ad
            loc. The nearest approach to the doctrine before Plato is in <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 3.9.1"
              >Xen. <title>Mem.</title> III 9. 1</bibl>—5 (as Krohn has pointed out
              <title>Pl. St.</title> p. 372), with which compare IV 6. 1—12, where
            Justice, Wisdom, and Courage are named, as well as other virtues, including <foreign

            subdivision of <foreign xml:lang="greek">dikaiosu/nh</foreign>. From Adimantus' ready assent
            (cf. V 476 A note), we may reasonably infer that the doctrine of four cardinal virtues
            was already a familiar tenet of the Platonic school. Schleiermacher thinks it may have
            been taken over “aus dem allgemeinen Gebrauch”
            (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 26). There is however no evidence to shew that these four
            virtues <hi rend="italic">and no others</hi> were regarded as the essential elements of
            a perfect character before Plato. If the theory was originated by Plato himself, it is
            possible enough that in restricting the number to four, Plato was not uninfluenced by
            the sacred character of the number four in Pythagoreanism, just as Aristotle has been
            supposed to have limited his categories to ten on similar grounds. An interesting
            conjecture is <pb n="225"/> suggested by the remarks of Schleiermacher (l.c. p. 21). Our
            city is <hi rend="italic">ex hypothesi</hi> perfectly virtuous. Its constituent elements
            are Rulers, Auxiliaries, Farmers and Artisans. Now the virtues which are exhibited in
            the lives and mutual relationship of these classes are, as Plato holds, Wisdom, Courage,
            Temperance, and Justice. Consequently these virtues are the component factors of moral
            perfection; in other words they are the cardinal virtues. We may admit that there is no
              <hi rend="italic">petitio principii</hi> in such a method of investigation, which is,
            in fact, akin to the perfectly legitimate method described in <bibl n="Plat. Meno 86E"
                ><title>Men.</title> 86 E</bibl>: cf. also V 458 A. If this suggestion is correct,
            the doctrine of four cardinal virtues will be directly descended from the arrangements
            of Plato's ideal city. But it is clear from what Plato himself says, both here and in
            429 A, 430 D, 432 B, 433 B f., that the doctrine is already an accepted part of his
            ethical system, and not merely a provisional hypothesis which is intended to be
            confirmed by what follows. For the relative value and importance of the four cardinal
            virtues in Plato's way of thinking see <title>Laws</title> 630 D ff.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ou)kou=n -- hu(rhme/non</lem></app>. Essentially the same
            method is used by Aristotle to reach his conclusion that virtue is a <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e(/cis</foreign> (<title>Eth. Nic.</title> II 4). Cf. also (with J. and
            C.) <bibl n="Plat. Lysis 216D"><title>Lys.</title> 216 D</bibl>, E. Jowett observes that
            the true function of “this half-logical, halfmathematical method of
            residues” is in dealing with “abstract quantity” and
            “the laws of Nature.” It is undeniable that this method is much more
            likely to lead us astray in ethics than in mathematics or the natural sciences, owing to
            the nature of the subject; but it is valid if our analysis of the phenomena is
            exhaustive and exact. A similar method was frequently employed in the Eleatic school:
            see II 380 D note Plato not unfrequently extends the methods of mathematical reasoning
            beyond what we should consider their proper sphere: the whole of the preliminary
            studies, for example, in Book VII are to be pursued according to the methods of pure
            mathematics. See on VII 528 E ff. and the Appendix to Book VII “On the

            noted that ‘wise’ (to confine ourselves for the present to the
            virtue of wisdom) is used (1) of the rulers in the State and the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >logistiko/n</foreign> in man, (2) of the city and the individual as wholes: cf. 441 D
            ff. Which of these two meanings is intended to be original and primary? This subject is
            admirably discussed by Hirzel <title>Hermes</title> VIII pp. 379 ff., who shews that the
            wisdom of the rulers and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">logistiko/n</foreign> is the
            fundamental one: cf. Arist. <title>Top.</title> V 8. 138^{b} 1 ff., where <foreign

            holds good of Courage; and also, though with a difference, of Temperance and Justice. In
            calling the whole city wise because the rulers are wise, Plato is influenced by its
            analogy with the individual man, whom we readily and easily call wise, although strictly
            speaking he is wise only by reason of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">logistiko/n</foreign>
            within him. Comparing 443 C ff., we observe that the city is wise because its rulers are
            wise, and its rulers are wise because their <foreign xml:lang="greek">logistiko/n</foreign>
            is wise. In other words the wisdom of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">logistiko/n</foreign> is
            the unit out of which the wisdom of the whole city is constructed. See on 443 B ff.</p>

          <p>429A - 430C The virtue of Courage will reside in the Warrior-class. It is owing to
            their bravery that we call the city brave, for the general character of the city as a
            whole cannot be determined by any courage or cowardice present among the others. The
            Soldiers will in spite of every temptation continue true to the principles laid down by
            law concerning what should, and what should not, be feared; and they will do so the more
            stedfastly, because their musical and gymnastic training has already prepared them for
            the legislation in question. It is in the <pb n="228"/> preservation of these principles
            that the courage of a city consists, a kind of courage which is distinct from the
            corresponding virtue in lower animals and slaves, because its basis is education.
            Another time we may discuss the virtue of Courage more fully, but for our present
            purpose this suffices.</p>

            Hartman). In either case the <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)th/n</foreign> which follows has a
            different antecedent viz. <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n peri\ tw=n deinw=n
            do/can</foreign>, so that the sentence becomes both awkward and obscure. Moreover, in
            whichever way we understand <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)th/n</foreign>, the MSS leave us
            with three accusatives (<foreign xml:lang="greek">au)th/n, swthri/an</foreign> and the
            clause introduced by <foreign xml:lang="greek">to/</foreign>), the precise relationship of
            which is far from clear. Various suggestions have been made to escape these
            difficulties. Instead of <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)th/n</foreign> Jackson suggests
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)= th/n</foreign> (<title>J. Ph.</title> IV p. 148); while
            Stallbaum and others read <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=|</foreign> (eo quod) for <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">to/</foreign>, before which Hartman for his part wishes to insert
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia/</foreign>. Hermann and Baiter cut the knot by expunging
            both <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)th/n</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >swthri/an</foreign>. Jackson's remedy is the simplest, but <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >au)=</foreign> creates a difficulty. The new point in the explanation which he supposes
            it to mark is, I think, emphasized too much by <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)=</foreign>; nor
            indeed is it quite easy to separate <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)=</foreign> from <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)/legon</foreign>. I believe Plato wrote <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >au)th=s</foreign>. The words <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ panto\s au)th=s
            swthri/an</foreign> recall and correspond exactly to <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(\ dia\
              panto\s sw/sei th\n peri\ tw=n deinw=n do/can</foreign>, and to 430 B <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">swthri/an dia\ panto\s do/chs ktl.</foreign>, and the meaning is
            ‘by preserving it perpetually I meant preserving it throughout when one is in
            pains and in pleasures’ etc. Grammatically, the infinitives are the direct
            object of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/legon</foreign> (‘I called’), and
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ panto\s au)th=s swthri/an</foreign> is its secondary
            object. The presence of <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)th=s swthri/an</foreign>
            <pb n="229"/> is necessary to correspond to <foreign xml:lang="greek">diasw/|zesqai
            au)th/n</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ panto\s</foreign> takes the first
            place, because it is the phrase requiring elucidation. The corruption of <foreign

            Blümner <title>Technologie</title> etc. I pp. 221 ff.). That this
            interpretation is right, appears also from the application of the simile. The guardians
            are the white woollen substances specially selected (note <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >e)celego/meqa</foreign> 429 E), their education is the <foreign xml:lang="greek"

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">tosou/twn</foreign> is strictly in point, for woollen substances
            may be of any colour, since they may have been already dyed. Plato informs us that dyers

            else that <foreign xml:lang="greek">qerapeu/santes</foreign> is used for <foreign

            identical. As for the second, Schneider remarks “aoristum ipsum pro praesenti
            positum vix credo.” There are some instances in which “an aorist
            participle denoting that in which the action of a verb of <hi rend="italic">past</hi>
            time consists may express time coincident with that of the verb, when the actions of the

            52: cf. Kühner <title>Gr. Gr.</title> II pp. 161 ff.), but as <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">proparaskeua/zousin</foreign> is a verb of present or universal time,
            Goodwin's rule is inapplicable here. Hartman ejects the participle, and Schneider is

            Further, without <foreign xml:lang="greek">panto\s a)/llou r(u/mmatos</foreign> Plato would

            and <hi rend="italic">de utilit. math.</hi> p. 14. I suggest the following
            interpretation. The action of pleasure differs from that of pain, fear, and desire, in
            being more gentle, and less violent (<foreign xml:lang="greek">bi/aios</foreign>). Pleasure
            in short relaxes (<foreign xml:lang="greek">xala=|</foreign>) while pain (of which fear and
            desire as such are both varieties) contracts: cf. III 411 A on the effect of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">glukei=ai a(rmoni/ai</foreign>, <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 66C"

            suggests <foreign xml:lang="greek">xala=n</foreign>, and it is probably for this reason that
            Plato compares pleasure to it. Such a play on words is quite in Plato's manner: cf.
              <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 361D"><title>Prot.</title> 361 D</bibl>. If we suppose that other
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">r(u/mmata</foreign> were harder, and less agreeable in their
            action, the point of comparing pain etc. with ‘every other

            Herwerden employs his favourite remedy of excision; and other equally unsatisfactory
            remedies will be found in Hartman. The text is quite sound. True opinion is in Plato the
            basis of action done in ignorance of what is right but in obedience to an authority
            which knows. A dog and a slave act from true opinion as often as they obey a master who
            orders them to do what is right. So also (among others) Rettig (<title>Proleg.</title>
            p. 109) and Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 42) rightly understand the passage. Cf.

            to me almost certainly right, although it has been adopted by no recent editor. <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">no/mimon</foreign>, as Rettig shews (<title>Proleg.</title> p. 110), must
            be used in precisely the same sense as in <foreign xml:lang="greek">do/chs o)rqh=s te kai\
              nomi/mou</foreign> just before. If so, Plato flatly (except for the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ou)/te pa/nu</foreign>) contradicts himself. For the only reason why a
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">do/ca</foreign> is <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)rqh/</foreign> is
            that it is <foreign xml:lang="greek">no/mimos</foreign> ‘in accordance with the
            law’: nor is it possible for even a dog to possess an <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >o)rqh\ do/ca</foreign> which is not <foreign xml:lang="greek">no/mimos</foreign>. In
            obeying a just command, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">do/ca</foreign> of a dog is therefore
            not <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou) pa/nu no/mimos</foreign>, but wholly <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >no/mimos</foreign>. On the other hand <foreign xml:lang="greek">mo/nimon</foreign> is not
            only appropriate but necessary in what is practically a résumé of
            Socrates' whole account of courage (<foreign xml:lang="greek">dokei=s ga/r moi
              —kalei=n</foreign>). The only difference between the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >o)rqh\ do/ca</foreign> of a guardian and a dog lies in this, that the former has
            received <foreign xml:lang="greek">paidei/a</foreign>, while the latter has not. And it is
            precisely this difference which makes the guardian's <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >do/ca</foreign> lasting, as the whole of the simile from dyeing was intended to shew
              (<foreign xml:lang="greek">i(/na deusopoio\s ktl.</foreign> 430 A). Finally, the soldier's
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)rqh\ do/ca</foreign> has just been defined (in 430 B) as
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">swthri/an dia\ panto/s ktl.</foreign> To <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >dia\ panto/s</foreign> the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou) pa/nu mo/nimon</foreign>
            are the necessary contrast: the <foreign xml:lang="greek">do/ca</foreign> is in both cases
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)rqh/ te kai\ no/mimos</foreign>, only you can depend on the

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">politikh\n a)ndrei/an</foreign> means, I think, primarily the
            virtue of a <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lis</foreign> as opposed to that of an <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">i)diw/ths</foreign>: cf. 442 D <pb n="232"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lew/s te kai\ i)diw/tou</foreign>. Our <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >po/lis</foreign> is brave because her soldiers are brave (429 B); so that in
            describing the courage of the soldiers we have really and truly been describing that of
            our city. But the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ndrei/a</foreign> with which we are now
            concerned is <foreign xml:lang="greek">politikh/</foreign> in another, and more important
            sense, being based on ‘correct opinion’ (cf. <bibl
              n="Plat. Phaedo 82A"><title>Phaed.</title> 82 A</bibl>, B), i.e. in this instance on
            opinion which is in conformity with the law of the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >po/lis</foreign> (cf. Aristotle's <foreign xml:lang="greek">politikh\ a)ndrei/a</foreign>
            <title>Eth. Nic.</title> III 11. 1116^{a} 16 ff.), and not on
            ‘knowledge,’ like the scientific or philosophic virtue to which we
            are introduced in Books VI and VII. In this Platonic connotation of the term, <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">dhmotikh/</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">politikh\
            a)ndrei/a</foreign> is inferior both to the courage which rests upon knowledge in the
            Socratic sense (<bibl n="Plat. Lach. 195A"><title>Lach.</title> 195 A</bibl>, 196 E ff.,
              <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 349D"><title>Prot.</title> 349 D</bibl> ff.) and to that which
            rests on knowledge of the Idea of the Good (cf. VI 506 A), although it is nevertheless
            on a much higher plane than the so-called courage of slaves and brute beasts, because it
            is <foreign xml:lang="greek">meta\ paidei/as gegonui=a</foreign>. In <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >au)=qis—di/imen</foreign> Siebeck (<title>Zur Chron. d. Pl. Dial.</title>
            pp. 126 ff.) finds a promise of the <title>Laches.</title> To this view it seems to me a
            serious objection that the <title>Laches</title> has nothing to say of the
            characteristically Platonic distinction between <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >e)pisth/mh</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)rqh\ do/ca</foreign>: for that very
            reason it is probably earlier than this passage. Courage in the <title>Laches</title> is
            little more than Socratic courage (cf. <title>Mem.</title> IV 6. 10 ff.), for the
            knowledge of the good into which it is finally resolved is not knowledge of the Idea.
            Others have found in <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)=qis</foreign> a reference to the account
            of Courage in the individual (442 B), or to V 467 A ff., or to VI 486 B. None of these
            references are in point; and it is simplest to take Plato at his word. He drops the
            subject because further discussion of it would be irrelevant; he will resume it on
            another occasion if Adimantus wishes, but Adimantus is content. Cf. VII 532 D note and
            see also on 1 347 E. The whole of this section of the dialogue is important because it
            emphatically reaffirms the principle that courage as well as the other virtues
            enumerated here rests on <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)rqh\ do/ca</foreign> and not on
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pisth/mh</foreign>. We have already seen that Plato's earlier
            scheme of education aims at implanting only <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)rqh\
            do/ca</foreign>. Cf. II 376 E note</p>

          <p>430D - 432A Thirdly, we consider Temperance. This virtue resembles a kind of
            ‘harmony’ or mutual accord. It is often explained as self-control.
            Self-control means that the better self rules the worse; and this is surely true of our
            city, for in it the higher controls the lower, and the irrational desires of the
            inferior many are subject to the rational desires of the virtuous few. Further, our
            citizens are in accord with one another as to who shall rule and who shall be ruled, so
            that Temperance is present in both ruled and rulers, pervading the whole city through
            and through and rendering it accordant with itself. We may define Temperance as accord
            between the naturally better and the naturally worse, on the question which of them
            should rule.</p>
          <p>ff. The difficulties connected with Plato's view of Temperance and Justice and their
            mutual relationship have been to a large extent cleared up by Hirzel
            (<title>Hermes</title> VIII pp. 379—411). Hirzel's conclusions, some of which
            have been attacked by W. A. Hammond in his instructive dissertation “On the
            notion of Virtue in the Dialogues of Plato,” but not, I think, successfully,
            are now accepted in the main by Zeller^{4} II 1, pp. 884 ff. Till Hirzel wrote, the
            tendency was to regard the two virtues as nearly, if not quite, identical—in
            which case one of the two would be practically superfluous. In that case, Plato's search
            for Justice is little better than a fiasco, and <pb n="233"/> his ideal city falls to
            pieces. Cf. Rettig <title>Proleg.</title> p. 137. Hirzel succeeds in shewing that
            Justice and Temperance are different, and both of them necessary to Plato's perfect
            city; nor does he employ any other method than a strict interpretation of Plato's own
            words as they occur. See on 432 A.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">pro/teron</lem></app> is omitted by Richards as

            his own words, which refer only to a single octave (<foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ pasw=n

            Plato usually distinguishes only between two classes—rulers and ruled: 431 D,

            voices singing in unison. Cf. III 401 C. Cobet's excision of the second <foreign

            e(ka/stw|</foreign> anticipates 442 C f.; but is justified here by 431 A, B.</p>
          <p>We may now sum up Plato's account of <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign> so far
            as it is a virtue of the State. It involves three elements: (1) the rule of the better
            over the worse, (2) the rule of <foreign xml:lang="greek">fro/nhsis</foreign> over the
            desires, (3) the agreement of better and worse as to which shall rule. (1) and (2) are
            different ways of expressing the same thing; neither is fundamental, for (granted the
            presence of <foreign xml:lang="greek">sofi/a</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >a)ndrei/a</foreign>) both of them follow from (3), whereas (3) does not follow from
            either. Plato accordingly admits (3) only into his final definition. It follows from (3)
            that <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign>, unlike <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >sofi/a</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ndrei/a</foreign>, is a virtue possessed
            by all the three classes of the City. Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 372) pronounces
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign> otiose and
            “ornamental.” The charge is best refuted by considering whether the
            City is complete without it. (The part played by Justice will be discussed later.) Apart
            from <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign>, what virtue remains for the third class
            of citizens? and what guarantee is there that <foreign xml:lang="greek">sofi/a</foreign>
            will consent to rule? (see on <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n a)mfote/rois</foreign> 431 E).
            Whereas <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign> not only provides for the third
            class, but furnishes a point of union in which all the classes may meet, and the City,
            so far, become <foreign xml:lang="greek">mi/a e)k pollw=n</foreign> (cf. 443 E). If we bear
            in mind that the Rulers are only select Guardians, and that <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >fu/lakes</foreign> includes both Rulers and Auxiliaries, we may tabulate the virtues
            of the three classes thus:—</p>
          <p>Virtues of Rulers, <foreign xml:lang="greek">sofi/a</foreign> + <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >a)ndrei/a</foreign> + <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Virtues of Soldiers, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ndrei/a</foreign> + <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >swfrosu/nh</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Virtues of Farmers, etc., <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Hirzel is, I think, mistaken in holding that <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign>
            is a virtue of the whole and not of the parts; the fact is that it is a virtue both of
            the whole and of each of the parts. Strictly speaking, of course, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >o(mo/noia</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">cumfwni/a</foreign> implies more parts
            than one, and <hi rend="italic">con</hi>cord is impossible to a unit; but the essence of
            the virtue consists in the view that the best shall rule, and this view is present in
            each of the three classes. For <foreign xml:lang="greek">dikaiosu/nh</foreign> see 434 C
            note</p>
          <p>Plato's account of <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign> in other dialogues
            differs in many respects from this, and is rather a hindrance than a help in elucidating
            the present passage. Cf. Hirzel l.c. p. 409. The <foreign xml:lang="greek"

          <p>432B - 434C Where then is Justice? We must beware lest she escape us. Socrates
            presently exclaims that he has found the trail. Justice is the principle, or else one
            form of the principle, which we laid down at the beginning, viz. that each individual
            shall fulfil that function only for which he is naturally best fitted. In other words,
              <pb n="237"/> Justice is, in a certain sense, ‘minding one's own
            business.’ Four considerations point to this conclusion. In the first place,
            it is in order to make the other three take root that we require a fourth virtue; and it
            is just the division of duty according to natural capacity which renders the other three
            virtues possible. Secondly, this is the only principle which can be compared with the
            other three virtues in respect of benefit conferred upon the State: and Justice must be
            comparable with them in this respect. Thirdly, it is by this principle that the Rulers
            will direct their judicial decisions, and Justice is the principle by which our Rulers
            judge. Lastly, the violation of this principle works the greatest mischief in the City.
            So does Injustice; so that the principle itself is identical with Justice.</p>

            >dikaiosu/nhs</foreign>, neatly but needlessly. <foreign xml:lang="greek">toi/nun</foreign>

            <foreign xml:lang="greek">toi</foreign> etc. p. 35). Plato first states a popular view, and
            then proceeds to shew that it is mainly right on grounds presently to be stated (whence
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(=sq' o(/qen tekmai/romai;</foreign>). <pb n="239"/> No stress

            case the predicate, and in the other the subject: complete identity is predicated in

            >ei)rh/kamen</foreign> refers to ordinary conversation. Such a view has affinities with
            the legal view of Justice as the virtue which respects the rights of others (cf. 433 E
            and I 331 A ff.), and is natural enough, especially with the loose connotation which
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">dikaiosu/nh</foreign> had in popular language. It is however
            curious that in <bibl n="Plat. Charm. 161B"><title>Charm.</title> 161 B</bibl> ff.

            Nägelsbach <title>Nachhom. Theol.</title> p. 238. Steinhart and others find in
            the difference between this passage and the <title>Charmides</title> l.c. an indication
            of the Socratic and Platonic doctrine of the unity of Virtue. No doubt there is a
            certain sense in which virtue is one (see below on 434 C), but we must insist that the
            specific virtues are represented by Plato in the <title>Republic</title> as distinct; on
            any other hypothesis, the perfect City falls to pieces. Perhaps <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >dikaiosu/nh</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="greek">polupragmonei=n</foreign> is an
            error for <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign>, and Plato is here deliberately <hi

            ‘Well,’ continues Socrates, ‘it is apparently (not
            Temperance, but) <title>Justice</title> which is <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ au(tou=

              >e)ggene/sqai</foreign> are coordinate and both under the government of <foreign

              >e)ggenome/nois</foreign>, preserved in Stobaeus (<title>Flor.</title> 43. 98) and in
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">*c</foreign>. The author of the reading <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >e)ggeno/mena</foreign> must have understood Plato to mean ‘which enabled
            them all to make their appearance in the city, and having done so, to keep it safe, so
            long as they are there,’ and this, I think, is the natural meaning of Plato's
            words, if <foreign xml:lang="greek">pare/xein</foreign> is retained. But the sentiment is
              compara<pb n="240"/> tively weak; and consequently Ast and Hartman wish to cancel
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">pare/xein</foreign>, making <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >swthri/an</foreign> depend upon <foreign xml:lang="greek">pare/sxen</foreign>; but a
            present tense is necessary. <foreign xml:lang="greek">pare/xei</foreign> seems to me what
            Plato wrote, ‘aye, and after they have appeared it preserves them, so long as
            it is present in the city.’ A relative clause often passes into an independent
            sentence (see on II 357 B); and the idiom is appropriate here because it responds to the

            factors of the State. Cf. II 370 A note It is moreover the soil out of which all the

            appears in the Farmers and Artisans, the last two in the Auxiliaries, while the Rulers
            possess all three (432 A note). Thus all the Virtues meet in Justice (<foreign

            9. 5), that the true unity of Virtue consists. Plato's Justice is in reality not so much
            a specific virtue, as Virtue or Righteousness in general: <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\
              ou)/q' e(/speros ou)/q' e(w=|os ou(/tw qaumasto/s</foreign> (Arist. l.c.): cf. 442 E

            democracy, although it is in reality a particular psychological interpretation of

          <p>435A - 435D The point to be determined is this: are there three psychological forms or
            kinds in the soul of the Individual, corresponding to the three orders in our City? And
            is the Individual temperate, brave, wise and just in virtue of the corresponding
            affections of these kinds? Our present methods of investigation are wanting in
            exactness; but they are sufficient for our immediate object.</p>
          <p>ff. The passages in Plato dealing with psychology have been collected and carefully
            expounded by E. W. Simson <title>Der Begriff der Seele bei Plato</title> (Leipzig 1889).
            I have found Simson's treatise more serviceable than Chaignet <title>De la Psychologie
              de Platon</title> (Paris 1862). Dr Brandt's Program <title>Zur Entwickelung der
              Platonischen Lehre von den Seelentheilen</title> (Leipzig 1890) will also be found
            useful in studying the psychological theory here unfolded. For an attempt to shew that
            Plato always believed in the unity of soul see ArcherHind in <title>J. Ph.</title> X pp.
            120—131. The fundamental principle on which the theory of Book IV should be
            interpreted is that the just soul is an image of the just city. Now the just city is a
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(/n</foreign> with three <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >polla/</foreign>: so therefore is the just soul. Plato states this quite clearly in 443
            E <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(/na geno/menon e)k pollw=n</foreign>. In this sense,
            therefore—and to Plato it was something real and no mere figure of
            speech—the soul has unity; but not, strictly speaking, in any other sense;
            otherwise we are in danger of obliterating the distinction between the three orders of
            the city, and so destroying the whole fabric. Of course nothing which Plato now says
            should be taken as prejudging the question about the nature of soul in its <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a)lhqesta/th fu/sis</foreign>, i.e. when exempt from all the evils which
            are inseparable from matter (X 611 B ff.): if wholly separated from material accretions
            it is probably <foreign xml:lang="greek">monoeide/s</foreign> (612 A), <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >logistiko/n</foreign> alone remaining. See on X 611 B. But for the present we are
            concerned with soul incarnate; and Plato certainly speaks of this as having three parts.
            Cf. Zeller^{4} II 1, pp 845 ff. In what sense an immaterial thing like the soul even
            when present in body can be said to contain ‘parts’ or
            ‘kinds’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">me/rh, ei)/dh, ge/nh</foreign>) is a
            further question, which Plato does not here raise, although his followers have done so.
            It is doubtless true (as Archer-Hind holds l.c.) that ‘parts’ of
            soul can only be different modes of its operation; and a consciousness of this fact
            seems to betray itself in 439 B, D; but we shall best apprehend the meaning of Plato in
            this passage by treating the analogy as Plato does, i.e. as valid throughout, and
            speaking, in common with Plato and his commentators, of ‘parts’ of
            soul. See also on 435 B. <pb n="244"/></p>

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">makrote/ra peri/odos</foreign> in VI 504 B ff., where Plato
            expressly refers back to this passage, eschews the psychological problem altogether. The
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">makrote/ra peri/odos</foreign> of Books VI—VII is in
            harmony with the present enquiry in so far as it seeks to determine the nature of
            Justice and the other virtues (VI 504 D, 506 A), but it is nowhere in the Republic
            expressly used either to confirm or to overthrow the triple division of soul which is
            here propounded. (The analysis of mental faculties in VI 509 D—511 E is
            introductory to the <foreign xml:lang="greek">makrote/ra peri/odos</foreign>, not a result
            obtained by it; nor has that analysis, strictly speaking, any bearing on the question
            whether soul has three <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> or not: cf. Pfleiderer <hi
              rend="italic">Zur Lösung</hi> etc. p. 25.) Krohn accordingly <pb n="245"/>
            holds that the ‘longer ways’ of IV and VI are different and distinct
              (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 128); and Schleiermacher supposes
            (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 71) that the <foreign xml:lang="greek">plei/wn
            o(do/s</foreign> of IV is to be found in the psychology of the <title>Timaeus</title>;
            but that Plato meant the two ways to be identical is certain, for he explicitly says
            that they are (VI 504 B ff.). The only way out of these difficulties is to suppose that
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou=to</foreign> here was not intended by Plato to refer to the
            psychological, but to the ethical question, to which the psychological enquiry is
            introductory. <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou=to</foreign> must then be taken as <foreign

            written by Plato immediately after he wrote 435 C, but at a later time, when VI 504
            A—D was composed. It is in itself highly probable that the most important
            passages referring forward or backward to one another throughout the dialogue were
            either written together, or at all events revised by Plato side by side. Cf. Brandt l.
            c. p. 13 note 3, where a kindred view is taken. In any case, we must adhere to our
            explanation of <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou=to</foreign>, if we would preserve the artistic

          <p>435E - 439E The presence of three kinds or characters in the city establishes the
            existence of the same characters in the individual; but the question is, do they exist
            in him as three separate elements, or not? Do we employ the whole soul in every
            psychical act, or do we learn with one part, feel angry with a second, desire with a
            third? In examining this question we begin by laying it down that the same thing cannot

            without qualification. Now it sometimes happens that we are at one and the same moment
            both thirsty and unwilling to drink, in other words, experience both Desire and
            Aversion. But Desire and Aversion are opposites. They must therefore spring from
            different psychical elements. The truth is, in such cases it is one part of soul, the
            Rational part, which says ‘Refrain!’, another, the Appetitive, which
            bids us drink.</p>

            Plato says is true, that the predominant character of a State depends on the predominant
            character of the individual citizens (cf. Bosanquet <title>Companion</title> pp. 147
            f.): but it does not necessarily follow, because a city contains three psychologically
            different classes of citizens, that each of us (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e(ka/stw|
            h(mw=n</foreign>) has within his soul the three corresponding psychological elements. In
            making this assertion, Plato relies upon the fundamental hypothesis of the
              <title>Republic</title>, viz. that the individual is a commonwealth writ small. See on

            and C., <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ toiau=ta</foreign> “is to be taken as

              >a)podexoi/meqa</foreign> (as Gildersleeve suggests, <title>A. J. Ph.</title> VI p.

            <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n toiou/twn</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\

            far as I know, been hitherto suggested. <foreign xml:lang="greek">tau)ta/</foreign> goes
            closely with the partitive genitive <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(autw=n</foreign>, and is a
              <hi rend="italic">predicate</hi> to <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ toiau=ta</foreign>,
            which is also governed by <foreign xml:lang="greek">kata/</foreign> (cf. the familiar usage
            with <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/sper</foreign> and a preposition in similes, e.g. <bibl

              ferome/nwn</foreign> is a genitive absolute. The sentence is in every respect an
            elegant and idiomatic piece of Greek, and means: ‘because such parts, in
            respect of which they both stand still and move on these occasions, are <hi

            Schneider, and J. and C. in retaining these words, which Galen l.c. also read, and only
            a few inferior MSS (with the majority of editors) omit. If the words are spurious, no
            satisfactory theory has yet been advanced to account for their presence in the text;
            certainly no scribe is at all likely to have added them. A fuller and more emphatic

            reference to actions, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/h</foreign> to a state, and <foreign

              >pro\s to\ au)to/</foreign>, which the discussion has not yet brought out, is best
            apprehended in examples not of <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/sxein</foreign> or <foreign

            E) is apparently regarded by Susemihl (<title>Gen. Entw.</title> II pp. 163 f.) as
            unnecessary for the immediate purposes of the argument, but it is not so. Plato's object
            is to remove a difficulty which might be felt in holding that desire is restrained, and
            that by the <foreign xml:lang="greek">logistiko/n</foreign>. Why should thirst be
            restrained? an objector might ask. You yourself, Socrates, hold that (1) desire is
            always of the good; consequently (2) thirst is always the desire of good drink, and (3)
            is therefore always good. See 438 A, where the gist of the objection is contained.
            Socrates would reply: The fallacy lurks in (2), for ‘good’ drink is
            ambiguous. If ‘good’ drink means drink which desire <hi
              rend="italic">thinks</hi> good, then (2) is true; if it means drink which is in
            reality good, (2) is not true. Desire cannot know what is good. We must therefore amend
            (2) by omitting ‘good,’ for in reality it is sometimes good and
            sometimes bad to drink. To what then is the final appeal? To the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >logistiko/n</foreign>. It is this which decides on each occasion whether it is really
            good or bad to drink, and gives or refuses its assent accordingly (439 C). Bosanquet
            takes a somewhat similar view (<title>Companion</title> p. 154). See also notes on 438
            A.</p>

            repetition of <foreign xml:lang="greek">di/ya</foreign> is like that of <foreign

            words and is followed by Stallbaum, Baiter, and others. “Palmaria
            emendatio,” cries Stallbaum; whereas J. and C. hold that it “makes
            nonsense of the passage.” It is not at first sight quite easy to decide
            between these conflicting views. The words <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)a\n me/n
              tis—prospare/xoit' a)/n</foreign> clearly mean that the desire of cold drink
            is due to thirst <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> heat, i.e. thirst supplies the desire of
            drink, and the heat present in the thirst supplies in addition (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >prospare/xoit' a)/n</foreign>) the desire of cold: see also on <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >tou= de\—prosgigno/mena</foreign> below. This is in harmony with common
            sense and also with the theory of <bibl n="Plat. Lysis 215E"><title>Lys.</title> 215 E</bibl>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)piqumei=n ga\r tou= toiou/tou</foreign> (sc. <foreign

            the opposite or homoeopathic principle. The presence of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >plh=qos</foreign> produces a desire not for its opposite but for itself. The solution
            of the difficulty is to be found in the different character of the notions <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">qermo/ths</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">plh=qos.
            qermo/ths</foreign> is something distinct from <foreign xml:lang="greek">di/yos</foreign>,
            though superadded to it, for which reason Plato does not use the expression <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">qermo\n di/yos</foreign>; whereas <foreign xml:lang="greek">plh=qos</foreign>
            is in reality <foreign xml:lang="greek">plh=qos di/yhs</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >pollh\ di/ya</foreign>, as experience shews, desires much drink. The common sense
            point of view is taken by Plato throughout, and is expressly justified by him in 438 E
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)/ ti le/gw w(s oi(/wn a)\n h)=|, toiau=ta kai\
            e)/stin</foreign>. For these reasons I heartily agree with the Oxford editors. Hermann's
            proposal is a product of the inveterate tendency to suppose that wherever we turn in
            Plato we rub against the theory of Ideas; but the use of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >parousi/a</foreign> here (in spite of Peiper's <title>Ontol. Pl.</title> pp. 602 ff.,
            Zeller^{4} II 1, p. 560 note, and many other critics) is not metaphysical, but logical,
            and <foreign xml:lang="greek">plh=qos</foreign> is certainly not an Idea in this passage.

            what the good really is (437 D note). Moreover, according to our present theory, the

            thirst or the desire of drink, and (2) the desire of good. That (2) is in a certain
            sense universal, does not alter the fact that the two desires are logically distinct.

            frequently contends. Its function is to support the Rational part of the soul. In a man
            of noble character the spirited element is quiescent or the reverse in accordance with
            the commands of Reason. It must not however be identified with Reason; for it is present

            continued throughout this section. It should be noted however that the parallel is no
            longer quite exact. The difference between <foreign xml:lang="greek">qumoeide/s</foreign>
            and <foreign xml:lang="greek">logistiko/n</foreign> in the soul is greater than that between
            auxiliaries and rulers in the State: for the <foreign xml:lang="greek">logistiko/n</foreign>

            rulers are of the soldiers—but something generically distinct from it.
            Otherwise the analogy holds (with the reservations mentioned on 435 A). Cf. Steinhart
              <title>Einleitung</title> p. 192 and Susemihl <title>Gen. Entw.</title> II p. 166.</p>

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">qumoeide/s</foreign> has been chiefly the source of courage and
            the natural antithesis of <foreign xml:lang="greek">filo/sofon</foreign> (II 375 A ff., III
            410 D, 411 C). It now enters on a wider sphere as the ally of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >logistiko/n</foreign>, and becomes, thus far, more intellectual, as Krohn points out:
            note also the <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)rqh\ do/ca</foreign> of 430 B. Its ethical
            connotation is also intensified; for it is not now simply spirit, but the sentiment of
            moral indignation at everything evil— “ein edler Unwille
            über alles Schlechte” (Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> p.
            55)—everything which tends to destroy the <foreign xml:lang="greek">politei/a e)n
              h(mi=n</foreign>. It becomes in short, as Brandt (<title>Zur Entwick. d. Pl. Lehr. v.
              d. Seelentheilen</title> p. 18) says truly enough though ponderously,
            “leidenschaftlicher Selbsterhaltungs- und

            and the first two very weak; while Campbell suggests that <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            For the ancient authorities see Milchhöfer l.c. pp. I—II. Various

            as our city. It follows that the individual is wise, brave etc. in the same way and in
            virtue of the same internal elements. We are therefore just when each of our
            psychological factors does its own work. Reason should rule, with Spirit for its
            obedient ally; and both of them together, harmonised by music and gymnastic, will
            control Desire, and ward off foreign enemies from soul and body. The individual is brave
            in virtue of the element of Spirit, if in spite of pain and pleasure that element
            continues faithful to the commands of Reason touching what should and should not be
            feared; wise, by reason of the part of soul that rules and knows; temperate, through the
            harmony of ruled and ruler on the question which shall rule; and just, in virtue of our

            the popular connotation of the word, and we shall find that we are right.</p>
          <p>ff. The parallel between the City and the Soul is maintained throughout this section.
            Like the City, the Soul is also wise and brave, in virtue of the wisdom and courage of
            its parts, and temperate and just for similar reasons (see on <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/

            (see however on 442 C); and the specific virtues are defined in the same way. Finally,
            as Justice in the State was at last identified with Righteousness or Moral Perfection,

              (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 43). Unless Plato made the Deity the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >oi)kisth/s</foreign> of the soul, as the original legislator is of the city, it was
            impossible for him to avoid placing the <foreign xml:lang="greek">logistiko/n</foreign> in a
            position of even greater authority than the rulers. In Books VI and VII the inequality
            is redressed by making the power of the Rulers in the city commensurate with that of

            possible, it is much simpler to regard the imperfect as real, and not
            ‘philosophic.’ See above on III 406 E. Schneider, to judge from his

            knowledge: cf. 429 C and 439 E note: (2) as ‘like the rulers in the

            Probably (2) is right, for the analogy between the <pb n="261"/> city and the soul is in

          <p>443B - 444A We were right then in suspecting that Justice in a certain shape was with
            us from the first when we founded our city. But the principle that every one should do
            his professional work and no more, is in reality only an image or shadow of Justice.
            True Justice is concerned with the inner man and consists in the performance of its own
            peculiar office by each if the three elements within the soul. It is this which produces
            spiritual unity, and spiritual unity shews itself in outward acts. We may now claim to
            have discovered Justice both in the City and in the Individual.</p>
          <p>ff. This section deals with the relation between Civic and Individual virtue. Although
            we discovered the latter by means of the former, it is the virtue of the soul which is
            alone original; the other, its outward expression, is but a copy. All true virtue
            therefore rests upon psychology; not yet, as in VI and VII, on the metaphysical
            knowledge of the Idea of Good. The full meaning of Plato's ‘natural
            city’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\ fu/sin oi)kisqei=sa po/lis</foreign>) now
            appears. It is a commonwealth whose institutions and political life are the outward
            expression or embodiment of the true and uncorrupted nature of the soul, regarded as in
            very truth a <foreign xml:lang="greek">futo\n ou)k e)/ggeion, a)ll' ou)ra/nion</foreign>
              (<bibl n="Plat. Tim. 90A"><title>Tim.</title> 90 A</bibl>). Hence arise the three
            orders of the city; hence too, each order performs its own function; for it is part of
            soul's ‘nature’ <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ e(auth=s
            pra/ttein</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">polupragmonei=n</foreign> is a
            consequence of unnatural degeneration (441 A). This optimistic view of
            ‘nature’ is noteworthy. It rests on the wide-spread Greek belief
            that good is natural, and evil unnatural; cf. infra 444 D and Aristotle's <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o( de\ qeo\s kai\ h( fu/sis ou)de\n ma/thn poiou=si</foreign> (<hi

            Education</title>, Deighton, Bell and Co. 1895 pp. 12 ff. Although not itself expressly
            a deduction from the theory of Ideas, Plato's conception of ‘nature’
            as good and not evil is altogether in harmony with the sovereignty of the Idea of Good
            in Book VI: see on 505 A ff.</p>

            strangely enough, suspects the whole phrase. Civic Justice is an <foreign xml:lang="greek"

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/roi</foreign> because they were in reality terms in a

              >nea/thn, u(pa/thn, me/shn</foreign> is very attractive: for the genitives can only be
            explained as <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/ron nea/ths</foreign> etc., and the effect is
            unpleasing, especially with <pb n="264"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(rmoni/as</foreign> coming between. Retaining the Greek
            nomenclature, we may translate: ‘having harmoniously joined together three
            different elements, just like three terms in a musical proportion or scale, lowest and
            highest and intermediate,’ etc. In <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/lla a)/tta
            metacu/</foreign> Plato indicates (as J. and C. observe) that his threefold division of
            soul may not be ‘strictly exhaustive’ (cf. VIII 548 D note). The
            missing faculties would thus correspond to the notes intervening between the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">u(pa/th</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/sh</foreign>, and the
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/sh</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">nea/th</foreign>. It
            will be noted that the unity resulting is not that of unison, but that of a scale or
            mode. Nevertheless it is clear from the language used that the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >a(rmoni/a</foreign> which Plato describes is, as before, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >swfrosu/nh</foreign>: cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/rcanta au)to\n au(tou=</foreign>

            >kosmio/ths</foreign>, and the word <foreign xml:lang="greek">sw/frona</foreign> itself is
            finally employed. Cf. 434 C note A different explanation is given by the Scholiast.
            Holding that Plato is referring to a system of two octaves (<foreign xml:lang="greek">di\s
              dia\ pasw=n</foreign>) he explains <foreign xml:lang="greek">nea/th, me/sh</foreign> and
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pa/th</foreign> as e.g. A', A, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
            (not <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, which is the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >proslambano/menos</foreign>). His note is as follows: <foreign xml:lang="greek">nea/th

          <p>(1) <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)=en ou)=n: h(mei=s ktl.</foreign> (Orelli, cited by

            (Richards).</p>
          <p>It should be mentioned also that Wyttenbach (quoted by Stallbaum) had conjectured
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(stia/toras kai\ daitumo/nas</foreign> instead of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e(stia/toras eu)dai/monas</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e(stia/toras
              kai\ eu)dai/monas</foreign> in a few inferior MSS).</p>
          <p>A glance at these proposals will shew that the difficulties felt have been chiefly in
            connexion with a <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei) me\n ou)=n h(mei=s me/n</foreign>, b <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">gewrgou/s</foreign>, c <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(stia/toras
            eu)dai/monas</foreign> and d <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/llo a)/n ti h)\ po/lin
            le/goi</foreign>. I can see no reason for Richards' correction of d:
            ‘mixed’ conditional sentences of this kind are surely common enough.</p>
          <p>For <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(stia/toras eu)dai/monas</foreign> cf. III 420 A <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">oi( eu)dai/mones dokou=ntes ei)=nai</foreign> and especially X 612 A
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n eu)daimo/nwn legome/nwn e(stia/sewn</foreign>. The <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">me/n</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)</foreign> is omitted in
            one Florentine MS, but <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/n</foreign> without <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">de/</foreign> occurs tolerably often in Plato (cf. V 475 E note). Here it
            has the effect of italicising the preceding word by suggesting a possible antithesis.
            The only real difficulty is in <foreign xml:lang="greek">gewrgou/s</foreign>, and in view of
            419 A to which <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( d' e)kei=no le/gwn</foreign> refers, some may
            doubt whether even <foreign xml:lang="greek">gewrgou/s</foreign> is not also genuine. For my
            own part I am inclined to think that Plato wrote <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            was originally only an adscript intended to be taken with <foreign xml:lang="greek"

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">le/gontes</foreign> and not <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >fai/nontai</foreign> is the gloss. This may be so, but unfortunately no satisfactory

              >fai/nonta</foreign> (Madvig, taking the participle in agreement with <foreign

            (Badham), <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)pofai/nontes</foreign> (Richards). Apelt has thought

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">le/gontes</foreign>. The <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >le/getai</foreign> of the next sentence suits <foreign xml:lang="greek">le/gontes</foreign>
            very well, for the phrase <foreign xml:lang="greek">krei/ttw au(tou=</foreign> is itself one
            of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)/xnh</foreign>. I have placed a full stop before <foreign

            change is necessary. </p>

          <p>In this difficult passage Stallbaum, who is followed by the Oxford editors, construes
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)=nai</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou/twn</foreign>
            (“is one of” etc.), and regards <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou=to o(/per
              e)sti/n</foreign> as no more than “ipsam per se” (“as
            far as its essence is concerned,” J. and C.). This interpretation is
            grammatically awkward, and otherwise objectionable, inasmuch as it anticipates <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">di/yos d' ou)=n au)to/</foreign> below. Plato evidently means to present
            his argument in two steps: (1) Thirst, as you will agree, is something relative to
            drink, (2) Thirst qualified is relative to drink qualified, and thirst by itself,
            without qualification, to drink by itself, without qualification.</p>
          <p>A large number of emendations has been proposed. The late Mr W. A. Gill was inclined to
            omit <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou=to o(/per e)sti/n</foreign> (<title>Proceedings of the
              Cambridge Philol. Soc.</title> XVIII p. 35), and Hartman boldly expunges the words,
            leaving <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/sti de\ dh/pou di/yos</foreign>, as it appears to me,
            in a lonely and unsheltered situation. The suggestion <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n oi(/wn
              tinos</foreign> (Madvig), i.e. ‘which are such as to be that which they are
            relatively to something,’ is very cumbrous, and renders <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >e)/sti de\ dh/pou di/yos</foreign> far from natural. Mr Cook Wilson's defence or
            explanation of Madvig's proposal in the <title>Academy</title> no. 824 (Feb. 18, 1888)
            does not carry conviction to my mind. Baiter combines the conjecture of Madvig with
            Morgenstern's <foreign xml:lang="greek">dh/ tou</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >dh/pou</foreign>, in which case Socrates repeats his question, if <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >e)/sti de\ dh/pou di/yos</foreign> is interrogative, or, if not, answers it himself.
            It <pb n="271"/> seems to me clear that <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/sti de\ dh/pou
            di/yos</foreign> is intended to explain <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou=to o(/per
            e)sti/n</foreign> and nothing more. J. and C. translate “Thirst is, I
            imagine— Yes, said he, thirst is of drink,” remarking that
            “two questions are asked; before the second is completed Glauco breaks in with
            a reply to the first (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/gwge</foreign>): and in <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">pw/mato/s ge</foreign> he completes and answers the second.” I
            can see no occasion for so much impatience on Glauco's part. The insertion of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">kai\ tino/s</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n tino/s</foreign>
            appears to me to solve all the difficulties, and the error is of a kind that frequently
            occurs in our oldest MS. See <title>Introd.</title> § 5. </p>

            >a)ntipra/ttein</foreign> of <hi rend="italic">q</hi>, although adopted by Bekker, is

            has no meaning or construction.</p>
          <p>Against the ordinary interpretation, which I have given in the notes, it has been urged
            that <foreign xml:lang="greek">qumo/s</foreign> does, in point of fact, sometimes join with
            the Desires against the Reason. Thus in the degenerate phases of character depicted in
            VIII 553 C ff. and elsewhere, <foreign xml:lang="greek">qumoeide/s</foreign> is the slave
            and minister of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)piqumhtiko/n</foreign>, and in 441 A
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi/kouron o)\n tw=| logistikw=| fu/sei e)a\n mh\ u(po\ kakh=s
              trofh=s diafqarh=|</foreign>, the same implication appears to be involved. Cf. Krohn
              <title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 52 ff. But in such cases the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >logistiko/n</foreign> would seem also to be corrupted (<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ de/
              ge, oi)=mai, logistiko/n te kai\ qumoeide\s xamai\ e)/nqen kai\ e)/nqen parakaqi/sas

              e)piqumhtikw=|—kai\ katadoulwsa/menos</foreign> VIII l.c.), so that there is
            no conflict between the allied forces of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">qumoeide/s</foreign>
            and <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)piqumhtiko/n</foreign> on the one hand and the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">logistiko/n</foreign> on the other. It is true that the language of 441
            A, taken in its full force, appears to imply that the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >qumoeide/s</foreign> can be corrupted without the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >logistiko/n</foreign>, but Plato would hardly, I think, have held such a view, and the
            implication is not to be pressed. See <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 253D"
              ><title>Phaedr.</title> 253 D</bibl>—256 E. There is some difficulty about
            the construction of <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ntipra/ttein</foreign>, and Hartman would
            expunge the word. Schneider's punctuation, which I have adopted, connects it with
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">dei=n</foreign>. Others make its subject <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >au)to/n</foreign> (‘but that <foreign xml:lang="greek">qumo/s</foreign>, having
            made common cause with the desires, when Reason forbids, should oppose
            Reason—this’ etc.). The explanation of Hermann (adopted also by
            Schmelzer) avoids the anacoluthon, but is exceedingly tortuous and unpleasing:
            ‘I think you would not say that you have perceived <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >qumo/s</foreign> making common cause with the desires and opposing Reason when Reason
            forbade’ etc. Richter also (<title>Fl. Jahrb.</title> 1867 p. 139) evades the
            anacoluthon by defending the more than dubious construction <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ai)sqe/sqai au)to\n koinwnh/santa</foreign>. <pb n="272"/> Finally Nitzsch
            conjectures (<title>Rh. Mus.</title> 1857 p. 472) <foreign xml:lang="greek">mh\ dei=n
              &lt;ti pra/ttein&gt;, a)ntipra/ttein</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">mhd'
              ei)=n&lt;ai/ ti pra/ttein&gt;, a)ntipra/ttein</foreign>. None of these devices
            seems to me so probable as Schneider's view.</p>
          <p>An entirely different view of this passage is suggested by a Scholiast's note, to which
            Warren has recently again called attention. The Scholium runs: <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(
              de\ nou=s ou(=tos. tai=s de\ e)piqumi/ais se koinwnh/santa tai=s eu)logi/stois, kai\
              ginw/skonta/ se tou=to e)k th=s pei/ras, ou)x u(polamba/nw se ei)pei=n o(/ti
              h)/|sqhmai e)n tai=s toiau/tais a)gaqai=s h(donai=s to\n qumo\n a)ntipra/ttonta tai=s
              e)piqumi/ais, w(/sper e)pi\ tai=s tou= *leonti/ou a)lo/gois h(donai=s
            a)nte/pratten</foreign>. It is obvious that the Scholiast connected <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">se</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)to/n</foreign> and took the
            sentence to mean, broadly speaking, that when Reason on the other hand <hi rend="italic"
              >sanctions</hi> indulgence (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ai(rou=ntos lo/gou mh\ dei=n
              a)ntipra/ttein</foreign> SC. <foreign xml:lang="greek">tai=s e)piqumi/ais</foreign>), we
            do not find any conflict between <foreign xml:lang="greek">qumo/s</foreign> and the desires.
            The meaning is satisfactory, and furnishes a fair antithesis to the first half of the
            sentence <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/tan bia/zwntai—tou= toiou/tou</foreign>, but
            it is difficult to reconcile this view with the Greek as we have it. Warren, who
            sympathises in general with the Scholiast, translates “but that dealing with
            desires it”—viz. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >qumo/s</foreign>—“should, when reason says it ought not, oppose
            them, this I imagine” etc. <foreign xml:lang="greek">koinwnh/santa</foreign> must
            however be more than ‘dealing with,’ and the aorist (which on the
            ordinary view means ‘having joined,’ ‘made common cause
            with’) presents a serious difficulty in this interpretation.</p>
          <p>Reading <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n e(antw=|</foreign>, for which there is good authority
            (see cr. n.), I formerly construed the passage as follows: ‘but when
            he’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">au)to/n</foreign> with reference not to <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">to\n qumo/n</foreign>, but to <foreign xml:lang="greek">tina/</foreign> and
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou= toiou/tou</foreign> alone) ‘has joined
            partnership with his desires, because reason decides that he ought not to oppose them,
            you will not, I imagine, say that he has observed anything of the sort’ (i.e.
            such internal <foreign xml:lang="greek">sta/sis</foreign> as has just been described)
            ‘ever happen in his own soul, or in the soul of another? Assuredly
            not.’ By this solution we get rid of the anacoluthon, while adopting generally
            the Scholiast's view; but it is an unnecessary and irrelevant elaboration to make Glauco
            speak of what the hypothetical person has observed in himself or in another: we wish to
            know what Glauco has himself observed.</p>
          <p>On the whole I am now inclined to believe that the traditional interpretation is
            correct. </p>

              o(tiou=n tw=n toiou/twn pa/sxwn</foreign> in the previous sentence, it appears to me
            certain (1) that <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ dia\ to\ peinh=n</foreign> etc. is right as
            against <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ dia\ <emph>tou=</emph> peinh=n</foreign> etc., and
            (2) that these words should be construed with <foreign xml:lang="greek">zei= te kai\
              xalepai/nei</foreign>. That which in the first case was represented as the <hi
              rend="italic">cause</hi> of anger should be so represented in the second case also.
            The same view was held by Schneider. It is more difficult to defend <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">u(pome/nwn kai/</foreign>, and Schneider is probably justified in
            preferring the less authoritative reading <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\
            u(pome/nwn</foreign>. The expression <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/sxein u(pome/nwn</foreign>
            can hardly be a mere periphrasis for <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/sxein</foreign>, nor is
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/sxein u(pome/nwn</foreign> altogether equivalent to <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">u(pome/nein pa/sxwn</foreign>, as Jowett supposes. If the best MSS are
            right in placing <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >u(pome/nwn</foreign>, it is possible that <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pome/nwn</foreign>
            is corrupt, and conceals <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(po/</foreign> with a genitive (cf.
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/sxwn u(p' e)kei/nou</foreign> in the parallel passage just
            before), but until the right correction has been proposed, we must adhere to the text of
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">*c</foreign>.</p>
          <p>The subject of <foreign xml:lang="greek">zei=</foreign> and the other verbs is supposed by
            J. and C. to be not the man himself, but <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( qumo/s</foreign>. This
            is unlikely, on account of <foreign xml:lang="greek">peinh=n</foreign> etc., and still more
            of <foreign xml:lang="greek">teleuth/sh|</foreign>. The parallel with 440 C <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">tosou/tw| h(=tton du/natai o)rgi/zesqai ktl.</foreign> is also in favour
            of making the individual the subject.</p>
          <p>That the text of A is in the main sound I have no doubt, although I should like to read
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ cummaxei= tw=| dokou=nti dikai/w|</foreign> after <foreign

          <p>There is an unusually large supply of emendations. That of Madvig is peculiarly
            unhappy, though adopted by Baiter in his text, and apparently approved by Apelt

            414 A, 416 B, IV 423 E, 435 D, 439 E, 442 C notes), and complete the picture of the
            perfect city and the perfect man by giving us Plato's third or crowning effort
            —the philosophic City and the Philosopher-King. See on II 372 D. As we often
            find in Plato (see e.g. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 84C"><title>Phaed.</title> 84 C</bibl>
            ff.), the new departure is occasioned by an objection, or rather a request for further
            information, on the part of one of the interlocutors. Adimantus invites Socrates to
            explain the remark made by him in IV 423 E f. and fully expound the principle of
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">koina\ ta\ fi/lwn</foreign> as it affects women and children.
            The challenge is accepted, and Socrates deals with the question under three main heads,
            which he figures as waves through which the argument must swim in safety. The first wave
            concerns Community of Education between the male and female Guardians (451 C—
            457 B); the second, Community in wives and children (457 B—466 D); the third
            and greatest, whose advent is long delayed, deals with the question whether Communism
            and therewithal the perfect city itself can be realised in the world (471 C ff.). The
            last of these three waves is not finally surmounted until the description of the
            Philosopher and his City reaches its conclusion at the end of VII: so that Books
            V—VII closely cohere together. In the first two divisions (V 451
            C—466 D), the dominating principle is still <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >fu/sis</foreign> or Nature (see on 451 C): but from 474 D onwards the psychological
            standpoint is gradually superseded by the metaphysical, until in Book VII the Idea of
            Good becomes the supreme inspiring force—at once the formal, the efficient,
            and the final cause—of Plato's City. See on VI 506 E, 509 B ff. On the alleged
            connexion between the earlier part of Book V (451 C—466 D) and the

            favours the ironical interpretation, and so does the ‘Socratic

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)ndrei=on dra=ma ktl.</lem></app> There is probably a
            playful allusion to the mimes of Sophron, as was first pointed out by R.
            Förster in <title>Rhein. Mus.</title> XXX (1875) p. 316. According to Suidas
            (s.v. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*sw/frwn</foreign>) and others, Sophron's mimes were
            classified as <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ndrei=oi mi=moi</foreign> and <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">gunaikei=oi mi=moi</foreign>. In the former, as may be inferred from
            Choricius' <title>Defence of Mimes</title> (first published by Graux in <title>Revue de
              Philologie</title> 1 pp. 209 ff.) Sophron represented male characters, in the latter
            female (<foreign xml:lang="greek">mimei=tai me\n a)/ndras, mimei=tai de\ gu/naia</foreign>
            ib. p. 215). This is corroborated by many of the titles of his plays, such as <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o( a)groiw/tas, o( qunnaqh/ras, o( a)/ggelos</foreign> contrasted with
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">tai\ a)k&lt;*&gt;stri/ai, a( numfo/ponos, a(
            penqera/</foreign> etc. Sophron's mimes are called <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >dra/mata</foreign> (cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ndrei=on dra=ma</foreign>) by Demetrius
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\ e(rmhnei/as</foreign> § 156 <foreign xml:lang="greek"

              >gunaikei=os</foreign>—this is not otherwise attested, so far as I can
            discover—, so it will be proper (<foreign xml:lang="greek">o)rqw=s a)\n
            e)/xoi</foreign>) for Plato's women to come on the stage after his men have played their
            part. Plato's partiality for Sophron is frequently mentioned by ancient authors, as for
            example by D. L. III 18, Quintil. I 10. 17: see Schuster in <title>Rhein. Mus.</title>
            XXIX (1874) pp. 605 ff., where these and other authorities are cited. Susemihl
            (Bursian's <title>Jahresbericht</title> 1874—1875 III p. 343) doubted whether
            Plato has Sophron in view here; but the allusion, which was admitted by Graux (l.c. p.
            215 note), and successfully reaffirmed by Förster (<title>Rhein. Mus.</title>
            for 1880 p. 472), is highly probable. I can see no point in making <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >dra=ma gunaikei=on</foreign> an ironical reference to the
            <title>Ecclesiazusae</title> of Aristophanes (with Munk <hi rend="italic">die nat.
              Ordnung d. Pl. Schr.</hi> p. 296, and Chiappelli l.c. p. 196), nor is it likely that
            the words allude to a dramatic caricature of Plato's policy by some other comedian, as
            is supposed by Bergk <title>Gr. Literaturgesch.</title> IV p. 462 note 134. On Sophron's
            prose-mimes as a preparation for the Socratic Dialogue see Hirzel <hi rend="italic">der

          <p>451C - 452E We declared at the <pb n="280"/> outset that our men were to be as it were
            guardians of the flock. Now the principle of community requires that our female
            watch-dogs shall share the active duties of the males, allowance being made for their
            inferiority in strength. Their education must therefore be the same: they will have to
            learn music, gymnastic, and the art of war. No doubt the spectacle of women, especially
            old women, exercising themselves naked along with men, will seem ludicrous at first; but
            it is not long since the Greeks would have thought it ludicrous even for men to strip
            for athletic exercises. Nothing is truly ludicrous except what is mischievous.</p>
          <p>ff. Socrates now prepares to encounter the first ‘wave’ (451
            C—457 B): see on 449 A ff. The outstanding feature in his argument throughout
            this part of the dialogue is the constant appeal which he makes to <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >fu/sis</foreign> (452 E, 453 B, C, E, 454 B, C, D, 455 A, D, E, 456 A, B, C, D). He
            maintains that community of work and education between certain selected men and women is
            ‘natural’ in two senses. In the first place, it is, he maintains, in
            harmony with <hi rend="italic">human</hi> nature, that is, with the nature of man and
            woman (455 E ff.), and in the second place, it is recommended by the analogy of Nature's
            other children, the lower animals (451 D). See also on II 370 A. Pöhlmann
              (<title>Gesch. d. antik. Kommunismus</title> etc. pp. 114—146) has shewn
            that the desire for a ‘return to Nature’ found frequent and manifold
            expression in the literature of Plato's times, and we can see that Plato was himself
            powerfully affected by the same impulse, although his interpretation of
            ‘Nature’ is coloured by an Idealism which is peculiarly his own (IV
            443 B note). The special regulations of Book V may be illustrated in some particulars
            from the practices of certain ‘Natur-völker’ before the
            time of Plato (see e.g. Hdt. IV 116 and infra 463 C note), as well as by certain
            features of the Pythagorean and Spartan disciplines (see RP.^{7} 48 A f. and notes on
            452 B al.), but it is more important and relevant to observe that Plato's assignment of
            common duties and common training to the two sexes is part of a well-reasoned and
            deliberate attempt by the Socratic school to improve the position of women in Greece. In
            this respect, as in many others, the teaching of Socrates inaugurated an era of protest
            against the old Hellenic view of things. See in particular, for the views of Socrates
            himself, <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 2.2.5">Xen. <title>Mem.</title> II 2. 5</bibl>,

            Euripides' pictures of noble and disinterested women were also inspired in some measure
            by the influence of the same movement. In later times the Stoics constituted themselves
            the champions of similar views, and Cleanthes wrote a treatise entitled <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">peri\ tou= o(/ti h( au)th\ a)reth\ kai\ a)ndro\s kai\
            gunaiko/s</foreign>: see Dyroff <title>Ethik d. alten Stoa</title> pp. 311
            —314, where other evidence is cited. A learned and acute discussion on the
            attitude of the Socratic school in this matter will be found in Chiappelli <title>Riv.
              di Filologia</title> etc. XI pp. 229 ff. Finally it should be observed that, from
            Plato's point of view, the selection of suitable women as <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >fu/lakes</foreign> is strictly in harmony with the fundamental principle of our city,
            viz. ‘to each one work according to his or her nature’ (II 370 B
            note); that it removes a dangerous source of unrest, intrigue, and sedition, by
            providing an outlet for the energies of able and politically-minded women in legitimate
            channels and silencing them with the responsibilities of rule, while it at the same time
            secures for the service of the State all that is best in the other half of the
            population (<title>Laws</title> 781 A), and justifies the claim of the perfect city to
            be in literal truth an Aristocracy.</p>

            If —with the majority of modern critics— we hold that the

            least in some measure directed against theories on communism and the position of women
            with which the Socratic school sympathised, it is easy to interpret Plato here as
            addressing a rebuke to the comic stage in the form of a further challenge. In any case,
            however, the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou) fobhte/on—o)xh/seis</foreign> are

            be ludicrous. Plato thus prepares the way for the identification to be presently made

            just above, points to the comic stage: and Aristophanes is perhaps intended. See on 452
            B. The whole sentence means: ‘Foolish is the man who identifies the laughable
            with anything but the bad, and he who attempts to raise a laugh by looking at any
            spectacle as laughable except the spectacle of folly and evil aims in all seriousness
            also at another standard of beauty, which he has set up for himself, than the standard
            of the good.’ The analysis of <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ geloi=on</foreign>, so
            far as it goes, is in harmony with <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 48A"><title>Phil.</title> 48

          <p>452E - 456C Let us first determine whether our proposal is possible—in other
            words, whether woman is naturally able to share the duties of man—all, or
            none, or some, and, if some, whether war is one of these. It may be argued:
            ‘man's nature is different from that of woman: we should therefore assign them
            different duties.’ A little analysis will shew the superficial and eristic
            character of such reasoning. The word ‘different’ is ambiguous.
            Natures may differ without differing at all in respect of the powers by which certain
            duties are performed. Consequently, if man and woman differ only in sex, they may each
            perform those duties in which sex plays no part. Among such duties are those which
            appertain to the administration of a city. Doubtless man is superior, as a whole, in
            capacity and strength, although many women excel many men; but the natural aptitudes of
            individual women are as various as those of men, and there is no administrative duty
            which is by Nature exclusively appropriated either to men, or to women. Thus Nature
            produces women who are fitted to guard our city. These we shall select as the wives and
            colleagues of the male guardians. Our proposal is possible, because it is natural: the
            term ‘unnatural’ may sooner be applied to the present condition of
            women.</p>

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)atriko/n</foreign> by itself suggests a doctor in actual
            practice, whereas an <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)atriko\s th\n yuxh/n</foreign> need not
            practise. If so, we may fairly doubt whether the two have the same nature; and at all
            events the difference between them renders them inapt illustrations of Plato's argument.
            Jowett and Campbell attempt to escape these difficulties by taking <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >th\n yuxh\n o)/nta</foreign> with the first <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >i)atriko/n</foreign> as well as with the second; but the Greek does not permit of this
            solution. Similar objections apply to the readings of Bekker (and apparently Ficinus)

          <p>456C - 457B It remains to prove that our policy is the best for the State. We are
            agreed that the training which qualifies a man to be a guardian will qualify a woman
            also, if their natural capacities are the same to start with. Now our male guardians,
            owing to their education, are the best men in the city. Our female guardians will in
            like manner be the best women. And there is nothing better for a city than to be peopled
            by the best women and the best men. This end is secured by our system of education.

            sentence, which sounds like a manifesto, and was characteristically selected by Grote as
            one of the mottoes to his <title>Plato</title>, is essentially Socratic: see especially
              <bibl n="Xen. Mem. 4.6.8">Xen. <title>Mem.</title> IV 6. 8</bibl>, 9 and other
            passages quoted by Zeller^{4} II 1. pp. 149—153. Utilitarianism of this kind
            pervades the <title>Republic</title>, as Krohn has amply proved (<title>Pl. St.</title>
            p. 370), and asserts itself even in the highest flights of Plato's idealism (<foreign

              prosxrhsa/mena xrh/sima kai\ w)fe/lima gi/gnetai</foreign> VI 505 A). But even
            Socrates ennobles his utilitarianism by placing soul far above body in dignity and
            worth. In Plato utilitarianism becomes transfigured by Idealism and the doctrine of
            Immortality. Here it should be noted that <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalo/n</foreign>
            <pb n="292"/> combines, as often, the ideas of artistic fitness or propriety, and
            propriety of conduct. The moral sense of the Greeks lay in their appreciation of the
            beautiful.</p>
          <p>457B - 458B Thus do we successfully evade one of the waves which threatened us, but a
            more formidable wave is now approaching. The women and children are to belong to all the
            guardians in common. No one shall know his father or his child. That such a state of
            society is both possible and beneficial, we shall have to prove; but for the present, we
            will assume its possibility, and try to shew that community of wives and children is the
            best of all policies for the city and its guardians.</p>
          <p>ff. We now confront the second wave (see 449 A ff. note). The Platonic doctrine of
            community in wives and children, as a certain critic drily remarks, has been more often
            censured than understood. The object of the present note is not to sit in judgment upon
            Plato, but to endeavour to explain his attitude on this subject. In its general aspect,
            the theory should be regarded as an extreme development of the Naturalism prevailing in
            Books II—IV: see on II 370 A f. and supra 451 C ff. Several precedents have
            been cited from the institutions of various primitive peoples who were sometimes
            regarded by the Greeks as types of ‘natural’ societies, as for
            example the Scythians (see on 463 C and other references in Pöhlmann
              <title>Gesch. d. antik. Kommunismus etc.</title> pp. 121 ff., with Newman's
              <title>Politics of Aristotle</title> Vol. II p. 282 and especially Riese's interesting
            tract on <hi rend="italic">Die Idealisirung der Naturvölker d. Nordens in d.
              gr. u. röm. Literatur</hi> 1875), and even Sparta, a State which was
            constantly extolled by Greek political theorists as a model of the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >kata\ fu/sin oi)kisqei=sa po/lis</foreign> (Pöhlmann l.c. pp. 125 ff., Grote
              <title>Plato</title> III p. 209 f.), furnished some parallels to the Platonic
            communism in this respect (Plut. <title>Lyc.</title> 15. 9—11, Xen.
              <title>Rep. Lac.</title> 1. 8, 9). But Plato's real motive in advocating his theory is
            simply and solely the good of the commonwealth (462 A). On the one hand, he dreaded the
            effect of domestic ties in encouraging selfishness and weakening the bonds of civic
            obligation; and, with his customary disregard of the limitations of ordinary human
            nature, he expected his citizens to transfer the domestic affections, without
            surrendering aught of their intensity, from the family to the State. We may therefore
            truly say that Plato's intention was not to abolish the family, but rather to enlarge
            its borders and make it coincident with the State. “Die
            Sonderfamilie,” as Nohle remarks (<hi rend="italic">die Statslehre Platos</hi>
            etc. p. 133), “wird nur aufgehoben, damit das Ganze eine grosse Familie
            sei.” On the other hand, he was profoundly impressed with the necessity of
            restricting the population, and at the same time maintaining and improving the breed of
            guardians, and the measures which he here prescribes are to a large extent devised with
            a view to securing these ends (459 A—461 E). In this respect Plato might
            fairly hope that his proposals would not be abhorrent to a nation whose idea of marriage
            was primarily only a legalised union for the procreation of legitimate children. It may
            be argued that Plato sacrifices more than he gains, even if we judge him from the
            standpoint of his own political idealism, but it shews a complete misapprehension of the
            situation to charge him with deliberate encouragement of vice: the community of wives
            and children “hat mit ‘freier Liebe’ nichts zu
            thun” (Pöhlmann l.c. p. 280). Finally, we should remember that it is
            only the Guardians and Auxiliaries who are subject to these rules (see on III 417 A),
            and that in the second-best city depicted in the <title>Laws</title> Plato revives the
            institution of marriage, as we understand the word, without, however, surrendering in
            the smallest degree his earlier ideal (807 B). Perhaps the wisest and most temperate
            discussion on Plato's conception of marriage and the family is that of Grote
              (<title>Plato</title> III pp. 220 —234). Some judicious remarks will also be
            found in Jowett <title>Introduction</title> pp. clxxxi—cxciv, and Nettleship
              <title>Lectures and Remains</title> II pp. 174—180: but Jowett goes beyond
            the province of the interpreter, and lays too much stress on the antagonism between the
            views of Plato and those of modern civilised communities. See also on 458 E and App. I

          <p>458B - 461E The mutual association of male and female guardians will naturally lead
            them to form conjugal ties. But no irregular unions will be permitted. We too shall have
            our ‘holy wedlocks,’ but by ‘holy’ we shall mean
            ‘profitable’ or ‘beneficial.’ Now the most
            beneficial unions among lower animals are those by which the best offspring is produced
            from parents in the prime of life. If the same is true of the human race, how skilful
            must our rulers be! They must unite the best couples as frequently, the worst as rarely
            as possible; and only the children of the best couples shall be reared. No one except
            the archons is to know how this result is attained. Bridegrooms and brides will be
            brought together at certain marriage festivals, accompanied with sacrifice and song; and
            the number of marriages will be settled on each occasion by the rulers, so as to keep
            the population as far as possible the same. The rulers will effect their object by using
            lots with which they have already tampered. They will also reward excellence in fighting
            and otherwise by more liberal intercourse with women. The children who are to be reared
            will be taken to an establishment of nurses, where the mothers, and other women, will
            come to suckle them, but every precaution will be taken to prevent the mothers from
            recognising their offspring. Woman is in her prime from twenty to forty, man from
            twenty-five to fifty-five, and it is only during these periods that we shall permit them
            to bear and beget children for the State. Violations of this rule will be severely
            condemned. After the prescribed <pb n="295"/> age has been passed, we shall remove the
            restrictions on sexual intercourse, observing only such regulations as are necessary to
            prevent incest; but, if possible, these unofficial unions shall be barren, and, in any
            case, their offspring must not be reared. Socrates lays down some further regulations
            about new meanings to be attached to names of family relationships, and adds that
            ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ may marry, with the
            sanction of the lot and the Pythian priestess's approval.</p>

            and were celebrated by a special festival in Athens and elsewhere: see H. Graillot's

              States</title> I pp. 184—192. To Greek religious sentiment the marriage of
            Zeus and Hera was (as Graillot says) the ideal type of all human marriages, and for this
            reason Plato characteristically applies the expression <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ero\s

            repudiated with scorn the charge of seeking to abolish marriage. We have already seen
            that he endeavours to make the State into one vast family (457 B note); and it is in the
            same spirit that he now tries to raise marriage from a private into a public
            institution, without sacrificing any of the religious ceremonies and associations by
            which the union of the sexes was hallowed in the eyes of his contemporaries: cf. 459 E.
            If his vaulting idealism “o'erleaps itself and falls on the other,”
            that is no reason why we should impugn his motives, or refuse our homage to his

            some reason for expunging <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)=nai</foreign>, although its
            intrusion is not altogether easy to explain. It is possible enough that Plato wrote

            i)atrou=</foreign> in line 19 (cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">dei= a)/krwn ei)=nai tw=n

            Girls are to marry between 16 (785 B) or 18 (833 D) and 20 (ib.). Cf. Hesiod

            These phrases express concisely the Platonic view of marriage. They are equally
            applicable to the Spartan ideal, and may have been borrowed from Sparta. Cf. Plut.

              >o)cutathn dro/mou a)kmh/n</foreign> is doubtless borrowed from some epinikian poet,
            perhaps Bacchylides or Pindar. The dactylic rhythm is not in itself enough to justify us
            in assigning the phrase (with Herwerden) to epic or elegy. The author of the quotation
            was probably speaking not of a man, but of a race-horse. By applying the phrase (of
            course in a metaphorical sense) to his bridegrooms, Plato contrives again to suggest the
            now familiar analogy of a ‘breeding-stud of horses and mares’: see
            on 460 C. The comparison gains in realism and point, if it was the custom of antiquity,
            as it is now, to bring a first-rate racer to the stud (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >i(ppofo/rbion, i(ppotrofei=on</foreign>) when he ceased to run. This is probable in
            itself, and supported to some extent by a comparison of Plut. <title>Lyc.</title> 15. 12

            B—776 B and J. B. Mayor in <title>Cl. Rev.</title> X p. 111. Stallbaum was the
            first to detect the poetical quotation. J. and C., though translating by “his
            swiftest prime of running,” follow Schleiermacher in understanding the phrase
            literally; but we may fairly doubt if Greek runners had passed their prime at 25, and,
            even if they had, “non hic erat tali designationi locus, nisi forte ob id

            unions between ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’: see 461
            C note The discrepancy is hard to explain, especially as the list in 461 C seems
            intended to be exhaustive. The effect of the prohibition (owing to the meaning now given
            to ‘brother’ and ‘sister’) would be greatly to
            restrict, but not to abolish, unauthorised liaisons.</p>

            exemption Plato's proposals would (according to Richards l.c.) “have rendered
            all unions whatever practically <pb n="304"/> impossible.” Surely not;
            although they would have unduly favoured the <foreign xml:lang="greek">thlu/getos
            pai=s</foreign>. A son, for example, who is born when his mother is 21 and his father
            26, cannot marry till he is 49, because he is 29 before his bride can possibly be born,
            and she cannot marry under 20; whereas a son, whose father is 54 and mother 39 when he
            is born, can marry a girl only one year younger than himself, because his father and
            mother retire at 55 and 40 respectively. Did Plato intend the sons of elderly couples to
            marry young, and those of young couples to marry late? Such an inference is unlikely,
            although it is the logical outcome of his theories. In any case Plato did well to
            introduce a saving clause. The <foreign xml:lang="greek">komyo\s klh=ros</foreign>, obedient
            to the archons, would couple ‘brothers’ and
            ‘sisters,’ whenever it seemed desirable in the interests of the
            State, so long as they were not really blood-relations. (This the archons of course
            would know.) Apollo's priestess would platonize. We must suppose that her assent is
            given in advance, and once for all (although <foreign xml:lang="greek"

          <p>461E - 464B Let us now endeavour to shew that community of wives and children is best,
            and in agreement with the general plan of our constitution. That it is the best policy
            Plato proves as follows. A legislator should above all things aim at maintaining unity
            within his city. The most effective instrument for this purpose is community of pleasure
            and pain. As in an individual man, the sufferings of a single member affect the whole,
            so also in a well-governed city, the joys and sorrows of every citizen are shared by
            all. It is easy to shew that our ideal city fulfils this condition in a unique degree,
            both by means of its other institutions, and more especially through the community of
            wives and children.</p>

            unity that the entire fabric of Plato's city rests: see IV 423 D note, and cf. also 432
            A, 443 D. The perfect city is a <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(/n</foreign> with three <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">polla/</foreign>—rulers, auxiliaries, farmers and artisans, or,
            if rulers and auxiliaries are classed together as guardians, then with two. Plato's
            object throughout this episode is to keep the whole city ‘one’ by
            preventing <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of its constituent factors, viz. the guardians,
            from becoming ‘many.’ If the guardians are united—so he
            holds—no danger to the city's unity need be apprehended from the others (465

            and it indues Our other healthful members ev'n to that sense Of pain.” Plato
            goes farther, and represents the partnership as extending also to the soul: see next

            organization, viz. that of the ruling power in the partnership’ etc. Plato's
            language is precise, but difficult. I take <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >h(—yuxh/n</foreign> as defining the <foreign xml:lang="greek">koinwni/a. kata\
              to\ sw=ma</foreign> is written rather than <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou=
            sw/matos</foreign>, because the partnership is not only a partnership of body with soul,
            but also a partnership of the different parts of body with one another. <foreign

              >tetame/nh</foreign>. A <foreign xml:lang="greek">su/ntacis</foreign> is the ordered

            refer, not to the soul, but to the whole <foreign xml:lang="greek">su/ntacis</foreign> or

            or rulers (see on II 374 D), as it appears to do here and in 466 A. The following
            explanations may be suggested. (1) Plato intends the community of wives and children to
            extend only to the Auxiliaries, and not also to the Guardians. This view is taken by
            Blaschke (<hi rend="italic">Familienu. Gütergem. d. Pl. St.</hi> p. 10), who
            asserts that the Rulers proper have already past the limits of age prescribed for
            matrimony. In point of fact, however, a man may become a <foreign xml:lang="greek">te/leos
              fu/lac</foreign> at 50 (VII 540 A, B), whereas he can marry till he is 55 (460 E). (2)
            As by far the largest number of husbands would be only Auxiliaries, Plato speaks
            somewhat loosely, as if matrimonial community were confined to them. This explanation is
            possible enough in itself, but fails to explain the usage in 466 A. (3) <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)pi/kouroi</foreign> is used with the new and deeper meaning given to it
            in 463 B (where see note), ‘helpers of the people,’ rather than in
            its original and technical sense of the rulers' auxiliaries. This suits all the
            passages, and is in my judgment what Plato intended. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >e)pi/kouros</foreign> is not the only term whose connotation deepens as the
              <title>Republic</title> proceeds: cf. II 376 B, III 392 C notes</p>
          <p>464B - 465D Domestic communism is also in harmony with the general communistic
            character of the city. It will cement the union of the guardians and so consolidate the
            State. It will also deliver us from lawsuits arising out of disputes about the family
            and property. In cases of attempted violence to the person, we shall expect a man's
            fellows to defend him. The older citizens will exercise disciplinary powers over the
            younger; reverence and fear will keep the latter from retaliating. All these
            arrangements will tend to keep the rulers at peace with one another, and, <pb n="310"/>
            if they are united, we shall not expect sedition in the rest of the State. Other minor
            advantages there are, too trivial to specify.</p>

            considerable MS authority (including II) for <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)na/gkh|</foreign>,
            and as <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pime/leian</foreign> was read by A^{1} (see cr. n.) and

              a)na/gkh| swma/twn e)pime/leian tiqe/ntes</foreign>, taking <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n
              a)na/gkh|</foreign> as meaning <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nagkai/an</foreign>; but this
            idiom is very rare except with <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)sti/, h)=n</foreign> and the
            like. Stobaeus (<title>Flor.</title> 43. 102) and Stallbaum read <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >a)na/gkhn swma/twn e)pimelei/as</foreign>. In <hi rend="italic">q</hi> and two other

              >a)na/gkh</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">swma/twn e)pimelei/as tiqe/ntes</foreign>.
            Does this mean ‘requiring them to guard against violence to the
            person’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)na/gkh| swma/twn</foreign>)? If Plato meant

            >kolakei/as</foreign> is “genitive singular in the same case as <foreign

            field shall not be dedicated in temples, least of all such armour as we take from
            Greeks, unless the God shall otherwise decree. We forbid Greek territory to be ravaged,
            or Greek houses to be burnt. The entire Hellenic race are children of one family, and
            conflicts between its members should not be called war, but civil strife. Our natural
            enemy is the Barbarian, and if we plunder Greece, we do but ravage our nurse and mother.
            Remember that our city is a Greek city. She may chastise, but will not enslave, other
            Greek States. Glauco agrees: he thinks our citizens should treat the Barbarian as Greeks
            now treat their fellowcountrymen.</p>
          <p>ff. In this episode Plato discusses the principles which are to regulate the
            international policy of his city in her dealings both with Greeks and Barbarians. The
            Greeks themselves recognised certain unwritten laws or usages (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >no/moi koinoi\ th=s *(ella/dos, no/mima tw=n *(ellh/nwn</foreign>) in matters of this
            kind, and to these Plato frequently makes allusion throughout his argument: see on 469
            E, 470 C al. Cf. Nägelsbach <title>Nachhom. Theol.</title> pp.
            300—307. The policy which Plato here prescribes for his ideal city was clearly
            intended by him to have a direct and immediate bearing on the circumstances of his own
            day; and this part of the <title>Republic</title> is in no small degree, as Jackson
            remarks, “a contribution to practical politics.” See on 470 C.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*(/ellhnas -- a)/llh|</lem></app>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">. *(/ellhnas</foreign> is the object, not, as is sometimes held,
            the subject, of <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ndrapodi/zesqai</foreign>. It rightly occupies
            the emphatic place, because the point is that Greek cities should not enslave
              <title>Greeks</title>—no one objects to their enslaving
            barbarians,—and not that <title>Greeks</title> (as opposed to barbarians)
            should not enslave Greek cities. Cf. the order in 471 A <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)d'
              a)/ra th\n *(ella/da *(/ellhnes o)/ntes kerou=sin</foreign>. A further reason for
            taking this view is that <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(ellhni/das po/leis</foreign> points the
            allusion to Plato's city, which is a <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(ellhni\s po/lis</foreign>

            easy and natural only if <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(ellhni/das po/leis</foreign> is treated

            sold into slavery on the destruction of their city by war (Blümner

              (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 202) <pb n="321"/> asserts that Plato expressly
            recognises slavery in his State. It is clear from the present section that Plato does
            not impugn the principle of slavery, so long as the slaves are of barbarian origin; but
            he nowhere says that his perfect city is actually to contain slaves, nor is it easy to
            see what there would be for them to do, unless they were employed to work under the

            points of Plato's Panhellenism are two—internally, the Delphic oracle (IV 427
            B, C notes), and externally, hostility with Persia: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Menex. 245C"

            mind,” says Bosanquet, “that Greek civilisation was to Plato much
            what white civilisation is to us.” This is, in part at least, true; but
            sentiments of chivalry and romance were far more powerful factors in fostering the
            ancestral feud with Persia than any apprehensions for the safety of Greek civilisation.
            The idea of a war against Persia always stirred the pulse of Hellas with a sense of
            continuity with the heroic past; and it was more than a meaningless ceremony when
            Agesilaus sacrificed at Aulis, and Alexander visited Achilles' tomb. See Grote IX p. 81
            and XI pp. 395—397. None the less, in spite of his emphatic expression of the
            old Greek policy of splendid isolation, it is difficult to overestimate the effect of
            Plato's writings, and especially of the <title>Republic</title>, in breaking down the
            barrier between Barbarian and Greek. See on 470 E.</p>

            hopefully, as if his perfect city were but one Greek city among many— a living
            example to the brotherhood of Hellas. It may be admitted that the city of
            II—IV has not a few claims to be called Hellenic. But the ‘third
            city’— that of the philosopher-king—is not Hellenic, nor
            even, in any proper sense, an earthly city at all: it is an ideal, an ensample in the
            heavens — <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n ou)ranw=| para/deigma tw=| boulome/nw|
              o(ra=n kai\ o(rw=nti e(auto\n katoiki/zein</foreign> (IX 592 B). The animating spirit
            of V 473 B—VII is assuredly not Hellenic exclusiveness, but the enthusiasm of
            humanity, if by ‘humanity’ we understand (with Plato) the divine
            element in man, in virtue of which we are most distinctively and truly human. See on VI
            501 B, IX 589 D. In a certain sense it is even true that Platonism is the
            “strongest protest ever raised against pre-Christian hellenism”
            (Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> p. 33). But Plato's is no barren protest; for his city
            foreshadows the future while it passes judgment on the past. Cf. VI 499 C note and IX

            Stud.</title> pp. 37—39) supposes that Plato wrote this passage in 374, when
            Plataea was destroyed by Thebes, and the surviving inhabitants fled to Athens (<bibl

            ‘abstract justice’ rather than merely ‘justice apart from

            is perfectly just if he should come into existence, and what his character would be if

              rend="italic">si</hi> fieri et existere talis posset.” We must beware of
            translating ‘num existeret’ (Stallbaum): for it is just in order to
            shew the irrelevancy of the question, ‘Can such a man exist?’ that
            Plato wrote this sentence. Madvig omits <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai/</foreign> before
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(=os</foreign>. In that case <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)
              ge/noito</foreign> goes with the following clause (cf. IV 419 A note), and the meaning
            is: ‘if he <hi rend="italic">should</hi> come into existence, what his
            character would be when he did.’ By this means we obtain an exact parallel
            between <foreign xml:lang="greek">dikaiosu/nhn oi(=o/n &lt;*&gt;sti</foreign> and
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/ndra—oi(=os a)\n ei)/h</foreign>. It must be
            admitted, I think, that the emendation is an improvement: but the MS reading may stand.
            Campbell needlessly questions <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei) ge/noito</foreign>, thinking it

            everywhere less true than language or theory. One great, yet possible change, and only
            one, is needed, and it is this. ‘Philosophers’ must become kings or

            of social and political administration if any real progress is to take place in

            political power and knowledge of the good; it can only be cured by effecting their
            reconciliation. In the <title>Politicus</title> Plato's remedy is to make the
            philosopher (who is the true king) act through the statesman (305 C ff.: cf. Nohle
              <title>Die Statslehre Platos</title> pp. 82, 88, whose interpretation
            is—wrongly, as I think—questioned by Zeller^{4} II 1, p. 901 note

            and the philosopher is himself a statesman. Whether even then he would be strong enough

            explanation removes the difficulty. As regards the sentiment, it <pb n="331"/> should be
            noted that Plato refuses to sanction the exclusive pursuit of knowledge as well as of
            politics. He holds “that a specialised study of merely abstract questions
            unfits a man for the true grasp of life and character which is the centre of real
            philosophy” (Bosanquet), and on this ground he would probably have condemned
            the one-sided enthusiasm which many persons now profess for what is usually called by
            them ‘research.’ Cf. VI 497 A note and 499 B.</p>

          <p>474C - 480A The philosopher, as analogy proves, is one who loves not a part of
            knowledge, but the whole. His passion is for Truth, and Truth means the Ideas. The Ideas
            are each of them One, but they appear many by union with particular things and one
            another. Lovers of sights and sounds and such like persons believe only in the many
            beautifuls; they cannot understand the One. Like dreamers, they mistake the copy for the
            original. Their condition of mind may be described as Opinion, that of the philosophers
            as Knowledge.</p>
          <p><title>Let us proceed to prove this statement. The object of Knowledge</title>
              ‘<hi rend="italic">is</hi>’<hi rend="italic">; that of
            Ignorance</hi> ‘<hi rend="italic">is not.</hi>’ <title>If therefore
              anything both</title> ‘<hi rend="italic">is</hi>’ <hi
              rend="italic">and</hi> ‘<hi rend="italic">is not</hi>,’ <hi
              rend="italic">it must lie between Being and not-Being, and the faculty which cognizes
              it will be something between Knowledge and Ignorance.</hi></p>
          <p>‘<title>Powers</title>’ <hi rend="italic">differ from one another
              according to the objects over which they preside, and the effects which they produce.
              The</hi> ‘<hi rend="italic">power</hi>’ <hi rend="italic">called
              Knowledge presides over Being, and produces the act of knowing. It is therefore
              different from the</hi> ‘<hi rend="italic">power</hi>’ <hi
              rend="italic">called Opinion, whose result is opining. What then is the object over
              which Opinion presides? We have seen that it is not Being; neither is it not-Being.
              Therefore Opinion is different both from Knowledge and from Ignorance. It is, in fact,
              something between Knowledge and Ignorance, less luminous than the one, more luminous
              than the other. Its object will therefore be that which both</hi> ‘<hi
              rend="italic">is</hi>’ <hi rend="italic">and</hi> ‘<hi
              rend="italic">is not.</hi>’</p>
          <p><title>Now it is just the many beautifuls etc. which both are and are not. There is not
              one of them which</title> ‘<hi rend="italic">is</hi>’ <hi
              rend="italic">more than it</hi> ‘<hi rend="italic">is not</hi>’
              <hi rend="italic">that which we say it is. We are therefore justified in saying that
              the many beautifuls etc. lie between Being and notBeing. Thus we have discovered the
              object of Opinion.</hi></p>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italic">We conclude that those who have eyes for the many beautifuls etc.,
              opine; while those who see the Beautiful itself, know. The former are lovers of
              Opinion, the latter lovers of Knowledge or philosophers.</hi>

            on a psychological basis and was the expression of a moral rather than of an

            most part in its ethical sense (II 376 B note). Now that he is about to leave psychology

            appearance of the Theory of ‘Ideas’ properly so called in the
              <title>Republic.</title> It should be carefully noted that Plato is not attempting to
            prove the theory: Glauco, in fact, admits it from the first. The Theory was approached
            from two directions, from the side of Mind or Thought (<foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( lo/goi
              oi( e)k tw=n e)pisthmw=n</foreign> Arist. <title>Met.</title> 19. 990^{b} 12), and
            from the side of Existence (<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ e(\n e)pi\ pollw=n</foreign> l.c.
            Cf. Zeller^{4} II 1, pp. 652 ff.). It is the first of these methods which is followed
            throughout the present investigation. The <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> provide
            objects for Knowledge, as opposed to Opinion, and they are capable of being known: see
            476 C, E ff., 478 A, 479 E. Throughout a large part of the following discussion, we are
            not much concerned with the Ideas as strictly transcendent entities or <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">xwrista/</foreign>, existing apart not only from particulars but also
            from the knowing Mind, for it is only in so far as he knows the Ideas that the
            philosopher-king can make use of them (cf. VI 484 C, D): he cannot possibly frame
            political institutions on the model of Ideas which he does not know. We must admit that
            the philosopher's apprehension of the Ideas is the relevant consideration here (cf. VI
            484 C <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)narge\s e)n th=| yuxh=| e)/xontes para/deigma</foreign>),
            but it is none the less true, and the fact cannot be too strongly insisted on, that the
            Ideas themselves are not mere concepts of the mind, but have a separate and independent
            existence of their own. See the Appendix to Book VII ‘<hi rend="italic">On
              Plato's Dialectic.</hi>’ The translation ‘Class’ for
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)=dos</foreign> (Jowett) is inappropriate on many grounds:
            ‘Form’ is better: but it will be most convenient to retain the usual
              <pb n="336"/> expression ‘Idea,’ although it is not a translation,
            but a transliteration, whose unfortunate identity with the English word
            ‘idea’ is responsible in no small measure for many imperfect and
            erroneous interpretations of Plato's Ideal Theory. The German translators mostly render
            by ‘Begriff.’ The further specifications of the Ideal Theory in this
            passage are as follows. Each Idea is, in and by itself, one (476 A), changeless (479 A,
            479 E), and perfect (VI 484 C, D), contrasting, in each of these respects, with the
            phenomena which ‘partake’ of or ‘imitate’ it
            (476 D note). Plato does not now touch on the question how it is that Mind has knowledge
            of a perfection above and beyond what can be derived from observation and experience.
            This faculty of Mind is elsewhere—in the <title>Meno</title> and the
              <title>Phaedo</title>—explained by the pre-existence of the Soul. See on 476
            C.</p>
          <p>Krohn has pointed out (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 96) that the examples of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> now cited by Plato are all of them
              attributes—<foreign xml:lang="greek">di/kaion, a)/dikon, a)gaqo/n,
            kako/n</foreign>, etc. It does not however follow from this that the theory of Ideas is
            still in process of formation: on the contrary, the appeal to Glauco just above (475 E)
            implies that it was already a recognised dogma of the Platonic school. The simple
            explanation is that Plato prefers to cite relevant examples. The <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ei)/dh</foreign> of <foreign xml:lang="greek">di/kaion, a)gaqo/n, kalo/n</foreign> etc.
            are precisely those which it is the philosopher's duty to introduce into the practical
            administration of the State: cf. VI 484 C and X 596 A note</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">au)to\ me\n ktl.</lem></app>: ‘each is, in
            itself’ (i.e. viewed apart from its association with <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >pra/ceis</foreign> etc.), ‘one, but by reason of their partnership with
            actions and bodies and one another, they each of them make their appearance everywhere
            and appear many.’ The <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei(=dos</foreign> of Beautiful,
            for example, <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, in itself, one, but by <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >koinwni/a</foreign> with e.g. an act of heroism, a sunset, a river, etc., it <hi

            of Beautiful <hi rend="italic">appears</hi> many by <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >koinwni/a</foreign> with other <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign>, as when we say
            ‘the Good is beautiful,’ the ‘Useful is
            beautiful’ etc. The expression <foreign xml:lang="greek">pantaxou=
            fantazo/mena</foreign> is better suited to describe Ideas allied with sensible
            particulars, than Ideas allied with Ideas; but statements involving the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">koinwni/a</foreign> of Ideas with Ideas ‘make their appearance
            everywhere’ as well as those which connect the objects of sense with Ideas. In
            all such cases the statements themselves are of course true or false according as the

            false or true, the appearance of <hi rend="italic">plurality</hi> which they give to the

              (<title>Antisthenica</title> p. 42) supposes that Plato means Antisthenes. There was

            Urban <hi rend="italic">Ueber die Erwähnungen der Phil. d. Antisthenes in d.
              Pl. Schr.</hi> (Königsberg 1882), and Zeller^{4} II 1, p. 296 note 2.
            Antisthenes was in particular a bitter opponent of the Theory of Ideas. The passage of
            arms between Plato and him is well known: <foreign xml:lang="greek">w)= *pla/twn, i(/ppon

            quoted by Urban l.c. p. 3). It is no doubt true, as Stein observes in his
              <title>Geschichte des Platonismus</title>, that Plato's “Kunst
            verallgemeinert nicht bloss das Historische, sondern individualisiert auch das
            Allgemeine”; but Antisthenes himself could scarcely deny that the cap fits.
            The deictic <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(=tos</foreign> is in favour of Dümmler's
            view, which certainly adds point to the whole passage; note in particular <foreign

            perhaps to the ferocity of his opponent: Antisthenes had nicknamed Plato <foreign

            refer to Antisthenes alone; he merely individualizes the type in him.</p>

            categoric affirmative is much more to the point. For the error see
            <title>Introd.</title> § 5. Hartman hastily pronounces <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ou)/t' a)mfo/tera ou)/te ou)de/teron</foreign> spurious on the ground that
            “illas res <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)de/teron</foreign> esse modo (<foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ou)/te ei)=nai—noh=sai</foreign>) dictum est,” and
            that “non verum est illas res non esse <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >a)mfo/tera</foreign>.” The text is perfectly sound. Phenomena, says Glauco,
            cannot be ‘fixedly conceived of’ as either a being or b not being,
            nor yet as c neither of the two. The fourth alternative is to ‘fix them in the
            mind’ as d both being and not being. This too is impossible, although we may
              <hi rend="italic">say</hi> that they ‘both are and are not’ (477
            A, 478 D). The reason is that they are not, in the last analysis, ‘both being
            and notbeing,’ but something between the two, as Socrates presently points
            out. (See also on <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(=on</foreign> in 478 D.) Phenomena cannot be
            fixedly conceived (<foreign xml:lang="greek">pagi/ws noh=sai</foreign>) in any kind of way,
            because they <hi rend="italic">have</hi> no fixity themselves. They are in a constant
            state of Heraclitean flux: cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">kulindei=tai, planhto/n</foreign>

            and not simply <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ polla\ kala/</foreign>) prepares us for VI 484
            C, where the whole purpose of this enquiry is disclosed. It is the business of the

            >kala/</foreign> the plural of ‘<hi rend="italic">the</hi>
            beautiful,’ or of ‘<hi rend="italic">a</hi> beautiful’?
            This question is raised by Bosanquet, who answers it thus: “the sentence about
            formulae leads me to interpret it in the former sense=‘many
            standards,’ or cases accepted as standards, ‘of
            beauty.’” Cf. 479 A, where however we have <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >polla\ ta\ kala/</foreign>, and its antithesis <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(\n to\
            kalo/n</foreign>. The expression <foreign xml:lang="greek">polla\ kala/</foreign> must, I
            think, be taken in its usual sense, as the plural of <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalo/n
            ti</foreign>; but it includes not only the objects of sense, but also <foreign

            this (according to Teichmüller <title>Lit. Fehd.</title> I p. 103) Plato here

            Dümmler, on the other hand, supposes that Antisthenes is meant, as before (see
            on 476 D). I can see no sufficient reason for holding that Plato is here thinking

            The mistaken notion (held by Stallbaum) that the word must be transitive induced

              >diecelqou=si</foreign>, a conjecture repeated also by Richards. Baiter (after Hermann

            (found in a few MSS) is favoured by Stallbaum, and suggested as an alternative also by
            Herwerden, as if <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ makrou= tino\s</foreign> could mean
            ‘at some length.’ The first hand in <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >*c</foreign> omits <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia/</foreign>, but it occurs in all the other
            MSS. None of these expedients is nearly so good as the reading of the best MSS, if

          <p>485A - 487A The philosophic nature loves eternal and changeless Being in its entirety.
            It follows that the philosopher naturally loves Truth, despises the pleasures of the
            body, is temperate, free from avarice, high-minded, courageous, just and gentle. He is
            also quick to learn, retentive in memory, not given to extravagance in conduct, but
            modest and well-bred. To such men, when years and education have perfected their natural
            qualities, we may fairly entrust our city.</p>
          <p>ff. This section should be compared on the one hand with II 375 A— 376 C, 377
            B—III 391 E, and on the other with VII 535 A, B notes In Book II the natural
            qualities insisted on were primarily moral; here and in VII they are primarily
            intellectual. This is in harmony with the difference between the earlier and later
            schemes of education: for the basis of the first was <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)rqh\
            do/ca</foreign>, whereas that of the second is <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >e)pisth/mh</foreign>. There is little or no indication to shew that even the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a)/rxontes</foreign> of I—IV knew or aspired to the Ideas (see
            497 C note) and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi/kouroi</foreign> certainly did not. Krohn
            is, in a certain sense, right when he maintains that in VI—VII we have
            “einen neuen Archontenstand und eine neue Archontendisciplin”
              (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 107), but the distinction of the
            ‘golden’ and ‘silver’ races in III 415 A ff.
            prepares us for a more thorough-going discrimination between the two higher classes than
            was attempted in the earlier sketch, and we must of course remember that the new
            discipline is not intended to supersede, but to supervene upon the old. See also Hirzel

            actually deny that steering can be taught at all. They overpower the master of the

            occurred already in 488 C. For these reasons I now agree with Schneider and others that

            no—that they think it impossible to acquire, and therewithal the art of
            steering.’ The true pilot, according to Plato, is one who knows <hi
              rend="italic">how</hi> to steer. Whether others wish him to steer or no, is wholly
            irrelevant; see <bibl n="Plat. Plt. 293A"><title>Pol.</title> 293 A</bibl> ff., where
            this principle is declared to be of universal application, and illustrated as follows
            from the case of doctors: <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)atrou\s de\ ou)x h(/kista

            and <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ e(ko/ntwn kai\ a)ko/ntwn</foreign> in these two passages,
            the general drift of which is the same as Plato's argument throughout this part of the
              <title>Republic</title>, exactly correspond to <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)a/n te/ tines
              bou/lwntai e)a/n te mh/</foreign>, and enable us to interpret that clause, as
            Schneider has already pointed out. Cf. also 296 E— 297 B. Plato, indeed, is
            ready to go farther still, and would maintain that he who knows how to steer is a true
            pilot, even although he does not touch the helm (cf. ibid. 292 E). If others wish for
            his services, it is their business to apply to him, not his to sue for the opportunity
            of doing them a service (infra 489 B, C). A like principle holds good in the government
            of cities, and the Platonic Socrates, though abstaining from political life, may fairly
            claim <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pixeirei=n th=| w(s a)lhqw=s politikh=| te/xnh| kai\
              pra/ttein ta\ politika\ mo/nos tw=n nu=n</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 521D"
                ><title>Gorg.</title> 521 D</bibl>). The foolish sailors, on the other hand, desire
            only to get the <pb n="12"/> helm into their hands (488 C): how to handle it, they know
            not, and deny that it is possible to learn (<foreign xml:lang="greek">mh/te
              te/xnhn— labei=n</foreign>). What of <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(/ma kai\ th\n
              kubernhtikh/n</foreign>? These words should be taken closely with what goes before.
            The literal translation is (to acquire) ‘at once and the art of
            steering’: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 22D"><title>Phil.</title> 22 D</bibl>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( bi/os ou(=tos ge/gonen ai(reto\s a(/ma kai\ a)gaqo/s</foreign>
            ‘this life is at once choiceworthy and good.’ Now ‘to
            acquire at once the art of how to steer (<foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/pws kubernh/sei,
              tou/tou te/xnhn</foreign>) and the art of steering’ is merely a way of
            saying ‘to acquire the art of how to steer and therewith the art of
            steering.’ He who learns the art and study of how to steer necessarily learns
            therewith the art of steering (“quarum qui compos factus sit, simul
            gubernatoriam artem teneat” Schneider): for <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >kubernhtikh/</foreign> is, according to Plato, simply and solely the art of <hi
              rend="italic">how</hi> to steer. <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n kubernhtikh/n</foreign>,
            in short, is nothing but the <foreign xml:lang="greek">te/xnh</foreign> and <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">mele/th tou/tou o(/pws kubernh/sei</foreign>, expressed from Plato's
            point of view. Thus in denying that it is possible to learn either <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >te/xnh</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">mele/th</foreign> of <hi rend="italic"
            >how</hi> to steer, the sailors are in effect emphatically denying that it is possible
            to learn <foreign xml:lang="greek">kubernhtikh/</foreign> in Plato's sense of the word at
            all: cf. 488 B <foreign xml:lang="greek">fa/skontes mhde\ didakto\n ei)=nai</foreign>. So
            much for the meaning of this passage as a whole. In regard to details, it should be
            noted that <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/pws</foreign> means ‘how’:
              ‘<foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/pws</foreign> ad <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >tou/tou</foreign> spectans modum et rationem potius quam finem significat’
            (after Schneider). With Schneider also I understand <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >kubernh/sei</foreign> as ‘shall steer’ and not ‘shall get
            possession of the helm.’ <foreign xml:lang="greek">mele/th</foreign> is
            ‘study’ (in the more concrete sense of the word), rather than actual
            exercise or practice: cf. III 402 B <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/sti th=s au)th=s te/xnhs te

          <p>The above explanation agrees in the main with that of Schneider, and is in my opinion

            (<title>Rhet.</title> II 16. 1391^{a} 8 ff.), Simonides. Being asked on one occasion by
            Hiero's queen whether it was better to be a man of genius (<foreign xml:lang="greek"

            (It should be remembered that <foreign xml:lang="greek">sofo/s</foreign> often means
            ‘poet’.) There is no reason for supposing (with e.g.
            Teichmüller <title>Lit. Fehd.</title> I p. 102) that Plato attributed the
            saying to Aristippus, although a witticism on the subject is ascribed both to him (D. L.
            II 8. 69) and to Antisthenes (Winckelmann <title>Antisth. Frag.</title> p. 58). Plato
            liked to get his knife into Simonides: see I 331 E ff.</p>

          <p>489C - 491A So much for the ‘uselessness’ of the philosopher. But
            the most serious prejudice from which Philosophy suffers is owing to those who pretend
            to be philosophers when they are not. It is they who are meant, when people assert that
            the majority of philosophers are depraved. Let us endeavour to shew that Philosophy is
            not responsible for the corruption of the philosophic nature. The true philosopher, in
            spite of popular misconceptions, is, as we have seen, naturally a lover of Truth, and
            therefore possesses all the virtues of character already named. We have to enquire (1)
            how this disposition becomes in many cases depraved and (2) what is the character of the
            false philosophers who are responsible for the prejudice against Philosophy.</p>

            Plato has to explain.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">pleio/nwn</lem></app> is much more elegant than Madvig's
            conjecture <foreign xml:lang="greek">plei=on</foreign>. Plato's position on this matter, in
            the way in which he states it, is open to objection. It might be argued that the
            naturally <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> nature is the best fitted to resist the
            corrupting influences of its environment. But the philosophic nature is remarkable for
            sensibility as well as strength, and the sensitive plant needs careful fostering. The
            general sentiment of this passage is Socratic, as Hermann (<title>Gesch. u.
            System</title> p. 330 note 33) and Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 365) have pointed

            correctly explains the passage. Cf. generally Dante <title>Inferno</title> VI

            towards saving and improving strong and gifted natures: cf. VII 519 A, B. Weak natures
            may be almost neglected, without serious injury to the State. They will never do
            anything great—whether good or evil: see 495 B. For this and other reasons

            corruption; the Sophists are only the mouthpiece of a disgraceful public opinion which
            it is their profession to flatter and court (493 A—D). But from Plato's point
            of view this is itself a sufficiently grave indictment to bring against a professional
            teacher of Morality (see 493 C), so that the present attack on the Athenian people is

            nothing but the common passage of a relative into a main sentence (see II 357 B note and

            it would be the height of folly in a teacher even to attempt to make a young man run
            counter to public opinion. The present sentence explains why. There is not, never has
            been, and never will be produced a character different (from the Many) in respect of
            virtue, by having been educated on principles opposed to the education which the Many
            provide (the force of public sentiment, expressed in assemblies etc.). Consequently
            every attempt to produce such a character by means of education in the teeth of public
            opinion is foredoomed to failure. The statement appears at first sight extraordinary;
            but from Plato's point of view it is, with the limitations which he makes, strictly
            correct. Cities are either actual or ideal. In the ideal city, education does not
            produce a type of character which conflicts with public opinion, because public opinion
            is itself formed by education. In actual cities, education must conform to the same
            standard if it is to exist at all: for <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n mh\ peiqo/menon

              xml:lang="greek">qei=oi a)/ndres</foreign>, saved from corruption by grace of God: see on
            493 A. In these circumstances, what is the political reformer to do? He must break with
            all existing cities (497 B), and found—as Plato now wishes to do—a
            new commonwealth in which sound education and public opinion no longer differ, but
            agree. In other words, his policy must be to make the Philosopher King. For other views

            II p. 367, and also by Blaydes on Ar. l.c. Two explanations of it were given. According
            to the first, which is adopted by the Scholiast on this passage, the phrase originated
            in the treatment meted out by Diomede to Odysseus, when they were returning from Ilium
            to the Greek camp after stealing the Palladium. Odysseus attempted to kill Diomede, but
            failed, and Diomede paid him out by tying his arms together and driving him home with
            blows from the flat of his sword. The Scholiast on Ar. l.c. explains differently.

            ‘scientific ruler,’ and bring back true prosperity to Athens. A tone
            of sorrow for the ‘lost leader’ seems to make itself felt in Plato's
            words.</p>

            that Plato has in view Antisthenes and the Cynic Diogenes, the latter of whom apparently
            started life as a moneychanger (D. L. VI 20). But the description which follows applies
            to sophists and sophistical rhetoricians rather than to the Cynic philosophers. The poet
            Gray says “this seems to be aimed at Protagoras, who was an ordinary
            countryman and a woodcutter” (see Gellius <title>Noct. Att.</title> V 3 and
            other authorities cited by Frei <title>Quaest. Prot.</title> pp. 6 ff.). Hermann
              (<title>Gesch. u. Syst.</title> p.628) cites Euthydemus and Dionysodorus as cases in
            point (cf. 496 A note). Each of these sophists had formerly taught the art of fighting
            in full armour (<bibl n="Plat. Euthyd. 271C"><title>Euthyd.</title> 271
            C</bibl>— 272 B, 273 E). As speech-writing and rhetoric generally were counted
            among the arts, we may think also of Isocrates, who loved above everything to call
            himself a <foreign xml:lang="greek">filo/sofos</foreign> (<title>Antid.</title> 271 ff.).
            But although these and other examples may be quoted in illustration of what Plato here
            says, the tone of the whole passage shews that Plato is describing a familiar phenomenon
            of his own times, when clever and ambitious young men were in the habit of forsaking
            their handicrafts and devoting themselves to ‘culture.’ Cf. <bibl
              n="Plat. Prot. 318E"><title>Prot.</title> 318 E</bibl>

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)fie/menoi ktl.</lem></app> is an anacoluthon. The
            natural flow of the sentence is interrupted by the question <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)\
              ou)k a)na/gkh;</foreign> which is intended to obtain Adeimantus' assent to <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ta\s yuxa\s—tugxa/nousin</foreign>. On resuming, Plato
            interposes a comparison, and to this the general idea which forms the logical predicate
            to <foreign xml:lang="greek">polloi/</foreign> is accommodated in <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >poi=) a)/tta—fau=la</foreign>. The sentence was thus understood by the
            editor of <hi rend="italic">q</hi>; for <foreign xml:lang="greek">tugxa/nousin</foreign>,
            which seems a difficulty on this theory, is in <hi rend="italic">q</hi>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">tugxa/nontes</foreign>. But <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >tugxa/nontes</foreign> would be extremely inelegant; and Plato writes <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">tugxa/nousin</foreign> to correspond to <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >lelw/bhntai</foreign>. Even in other cases a finite verb sometimes replaces a
            participle in the second of two contrasted clauses, e.g. <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 21E"
                ><title>Ap.</title> 21 E</bibl>. J. and C. explain the passage in nearly the same
            way, as well as (apparently) Schneider and Stallbaum. It is impossible for many reasons
            to connect <foreign xml:lang="greek">tugxa/nousin</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >e)fie/menoi</foreign> and so escape the anacoluthon. I formerly suspected the text,
            and proposed <foreign xml:lang="greek">&lt;a)po&gt; tugxa/nousin</foreign>
            (‘miss the mark,’ i.e. fail to win the distinction which they
            covet). Another solution might be to place the troublesome <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >tugxa/nousin</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="greek">polloi/</foreign>. But neither
            change is in any degree probable; and it is better to acquiesce in the reading of the
            MSS. Plato's anacolutha are a device for imparting life and reality to his dialogues. A
            careful translation should preserve them all.</p>

            quoting in support Hdt. II 165—167). “Sedentary and within-door
            arts,” says Bacon (quoted by Newman <title>Politics of Aristotle</title> I p.

            alone. As usual, he individualises the type, and if the resultant picture resembles
            Isocrates, so much the worse for him. Plato would not be sorry (cf.

            36—40), and doubtless intended his readers to think of Isocrates, as they

          <p>496A - 497A The few who, from various reasons, remain faithful to philosophy, withdraw
            from political life. By so doing, they keep themselves unspotted from the
            world—no mean achievement, yet not the greatest. If they meet with a
            commonwealth appropriate to them, they will themselves attain a larger growth, as well
            as prove the saviours of their country.</p>

            instances in view? Steinhart (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 208) thinks of Anaxagoras,
            and even of Plato himself. But it cannot be said that either of them was saved by exile
            from deserting Philosophy, and Plato was hardly exiled, even metaphorically speaking.
            Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 117, 384) declares for Xenophon. It is however more
            than doubtful, even after Boeckh's attempt to overthrow the tradition about
            unfriendliness between Xenophon and Plato (<title>De simultate quam Pl. c. Xen.
              exercuisse fertur</title> 1811), whether Plato would have gone out of his way to pay a
            compliment to his fellow-disciple. Can Plato be thinking of his friend Dio? If so, this
            passage must have been written in or after 367 B.C., the year of Dio's banishment from
            Syracuse. A personal reference is easily combined with the description of a class, and a
            tribute to Dio would be very pleasing here. I have lately found the same conjecture in

            Phaedo of Elis, and Simon the Athenian, both of whom were members of the Socratic circle
            (Steinhart l.c. p. 208). The latter (whose very existence has been denied by some recent
            critics, but—as Hirzel <title>Der Dialog</title> pp. 102 ff.
            shews—on wholly inadequate grounds) was once a shoemaker (D. L. II 122). We
            may also in some respects compare the architect-philosopher Hippodamus of Miletus: see

            Zeller^{4} II 1, p. 52 note 1 thinks Plato may have had Socrates himself in view, but

            Greek literature too seldom recognises that physical weakness may be combined with
            mental and moral strength: see III 406 C note Plutarch (<hi rend="italic">de tuenda san.

            really was, is a question which different writers have answered differently, according
            to their different points of view: see Zeller^{4} II 1 pp. 75—91. The subject
            is treated with great fulness in Ribbing's <title>Socrat. Stud.</title> II pp. 1 ff. and

            vouchsafed to others in the future. Schneider conjectures that Plato added this
            limitation with a view to himself—an unlikely supposition, although no doubt
            the present passage is in some measure intended as a defence of Plato's abstention from
            political life: cf. 496 D note</p>

            Athens</title> IV 3 “The commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)/agrioi</foreign>, to which he alludes in <bibl
              n="Plat. Prot. 327D"><title>Prot.</title> 327 D</bibl>. In Pherecrates' play the

            Athens: see Kock's <title>Com. Graec. Fr.</title> I pp. 146—150. Plato points
            out that there are savages enough at home. In <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa=sin

              >koniortou=—ferome/nou</foreign> is of course a descriptive genitive

            proposal is supported by any of the ancient citations, except that of Themistius
              (<title>Or.</title> VIII p. 104 C) whose reproduction of this passage is in other
            respects, as in this, extremely inaccurate: see Schneider's note. And <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">za/lh koniortou=</foreign> is, to say the least, a questionable phrase.
            It is not well to mar the wonderful force and beauty of writing such as this by
            tasteless and inept conjectures. The passage has often been compared with Lucretius'
            “Suave mari magno,” but the difference is greater than the
            resemblance. The Platonic philosopher is content (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >a)gapa=|</foreign>), if he can keep his own soul pure, because he cannot, as things now
            are, save both himself and others. But it is no pleasure for him to see
            “quibus ipse malis careat,” for he would fain help others if they
            would but let him. That they will not is a misfortune, not for others only, but for him
              (<foreign xml:lang="greek">au)to/s te ma=llon au)ch/setai ktl.</foreign>). We seem to
            catch in Plato's words a certain tone of sorrow, as if he had not himself attained the
            highest of which he was capable, because he could not find a philosophic city in which
            to dwell: see Morgenstern <title>De Plat. rep.</title> p. 161, where reference is made

            and his confession is most true. In one passage (IV 429 C note), indeed, he seems
            expressly to imply that the Rulers do not fill the legislator's shoes. But there are
            also some hints or traces of the later view: see on III 414 A, IV 423 E (to which,

          <p>498C - 502C Adimantus hardly expects the reasoning of Socrates to carry conviction to
            most of his hearers. But Socrates will not despair, believing that his words may perhaps
            bear fruit hereafter, if not here. As for the Multitude, their dissent is easily
            explained. They have heard enough of jingling rhetoric, but they have never yet seen a
            Philosopher-king, nor are they accustomed to discourses whose only aim is truth. Our
            perfect city is realised always and everywhere, wheresoever and whensoever Philosophy
            sits on the throne. The Multitude will assent, if we approach them rightly; for their
            hatred is against the false philosophers, and not against the true. The lover of Truth
            is absorbed in contemplation of the changeless Realities, on the model of which he will
            frame human institutions, should he be called upon to enter public life. Point this out
            to the Many, and reason with them, and they will agree. Our proposals, though difficult,

            doubt but that this was meant as a compliment and incitement to the younger Dionysius
            (see Plato <title>Epist.</title> 7, p. 327). And I understand what follows p. 502 in the
            same manner. Hence it seems that this part of the dialogue was written after his first
            voyage to Sicily, and probably not long before his second, about Ol. 101, 3, when the
            elder Dionysius was just dead” (Thomas Gray <title>Works</title> ed. Gosse IV
            p. 251). In the parallel passage V 473 D Plato speaks of kings and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >duna/stai</foreign>, but not yet of kings' sons. The substance of Gray's conjecture
            is confirmed by recent criticism (see e.g. Hirmer <title>Entst. u. Kompos.</title> etc.

            and Plato's second visit to Sicily seems to have taken place just after the old tyrant's

            insurmountable; since a <foreign xml:lang="greek">qei/a tis tu/xh</foreign> (IX 592 A) may

            throughout inorganic and organic nature and the animal world, and culminating in the
            life of man.” It is better to let Plato soar where we cannot follow him than
            thus to clip his wings. See the Appendix to Book VII <hi rend="italic">On Plato's

            most manlike when he most resembles God: and (as Tennyson says) “then most
            godlike being most a man.” Cf. IX 589 D note This sure and abiding conviction
            of the presence of a divine element within us, rendering our nature essentially and
            truly human, makes itself felt in nearly all the dialogues of Plato. It is the ultimate
            source of all his idealism, religious and metaphysical, no less than moral and
            political, and may well be considered the most precious and enduring inheritance which
            he has bequeathed to posterity.</p>

            begin to see the intimate relation between the two subjects. In V 450 C Socrates for the

            etc. ‘possible?’ The same question reappears in 471 C, but with a
            larger scope ‘Is the perfect city possible as a whole?’ The reply is

            arriving at the Virtues as inadequate and incomplete. Our guardians must travel by a
            longer road, if they would reach their proper goal, i.e. the highest of all studies,
            which is something above and beyond even the virtues. And these very virtues must no
            longer be seen merely in outline; they must be studied in all their fulness and
            perfection. The highest study is the Idea of the Good, as Glauco has often heard before.
            It is the knowledge of this Idea which alone renders all other knowledge useful and
            profitable.</p>

            circuit’ is the educational training necessary in order to enable the
            guardians to obtain scientific knowledge of the virtues by discerning their relation
            with the Idea of Good: cf. 506 A. In Book IV Justice, Temperance etc. were regarded as
            psychological qualities or relations; but the philosophic Guardians must learn their
            metaphysical import. Throughout the rest of VI and VII Plato, in short, discards
            Psychology for Metaphysics. Thus much is clear; but many difficult and interesting
            questions arise in connexion with this passage, as Krohn and others have pointed out.
            The <foreign xml:lang="greek">makrote/ra peri/odos</foreign> mentioned in IV 435 D appears
            to be a longer way of determining, not the essential nature of the virtues, but whether
            Soul has ‘parts’ or not. (A <pb n="49"/> solution of this difficulty
            is suggested on 435 D). Socrates' shorter road, again, is not a way by which the
            Guardians are to go, but a method employed by himself in studying primarily the Soul,
            and secondarily the virtues. Finally, what is the relation between the psychological
            conception of Virtue and the metaphysical? And does the metaphysical conception involve
            a revised psychology or not? The last question is touched on in the notes to X 611 B,
            where Plato himself appears to raise it. For the last but one see on 504 D.</p>

            found in Zeller^{4} II 1. pp. 709 ff., 718 note 1. In addition to Stumpf's treatise to
            be presently named, I have found the monograph by Biehl <title>Die Idee des Guten bei
              Platon</title> Graz 1870 particularly good and useful. Other special treatises are
            also referred to in the course of the notes. The majority of interpreters are now agreed
            in identifying Plato's Idea of the Good with his philosophical conception of the Deity.
            The best and fullest proof of the identity is still, I think, Stumpf's exhaustive
            dissertation <hi rend="italic">Das Verhältniss des Platonischen Gottes zur Idee
              des Guten</hi> Halle 1869. There is only one passage in his works where Plato himself
            appears expressly to identify the two, viz. <bibl n="Plat. Phileb. 22C"
              ><title>Phil.</title> 22 C</bibl>, but on the principle that things which are equal to
            the same thing are equal to one another, the identification is complete, and I have
            therefore thought myself at liberty throughout the notes occasionally to illustrate
            Plato's metaphysics by his theology.</p>

          <p>505B - 506A What then is the Good? The majority answer ‘Pleasure,’
            others, who are more refined, ‘Knowledge.’ Neither of these views is
            tenable. Men are constantly disputing about the Good, but its existence is practically
            admitted by all, for it is the ultimate object of all endeavour. The Idea of the Good
            must be known by our Guardians; for unless they know the connexion between the Good, and
            particular instances of the just, the honourable etc., they cannot guard the latter, or

            that every historian of Philosophy regards this passage as the <hi rend="italic">locus

            <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)gaqo/n</foreign> p. 15) thinks of the <title>Philebus</title>;
            Susemihl (<title>Gen. Entw.</title> II p. 193) of the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >*filo/sofos</foreign>, which was perhaps planned, but probably never executed (see on
            484 A). The <title>Philebus</title> is unsuitable; and of the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >*filo/sofos</foreign> we know nothing. I am inclined to think—in view
            especially of <foreign xml:lang="greek">bouloi/mhn a)\n ktl.</foreign> below—that,
            although Plato may have cherished the idea of describing the Good without the aid of a

            au)tw=n</foreign>—, he never, at all events in any of his dialogues, did so.
            In a certain sense, perhaps, the <title>Timaeus</title> describes the Good (see
            Archer-Hind's edition p. 27), but even there, we study the ‘Father of
            all’ not in himself so much as in his works. I agree with Stumpf's conclusion
            (l.c. p. 75) that Plato could hardly have depicted the Idea of Good at all except by
            means of a comparison. Certainly nothing else could have made it equally clear; and, in
            point of fact, ‘es wird nirgends Mehr gegeben’ (Stumpf, l.c. p. 59

          <p>508B - 509A So much for our similitude. The interpretation is as follows. The offspring

            that of the Good to Thought (<foreign xml:lang="greek">nou=s</foreign>) and the objects of
            Thought. The analogue of Light is Truth; as we cannot see without Light, so, where Truth
            is absent, we cannot know. The Idea of the Good is the source of Truth and Knowledge,
            although itself apprehended by Knowledge. As Light and Sight resemble the Sun, so Truth
            and Knowledge resemble the Good, but the Good is not identical with either, for it

            are involved: <figure/></p>
          <p>With regard to (2), Light has been variously interpreted as symbolizing the Idea of
            Good (Plotinus, as appears from XXIII 4), Reason (Steinhart, <title>Einleitung</title>
            pp. 212 ff.), and the Ideas (Susemihl <title>Gen. Entw.</title> II pp. 195 ff.). But the
            chiasmus in 508 E, 509 A (<foreign xml:lang="greek">&lt;*&gt;pisth/mhn—
              o)/yin</foreign>) clearly establishes equation (2) as well as (6), and the entire
            simile is plunged in confusion if Light is equated with anything except Truth. Cf.
            Stumpf l.c. p. 60 notes and Biehl l.c. pp. 50—53. Plato means that as Light,
            coming from the Sun, enables colours to be seen, and the faculty of Sight to see, so
            Truth (or rather Trueness, as Bosanquet remarks), coming from the Good, enables the
            Ideas to be known, and the faculty of <foreign xml:lang="greek">nou=s</foreign> to know. It
            should be carefully noted that Truth (or its source, the Idea of Good) is not yet
            regarded as creating, but only as actualizing the faculty of Reason. The conception of
            the Good as the ultimate cause of all Existence follows later (509 B ff.): here it is
            represented only as the cause of Knowledge. See also on 490 B, 508 D (<foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o(/tan me\n ktl.</foreign>). If we would grasp the full significance of
            Plato's comparison, we must not be content with the merely philosophical interpretation
            of Light, but remember also the many poetical and religious associations which attached
            themselves to such words as <foreign xml:lang="greek">fw=s</foreign> and <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">fe/ggos</foreign>, especially in the Mysteries: see Neil on <bibl
              n="Aristoph. Kn. 1319">Ar. <title>Knights</title> 1319</bibl>, Mommsen <title>Feste d.

              Mysteries upon Christian usages</title> in his <title>Hibbert Lectures</title> pp.
            283—309. The prominent position occupied by Light in the half-religious,
            half-philosophical teaching of Plotinus (see Zeller^{3} III 2 pp. 498 f., 500 note 2,
            616 al.) may to a large extent be attributed to the elaboration and expansion of the
            mystical elements involved in Plato's simile, the whole of which, together with the
            similes of the Line and the Cave, is of the greatest importance for the history of
            Neoplatonism. Cf. also 508 A, B notes</p>

            over-subtle distinction between <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)=nai</foreign> and <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign>, holding that although the Good is not <foreign

            >o)/n</foreign> (cf. VII 518 C). Others have suspected the text, O. Schneider, for

            <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)gaqo/n</foreign> p. 16). That the text is right, the balance
            with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou) ge/nesin—o)/nta</foreign> conclusively shews.
            The Sun, said Socrates, is the cause of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ge/nesis</foreign>, though
            not himself <foreign xml:lang="greek">ge/nesis</foreign>. Just so the Good is the cause of
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign>, though not itself <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ou)si/a</foreign>, but (to use a Neoplatonic expression) <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >u(perou/sios</foreign>. Plato's meaning is as follows. The Sun is not <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ge/nesis</foreign> in the sense in which the objects which he produces
            are <foreign xml:lang="greek">gigno/mena</foreign>. Yet in a certain sense he too is
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ge/nesis</foreign>, for he is <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >o(rato/s</foreign>: see VII 529 C ff. and <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 28B"><title>Tim.</title>
              28 B</bibl>. (Bosanquet cannot be right in denying that Plato regards the Sun as a
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">gigno/menon</foreign>). As the cause of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ge/nesis</foreign>, we may, in fact, regard the Sun as the only true <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ge/nesis</foreign>, for all <foreign xml:lang="greek">gigno/mena</foreign>
            are derived from him. Similarly the Good is not <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign>
            in the sense in which the Ideas are <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)si/ai</foreign>; but in a
            higher sense it is the only true <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign>, for all
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)si/ai</foreign> are only specific determinations of the Good.
            The <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(perousio/ths</foreign> of the Good is merely Plato's way of
            saying that the first Principle of all existence must itself be underived. See on

            and Fouillée l.c. II pp. 105—111, where the matter is very clearly
            explained. The doctrine of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(perousio/ths</foreign> of the
            Highest afterwards became a cardinal point with the Neoplatonists: see Plotinus ap.

            whole attitude that he finds the true keystone of the Universe—the ultimate
            fountain from which both Knowledge and Existence flow—in no cold and
            colourless ontological abstraction, like Being, but in that for which <foreign

          <p>509C - 511E Socrates, at Glauco's <pb n="63"/> request, now proceeds to expound the
            similitude more fully. Let us take a line, and divide it into two unequal parts, to
            represent the objects of Sight and the objects of Thought respectively. If we further
            subdivide each part in the ratio of the original sections, we shall have four segments,
            representing, in order of clearness, (1) Images and the like, (2) so-called real things,
            (3) the objects of that intellectual method which descends from assumptions to a
            conclusion, using sensible objects as images or illustrations, (4) the objects of that
            intellectual method, which ascends from assumptions to an unassumed first principle,
            without making use of any sensible illustrations whatsoever, and thereafter descends to
            a conclusion. The third section represents the subjects investigated by the so-called
            ‘Arts’ or mathematical sciences; the fourth is the sphere of
            Dialectic. The corresponding mental states are called by Socrates <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ei)kasi/a, pi/stis, dia/noia</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">no/hsis</foreign>.

            be no doubt that Plato <hi rend="italic">more suo</hi> is merely scoffing at a

            but there should be no question that Plato wrote <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            elaborate proportions drawn in 510 A, 511 E, VII 534 A represent no corresponding
            relations between the different segments of the line. The inequality, as Schneider and
            Steinhart point out, is intended to represent the difference in <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            the <foreign xml:lang="greek">nohto/n</foreign> should be represented by a longer segment.
            Others assign the larger part to the <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(rato/n</foreign>, as being
            the region of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ polla/</foreign> (Plutarch l.c. and Espinas in

            primary and fundamental principle of Plato's classification. The relevant consideration
            is not at present multiplicity <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> unity, but different
            degrees of clearness and truth. Beckman's excision of <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/nisa

            Towards this the Dialectician travels, starting from <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >u(poqe/seis</foreign>. He may begin, for example, by ‘assuming’ the
            ‘just.’ In such a case he assumes that his definition of
            ‘just’ is correct, i.e. corresponds exactly to the Idea of
            ‘Just.’ But whereas the arithmetician treats his <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">u(po/qesis</foreign> as an ultimate truth, and proceeds deductively to a
            conclusion, making use of sensible images by way of illustration, the dialectician
            treats his hypothesis as purely provisional, testing, revising, rejecting (VII 533 C
            note), and reconstructing, and gradually ascending step by step to the first principle
            of all (<foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n tou= panto\s a)rxh/n</foreign>), without employing
            any sensible objects to illustrate his reasoning. The one gives no account of his
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(po/qesis</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)de/na
              lo/gon—fanerw=n</foreign> in C below); the other not only does, but must do
            so, just because he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a dialectician: cf. VII 533 C ff. He
            connects his <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(poqe/seis</foreign> with others, subsuming them
            under higher and yet higher —better and truer—<foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >u(poqe/seis</foreign>, until at last he has traversed the whole region of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">nohta/</foreign>. Such of his <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(poqe/seis</foreign>
            as survive will be improved at each stage in the ascent, and finally, as soon as the
            Idea of Good is reached, all his surviving <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(poqe/seis</foreign>
            will actually have become perfect counterparts of the Ideas which they have hitherto
            been only <hi rend="italic">assumed</hi> to represent. In the meantime the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a)rxh\ tou= panto/s</foreign>, which Plato himself described dogmatically
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">di) ei)ko/nos</foreign> in 507 A—509 C, will have
            ceased to be a mere <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(po/qesis</foreign>: it will have become, in
            the fullest sense of the term, an <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)rxh\ a)nupo/qetos</foreign>:
            for the highest rung of the ladder is not reached until the entire domain of the
            knowable has been exhausted, and shewn to be the expression of the Idea of Good. Plato's
            ideal—it is no more—is a comprehensive and purely intellectual view
            of the totality of <foreign xml:lang="greek">nohta/</foreign>, in which every department is
            seen in its connexion with every other, and all in their dependence on the Good, which
            is in itself <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nupo/qetos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">dianoi/a|</foreign> (511 A), and we then see that Plato is here
            speaking of the <hi rend="italic">mathematical</hi> square. The singular <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">tou= tetragw/nou</foreign> is generic (cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(
              sofisth/s</foreign> for the whole class of Sophists), for there are many
            ‘mathematical’ squares, diagonals etc. (VII 526 A note and App. I to
            Book VII). It is conceivably for this reason that Plato drops the article with <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">diame/trou</foreign> (‘a diagonal itself’), thereby
            also getting a more precise antithesis to <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ll' ou)
            tau/ths</foreign>, or else (if this suggestion is hypercritical) <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >diame/trou</foreign> is also generic. Sidgwick is, I think, mistaken when he says
              (<title>J. Ph.</title> II p. 103) that the language of this passage “in no
            way supports the interpolation of intermediates (Aristotle's <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\
              metacu/</foreign>) between particulars and Ideas”: for <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >dianoou/menoi</foreign> involves <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia/noia</foreign>, and since
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia/noia</foreign> is intermediate between <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >nou=s</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">do/ca</foreign> (511 D), we may reasonably
            suppose that its objects are likewise intermediate <pb n="69"/> between the higher

            Dialectic dispense with all sensible images or illustrations? Plato (it should be
            remembered) holds that the intrusion of any element of sense-perception, however small,
            impedes the exercise of thought: see <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 79C"><title>Phaed.</title> 79

            These <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(poqe/seis</foreign> it is the province of Dialectic to

              <title>Republic</title> to classify Ideas in such an ascending scale as he here
            suggests, though it is probable from 509 A that Knowledge and Truth would rank near to
            the Good. Nor is there any dialogue in which an exhaustive classification is even
            attempted. Such hints as Plato gives us throughout his writings are enumerated in Stumpf
              <hi rend="italic">das Verhältniss</hi> etc. pp. 50, 56, 76, and in Zeller^{4}
            II 1, pp. 704—707: cf. also Fouillée <title>La Philosophie de
              Platon</title> II pp. 99—104. We must suppose that each higher Idea will
            excel all the lower both in range and in excellence. These two characteristics are, from
            Plato's point of view, the same. The wider an Idea is in range and extension, the
            greater will be the sum of existences of which it is the cause. But the Idea of Good is
            the cause of all existence, so that each higher Idea will be better than all below it,
            because it contains more of <pb n="71"/> Good. Beyond this it is perhaps safer not to
            go. A systematic attempt to correlate all intelligibles among themselves and in their
            connexion with the Good would have been premature in Plato's day, and is premature
            still. The permanent value of Plato's conception lies in the ideal which it sets before
            every succeeding generation of investigators.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">pa/lin au)= ktl.</lem></app> The dialectician's progress

              th\n teleuth/n</foreign> (cf. Aristotle quoted on 510 B). By the time that he reaches

            become exact counterparts of the Ideas which are their objective correlates; the others
            have all of them been demolished (VII 533 C note). The conclusions (<foreign

              (<foreign xml:lang="greek">safh/neia</foreign>) to <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >ei)kasi/a</foreign>. We may regard it as the normal condition of the average uneducated

            >ei)kasi/a</foreign> must be similarly confined in its scope, and loses all metaphysical
            interest and importance: see VII 517 A note But since the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ei)ko/nes</foreign> are a lower grade of <foreign xml:lang="greek">docasta/</foreign>
            (510 A note), <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)kasi/a</foreign> should be understood as a lower
            variety of <foreign xml:lang="greek">do/ca</foreign> (as in VII 534 A), viz. the state of
            mind which accepts as true that which is a copy of a copy (<foreign xml:lang="greek">tri/ton
              pro\s a)lh/qeian</foreign>). In this sense <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)kasi/a</foreign>
            (with a play on <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)ko/nes</foreign>) is a new coinage of Plato's.
            The translation ‘conjecture’ is misleading, for conjecture implies
            conscious doubt or hesitation, and doubt is foreign to <foreign xml:lang="greek"

          <p>514A - 517A The following comparison represents our nature in respect of education and
            the absence thereof. Let us imagine a number of prisoners confined in a subterranean
            cave, and unable to see anything except shadows of images and other such objects, cast
            by the light of a fire. Such men will believe that shadows of manufactured things are
            the only truth. If they are released, and led up step by step towards the light, they
            will turn and flee back into the cave; but if we compel them to emerge, they will
            gradually grow accustomed to the brightness, and be able to gaze upon the Sun and
            understand his sovereignty in the domain of visible things. Pity for their former
            friends will then begin to mingle with joy at their own escape. Should they redescend
            into their former place, the darkness will at first affect their vision, and expose them
            to the laughter of the others, who will, it may be, lay hands upon their deliverer and
            slay him.</p>
          <p>ff. The simile of the Cave presents us with a picture of the life of the uneducated man
              (<foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n h(mete/ran fu/sin paidei/as te pe/ri kai\
            a)paideusi/as</foreign> 514 A: cf. also 515 A). From this point of view it should be
            compared with <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 172C"><title>Theaet.</title> 172 C</bibl>
            —177 C, and (in spite of the different situation) with <bibl
              n="Plat. Phaedo 109A"><title>Phaed.</title> 109 A</bibl>—E, where the
            equation is:—Depths of Ocean : Hollows of Earth=Hollows of Earth : The true
            Earth. Plato bids us connect the Cave with the Line (517 A), and does so himself (l.c.,
            and 532 C). We have seen that the lower segment of the line (<title>AC</title>) is
            spoken of sometimes as <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(rato/n</foreign>, sometimes as <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">docasto/n</foreign> (VI 510 B note). Plato does not even now distinguish
            between the two terms; and since the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)pai/deutos</foreign> is
            concerned with <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ docasto/n</foreign> in general rather than with
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ o(rato/n</foreign> exclusively, we shall best apprehend
            Plato's meaning if we interpret the simile by the following proportion:—Cave :

            <hi rend="italic">s.</hi>

              u(po/stegon</foreign> 31 ed. Karsten), and similar expressions occur in the Orphic
            verses e.g. <foreign xml:lang="greek">tau=ta path\r poi/hse kata\ spe/os

            note There is however nothing to shew that Plato borrowed the underlying idea, much less
            the details, of his simile from any previous writer: for the metaphorical application of
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/nw, u(yo/qen</foreign> and kindred words in connexion with
            true <foreign xml:lang="greek">paidei/a</foreign> is a favourite usage of Plato's (cf. <bibl
              n="Plat. Theaet. 175B"><title>Theaet.</title> 175 B</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Soph. 216C"

              ><title>Phaed.</title> 109 A</bibl> ff.), and the simile might easily have been
            elaborated from such a metaphor. For a strikingly eloquent imitation see Cic. <hi
              rend="italic">de nat. deor.</hi> II 95 (translated from Aristotle: see
            <title>Frag.</title> 14. 1476^{a} 34 ff.). With the life of the cave-dwellers Bosanquet
            aptly compares the account of uncivilized humanity in <bibl n="Aesch. PB 447">Aesch.
                <title>Prom.</title> 447</bibl>—453. A kindred though not identical figure
            is employed in Fitzgerald's Omar Khayya/m LXVIII: “We are no other than a

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)napeptame/nhn ktl.</lem></app> Herwerden suspects
            corruption, on the ground that the cave is dark, except for the light of the fire. But
            unless the <hi rend="italic">entrance</hi> to the cave is open to the light of day, how
            are the prisoners ever to emerge, as they ultimately do (515 E)? The <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ei)/sodos</foreign> is long (<foreign xml:lang="greek">makra/</foreign>) and
            steep (515 E), so that the daylight cannot reach the cave in any case. Prantl is right,
            I think, in understanding <foreign xml:lang="greek">makra/n</foreign> of <hi rend="italic"
              >length</hi> and not width, although Schneider and the English translators apparently

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">par' a(/pan to\ sph/laion</lem></app> should (I believe)
            be taken separately from <foreign xml:lang="greek">makra/n</foreign>. The words define the
              <hi rend="italic">width</hi> of the entrance, which is ‘along the whole
            of,’ i.e. ‘as wide as,’ the cave. The reason will appear
            later: see on <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/ra toi/nun</foreign> 514 B. The translation
            “extending along the entire length of the cavern” (D. and V.) seems
            to render <foreign xml:lang="greek">makra/n</foreign> altogether otiose. See Fig. ii on p.

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/nein</foreign> is not, I believe, used absolutely in the
            sense of <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/nein au)tou=</foreign>, which is the meaning required
            here. It might be possible to understand <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/nein</foreign> as
            equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/nein a)kinh/tous</foreign>, in view of <bibl
              n="Plat. Crat. 426E"><title>Crat.</title> 426 E</bibl> and <bibl
              n="Plat. Phaedrus 261D"><title>Phaedr.</title> 261 D</bibl>, but ‘remain
            motionless’ is not quite suitable in point of sense. Still less does the
            possible rendering ‘remain by themselves’ fit the situation. On the
            other hand <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/nein te au)tou=</foreign> ‘remain where
            they are,’ ‘remain in one place’ (cf. I 327 C, II 371 C),
            corresponds exactly to <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n desmoi=s ta\ ske/lh</foreign>, just as
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/s te to\ pro/sqen mo/non o(ra=n</foreign> echoes <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)n desmoi=s tou\s au)xe/nas</foreign>. The <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >te—te</foreign> after <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\—kai/</foreign>
            suggests that Plato intended this correspondence. There is nothing to be said for
            Herwerden's proposal to insert <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)kinh/tous</foreign>.</p>

            and it is unnecessarily harsh to construe the adverb with the noun. The fact that verbal

            translate, the spectators. <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( a)/nqrwpoi</foreign> could not,
            without further specification, stand for the spectators, and no further specification is
            given. But Jowett and Campbell are, I think, in error when they distinguish between the

            The low wall which crosses the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/sodos</foreign> at a point
            between the prisoners and the fire intercepts the shadows of the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >parafe/rontes</foreign>: but the <foreign xml:lang="greek">skeu/h</foreign> which they
            carry, presumably on their heads, overtop the wall, and are reflected on the wall of the
            cave in front of the prisoners. See Fig. ii on p. 65. Plato adopts various devices in
            order to suggest a due proportion between the objects inside and outside the cave in
            point of reality. Thus (1) the typical examples <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >a)ndria/ntes</foreign> etc. are themselves images of the natural objects of the
            superior <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(rato/n</foreign>: (2) the originals of the Cave are all
            (except the prisoners themselves 515 A) <foreign xml:lang="greek">skeuasta/</foreign>,
            whereas those of the superior <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(rato/n</foreign> are
            —primarily speaking—<foreign xml:lang="greek">futeuta/</foreign> (for
            the significance of this see 532 C note): (3) the contents of the Cave, both originals
            and shadows, may be regarded as less luminous and true than the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >o(rata/</foreign> outside, because they derive their light and truth, not from the
            Sun, but from an artificial Fire (see also on 517 C). The interpretation of the simile
            is to be sought in the <foreign xml:lang="greek">docasto/n</foreign> generally as well as in
            the <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(rato/n</foreign> in particular (see on 517 A), but we need
            not suppose that every detail is significant. Comparisons have been made between the
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">parafe/rontes</foreign> and (in the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >o(rato/n</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">dai/mones</foreign> (Campbell II p. 16,
            comparing <title>Tim.</title> 43), or (in the <foreign xml:lang="greek">docasto/n</foreign>)
            Sophists etc. (Shorey, <title>Idea of Good</title> etc. p. 238). The latter analogy is
            the more fruitful, but neither of them is altogether free from difficulty, and Plato may
            have intended the <foreign xml:lang="greek">parafe/rontes</foreign> only as part of the
            machinery of his similitude. If the Cave is to represent the world of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ta\ polla/</foreign>, it must have a semblance of life and motion; and
            without the <foreign xml:lang="greek">parafe/rontes</foreign> the shadows would be
            motionless and dead.</p>

            <foreign xml:lang="greek">pario/nta</foreign> which they see. For example, they call the

            knowing it, naming, not, as they suppose, the shadow, but the substance. J. and C.
            remark that “<foreign xml:lang="greek">pario/nta</foreign> is rather confusing as
            it might signify either the shadows” (cf. 516 C) “or the

            <foreign xml:lang="greek"> fu/sei</foreign> has been variously interpreted as follows. (1)
              ‘<foreign xml:lang="greek">fu/sei</foreign> est revera’ (Ast,
            Stallbaum): (2) ‘si res et natura ferret,’ ‘in the course
            of nature’ (Schneider, J. and C., D. and V.): (3) ‘<foreign
              xml:lang="greek">fu/sei</foreign>, no one knows how’ (Nettleship <title>Lect.
              and Rem.</title> II p. 260). None of these explanations is either linguistically easy
            or altogether suitable in point of meaning. It should be remembered that the condition
            of the prisoners, shut out as they are from light and truth amid the darkness of the
            Cave, is ‘unnatural’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">para\ fu/sin</foreign>)
            in the Platonic sense of the word (see IV 443 B note). Their release is therefore a
            return to their true nature, and may for this reason be described as
            ‘natural.’ This, I think, is what Plato means to suggest by <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">fu/sei</foreign>. It is true, as we are presently told (515 E <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">bi/a|</foreign>), that force has to be employed in order to drag the
            prisoners on high; but their deliverance is none the less ‘natural’
            in Plato's way of thinking. Schleiermacher and Herwerden wish to read <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">oi(/a tis a)\n ei)/h fu/sei, ei) toia/de ktl.</foreign> The fact that
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)</foreign> was omitted by A^{1}, and is absent from five
            other MSS, may appear to favour this conjecture. We might suppose that <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ei)</foreign> fell out by <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(moiote/leuton</foreign>
            after <foreign xml:lang="greek">fu/sei</foreign>, disappeared altogether from several MSS,
            and was wrongly replaced in A. (The evidence of <foreign xml:lang="greek">*p</foreign> is
            unfortunately wanting here.) But on this view it is difficult to see what <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">fu/sei</foreign> adds to <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(/a tis a)\n
            ei)/h</foreign>, and for this and other reasons I prefer the solution which I have

            Plato is thinking chiefly of the empirical politician and political adviser, who
            foretells the future from the present and the past (cf. Thuc. I 22), but limits his
            intellectual horizon by his own experience, and knows nothing of the real determining
            causes of events. The vast majority of Athenian statesmen belonged in Plato's opinion to
            this category: see on V 473 C and VI 488 B.</p>

              >a)poktinnu/nai a)/n</foreign> appears to be possible, and the immediate juxtaposition
            of the two forms of the infinitive is also in itself suspicious. A few inferior MSS read
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)poktenei=n</foreign> for the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >a)poktei/nein</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)=</foreign> for the <foreign

            a)poktei/neian</foreign> (Ast), (2) <foreign xml:lang="greek">labei=n, kai\ a)poktei/noien

              a)poktei/neian a)/n</foreign> (Baiter). The correction in the text appears to me not
            only easier, but more in harmony with Plato's fulness of expression. I suppose that the
            error arose thus. A scribe accidentally omitted <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >a)poktinnu/nai</foreign>, and the infinitive was wrongly replaced after, instead of
            before, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)poktei/neian</foreign>. This would give <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">labei=n kai\ a)poktei/neian, a)poktinnu/nai a)/n</foreign>, from which
            the change is inevitable to the text of A.</p>
          <p>517A - 518B The simile of the Cave should be connected with the Line. The Cave is the
            visible world, the fire is the Sun, and the prisoners' journey towards the light
            resembles the ascent of the soul into the intelligible sphere, in which the Idea of Good
            reigns supreme. We need not wonder that the philosopher is unwilling to leave the light
            of thought for the darkness of practical affairs, or that he is dazed and confused when
            he does.</p>

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)pai/deutos</foreign>, of whose condition the Cave is an
            allegory, does not contemplate exclusively or even principally natural shadows of
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">futeuta/</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">skeuasta/</foreign>
            (cf. VI 511 E note). Nor do the other comparisons exhaust the significance of the Cave
            as an allegory of <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)paideusi/a</foreign>. In order fully to
            apprehend its meaning, we must regard the lower section of the line as <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">docasto/n</foreign> in the sense of V 475 E ff. Plato himself does so:
            see VI 510 A note The shadows and originals within the cave will then symbolise <foreign

          <p>518B - 521B It follows that Education is not a way of putting knowledge into empty
            souls, but a revolution of the Reason or organ of Knowledge, whose gaze must be directed
            upon Being and the brightest part thereof, which is the Good. The entire soul turns
            round along with Reason in this revolution. Other virtues are secondary and
            adventitious, but Reason never loses its power, and works weal or woe, according as it
            is or is not converted by means of Education. The best natures in our city, after they
            have ascended to the Good, must rejoin the prisoners whom they have left. To force them
            thus to redescend, may seem unjust; but Law seeks to make the whole city prosperous
            rather than a single class. And indeed it is also just that they should thus repay their
            country for having reared and educated them. They will themselves admit the force of our
            demands, and take their turn in the work of government, not eagerly, but as a necessity.
            We have seen that a well governed city is impossible unless a life better than that of
            ruling is open to its rulers, and the life of true philosophy is better.</p>
          <p>ff. Nothing that Plato has bequeathed to us is more valuable than his theory of
            education as developed in this part of the <title>Republic</title>, and there is
            probably nothing in the whole range of educational literature, ancient or modern, which
            takes so far-reaching and profound a view of the aim and scope of education, or is so
            well fitted to inspire the teacher with indomitable courage and inextinguishable hope.

            and that the sculptor brings it to light by cutting away the encumbrances by which the
            ‘human face divine’ is concealed. In like manner, according to
            Plato, it is the business of the teacher to prune the soul of his pupil of those
            unnatural excrescences and incrustations which hide its true nature (519 A, B note),
            until the human <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> divine (VI 501 B note) stands out in all its
            pristine grace and purity. It should carefully be noted that in Plato's theory of
            education the entire soul is involved (<foreign xml:lang="greek">cu\n o(/lh| th=|

            a moral no less than an intellectual revolution. The moral discipline of Books

            interpretation is, I believe, correct. Plato began by asserting that Education is not
            what certain Sophists declare it to be—the putting of sight, as it were, into
            blind eyes. For there is already in every man's soul an eye or <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >o)/rganon</foreign>, which sees or learns already; what is required is to turn this
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)/rganon</foreign> round. Hence he concludes (<foreign
              xml:lang="greek">toi/nun</foreign>) Education is not (as the Sophists say) an art of
            putting sight into the soul's eye (<foreign xml:lang="greek">tou= e)mpoih=sai au)tw=| to\

              xml:lang="greek">o)/rganon</foreign> which is present in every soul from the first. The
            prevailing view since Schneider regards <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou/tou au)tou=</foreign>
            as anticipating and explained by, not as depending on, <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=s
              periagwgh=s</foreign>. This yields a tolerable sense, but makes it difficult to supply

              au)tou= th=s periagwgh=s</foreign>, and the subject of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >metastrafh/setai</foreign> as well as the antecedent of <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            can hardly (with J. and C.) suppose that the allusion is to Heracles, Pollux etc., for
            Heracles' descent to Hades was an incident which happened long before his ascent to
            Heaven; and Pollux's life among the gods was intermittent. Cf. Schneider in his
            translation p. 304 note 187. Schneider himself suggests that Plato is thinking of
            legends about e.g. Aesculapius' deliverance from Hades, after Zeus had smitten him (cf.
            III 408 C and Roscher's <title>Lexicon d. Mythologie</title> I p. 620), and others have
            thought of Briareos and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(kato/gxeiroi</foreign>: see
              <title>Il.</title> I 402—405 and cf. Hes. <title>Theog.</title>
            617—721. Mr Walter Headlam has pointed out to me that Semele was also raised
            from Hades to Heaven, citing Paus. II 31. 2 and ib. 37. 5: cf. also Plut. l.c. <foreign

            u(/steron</foreign>. These examples are certainly more to the point. It is worthy of
            remark that Justin Martyr in a remarkable passage of his <title>Apologia pro
            Christianis</title> speaks of the ascent of Asclepius and others into Heaven as Pagan
            parallels to the Christian doctrine of the Ascension: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)ihsou=n

            —a)nelqei=n</foreign> (although it appears in all MSS) might be an early
            satirical adscript by some Pagan scribe on the doctrine of our Lord's descent into Hell,
            and subsequent resurrection and ascent into Heaven. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >tines</foreign> might well be a specific allusion (518 B note), and there is more than
            a suspicion of satire in <foreign xml:lang="greek">dh/</foreign>. But I have no longer any
            doubt that the text is sound.</p>

            derived from the game of <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)straki/nda</foreign>, the authorities

            shell, black on one side, and white on the other, was thrown on the ground by one of the

              >nu\c h)\ h(me/ra</foreign>, ‘Heads or Tails,’ as he threw it.
            According as the white or black fell uppermost, one side ran away and the other gave
            chase. Plato means that education is not, like the ‘spinning of a
            coin,’ an affair of no consequence, to be settled off-hand, and by chance, but
            a slow and laborious scientific process, dealing with the gravest of all possible

          <p>523A - 524C I distinguish (says Socrates) between two classes of perceptions, those
            which stimulate the intellect, and those which do not. To the former belong all such
            sense-presentations as are selfcontradictory. We have here, for example, three fingers.
            Sight tells us that each is a finger. So far there is no contradiction and the intellect
            is not roused. But it is otherwise with size and smallness, thickness and thinness, and
            the like. The perception which reports that suchand-such a thing is hard frequently
            tells us that it is also soft, and the same, mutatis mutandis, may be said of all
            perceptions which deal with relative qualities of this kind. In such cases the soul is
            perplexed, and appeals to the intellect for help. The intellect, promptly respond- <pb
              n="109"/> ing, apprehends ‘great’ and ‘small’
            (for example) as distinct and separate from one another, unlike the senses, by which
            they were seen together and in confusion. It is thus that we are first led to ask
            ‘What is the great?’ ‘What is the small?’</p>

            point of fact, the sort of contradictory judgments which are here ascribed to the
            initial step in the psychological process, viz. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >ai)/sqhsis</foreign> (524 A), have already been attributed to <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >do/ca</foreign> in V 479 B—479 E. We have already seen that Plato

            psychological process involved in such a judgment as ‘This is a
            finger.’ The relevant consideration is that in such cases the intellect is
            not, as a rule, aroused, and this is equally true whether we regard the judgment as an
            act of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai)/sqhsis</foreign> alone or as the joint product of
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai)/sqhsis</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">mnh/mh</foreign>.

            philosophy, and runs throughout its entire history. In Plato's time the question had
            become acute in connexion particularly with the problem of predication, and it was in
            trying to solve this special form of the antinomy that Plato devised his theory of
            Ideas. Nothing could be more natural or just than that his philosopher-kings should
            receive their first scientific impulse from the problem which had proved so great an
            intellectual stimulus in the past, and which had also led Plato himself to the goal
            whither he would have his guardians arrive, the contemplation of the Idea.</p>

            describing a passage-atarms between mathematicians and some obstinate fellow who will
            not admit the indivisibility of their unit. The words ‘back again’
            in D. and V.'s translation “they multiply it back again” correspond
            to nothing in the Greek and suggest an erroneous idea; nor can the Greek mean
            “that division is regarded by them as a process of multiplication, for the
            fractions of one continue to be units” (as Jowett suggests). Each of these
            explanations misses the humour of the original. The word <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >mo/ria</foreign> is doubtless genuine, though its rejection (proposed by Herwerden)
            would improve the antithesis. Cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">mo/rio/n te e)/xon e)n e(autw=|

          <p>526C - 527C Next in order comes Plane Geometry. On its practical uses we need not
            dilate; the important question is whether it tends to turn the soul towards Being. A
            mere tiro in Geometry knows that it is not a practical art, in spite of such terms as
            ‘squaring’ etc., which the poverty of language compels it to employ.
            The object of geometrical knowledge is ever-existent Being. For this reason we shall
            prescribe the study of Geometry, a subject which is moreover practically useful and an
            excellent educational propaedeutic.</p>

          <p>527C - 528E Shall we prescribe Astronomy as our third subject? Glauco approves,
            pointing to its usefulness in practical affairs. After reproving his friend for
            advocating the Platonic curriculum chiefly on this ground, Socrates observes that the
            solid should first be studied in itself, and afterwards the solid in motion. In other
            words Stereometry should precede Astronomy. Although the problems of Stereometry are not
            yet solved, we may hope for success under proper guidance, and with the support of the
            State.</p>

            most famous stereometrical problem of Plato's time was the so-called ‘Delian
            problem’ or duplication of the cube, and it is highly probable that Plato had
            this question in his mind when he wrote the present chapter. A dramatic poet, whom
            Valckenaer supposed to be Euripides, had already made allusion to it in the lines

            application, and the students of the Academy set to work with extraordinary enthusiasm.
            A remarkable stimulus was thereby given to the study of stereometry, and the Delian
            problem was successfully solved. The anecdote may of course be apocryphal, but we have
            not the smallest reason for rejecting it. The memory of such incidents is usually
            cherished with peculiar care in the history of a College, and Eratosthenes
            (276—194 B.C.) was born only seventy-one years after Plato's death. In any
            case the duplication of the cube may well have seemed in Plato's time a question of the
            first importance for the purposes of stereometrical science, for, as Tannery remarks
            (l.c. p. 256), the duplication of the square, which had already been discovered (<bibl
              n="Plat. Meno 82B"><title>Men.</title> 82 B</bibl> ff.), was believed to be the key to
            plane problems, and so it was probably surmised that the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >diplasiasmo\s tou= ku/bou</foreign> would give the solution of a whole series of
            solid problems. English readers will find a short account of this classical <foreign

            the Py<pb n="123"/> thagoreans, Anaxagoras and Democritus (Blass l.c. p. 21, Tannery
            l.c. X p. 524), not to speak of Hippocrates of Chios, who had concerned himself in the
            fifth century B.C. with the question of the duplication of the cube (Allman <title>Gk
              Geometry</title> etc. pp. 84 ff.). He only means that its problems had not yet been

            ‘Delian problem’ in particular was definitively solved to the
            satisfaction of the Academy, is not quite clear. The tradition which ascribes a solution
            of it to Plato himself is beset with grave difficulties, as Blass (l.c. pp.
            21—30) and others have pointed out (see especially Cantor l.c. pp.
            194—202 and Sturm <title>Das Delische Problem</title> pp. 49 ff.). It is
            however universally allowed that the principle involved —the finding of
            “two mean proportionals between one straight line and another twice as
            long” (Gow <title>Gk Math.</title> p. 169) —was first stated by
            Hippocrates of Chios and well known to Plato, at all events when he wrote the

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)/pw hu(rh=sqai</foreign> that Plato did not think a final

            Plato implies that in his city this claim will be fully satisfied; and the Platonic

            Plato's picture of the <hi rend="italic">odium stereometricum</hi>, if the phrase may be
            allowed, is evidently drawn from life. He seems to speak as if he had himself an
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pista/ths</foreign> ready, and wished to secure for him public
            support in order that students might be willing to work under him. Now although <foreign

            clause, the words <hi rend="italic">may</hi>, so far as the Greek is concerned, be

            be equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s nu=n e)ge/neto e)pista/ths</foreign>. I think
            it not impossible that Plato intended his readers to suspect him <pb n="124"/> of this
            further meaning. If there is anything in this conjecture, to whom does Plato allude?
            Not, surely, to himself, although some have suspected the philosopher of blowing his own
            trumpet in a somewhat similar passage of the <title>Phaedo</title> (78 A): see
            Lutoslawski's <hi rend="italic">Plato's Logic</hi> pp. 263 f. We are told by Plutarch
              <hi rend="italic">de genio Socratis</hi> 7. 579 C that Plato referred the Delian
            deputation to Eudoxus, telling them that the problem was <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)/ toi

              *kuzikhno\n *(elikw=na suntele/sein ktl.</foreign> Now we know that Eudoxus not only
            himself achieved a solution of the Delian problem (Sturm l.c. pp. 32—37), but
            was also, in the fullest sense of the term, ‘the founder of scientific
            Stereometry’ (Günther in Müller's <title>Handbuch</title> V
            1, p. 30), and did more for the subject than any of Plato's disciples (Cantor l.c. pp.
            208—210). For these reasons I think it not unlikely that Plato has Eudoxus in
            his mind. Eudoxus and his pupils seem to have been living and working in the Academy
            along with the followers of Plato sometime between Plato's second and third visits to
            Sicily (368 B.C. and 361 B.C.: see Allman <title>Gk Geometry</title> etc. p. 178), and
            it is a pleasing and I hope pardonable conjecture—I do not claim that it is
            more—to suppose that Plato avails himself of this opportunity to pay a
            graceful compliment to his fellow-workers. See also on line 19 below and

              >u(po\ xa/ritos</foreign> conceals some complimentary allusion to a particular person.
            If so, Eudoxus may be intended (see above on 528 C). There is, it is true, a tradition
            that Plato and Eudoxus had not always been on the best of terms (Allman <title>Gk
            Geom.</title> pp. 128 f.), but during the visit of Eudoxus to Athens between 368 and 361
            B.C., they appear to have worked harmoniously and even cordially together (ib. pp. 133,
            178). See also 530 A note But we have no evidence to shew that Eudoxus bore the
            sobriquet of <foreign xml:lang="greek">xa/ris</foreign>, though his character and
            personality (see Arist. <title>Eth. Nic.</title> X 2. 1172^{b} 15 ff.), and even perhaps
            his name, deserved such a compliment. I think Plato means merely ‘through
            elegance,’ i.e. through the inherent elegance of the subject: cf. <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">to/ ge e)pi/xari kai\ diafero/ntws e)/xei</foreign>. The use of <foreign

          <p>528E - 530C Astronomy will accordingly be fourth in order, and Stereometry third. Yes,
            says Glauco; for assuredly Astronomy compels the soul to look ‘on
            high.’ On the contrary, Socrates replies, as studied at present, Astronomy
            turns the soul's eye down, though the bodily eye looks upward. True astronomy is not
            observation of the visible heavens, which are, like all things seen, imperfect and
            subject to change; it is a mathematical science, which studies the true movements of
            intelligible stars and uses the visible firmament as its orrery. We shall therefore
            pursue Astronomy by making use of problems and leave the heavens alone.</p>
          <p>ff. We have seen that the study of Stereometry, the science which deals with <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">tri/th au)/ch</foreign>, naturally follows the study of Geometry, in
            which <foreign xml:lang="greek">deute/ra au)/ch</foreign> is investigated (526 C note).
            Astronomy, like Stereometry, is still concerned with bodies of three dimensions, but in
            Astronomy we have one additional element, viz. Motion, so that the study of Astronomy,
            as Plato conceives it, is a degree more complicated than Stereometry, and forms its
            natural sequel: cf. 528 A, B. Plato's conception of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >a)riqmhtikh/</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">gewmetrikh/</foreign> would have
            commended itself in the main to the mathematicians of his day (cf. 525 D ff., 527 A),
            although they might not have accepted his view of the ontology of these sciences; but in
            the two remaining subjects of his curriculum, Astronomy and Harmonics, he consciously
            and deliberately parts company with his contemporaries (see 529 A—530 C, 530
            E—531 C). After every allowance has been made for the perfervid enthusiasm of
            Plato's style, it must be confessed that the application of the principles laid down in
            this chapter would have checked the progress of astronomical science. Both Astronomy and
            Harmonics are treated by Plato as branches of pure rather than applied mathematics; and
            in each of these sciences Plato either discredits or altogether prohibits observation.
            It must be remembered, on the other hand, that Plato's object is not to promote the
            study of physical science for its own sake, but to provide a suitable <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">propaidei/a</foreign> for those who are to crown their lives by the
            contemplation of the Idea, from which every element of sense-perception is far removed.
            The astronomy which Plato sketches in this chapter is a unique compound of poetry,
            metaphysics and mathematics. Besides the powerful appeal which it makes to the poetical
            imagination, it has a permanent value even in the <pb n="126"/> history of Astronomy as
            a passionate protest against mere empiricism, and an emphatic if exaggerated vindication
            of the theoretical side of the science. See also on 529 C, D and App. II.</p>

            ‘in respect of that, in respect of which you pursue it,’ i.e.
            ‘in the way in which you pursue it,’ no longer for its practical
            uses, as I did before (527 D), but because it leads the soul ‘on
            high,’ and from things here yonder (“from the things of this world
            to the next,” say D. and V., quite wrongly). The object of <foreign

            mete/rxei</foreign>, but astronomy. Glauco has assimilated the phraseology of Socrates
            without its meaning. ‘On high’ and ‘yonder’ mean
            to Glauco the material heavens, not the <foreign xml:lang="greek">nohto\s to/pos</foreign>:
            and he thinks the soul looks upwards if the bodily eye is turned aloft! The essence of
            Glauco's error consists in materializing the spiritual; and Plato here warns us against
            a danger which is responsible for countless errors, not only in Platonic criticism, but
            in every department of human thought and dogma. See also on 529 B, C.</p>

            So much for the relation between the different members of the sentence. In order to
            grasp the meaning of Plato, we should read the sentence aloud, letting the full stress
            of the voice fall on the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)lhqinw=n, o)/n, ou)=sa,
              a)lhqinw=|, a)lhqe/si</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">-o/nta</foreign> in <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ta\ e)no/nta fe/rei</foreign>. Each of these words is emphatic, and
            expresses that degree of Truth or Being which belongs to the mathematical realities of
            true astronomy, as opposed to the sensibles or <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai)sqhta/</foreign>
            which form the subject-matter of the astronomy which Plato has just condemned. Popular
            astronomy observes with the bodily eye the movements of visible and material planets,
            e.g. Mercury and Mars. These two planets <foreign xml:lang="greek">fora\s pro\s a)/llhla
              fe/rei</foreign> in <foreign xml:lang="greek">gigno/menos</foreign> or <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">kinhto\s a)riqmo/s</foreign>, i.e. in time (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 37C"
                ><title>Tim.</title> 37 C</bibl> ff.), Mercury, as astronomers tell us, completing
            his orbit in about three, and Mars in about twenty-three, months. In the second place,
            these planets travel in <foreign xml:lang="greek">gigno/mena</foreign> (not <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a)lhqh=</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">sxh/mata</foreign>, i.e. in
            forms or orbits which belong to the world of <foreign xml:lang="greek">gigno/mena</foreign>,
            and as they travel they carry with them the <foreign xml:lang="greek">gigno/mena</foreign>
            which they contain, Mars for example his snow-caps and canals. The Platonic astronomer,
            on the other hand, looks with the eye of <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia/noia</foreign> at the
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)lhqina\ poiki/lmata</foreign>, i.e. at the motions of true or
            mathematical stars. These mathematical stars <foreign xml:lang="greek">fora\s pro\s a)/llhla
              fe/retai e)n tw=| a)lhqinw=| a)riqmw=|</foreign>, i.e. in mathematical number, e.g. in
            3 and 23 (not three <hi rend="italic">months</hi>, etc.), and also <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >e)n a)lhqe/si sxh/masin</foreign>, i.e. in mathematical orbits, viz. the perfect
            ellipses which are imperfectly reproduced in the orbits of the visible material planets.
            Furthermore, although here perhaps our imagination may refuse to follow Plato in his
            flight, just as the visible Mars in his journey carries with him the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">gigno/mena</foreign> which he contains, so Plato represents the true
            stars of mathematical astronomy as carrying round with them <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\
              e)no/nta</foreign>, i.e. the mathematical <hi rend="italic">realities</hi> which are
            in them. The mathematical counterpart of Mars, for example, will take with it in its
            revolution those perfect mathematical forms which are imperfectly reproduced in the
            canals and snow-caps of the visible Mars. Plato in short conceives of a mathematical
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)rano/s</foreign> of which the visible heavens are but a
            blurred and imperfect expression in time and space, just as every visible and material
            triangle is only an approximation to a true or perfect, i.e. a mathematical, triangle.
            The following remark of Aristotle's is intended as an objection to Plato's theory, but,
            according to the doctrine of this part of the <title>Republic</title>, Plato would have
            accepted the criticism as containing a just and true account of the astronomy which he
            prescribes: <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/ti de\ ei)/ tis para\ ta\ ei)/dh kai\ ta\ ai)sqhta\

            speak of two particular difficulties. What does Plato mean by <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >tau=ta ta\ e)n tw=| ou)ranw=| poiki/lmata</foreign>, and by <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\
              o)\n ta/xos kai\ h( ou)=sa braduth/s</foreign>? The <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >poiki/lmata</foreign> seem to be generally identified with the stars and nothing more.
            But inasmuch as astronomy deals with <foreign xml:lang="greek">fora\ ba/qous</foreign>, and
            the ordinary astronomer, according to Plato, studies <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\s tw=n
              a)/strwn fora/s</foreign> (cf. 533 A) rather than <pb n="129"/>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/stra</foreign> themselves, it may be presumed that the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">poiki/lmata e)n tw=| ou)ranw=|</foreign> in reality denote the stars
            regarded as moving bodies, i.e., strictly speaking, the movements of the heavenly bodies
            revolving in their orbits (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 39D"><title>Tim.</title> 39 D</bibl>
            and 40 C); and the presumption becomes a certainty when we reach the words <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">tw=n a)lhqinw=n, a(\s—fe/rei</foreign>, for since the true
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">poiki/lmata</foreign> which true astronomy studies are
            identified with the movements of true stars, we are bound in like manner to suppose that
            the <foreign xml:lang="greek">gigno/mena poiki/lmata</foreign> which observational astronomy
            studies are the movements of <foreign xml:lang="greek">gigno/mena a)/stra</foreign>. Some
            may be disposed to think that <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ e)n ou)ranw=|
            poiki/lmata</foreign> refers to the intricate and complex patterns which the orbits of
            the celestial bodies weave upon the Heavens: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 39D"

            <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( poikilei/mwn nu/c</foreign> and <bibl n="Eur. Hel. 1102">Eur.

            uses it of the movements of the stars, especially as throughout this chapter he
            consistently represents the visible stars which popular astronomy investigates as
            nothing but visible or material <foreign xml:lang="greek">forai/</foreign>. I understand
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ o)\n ta/xos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( ou)=sa
              braduth/s</foreign> as the mathematical counterparts of visible stars. This
            interpretation is, I think, the only one which gives a proper sense to <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">fora/s te pro\s a)/llhla fe/retai kai\ ta\ e)no/nta fe/rei</foreign>, and
            no other solution preserves in its full and unimpaired significance the necessary
            contrast between the astronomy of observation and Plato's form of the science. The place
            which in popular astronomy is occupied by a <foreign xml:lang="greek">gigno/menon
            ta/xos</foreign>, e.g. the planet Mercury, and a <foreign xml:lang="greek">gignome/nh
              braduth/s</foreign>, e.g. the planet Mars, is in true astronomy filled by <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o)\n ta/xos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)=sa
            braduth/s</foreign>. Plato's conception of a true science of Astronomy is a remarkable
            product of his peculiar half-poetical, half-philosophical imaginative faculty, and
            differs fundamentally from the theory and practice of the science both in antiquity and
            now. But it must in fairness be allowed that if a science of astronomy could be
            constructed on Platonic principles, admitting no element of sense-perception, and
            dealing exclusively with incorporeal mathematical abstractions, it would prove a better
            prelude to the study of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)xrw/mato/s te kai\ a)sxhma/tistos

            inapposite; for, according to this passage, the visible perturbations of Uranus, which
            occasioned the search for Neptune, would not have seemed to Plato anything very
            extraordinary. Unless he is greatly exaggerating here, and I do not deny that throughout

            heavens is the mind of man. Nettleship (<title>Lect. and Rem.</title> II pp.
            271— 277) and Bosanquet (<title>Companion</title> pp. 290—293) are,
            as it seems to me, unduly anxious throughout the whole of this episode to minimise and
            explain away Plato's depreciation of the senses and their objects, although by so doing
            they can make his theories harmonize more nearly with the views of certain modern
            philosophers, and possibly also with the truth. Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> pp.
            170—174) inclines to the opposite error, although, except perhaps on verbal
            grounds, Plato would not quarrel with his definition of Platonic astronomy as
            “die Wissenschaft von den Bewegungen intelligiblen Körper.”
            Plato's Astronomy is in fact a kind of idealised Kinematics, with occasional
            illustrations from the visible movements of the heavenly bodies (<foreign xml:lang="greek"

          <p>530C - 531C Next will come the science which is sister to Astronomy, viz. Harmonics.
            For particulars we will refer to the Pythagoreans, taking care, however, to maintain our
            leading principles intact. We may ignore the good people who try to determine a minimum
            interval and unit of measurement by the ear; but the Pythagoreans are also wrong, for it
            is the numerical ratios of audible consonances which they study. They ought to ascend to
            problems and examine which numbers are consonant, which not, and why. The science of
            Harmonics is useless for our purpose if otherwise pursued.</p>
          <p>ff. With the science of Harmonics we reach the end of Plato's <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >propaidei/a</foreign>. Plato's conception of Harmonics is in all respects analogous
            to his view of Astronomy. We have seen that the visible movements of the celestial
            bodies are only imperfect copies of those mathematical movements which true Astronomy
            seeks to apprehend. In like manner, the audible movements which produce audible
            consonances are imperfect reproductions of those mathematical movements from which
            result mathematical consonances, and it is these true consonances which the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a(rmoniko/s</foreign> should study. The methods of pure mathematics are
            to be employed in Harmonics as well as in Astronomy, and observation and experiment are
            forbidden. If we criticise Plato from the standpoint of acoustical science, we must
            allow that he falls into the same error as before, but the emphasis, however
            exaggerated, which he lays on the mathematical and theoretical element in Harmonics, is
            not without importance in the history of the science; and we must remember that the
            study of Harmonics is valuable to Plato only as a preparation for Dialectic. The
            poetical affinities of the Platonic science of Harmonics are worthy of remark, though
            this chapter refrains from any allusion to them. It is altogether in harmony with
            Plato's theory to hold that ‘the solemn and divine harmonies of music, heard
            or learned,’ appeal to us so powerfully because they are one expression of
            those ‘unheard harmonies’ which are also expressed in the sister
            souls of Nature and of Man (<bibl n="Plat. Tim. 35A"><title>Tim.</title> 35 A</bibl>
            ff.), and although there is much in Browning's Abt Vogler to which Plato would demur,
            the idea which inspires that noble poem has its philosophical basis in some such theory
            as Plato here suggests.</p>
          <p>“But here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can, Existent behind
            all laws, that made them and lo they are! And I know not, if, save in this, such gift be
            allowed to man, That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star. <pb

            mix it with two in my thought; And there! ye have heard and seen: consider and bow the
            head!”</p>
          <p>It is perhaps because he believed that the Soul of the Universe no less than that of
            Man is attuned to these eternal harmonies, as well as for other reasons, that Plato
            makes his <foreign xml:lang="greek">propaidei/a</foreign> culminate in Harmonics. See also

            so the true <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(rmoniko/s</foreign> must investigate intelligible,
            and not audible, consonances. In the words of a modern writer, he must “look,
            not into the tone-world here, but into the world of harmony beyond.” Plato
            holds that certain mathematical numbers are in themselves <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >cu/mfwnoi</foreign>, and others not: see Theo 72—75, where examples of both
            varieties are given. The numbers or ratios of audible consonances are only particular
            and imperfect embodiments or expressions of these numbers: they may serve as <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">paradei/gmata</foreign>, but nothing more. In the <title>Timaeus</title>
            Plato represents the World-soul as the grandest expression of certain <foreign

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">cumfwni/a</foreign>, and say that it is ‘useful in
            seeking out the beautiful and good.’ It must nevertheless be admitted that
            Plato's conception of Harmonics as well as of Astronomy is fundamentally different from
            that of modern science, in spite of the attempts which Bosanquet and others have made to
            prove their essential harmony. See on 530 C and App. II.</p>
          <p>531C - 533D The pursuit of these studies, if carried far enough to reveal their mutual
            relationship, will contribute to the end which we desire; but after all, they are only
            the prelude to Dialectic. We may compare Dialectic to the prisoner's progress from
            looking on real animals to beholding the sun, and these preparatory studies to his
            release and ascent from shadows and images within the cave to shadows of real objects in
            the world above. Socrates declines to give an account of the method and object of
            Dialectic; but insists that the Good must be seen, and that Dialectic alone can reveal
            it, for Dialectic is the only study which ascends on the ruins of its hypotheses to the
            Idea of Good, leading the soul on high, and using the ‘Arts’ as
            handmaidens and helpers in the process of education.</p>

            would insert <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)</foreign> before <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(=o/s t'
              e)/sei</foreign>). Glauco has not without difficulty (517 C) followed Socrates thus
            far: nor is there anything rude in telling him frankly that he has reached his limit,
            and even if there were, Socrates does not spare Glauco's feelings (cf. 527 D, 529 A).
            That his audience would not be able to follow a description of the Good, has already
            been implied in VI 506 E ff. <foreign xml:lang="greek">bouloi/mhn a)/n, ei)=pon, e)me/ te

              >a)podou=nai kai\ u(ma=s komi/sasqai</foreign>. Here Socrates appears to be a trifle
            more confident of his own expository powers, though he is careful, as before, to avoid
              <pb n="139"/> the appearance of dogmatism and therefore introduces the expression
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/ ge dh/ moi fai/netai</foreign> etc. (cf. <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">tou= ge dokou=ntos e)moi/</foreign> l.c.) and <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            506 D). Krohn (Pl. St. pp. 179 ff.) bitterly complains of Socrates for drawing back; and
            Whewell (Phil. of Discovery p. 436) observes “We may venture to say that it
            does not appear that he had any answer ready.” The dialectical method
            recommended by Plato in the Republic is doubtless, in its full significance, an
            unrealised ideal (cf. nn. on <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)rxh\n a)nupo/qeton</foreign> VI 510
            B and <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou= a)nupoqe/tou</foreign> 511 B), just as the ultimate
            object of Dialectic, the Idea of Good, will still recede as we approach it. The
            description which follows merely recapitulates the account already given in Book VI,
            with a few additional characteristics already familiar in the Socratic school: but the
            majority of the Platonic dialogues furnish practical illustrations of many essential
            features in Plato's dialectical method: so that it is possible to form a tolerably clear
            idea of the kind of answer which the Platonic Socrates might have made in reply to
            Glauco's invitation. See on the whole subject App. III.</p>

            establish what he has just asserted, viz. that only dialectic can reveal the Good to
            those who are versed in the propaedeutic ‘arts’ or sciences. In this
            at least (he says) every one will agree with us, viz. ‘that it is some <hi

            <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/qodos</foreign>’ (different from the five
            propaedeutic ‘arts’) ‘which endeavours in every case to
            apprehend by scientific procedure concerning each several self’ (e.g. <foreign

            they severally <hi rend="italic">are</hi>’ (the <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            (the five propaedeutic ‘arts’) <foreign xml:lang="greek">deinoi\

            then,’ said I, ‘the method of dialectic alone proceeds by the
            destruction of hypotheses to the actual first principle, in order to make its results
            secure.’ Dialectic examines and cancels (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >a)nairei=</foreign>) one <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(po/qesis</foreign> after another, till
            in the end it reaches the Idea of Good. Suppose for example that <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >o(sio/ths</foreign> is the subject of discussion. Various <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >u(poqe/seis</foreign> are proposed, tested, and overthrown. Out of the ruins of the
            former <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(poqe/seis</foreign> we built a new and better one, which
            must in its turn be thoroughly tested, tried, and perhaps overthrown, before it can
            serve as a stepping-stone to one which is higher, truer and better: cf. 534 B, C. Now
            this process of testing, revising, discarding, is not, ideally speaking, complete until
            we examine the relations of our <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(po/qesis</foreign> of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o(sio/ths</foreign> with all <foreign xml:lang="greek">nohta/</foreign>, and
            in such an examination we apply the same ‘hypothetical method’
            throughout the whole noetic sphere, testing and correcting all our <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >u(poqe/seis</foreign> by one another. In the final stage, which is of course only an
            ideal, all our <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(poqe/seis</foreign> become exact counterparts of
            the Ideas, and we have reached the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)rxh/</foreign> or Good.
            Thereafter the results of Dialectic are <foreign xml:lang="greek">be/baia</foreign>: see VI
            511 B. The earlier steps in this dialectical ascent may be illustrated from many, if not

          <p>533E - 534E In conclusion, after pointing out the proportions between the different
            intellectual states, Socrates declares that the essential feature of Dialectic is its
            power to grasp the reason or principle of all Being, separating the Idea of Good, for
            example, from everything else, defining it in words, and scrutinizing the definition by
            tests, from each and all of which it must emerge triumphantly. Glauco agrees that such a

            agree with Shorey when he says (<title>Idea of Good</title> etc. p. 235) that Plato

            Both of these assertions are in my opinion quite wrong, and if they were true, Plato
            would have refrained from drawing out the proportions between the faculties themselves
            for exactly the same reasons. See App. I. As it is, we should take Plato at his word. He
            may well decline to enter on the tedious and unprofitable task of expounding and
            illustrating in detail the proportions which may be conjectured to obtain between the
            different objects of our intellectual powers. It would for example lead to no useful

            should translate ‘that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> those natures’

            tested by Dialectic. Great care must be taken in introducing them to this study; for
            where the character is immature and weak, dialectical debate too frequently engenders
            lawlessness, by overthrowing inherited beliefs. We shall therefore forbid such
            disputations to the young. After five years devoted solely to Dialectic, the next

            numerous examples of the <hi rend="italic">nominativus pendens</hi> are given. Plato

            is not till then that the Idea of Good is fully apprehended, so that the five years from

            of supposing that there is any break of continuity in the education of the Guardians.

            for expelling Hermodorus” (Bywater's Heracl. <title>Fr.</title> 114), but the
            parallel is not very close. Plato's <foreign xml:lang="greek">kaqarmo/s</foreign> is
            sufficiently explained by the precepts which he himself lays down in VI 501 A: see also
              <bibl n="Plat. Plt. 293D"><title>Pol.</title> 293 D</bibl> and especially

            ff. Whether the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kaqarmo/s</foreign> of the <title>Republic</title>
            is itself either possible or adequate is another matter: Grote pronounces it an <foreign

              n="Xen. Hell. 5.2.7">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> V 2. 7</bibl>) might well have regarded
            it as feasible. ‘Possible, but difficult’ is perhaps the safest
            verdict. The purgation, even if successfully applied, might not be sufficient to start
            the city well, but it would be a useful auxiliary to that “express initiative
            force, exceptional and belonging to some peculiar crisis,” which (according to
            Grote l. c.) would float the enterprise. Bosanquet raises the question how far the
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">kaqarmo/s</foreign> is seriously meant. To me it appears to be
            neither more nor less serious than Plato's treatment of the general question as to the
            possibility of his ideal city: see on VI 502 C and Hirmer <title>Entstehung u. Komp. d.

            barely considering “how the provision, which he here abruptly introduces, is
            to be reconciled with what precedes. For how are the children to be taught music and
            gymnastic when all their elders have been sent away? From what other State are the new
            teachers to be brought?” Plato is perfectly consistent. The new teachers are

          <p>543A - 545C Socrates now returns to the point at which the digression occupying Books
            V—VII began. There are, as we observed, four leading varieties of States and
            individuals, in addition to the perfect polity and perfect man. In order of merit they
            are (1) Timarchy, or the Cretan and Laconian State, (2) Oligarchy, (3) Democracy, (4)
            Tyranny. All other kinds of commonwealths, such as dynasties etc., lie somewhere between
            these primary and conspicuous varieties. Furthermore, inasmuch as the specific character
            of States is determined by that of individuals, there will be five leading types of
            individual character, embodied respectively in (1) the aristocratic, (2) the
            timarchical, (3) the oligarchical, (4) the democratical, (5) the tyrannical man. The
            first of these we have already described; but we must review the others also, in order
            that, by contrasting the best and worst, we may apprehend the relation between undiluted
            justice and undiluted injustice in respect of the happiness and misery of their
            possessors. As before, we will examine the commonwealths first, and afterwards the
            individuals.</p>
          <p>ff. The description of the philosopher and the philosophic city is at last complete,
            and the argument returns to the point at which the ‘digression’
            began, viz. V 449 A: see note ad loc. Plato has already said repeatedly, and reminds us
            yet again in 544 A, that the aim of our whole investigation was to decide <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ei) o( a)/ristos eu)daimone/statos kai\ o( ka/kistos a)qliw/tatos, h)\
              a)/llws e)/xoi</foreign> (cf. II 368 E, 369 A notes). With the character of the
            perfect man we are now familiar, but we have still to discover and describe <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">to\n ka/kiston</foreign>, in order that we may institute our comparison
            and pronounce our verdict. This is the task to which Plato addresses himself in VIII and
            IX (down to 576 B). The method which he follows resembles that adopted in II 369 B
            ff.—IV. In the first place, he retains throughout the former analogy between
            the Soul and the City, and his account of the imperfect man is in every instance
            preceded by an account of the imperfect State. Secondly, instead of going straight to
            the mark and giving us a single ready-made sketch of total and complete depravity, Plato
            draws an elaborate and quasi-historical picture of the gradual descent of the perfect
            State and the perfect Man through successive phases of ever-growing degeneration down to
            the lowest depth of wickedness and crime. In the same way, as Nettleship observes
              (<title>Lect. and Rem.</title> II p. 295), “in describing a perfect state,
            or certain steps in the process of forming a perfect state,” he sometimes
            wrote “as if one step of that process succeeded another in a historical
            order.” See on II 369 B, 372 D, 373 D et al. The question has often been
            discussed whether the sequence of polities in VIII and IX was intended to be really
            historical or not: see for example Zeller^{4} II pp. 923—925, Henkel
              <title>Studien zur Gesch. d. Gr. Lehre v. Staat</title> p. 56 and Krohn <title>Pl.
            St.</title> pp. 204 ff. Aristotle seems to have understood Plato's account as an attempt
            to describe the actual facts of Greek history, and severely criticizes it from his usual
            standpoint in <title>Pol.</title> E 12. 1316^{a} 1—^{b} 27 ; but Plato himself
            must of course have known as well as Aristotle that the historical development of Greek
            constitutions did not by any means always correspond with his scheme. See Whibley
              <title>Gk Olig.</title> pp. 62—88 and Greenidge <title>Gk Const.
            Hist.</title> pp. 12—35. The fact is that Aristotle altogether ignores the
            real object of Plato, which is, as we have seen, to arrive at the worst State and the
            worst man, and treats him as if he had undertaken to exhibit a full <pb n="196"/> and
            complete genealogical tree of all the changes good or bad which had ever taken place in
            Greek constitutional history. But Plato does not here profess to describe political
            advance, but only political decay; and even his theory of political decay is itself
            based upon a theory of psychological degeneration which justly and deliberately ignores,
            as irrelevant for our present purpose, the undoubted power of human character to improve
            as well as to deteriorate. The question, as Nettleship says, which Plato puts before
            himself is this: “The human soul being as we have described it, and having in
            it a certain capacity for evil as well as for good, what would it come to, and through
            what stages would it pass, if its capacity for evil were realized gradually but without
            any abatement? In actual human experience there is always some abatement; there are
            always counteracting circumstances which prevent any one tendency working itself out in
            isolation and unhindered; but the philosopher may, as Plato here does, work out the
            result of a single tendency logically. These books therefore put before us an ideal
            history of evil, as the previous books put before us an ideal history of good”
            (l. c. p. 295). The different stages in the decline of the individual soul are each
            reflected in the decline of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">politei/a</foreign>, which is
            still, as in II—VII, not ‘a lifeless instrument, or dead
            machine,’ but in the words of Isocrates, simply the soul of the State
              (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/sti ga\r yuxh\ po/lews ou)de\n e(/teron h)\ politei/a</foreign>
            <title>Areop.</title> 14). But although Plato treats the whole question from a
            psychological rather than a historical standpoint, it is none the less true that the
            materials of his picture are taken from Greek political and social life. In Books VIII
            and IX of the <title>Republic</title> we have an extraordinarily vivid and life-like
            embodiment of the results of Plato's observation and experience of the Greek character,
            both private and public, in all its different phases, Lacedaemonian, oligarchical,
            democratical or Athenian, and tyrannical; and the student of Greek history, whether
            political, economical or social, will obtain a clearer idea of the inner life and
            animating spirit of Greek constitutions from Plato's description than from any other
            ancient source whatever. For the rest, it should be noted that Plato has given us in
            this part of the <title>Republic</title> the earliest attempt at a Philosophy of
            History, and founded the psychological interpretation of the State. Every political
            movement is, according to him, the expression of some particular psychological impulse
            or impulses, and the Constitution inevitably assumes different forms, according as one
            or another element or ‘part’ of soul obtains the mastery in the
            individual citizen. See on this subject Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 199 ff., and

            indications it would appear on a first perusal that the sequence of commonwealths in
            VIII and IX is intended by Plato to be not merely logical, but historical also; but
            there is no question that the political evolution of Greek constitutions was far more
            complex than would appear from Plato's description. See on 543 A. We must above all
            things remember that it is in order to furnish a picture of the worst city and the worst
            man that the whole of this enquiry is undertaken, and Plato is at liberty to adopt
            whatever mode of presentation is best adapted for the object which he has in view. The
            form which he does in point of fact select is that of a historical narrative (see on 543
            A, 548 D), but the real order of the development which he describes is a
            ‘logical order,’ and is primarily determined by psychological, and
            not by historical considerations. Although there are many points of contact between the
            development of Greek constitutional history and Plato's arrangement, Plato here employs
            narration primarily and chiefly as a vehicle or instrument for expressing the results of
            psychological analysis, and not because he believes that political development always
            and inevitably follows the same lines. See also on 543 A and infra 544 D.</p>

          <p>545C - 547C How does Timarchy arise out of Aristocracy? We may lay it down as a
            universal rule that constitutional change is originated by dissension within the
            governing class. Socrates invokes the Muses to tell ‘how first sedition
            entered.’ Like everything else, our perfect city is subject to Nature's
            universal law, that whatever is created perishes. Out of the elements of the number
            which expresses the shortest period of gestation in the human kind, Socrates builds up a
            ‘geometrical number,’ which he calls ‘the lord of better
            and worse births.’ When, through ignorance of these, couples are united
            inopportunely, as one day they will be, a degenerate race of offspring arises. The best
            of these in due course become rulers; but the mixture of races—golden, silver,
            copper, iron—waxes greater, and sedition is the result. The contending parties
            finally, by means of a compromise, effect the transition to Timarchy—a form of
            commonwealth standing midway between Aristocracy and Oligarchy.</p>
          <p>ff. I have discussed the famous ‘Number of Plato’ at length in
            Appendix I, and must refer the reader to that Appendix for a fuller justification of
            views which considerations of space preclude me from defending <hi rend="italic">totis
              viribus</hi> throughout the notes. The connexion of the episode with the argument of
            the <title>Republic</title> may be expressed as follows. In accordance with the form of
            a historical narrative which he employs throughout these two books, Plato invites us to
            conceive of his perfect city as having actually existed long ago, just as in the
              <title>Timaeus</title> (23 C ff.) and <title>Critias</title> (109 B ff.) the Platonic
            Utopia appears as prehistoric Athens. In making this demand upon the imagination of his
            countrymen, Plato could count upon the support to be derived from the prevalence of the
            view that mankind had degenerated from an age of innocence and bliss in the far-distant
            past: see the references in my <pb n="202"/> edition of the <title>Protagoras</title> p.
            xxiii and Rohde <title>Griech. Roman</title> pp. 216 ff. What, then, was the originating
            cause of degeneration? Plato finds the cause, not in anything peculiar to the Ideal
            city, but in a law which prevails throughout the whole of Nature—the law that
              <hi rend="italic">everything created is doomed to decay.</hi> There cannot be any
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)/dios metabolh/</foreign> (to quote the phrase of Aristotle
              <title>Pol.</title> E 12. 1316^{a} 12) of a perfect City; for a city which carries <hi
              rend="italic">within itself</hi> the seeds of decay is not perfect, but imperfect. In
            the sequel Plato first describes the manner in which degeneration begins to take effect
              (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ou) mo/non —de/on</foreign> 546 A, B), and afterwards
            proceeds to construct a Number which is the expression of that law of inevitable
            degeneration to which the Universe and all its parts are subject. The substance of what
            he has to say on the first head is that a psychologically inferior offspring gradually
            makes its appearance because children are sometimes begotten inopportunely. It is
            noteworthy that here, as everywhere in Books VIII and IX, the decline of the
            constitution or soul of the State (543 A note) is traced to the decline of the soul of
            the individual. In the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nqrwpei/w|
            de\—tria/dos</foreign> (546 B, C), Plato, copying the method of the
            Pythagoreans, and closely following their calculations, at all events in the first part
            of the reckoning, attempts to give an arithmetical expression to the Law of Change in
            that which he calls the <foreign xml:lang="greek">gewmetriko\s a)riqmo/s</foreign>.
            According to the view which I have endeavoured to establish in Appendix I, the
            arithmetic, in which each of the factors and processes involved was full of significance
            to ancient speculators on the theory of numbers, may be thus expressed in modern
            arithmetical notation: (1) 3^{3} + 4^{3} + 5^{3}=216. (2) (3 x 4 x 5)^{4}=12,960,000
            =3600^{2}=4800 x 2700.</p>
          <p>The first number, 216, is the shortest period of gestation in the human race expressed
            in days. In the second equation, the number 12,960,000 expresses, also in days, the
            duration of a Great Year in the life of the Universe. Expressed in years, the number is
            36,000, if we count, as Plato here does, 360 days in the year. The two
            ‘harmonies,’ 3600^{2} and 4800 x 2700, are the two cycles described
            in the <title>Politicus</title>, each of which is a Great Year. In the first <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o(moio/ths</foreign> prevails, in the second <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >a)nomoio/ths</foreign>: the World ‘waxes’ in the first, and
            ‘wanes’ in the second, without, however, suffering dissolution. In
            what sense the whole number 36,000 years, which astronomers sometimes called the
              <title>Platonicus annus</title> in the middle ages, is at once the numerical Cause of
            Change, and the ‘lord of better and worse births,’ is pointed out in
            App. I, Pt ii § 7, and also in the notes on 546 C. How far Plato attached a
            serious value to his Number and the calculations from which he derives it, I have
            briefly discussed at the end of App. I, Pt ii. Here it must suffice to say that the
            episode, like many other passages in Plato, is half-serious, and half-playful. The
            setting of the whole is mythical, for it is only for literary and artistic purposes that
            Plato pictures his ideal city as historically true: and the meaning of the latter part
            of the Number is deciphered by the aid of one of Plato's myths. Moreover, the style of
            the whole passage, though extraordinarily rhythmical and highly-wrought, acquires a
            touch of fantastic humour from the bewildering parade of mathematical terms, at some of
            which even Plato's own contemporaries would probably have smiled. On its serious side,
            the Number affords an interesting example of the application of Number and Mathematics
            to explain the life of the Universe and Man; and, as I have said in the Appendix, finds
            its fittest apology in the saying <foreign xml:lang="greek">qeo\s a)ei\
            gewmetrei=</foreign>. It is of some importance in the history of philosophy because of
            its connexion with Pythagorean embryology and physics, and its employment by the
            Neoplatonists to justify the wildest astrological vagaries. The extreme difficulty of
            the Greek has made the Platonic <pb n="203"/> Number a favourite hunting-ground of
            successive generations of scholars, and the works which have been written on the
            subject, a few of which are mentioned in the Appendix, are very numerous.</p>

            multiplications’ i.e. ‘multiplications of root by square,’

            phrase which itself might well have been employed by Plato, except that he has an object
            in drawing attention to the different stages in the process of augmentation (see App. I,
            Pt ii § 4); and partly also he wants the Muses to preserve their character as
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(yhlologou/menai</foreign>. The period of human gestation is
            therefore the first number, in which ‘cubings make everything <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">r(hta\ pro\s a)/llhla</foreign>’—but cubings of what?
            The answer is ‘of elements which make like and unlike and wax and
            wane.’ These elements are the numbers 3, 4 and 5, which measure the three
            sides of the Pythagorean <foreign xml:lang="greek">zw|ogoniko\n tri/gwnon</foreign> (Procl.
              <hi rend="italic">in remp.</hi> II p. 43. 10), the triangle which, <figure/> as we are
            informed by many authorities— Aristotle, Plutarch, Aristides Quintilianus,
            Proclus and others—Plato made use of in his Number. The antecedent of <foreign

              puqmh/n</foreign> means ‘of which 4, 3,’ Plato himself tells us
            two of the numbers, and the third is also readily suggested by <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >pempa/di</foreign>. 3, 4 and 5 are said to ‘make like,’ because,
            as we shall see, in the latter part of the Number, where the triangle fulfils its office
            as a <foreign xml:lang="greek">kosmiko\n tri/gwnon</foreign> (Proclus l.c. II p. 45. 23),
            they produce the ‘harmony’ 3600^{2}, and square numbers are <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o(/moioi</foreign> (Iambl. l.c. p. 82): they ‘make
            unlike’ because they produce <pb n="206"/> the ‘harmony’
            4800 x 2700, and oblong numbers are <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)no/moioi</foreign> (ib.):
            they are said to wax and wane in a figurative sense—to wax in the first
            harmony, which represents in a certain sense the waxing of the Universe, and to wane in
            the second, which represents its wane. As the elements out of which the Universe is
            formed, they may be said to grow with its growth, and decline with its decline. The
            words have also a further meaning as a description of 3, 4, 5 regarded as the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a)rxai/</foreign> of everything which exists: see App. I, Pt ii
            § 5. Now the first number in which cubings of 3, 4 and 5 are present is 3^{3} +
            4^{3} + 5^{3}=216, and Aristides Quintilianus, in the passage where he refers to Plato's

              xml:lang="greek">a)nqrwpei/w| de\—a)pe/fhnan</foreign> the Pythagorean triangle
            was employed to construct the period of gestation for the microcosm or man: here it is
            used to construct two periods in the lifetime of the macrocosm or Universe, for that is
            what Plato means by the two ‘harmonies.’ The translation is:
            ‘of which, 4, 3 married with 5, yields two harmonies when thrice increased,
            the one equal an equal number of times, so many times 100, the other of equal length one
            way, but oblong:—on the one side, of 100 squares of rational diameters of five
            diminished by one each, or if of irrational diameters, by two: on the other of one
            hundred cubes of three.’ The antecedent of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >w(=n</foreign> is <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(moiou/ntwn te kai\ a)nomoiou/ntwn kai\
              au)co/ntwn kai\ fqino/ntwn</foreign>, which I have already interpreted as the numbers
            3, 4, 5. Of these numbers (<foreign xml:lang="greek">w(=n</foreign>) the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)pi/tritos puqmh/n</foreign> i.e. 3, 4 (cf. Theo Smyrn. p. 80 ed.
            Hiller, Proclus l. c. II p. 37 <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( e)pi/tritos puqmh\n g/ kai\
            d/</foreign>), is ‘married’ or ‘coupled’ with 5.
            That is to say, 3, 4, and 5 are multiplied together: whence we get 3 x 4 x 5=60.
            ‘Thrice increased’ is ‘three times multiplied by
            itself’; and 60 thrice increased is therefore 60 x 60 x 60 x 60. This sum,
            which is 12,960,000, yields two harmonies. One of the two harmonies is ‘equal
            an equal number of times, viz. <hi rend="italic">so</hi> many times 100,’ in
            other words, it is a square (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 147E"><title>Theaet.</title> 147
              E</bibl>) each of whose sides is a certain number of times 100 (for <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">tosauta/kis</foreign> cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">tosou=ton</foreign> in
              <title>Alc.</title> I 108 E), viz. of course 36 times 100, for 60 x 60 x 60 x
            60=3600^{2}. See Fig. 4. <figure/> The other harmony which 60 x 60 x 60 x 60 yields is a
            rectangle (with <foreign xml:lang="greek">promh/kh</foreign> cf. <pb n="207"/>
            <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 148A"><title>Theaet.</title> 148 A</bibl>), one of whose sides is
            one hundred cubes of 3, i.e. 2700, and the other the number which Plato describes in
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(kato\n me\n—duoi=n</foreign>. What is that number?
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)riqmoi\ a)po/</foreign> means (numerical) ‘squares
            of’ (cf. Procl. l. c. II p. 38. 9 et al.): the side in question is therefore
            ‘100 squares of’—what? Of the rational diameter of 5 etc.
            Now the ‘rational diameter of 5’ is the nearest rational number to
            the real diameter of a square whose side is 5 (Theo l. c. pp. 43 ff. and other
            authorities). The real diameter <figure/> of a square whose side is 5 is √50.
            See Fig. 5. AC^{2}=5^{2} + 5^{2}=50 (by Pythagoras' famous <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >eu(/rhma</foreign> Eucl. I 47): therefore AC=√50. And the nearest rational
            number to √50 is 7: for √49=7. Consequently 7 is ‘the
            rational diameter’ of 5. And 100 squares of 7=100 x 49=4900. But we are told
            to diminish the 100 squares by 1 each. Do so: 4900 - (1 x 100)=4800. This side is
            therefore 4800. The words <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)rrh/twn de\ duoi=n</foreign> give us
            an alternative way of reaching the number 4800. The construction is <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">&lt;a)po\&gt; a)rrh/twn de\ &lt;diame/trwn deome/nwn&gt;
              duoi=n &lt;e(ka/stwn&gt;</foreign> = (or of 100) ‘squares of <hi
              rend="italic">irrational</hi> diameters of 5, wanting 2 each.’ Now the <hi
              rend="italic">irrational</hi> diameter of 5 is √50. Square this and it
            becomes 50. 100 squares of 50= 5000. Subtract 2 from each square and you have 5000 - (2
            x 100)=4800. The two sides of the oblong are therefore <figure/> 4800 and 2700
            (‘one hundred cubes of three’). The area is 4800 x 2700= 12,960,000
            which is 60 x 60 x 60 x 60. See Fig. 6. Thus the arithmetical meaning of this part of
            Plato's Number may be expressed by us as follows:</p>
          <p>(3 x 4 x 5)^{4}=3600^{2}=4800 x 2700.</p>
          <p>In this explanation, which is defended at length in App. I, Pt i § 2, the most
            important novelty is my view of <foreign xml:lang="greek">tri\s au)chqei/s</foreign>. Most,
            but not quite all, of the other expressions have been explained in the above way at one
            time or another, though never, as far as I have noticed, by any single critic. The
            meaning of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi/tritos puqmh/n</foreign> was perfectly well known
            to ancient mathematicians: and Proclus fully understood the
            ‘rational’ and ‘irrational’ diameters of 5. The
            full explanation of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(kato\n me\n—tria/dos</foreign> is
            due to Barozzi, except that he did not multiply the sides. As regards <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">tri\s au)chqei/s</foreign>, I believe that I have proved my view in App.
            I, Pt i § 2 and Pt iii. Here I will only say that just as in the increasing
            series 1, 60, 3600, 216000 the number 216000 or 60^{3} is the ‘<hi
              rend="italic">third</hi> increase’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">tri/th
            au)/ch</foreign>) of unity, so in the increasing series 60, 3600, 216000, 12960000, the
            number 12960000 or (as <hi rend="italic">we</hi> express it, but as Plato, to whom
            ‘power’ means either ‘square’ or
            ‘root,’ never did or could express it, 60^{4}) is the third increase
            of 60.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">suzugei/s</lem></app>. The metaphor is from marriage, and
            marriage, among the Pythagoreans, was usually expressed by multiplication. Thus 6, which
            is the product of the first male number 3 and the first female number 2, was called by
            them marriage. <foreign xml:lang="greek">suzugei=sa</foreign> also means
            ‘multiplied with’ in Proclus l. c. II p. 544 (App. I, Pt i
            § 2).</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">du/o a(rmoni/as</lem></app>. The square and oblong may be

            216 above, all things are <foreign xml:lang="greek">prosh/gora kai\ r(hta\ pro\s
            a)/llhla</foreign>. Thus 12,960,000=(35 + 1) x 360,000, so that, as 35 is a <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a(rmoni/a</foreign>, 12,960,000 contains the portentous number of 360,000

            arithmetical meaning of the term <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(rmoni/as</foreign>. In App. I,
            Pt ii § 5 I have given my reasons for connecting the two <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >a(rmoni/ai</foreign> with the myth of the <title>Politicus.</title> In that myth we
            are told how two cycles of equal and vast duration invariably succeed one another in the

            Great Years, in the first of which <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(moio/ths</foreign> prevails

            >a(rmoni/a</foreign>, which is a square and therefore <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >o(/moion</foreign>, represents the progressive cycle, the cycle of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o/moio/ths</foreign>, and the second <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >a(rmoni/a</foreign>, which is an oblong, and therefore <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >a)no/moion</foreign> (see above on 546 B line 12), stands for the retrogressive cycle,
            the cycle of <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nomoio/ths</foreign>. If this identification is, as
            I believe, correct, each <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(rmoni/a</foreign> represents a Great
            Year. The area or number of each harmony, according to Plato, is 12,960,000, and as
            Plato elsewhere says that the Great Year is measured <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=| tou=
              tau)tou= kai\ o(moi/ws i)o/ntos ku/klw|</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Tim. 39D"
                ><title>Tim.</title> 39 D</bibl>), i.e. by the diurnal revolutions of the heavens,
            we may take this number as denoting days. Converted into years, on the astronomical
            calculation of 360 days to the year, followed by Plato here and elsewhere, the number
            becomes 36,000 years, which was known in Ptolemaic astronomy as the <hi rend="italic"
              >magnus Platonicus annus.</hi> For the evidence on all these points, see App. I, Pt ii

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">cu/mpas de\ ou(=tos ktl.</lem></app> ‘This
            whole number, a number <hi rend="italic">measuring the earth</hi>, is lord of better and
            worse births.’ On its arithmetical side, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >gewmetriko/s</foreign> means only that the number is reached by means of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">gewmetri/a</foreign> and expressed in geometrical figures: but I have no
            doubt that Plato meant the word to bear another and profounder meaning, suitable to the
            real import of the two harmonies whereof this is the number. The number is <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">tw=| o)/nti gewmetriko/s</foreign>, for it measures an aeon of the
            Universe, of which the Earth is part (cf. 555 A note and VI 511 B note): and indeed it
            is artistically right that the meaning of the two harmonies should be summed up at the
            climax of the whole in a single pregnant word. How do good and bad births depend upon
            this number? Because in the early days of our era, when God had but lately left the
            world, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nomoio/ths</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >a)nwmali/a</foreign> were young, Nature produced better children than <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">oi)=oi nu=n brotoi/ ei)sin</foreign>. Plato in fact invites us to think
            of his city as having existed soon after the change to the aeon in which we now live,
            just as throughout Book VIII and part of IX the Ideal City is figured in the past. For
            more on this subject see App. I, Pt ii §§ 5—7. I know not
            what others will think, but to me it seems that the extraordinary range and elevation of
            its central ideas make the Platonic number worthy even of a writer who is full of
            ‘thoughts that wander through eternity.’ The connexion between the
            Human Child and the Divine, the Microcosm and the Macrocosm, has played no small part in
            the history of human thought, and the story of a Great Year, with the hope which it
            affords of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)pokata/stasis</foreign> of all things
              (<title>Acts</title> 3. 21), has been and is, in its religious setting, the solace and
            support of many a ‘human child.’</p>

          <p>547C - 548D So much for the origin of Timarchy. In character, it will resemble
            Aristocracy on the one hand, and Oligarchy on the other; partly also it will have
            peculiarities of its own. The aristocratical features of Timarchy are respect for the
            ruling class and so forth; its own distinctive peculiarity is the love of war and
            warlike matters; in cupidity and avarice it is like Oligarchy. On the whole Timarchy is
            a mixture of good and evil; but the one conspicuous feature of this polity is the love
            of victory and honour.</p>
          <p>Plato's description of ‘timocracy’ is, as he says himself, a sketch
            (548 D), but one in which hardly any feature of first-rate importance is wholly ignored.
            He regards ‘timocracy’ as primarily and essentially the political
            embodiment of <foreign xml:lang="greek">qumoeide/s</foreign> (548 C), and consequently a
            sort of half-way house between aristocracy and oligarchy, as <foreign xml:lang="greek"

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">filoxrh/maton</foreign>. It is, however, at the same time a
            ‘mixed’ constitution (548 C note), and partakes in the
            characteristics of both its neighbours. The portrait of timocracy is drawn in the main
            from Sparta, as the notes will shew, but it represents the Sparta of the fifth rather
            than of the fourth century, during which the oligarchical element in the Spartan
            constitution began to acquire an undue predominance, owing to the temptations of empire

          <p>548D - 550C The character of the timarchical man is now described in close analogy with
            that of the timarchical State (548 D—549 B). In origin (continues Socrates) he
            was the son of a good father living in an ill-regulated city and abstaining from public
            life. Drawn by his father's precepts and example towards the higher life, and by
            maternal and other influences towards the lower, he finally surrendered himself to the
            dominion of the intermediate principle in the soul, and thus became timarchical.</p>

            with the whole of Plato's exposition, which is deliberately arrayed in the vesture of a
            historical narrative or epic poem: see on 543 A, 544 C. It appears to be the custom to
            translate most of the aorists of this kind in Books VIII and IX by the present, but in
            some cases the effect is much more realistic and picturesque if we make them past, and I
            think that Plato intended some of these aorists to be understood in that way. The

            “used in animated language to express general truths” (Goodwin
              <title>MT.</title> p. 53), each of these tenses is in my opinion correctly translated
            by a past in English. Plato of course repeatedly employs the <pb n="215"/> present also,
            not only where he is painting a scene (e.g. 549 B ff., 553 A ff., 555 C ff.), but also
            when he is describing the actual genesis of a particular sort of commonwealth or

            is here speaking of the origin of the ‘timarchical’ <hi

            <title>State</title>, and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ristokratiko/s</foreign> whose son

            that there is no remnant of good men in depraved States (cf. VI 492 E ff., 496 C ff., IX
            591 E ff.). If Plato had here preserved the fiction of a historical narrative and made
            the <foreign xml:lang="greek">timokratiko\s neani/as</foreign> the son of an <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a)ristokratiko/s</foreign> in his own ideal city, he could only have
            attributed his fall to the same law of natural degeneration which subverted the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">kalli/polis</foreign> (546 A ff.). As it is, the description is drawn
            from facts of daily experience and observation, and Plato, as is suggested by the Oxford
            editors, may well be thinking of some ‘Laconizing youth of Athens,’
            perhaps of some member of the Socratic circle. We have already seen that Plato
            frequently deserts the epic or narrative form of exposition which he has chosen to
            express his views: see above on 548 D. I formerly printed a comma after <foreign

            regard the subject of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai)sqa/nhtai</foreign> as the mother, but
            grammatically it can only, as with <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)kou/h|</foreign>, be the son.

            solution is perfectly satisfactory; and it is possible that the sentence by some
            accident or other was imperfectly revised by Plato. The grammatical structure of this
            chapter from <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)ni/ote patro/s</foreign> down to <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)painoume/nous</foreign> (550 A) is considerably freer than is usual
            even with Plato, and there are other passages in Book VIII which seem to stand in need
            of revision: cf. 558 A note Nothing is easier than to ‘emend’ them
            all in accordance with our grammatical rules, but such emendations involve so great a
            departure from the MSS that they lack every element of probability, and as it is
            possible that the fault is Plato's, it is safer for us to adhere to the MSS. Nearly all
            the greatest writers occasionally offend against the rules by which we seek to bind
            them. See the excellent remarks of Longinus on the subject of correctness <hi

            establishment of a property qualification for full citizenship was the central feature
            in the programme of the Athenian oligarchical party from 412 B.C. onwards: see (for 411)

            It is therefore natural enough that Plato should define oligarchy as he does, especially
            as in his younger days, both personally and through his friends, he was himself
            connected with the Athenian oligarchical faction (Grote VIII p. 30). The term
            ‘oligarchy’ retained its Platonic sense after Plato (cf. e.g. Arist.

            to ourselves, this would naturally suggest a revolution against a democratic system such
            as took place at the establishment of the Four Hundred in 411 B.C., or of the Thirty in
            404 B.C., and constantly throughout Greece during the Peloponnesian war”
            (Bosanquet). The remark applies with equal force to <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\ tou/tou
              fobh/santes</foreign> (cf. Thuc. VIII 66. 2), and it can scarcely be doubted that the
            familiar struggles of oligarchy against democracy in his own as well as other times
            supplied Plato with this detail of the picture. But the employment of force would be
            equally necessary in order to transform a timarchy into an oligarchy, owing to the
            opposition to be apprehended from the impoverished and relatively poorer sections of the
            timarchs, who would under an oligarchy be formally and for ever excluded from office.
            The conspiracy of Cinadon partly illustrates Plato's point; for it was supported by
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pomei/ones</foreign>, and suppressed by force (<bibl

            IX pp. 70 ff.). Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 211) asserts that Plato has already
            forgotten 545 C, D, where constitutional change was said to originate from <foreign

              <hi rend="italic">de iure</hi> rulers as well as the rich. In Sparta it would be
            otherwise, because those who failed to pay their contributions to the <foreign

          <p>551C - 553A There are many grievous faults in the oligarchical city. It makes wealth

            in all probability, of waging war, and false to our principle of ‘one man, one
            work.’ Worst of all, Oligarchy is the first constitution which permits a man
            to dispose of all his property by sale. From this cause springs up a large impoverished
            class resembling drones, some stingless and others stinging. The former are only poor,

          <p>554A - 555B In character, the oligarchical man resembles the oligarchical State. He
            gratifies his ‘necessary’ desires and no others. He is avaricious,
            niggardly, sordid, and the blind god of wealth is leader of the chorus of his soul. From
            time to time, as opportunity offers, the drone-like desires within him assert
            themselves, but for the most part he forcibly represses them through fear of
            consequences. Thus, although his soul is a prey to sedition, his better desires
            generally prevail over those which are worse. In public competitions he is usually
            content to be beaten and save his money.</p>

          <p>555B - 557A Oligarchy is succeeded by Democracy. As dissipated young men in an

            large impoverished class of ‘stinging drones’ makes its appearance
            in the city. The rulers take no steps to remedy an evil which increases their own

            the poor discover their own <pb n="230"/> strength and the weakness of the rich, and

            Hermann. Plato was not likely to omit all mention of the most characteristic and
            necessary factor in the establishment of a democracy, especially as he <pb n="234"/>
            introduces the same feature in describing the democratical man (561 B <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">w(/sper laxou/sh|</foreign>). J. and C., with Schneider and others, read
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">gi/gnontai</foreign>, for which there is very little MS support,
            remarking that ‘the subjunctive is inexact, because any words dependent on
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/tan</foreign> should describe a characteristic of the origin
            of democracy, not merely a characteristic of democracy.’ The fact is that the
            words do explain the origin of democracy by explaining <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)c i)/sou
              metadw=si ktl.</foreign>, where the aorist is rightly used of the act by which
            democracy is established; whereas if we read <foreign xml:lang="greek">gi/gnontai</foreign>
            the clause must be taken by itself, and then it can only express a characteristic of
            democracy after that constitution is in force, so that its proper place would be in the
            next chapter. It should be observed that in no ancient democracy that we know of was the
            lot employed in electing to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> magistracies: see Gilbert l.c. II
            p. 318. For this reason Plato writes <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s to\ polu/</foreign>.</p>
          <p>557A - 558C The peculiar characteristics of Democracy are liberty and licence. It is of
            all governments the most manifold and many-coloured, resembling a bazaar of
            constitutions rather than a single polity. In a democratic city the individual is free
            to adopt his own policy independently of the State. Little trouble is taken to execute
            judicial sentences. The people are indulgent to educational defects in their leaders and
            require nothing beyond a profession of loyalty to the masses. Truly a delightful
            constitution, full of anarchy and colour, distributing a species of equality to equal
            and unequal alike!</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ti/na dh\ ou)=n ktl.</lem></app> The psychological
            principle of Democracy, as well as of Oligarchy, is <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\
              e)piqumhtiko/n</foreign>. But whereas in Oligarchy everything was subjected to the
            dominion of one particular desire, viz. the desire of wealth (550 C note), Democracy, on
            the other hand, is the political embodiment of absolute freedom and equality among all
            desires, unnecessary as well as necessary: see on 558 C ff. The materials for Plato's
            picture of democracy are of course taken from Athens more than any other single city. It
            is an extraordinarily vivid sketch; and indeed Plato's whole account of democracy and
            the democratical man (557 A—565 C), in spite of manifest exaggerations, brings
            Athens nearer to us than almost any monument of ancient literature, Aristophanes alone
            excepted. We can see that Plato was fully alive to the wonderful variety and colour of
            Athenian life; but even on this ground democracy did not appear to him worthy of praise.
            Multiplicity and variety are the offspring of that fatal <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >a)nomoio/ths</foreign> which works ruin alike in the city and the soul (547 A note).
            In other respects, Plato represents democracy as a land of Hedonism, peopled by Anarchy
            and Waywardness, and darkened by the shadow of the Tyranny to which it must at last
            succumb. Nearly all the greatest writers of Greek antiquity were on the whole
            unfavourable to democracy, except of course the Orators: and least of all in Plato could
            democracy expect a champion. For the other side of the picture, we should of course take

            farther, and say that every democratical individual is himself a kaleidoscopic
            succession of polities—<foreign xml:lang="greek">xamaile/wn tis kai\ saqrw=s

            as Plato would hold, the waywardness and instability of democratic policy, constantly
            reversing to-morrow what it decrees today. See Thuc. I 44, II 65, III 36 ff., IV 28 and
            VIII 1. Democracy in fact, from Plato's point of view, is the political expression of

            III 19. 12 with Frazer's note, and Hdt. VIII 64); but Plato's language is quite general.
            The meaning cannot be ‘parades like a hero’ (as Jowett translates),
            for <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(/rws</foreign> is not thus used in Greek, and a parading
            hero always excites popular attention. J. and C. think ‘there is an implied

            ‘unnecessary.’ The oligarchical man is ruled by the former; the
            latter sway the drone.</p>

            Plato's complete classification distinguishes between (1) necessary desires, (2)

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">turanniko/s</foreign> of (3). Cf. IX 571 A note If we translate
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">para/nomoi</foreign> by ‘unnatural’ (as in
            view of IX 571 C ff. we are justified in doing: cf. IX 571 B note), Plato's account
            becomes almost identical with that of Epicurus, who classified Desires as (1) natural
            and necessary, (2) natural and not-necessary, (3) neither natural nor necessary. For the

          <p>559D - 562A Let us now return and explain the genesis of the democratical man. An
            oligarchical father has a son, whom he brings up on narrow and parsimonious principles.
            The young man tastes the ‘honey of drones,’ and sedition is
            engendered within his soul. A struggle ensues, and after perhaps a temporary check the
            unnecessary desires prevail; but with the help of fortune and advancing years a sort of
            equality of all desires is finally established; and the man becomes an impartial devotee
            of pleasure in all its forms—a beautiful and many-coloured creature,
            ‘everything by starts and nothing long.’</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">pa/lin toi/nun ktl.</lem></app> Plato's description of
            the genesis of the democratical man is one of the most royal and magnificent pieces of
            writing in the whole range of literature, whether ancient or modern. Throughout most of
            this chapter, in the words of Longinus, the style <foreign xml:lang="greek">plousiw/tata
              kaqa/per ti pe/lagos ei)s a)napeptame/non ke/xutai—me/geqos</foreign>
              (<foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\ u(/yous</foreign> 12. 2), and no better example will ever
            be discovered of that full tide of lofty thoughts and images and words—a tide
            ‘too full for sound and foam’—in which the author of the
            treatise <title>On the Sublime</title> places the essence of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >&lt;*&gt;yos</foreign>. We owe to Longinus what is by far the best
            appreciation of Plato's hierophantic vein: see especially cc. 33—36, where we
            can hear more than a mere echo of that sublimity which is itself, according to Longinus,
            the ‘echo of high-mindedness’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">u(/yos
              megalofrosu/nhs a)ph/xhma</foreign> ib. 9. 2). For a very different estimate the
            student may be referred to Dionysius of Halicarnassus (<hi rend="italic">ad Cn. Pomp.
              Gem.</hi> 753—765 Reiske), whose pedantic criticisms make it tolerably plain
            that a study of the Attic orators does not qualify a man to sit in judgment upon Plato.
            The present episode is hardly less remarkable for psychological insight than for
            elevation of style, and the description of the democratic man as the chameleon of human
            society paints him for all time (561 C ff.). As a representation of actual fact, the
            picture is doubtless somewhat exaggerated, as usual; but it is extraordinarily vivid and
            powerful, and shews that the Platonic analogy between the individual and the State may
            prove in the hands of a master an admirable clue whereby to unravel the workings of the
            human soul in the individual as well as in the State.</p>

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)ligarxikh=s politei/as</foreign>, at all events in this
            connexion. The MS reading can only mean ‘of the oligarchical change within
            himself into a democratical,’ an expression which bears no sense. I formerly
            wrote <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)ligarxikou= tou=—dhmokratiko/n</foreign>,
            comparing 559 E, 560 A; but it may fairly be objected that the ‘oligarchical
              <hi rend="italic">element</hi>’ within the man does not change into a
            democratical: it is the <hi rend="italic">government</hi> that changes. For this reason
            I now prefer my old suggestion (<title>Cl. Rev.</title> IV p. 357), although the
            corruption of <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)ligarxikou= — dhmokratiko/n</foreign> is
            perhaps somewhat easier to explain. For the combination of genitives cf. V 449 A note An
            alternative solution would be to insert <foreign xml:lang="greek">politei/as</foreign> after
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(autw=|</foreign>. This gives excellent sense, but it is
            difficult to assign a plausible reason for the loss of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >politei/as</foreign> in all our MSS. I am unable to resist the conclusion that the text
            is corrupt, otherwise I should not venture to make any alteration. If Plato did not

            overthrown by the insatiate pursuit of wealth, so democracy begins to change to tyranny,
            when evil cupbearers provide the wine of Freedom in excessive draughts. Anarchy under
            the name of Freedom infects every department of life—political, domestic,
            educational, and social: the very dogs and beasts of burden become tainted with the

            sovereignty lies. The most active members of the drone-fraternity become leaders of the
            Demos against the rich. By dint of extortion and calumny the propertied classes are at
            last compelled in self-defence to form an oligarchical party. Hence arise impeachments
            etc., and the people range themselves under a single Champion. As in the fable he who
            tasted human flesh became a wolf, so this Champion of the People, as soon as he spills
            the blood of fellow-citizens, is doomed to become a tyrant. Civil war begins; the
            Champion is either driven from the city, and returns a full-fledged tyrant, or receives
            a bodyguard to protect him from secret assaults, and thus achieves his end. <pb n="250"

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ou)k e)c a)/llhs ktl.</lem></app> In early times,
            according to Aristotle (<title>Pol.</title> E 5. 1305^{a} 7 ff.) democracies used to
            give rise to tyrannies. The tyranny of Dionysius I of Syracuse is a notorious
            illustration from later history (see Grote c. 81). But tyranny had other origins as
            well: it constantly appeared for example during the transition from Aristocracy to an
            oligarchical form of government (Whibley <title>Gk Olig.</title> pp. 72—83).
            Plato deliberately selects that particular origin which accords with his psychological
            standpoint. In the decline of an individual soul, ‘lawless’ or
            unnatural (<foreign xml:lang="greek">para/nomoi</foreign>) desires succeed the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">i)sonomi/a</foreign> in which all desires are treated as equal. Hence
            tyranny, which is only the political expression of unnatural desire, succeeds democracy
            in the fall of a State. Granted that Plato thought Athens was still degenerating, he
            must certainly have expected her, unless the process of decay should be arrested, to end
            in a tyranny. See also on IX 576 B. With the position of <foreign xml:lang="greek"

              n="Aristoph. Cl. 1378">Ar. <title>Clouds</title> 1378</bibl>): for he gave utterance <hi

            tu/rannos</foreign>), the associates of the tyrant, i.e., as we have seen, a rabble of
            emancipated slaves and foreign mercenaries. In <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >tragw|di/a— sofo\n dokei= ei)=nai</foreign> Plato is also perhaps scoffing
            at the constant use of <foreign xml:lang="greek">sofo/s</foreign> in tragedy, especially by
            Euripides: <foreign xml:lang="greek">sofo/s</foreign> is, no doubt, that <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">sofo/n</foreign> says! None but a <foreign xml:lang="greek">sofo/s</foreign>
            could have written <foreign xml:lang="greek">sofoi\ tu/rannoi tw=n sofw=n
            sunousi/a|</foreign>. The poet of course really meant that tyrants gain wisdom from the
            wise men who throng the ‘rich man's courts’ (VI 489 B note); but
            Plato maliciously twists the words into a compliment to tyrants and their rabble rout,
            and makes them a reason for tabooing tragic poets as <foreign xml:lang="greek">turanni/dos
              u(mnhta/s</foreign> (B). Cobet would omit <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou/s</foreign> before
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">sofou/s</foreign>: but the article is necessary because <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">tou\s sofou/s</foreign> represents <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n
            sofw=n</foreign> of the quotation. As regards the verse itself, it was Sophocles (in his
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">*ai)/as o( *aokro/s</foreign>), and not Euripides, who was the
            author: see the references in Schneider, with Blaydes on <bibl n="Aristoph. Thes. 21">Ar.
                <title>Thesm.</title> 21</bibl>, <title>Frag.</title> 311 and Dindorf on <bibl

            B</bibl>, and the Scholiast on Ar. <title>Thesm.</title> l.c. remarks that Aristophanes
            and Antisthenes made the same mistake, suggesting that either Aristophanes misled the
            others (so also Hirmer <title>Entst. u. Komp. d. pl. Pol.</title> p. 658 note 2), or
            that the two tragedians wrote the same line independently (so Schneider also thinks).
            The latter supposition is unlikely. Perhaps the reduplication of the cant Euripidean
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">sofo/s</foreign> is responsible for a kind of error which was
            easier in antiquity than it would be now. There is little to be said in favour of
            Dümmler's conjecture (<title>Akadem.</title> p. 16), that Antisthenes had
            quoted the line as from Euripides in an attack on Plato for associating with tyrants
            (Dionysius I and II), and that Plato, in his hurry to reply, forgets to rectify his
            assailant's error. Still less should we suppose that Plato's perverse exegesis is meant
            to caricature Antisthenes' way of expounding poetry.</p>

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o)re/gesqai/ tou</lem></app>. Schneider and Stallbaum
            read <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)re/gesqai tou= ai)sqa/nesqai</foreign> with II (see cr. n.)
            and a majority of MSS; but such an expression would be heavy and unpleasing. Jowett and
            Campbell think “<foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ ai)sqa/nesqai</foreign> should
            perhaps be struck out and the accent restored to <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >tou</foreign>,” while Burnet omits <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai/</foreign>,
            reading <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)re/gesqai/ tou ai)sqa/nesqai</foreign>. The text, I
            believe, is sound, but cannot mean ‘to aspire further (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >kai\</foreign>) to perceive something which it knows not’ (J. and C.). We
            may translate ‘to yearn after it knows not what and perceive what it knoweth
            not.’ Just as in evil dreams the baser part of soul reaches out after the
            object of its desires (571 C), so also the <foreign xml:lang="greek">be/ltiston</foreign>,
            in these happier visions of the night, has longings which are all its own. <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o)re/gesqai</foreign> expresses the instinctive and unconscious turning
            of the soul towards the fountain of her being, and the waking counterpart of these
            visions of the night are just</p>
          <p>“those shadowy recollections, Which, be they what they may, Are yet the
            fountain light of all our day, Are yet a master light of all our seeing.”</p>
          <p>With the use of <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)re/gesqai</foreign> cf. <bibl
              n="Plat. Phaedo 65C"><title>Phaed.</title> 65 C</bibl>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)re/ghtai tou= o)/ntos ktl.</foreign>, a passage which throws
            light on Plato's meaning here in more ways than one. <pb n="322"/></p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">h(suxa/sas</lem></app>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">. h(suxa/zw</foreign> is used transitively only in the aorist: cf.
            Solon ap. Arist. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 5. 3. Schleiermacher (<title>Platons
            Staat</title> p. 601) thinks that Plato recognises here, and in <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >e)gei/ras, e(stia/sas, prau/nas, kinh/sas</foreign> etc., a fourth principle or
            ‘part’ of soul, that viz. which is able to excite or calm the
            others. Krohn on the other hand sees in this passage a sort of implicit recognition of
            the ‘ego’ as a separate and distinct entity (<title>Pl. St.</title>
            p. 217). The latter view is nearer the truth (cf. V 462 C, D notes); but we ought not to
            press the words too much: cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pieikei= tini e(autou= bi/a|
              kate/xei a)/llas kaka\s e)piqumi/as</foreign> VIII 554 C, and III 411 B note</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ei)/dh</lem></app>. Other examples of this rare form of
            the dual in Plato are cited by Roeper <hi rend="italic">de dual. usu Plat.</hi> p. 12.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ma/lista</lem></app>: i.e. more than when he retires to

            take the word generally, as if divination by dreams were the best way of grasping truth.
            Plato would hardly say this, nor indeed would the average Greek. See especially <bibl

          <p>572B - 573C The origin of the tyrannical man is as follows. A democratical father has a

            the reading of the best MSS. Plato is testing his account of the origin of the
            tyrannical man by obvious and admitted facts: cf. (with Schneider) IV 442 E ff. Lust,
            Drink, and Madness are confessedly tyrants; and we hold that a <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >turanniko\s a)nh/r</foreign> in the strictest sense of the term (for <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a)kribw=s</foreign> cf. I 341 C) is produced when a man falls under the
            dominion of all three. So that our theory accords with everyday experience. <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">melagxoliko/s</foreign> is not of course ‘passionate’
            (Jowett), but ‘insane’: cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/ ge maino/menos
              kai\ u(pokekinhkw/s</foreign> above.</p>
          <p>573C - 576B In respect of his character and mode of life, the tyrannical man plunges
            into every form of dissipation, and is hounded on by ever fresh desires. His income and
            property soon disappear; and in order to satisfy his clamorous lusts, he plunders his
            father's estate, not hesitating if need be to lay violent hands on father and mother.
            Then follow sacrilege and theft, and every variety of crime; for he has now become in
            living fact that which once he rarely was in dreams. Such men, if few in number, may go
            abroad and join a tyrant's bodyguard or remain to swell the ranks of petty criminals at
            home; but if they are numerous, they make the worst of all their crew into a tyrant over
            their fatherland. Tyranny is the goal and consummation of such a man's desires.
            Throughout his whole existence, both before and after he attains the crown of his
            ambition, the tyrannical man is a stranger to freedom and friendship, faithless and
            superlatively unrighteous— in one word, he is the living embodiment of the
            monstrous lusts we found in dreams, and the longer he rules, the worse he grows.</p>
          <p>ff. Plato's <foreign xml:lang="greek">turanniko/s</foreign> is a monster without a single
            redeeming feature of any kind, the incarnation of unnatural desire, “bloody,
            Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, Sudden,
            malicious”—“not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a
            devil more damned In evils” (<title>Macbeth</title> Act IV Sc. 3). It must be
            admitted that Plato takes a terrible revenge on Dionysius: see on 577 A.</p>

              <hi rend="italic">him</hi> a tyrant too’; and the sentiment appears in a

            The latter view has hitherto, I believe, been held; but the introduction of the parallel

            nor even the tyrant himself was said in Book VIII to lead the city into daring deeds

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/sper po/lin</foreign> is natural and easy: if <foreign

            we are about to enter on a new stage in the discussion: cf. VI 487 A, 506 D al.
            Aristotle blames Plato for not saying what is to follow tyranny (<title>Pol.</title> E
            12. 1316^{a} 25 ff.). In reply, Plato would, I think, first point out that he is not
            required to touch on this subject either by the main thesis of the
            <title>Republic</title> or by the special aim which he has in view throughout Books VIII
            and IX (see VIII 543 A note). He might afterwards observe that, since the best hope of
            founding the perfect city lies in imbuing an absolute ruler or one of his descendants
            with a love of genuine philosophy (VI 499 B—502 C), the deepest darkness
            perhaps contained a promise of the dawn. See especially the striking passage in
              <title>Laws</title> 709 E—712 A. Aristotle seems to have understood him to
            mean this (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pei\ kat' e)kei=non dei= ei)s th\n prw/thn kai\ th\n
              a)ri/sthn: ou(/tws ga\r a)\n e)gi/neto sunexe\s kai\ ku/klos</foreign> l.c.), and
            criticises him accordingly from the facts of experience; but the succession of polities
            in the <title>Republic</title> is not intended to be in all respects, or even primarily
            and chiefly, historical (VIII 543 A note).</p>
          <p>576B - 577B What shall we say then about the happiness or unhappiness of the individual
            who is most depraved? As is the city, so will the individual be in point of happiness as
            well as virtue. And the city in which a tyrant rules is of all cities the worst and most
            unhappy. What of the tyrannical man? He that has lived with a tyrant, and is himself
            moreover capable of judging, will best decide. Let us pretend, says Socrates, that we
            ourselves possess these qualifications.</p>

            Dionysius I was himself a writer of tragedies, and notoriously jealous—so we
            are told—of his poetical reputation (Grote X pp. 302 ff.): but it would be

            nearly all critics are now agreed in holding that Plato throughout the whole of this
            passage is referring to his own experience of Dionysius I: see for example Susemihl

            with Zeller^{4} II p. 413 note 1. The date of Plato's first visit to the elder Dionysius
            was in or near 388 B.C. Compare <title>Epp.</title> VII 324 A—327 D. Whether
            this epistle be genuine or not, the visit is abundantly attested, as Zeller proves (l.c.
            pp. 413—415 notes), and it is strange that J. and C. should still have doubts
            upon the subject. See also on V 473 D, VI 496 B, 499 B and infra 579 B note</p>
          <p>577B - 580C Like the city whose counterpart he is, the tyrannical man is in reality a

            tyrant. Imagine the piteous plight of one who is suddenly transported into a solitary
            place where he is at the mercy of his own slaves, and surrounded by free neighbours who
            make common cause with them! Such is the position of the tyrant, a prisoner in his own
            palace, tormented by longings which he can never appease. To sum up, he is the supreme
            embodiment of vice and misery, and the longer he holds sway, the worse he becomes.</p>

          <p>ff. The arguments by means of which Plato establishes his conclusion may be briefly
            described as the political argument, the psychological argument, and the metaphysical
            argument. The first (577 B—580 C) depends on the resemblance between the soul
            and the State, the second (580 C—583 A) on the threefold division of the soul
            into <foreign xml:lang="greek">logistiko/n, qumoeide/s</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >e)piqumhtiko/n</foreign>, the third (583 B—587 B) on Plato's theory of
            Reality or Being. Now it is just these three methods of investigation, and these alone,
            which have been employed in the different parts of the dialogue, the political and
            psychological in II—IV and VIII—IX, the metaphysical in
            V—VII; and it is therefore altogether appropriate and right that Plato should
            bring them together now, and use their united forces ‘in making up the last
            account.’ The sequence of the three arguments follows the usual Platonic way
            of progression from the exoteric to the esoteric, and as the ideal city culminated in
            metaphysical idealism, so it is a metaphysical argument that crowns our citadel of

            says would nearly always be found true, especially where, as in Athens, the slaves

              Ant.</title> E. T. pp. 170—174. Fifty slaves would of course be more than
            the average number belonging to a single citizen. In Athens, during the fourth century

            According to Petersen, who in his Dorpat program <hi rend="italic">über die
              Preisrichter der Grossen Dionysien zu Athen</hi> (1878) has carefully investigated the
            whole subject, the mode of procedure was as follows. Some time before the festival a
            number of qualified persons were selected by the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >bouleutai/</foreign> in cooperation with the <foreign xml:lang="greek">xorhgoi/</foreign>,
            and their names deposited in 10 urns, one for each <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >fulh/</foreign>. On the day of the contest, one name was drawn from each urn, and the
            ten judges thereby constituted, after witnessing the performance, each wrote down in his
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">grammatei=on</foreign> the order in which he arranged the
            several competitors. Of these ten judges five were next selected by lot, and the final
            verdict was given in accordance with the votes already registered by these five. The
            most important piece of evidence in support of this theory is furnished by Lysias 4. 3
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)boulo/mhn d) a)\n mh\ a)polaxei=n au)to\n krith\n
              *dionusi/ois, &lt;*&gt;n) u(mi=n fanero\s e)ge/neto e)moi\ dihllagme/nos,

            fully cited by Petersen, do we find the expression <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( dia\ pa/ntwn
              krith/s</foreign>: but Petersen thinks the phrase may perhaps denote any one of the
            surviving five, <hi rend="italic">who had lasted through all the stages</hi>, having
            been originally chosen by the Senate, and afterwards by lot on the two remaining
            opportunities. The singular number, according to Petersen, is generic, as in
            <title>Laws</title> 659 A, B and elsewhere. It is true of course that the matter could
            not always be brought to an immediate issue in this way; for, to take a single instance,
            in a case where there were, let us say, three competitors, the votes of the five judges
            might result in a tie between two competitors for each of the three prizes. Thus we
            might have: <figure/></p>
          <p>In such a case we must, I suppose, believe either that one of the five judges, who will
            then be <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( dia\ pa/ntwn krith/s</foreign>, had a casting vote, or
            else—and this is the more reasonable view—that C was held to be
            disqualified for the first prize, and fresh scrutinies began. Petersen's explanation is
            accepted in the main by Müller (<hi rend="italic">Griech.
            Bühnenalt.</hi> pp. 369— 372), and, though to some extent
            conjectural, appears to me the best available, except in one point. <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o( dia\ pa/ntwn krith/s</foreign> can hardly be separated from <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o( dia\ pa/ntwn a)gw/n</foreign>, a phrase which is quoted from Cratinus'
              <title>Panoptae</title> (<title>Fr.</title> 157 Kock), and explained as <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o( e)/sxatos a)gw/n</foreign> in Bekker's <title>Anecdota</title> p. 91.
            10. The <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ pa/ntwn krith/s</foreign> must surely mean the judge
            of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ pa/ntwn a)gw/n</foreign>, and if so, <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">dia\ pa/ntwn</foreign> should be similarly interpreted in both phrases.
            In <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ pa/ntwn a)gw/n</foreign> it cannot mean “der
            durch alle Stadien oder besser durch alle Collegien hindurchgegangen war”
            (Petersen l. c. p. 24), but may possibly mean the last and greatest <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a)gw/n</foreign>, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ dia\ pasw=n</foreign> is
            the greatest interval in a scale of one octave. The expression is strangely reminiscent
            of the musical terms <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ pe/nte, dia\ tetta/rwn, dia\
            pasw=n</foreign> etc., and in a competition between <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >xoroi/</foreign>, it is natural enough that musical analogies should provide a name for

          <p>580C - 583A A second proof may be founded on our psychological theory. Let us agree to
            call the three varieties of soul, knowledge-loving, honour-loving, and gain-loving
            respectively, and let us distinguish three corresponding varieties both of men and of
            pleasures. If you ask any three men who represent these different classes, which of the
            three lives is the most pleasurable, each will pronounce in favour of his own. Which of
            them is right? The necessary requisites for deciding this, like every other question,
            are experience, intelligence or wisdom (<foreign xml:lang="greek">fro/nhsis</foreign>), and
            argument. Now the lover of knowledge is the only one among the three in whom any of
            these qualifications are present, and he possesses them all. We therefore accept his
            verdict, and arrange accordingly, placing love of knowledge first, love of honour
            second, and love of money last.</p>

            three varieties in <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ e)piqumhtiko/n</foreign>, corresponding
            respectively to the oligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical man (VIII 558 D note). In
            the present chapter these varieties again recede into the background. This apparent
            ‘Inconsequenz,’ together with other reasons, led Krohn to suppose
            that the whole of this proof, as well as the next, was written at a different time from
            the rest of Books VIII and IX (<title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 221 ff. Cf. Pfleiderer <hi
              rend="italic">Zur Lösung</hi> etc. p. 75. Krohn has since retracted his view:
            see his <title>Pl. Fr.</title> p. 104). But the unity of the <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            <hi rend="italic">as such</hi> has never been sacrificed, since each of its varieties

              >qumoeide/s</foreign>. To have compared each of its varieties separately with the two
            higher principles would have greatly lengthened and complicated Plato's proof; and he
              <pb n="343"/> reserves this point for another mode of treatment at a later opportunity
            (587 C note). Why does he select the word <foreign xml:lang="greek">filoxrh/maton</foreign>
            (s. <foreign xml:lang="greek">filokerde/s</foreign>) to denote the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >e)piqumhtiko/n</foreign> here? He wishes to find a <hi rend="italic">single</hi> word
            to contrast with <foreign xml:lang="greek">filo/sofon</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >filo/nikon</foreign> (s. <foreign xml:lang="greek">filo/timon</foreign>). The word
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)piqumhtiko/n</foreign> itself is excluded, because we have
            agreed that the <foreign xml:lang="greek">filo/sofon</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >filo/nikon</foreign> have also <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)piqumi/ai</foreign> of their
            own (580 D), and, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">filoxrh/maton</foreign> made its appearance
            in each of the three forms of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)piqumi/a</foreign> (VIII 551 A,
            553 C, 555 A, 558 D, 561 A, 568 D, IX 572 C, 573 D), it is the best summary description
            available. Plato himself claims no more for it, and that is why he says <foreign

            connected the word with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ni/kh</foreign> and not with <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">nei=kos</foreign>, from which indeed it could not be derived without
            doing violence to the laws of the Greek language (cf. Schanz Vol. VI p. x). Now Plato
            certainly did not write <foreign xml:lang="greek">nei/kh</foreign>, but <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ni/kh</foreign>: and it is therefore highly improbable that he wrote
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">filo/neikos. filo/nikos</foreign> has also considerable support
            from the inferior MSS of the <title>Republic.</title> The substitution of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ei</foreign> for long <foreign xml:lang="greek">i</foreign> became extremely
            common in imperial times, especially in proper names derived from <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            >e)nei/kwn</foreign> and the like are also found on late inscriptions (e.g. CIG 1585).
            In the case of <foreign xml:lang="greek">filo/neikos</foreign> the error was apparently
            established by Plutarch's time: see his <title>Ages.</title> 5. 4. The meaning
            ‘lover of strife’ is often unsuitable in Plato; where it suits, it
            is secondary and derivative, for the lover of victory must also love strife: <hi
              rend="italic">non sine pulvere palma.</hi> For an exhaustive discussion of the
            question the student may be referred to Schmidt <title>Ethik d. alten Griechen</title> I
            pp. 386—391. While admitting that ‘<foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >filo/nikos</foreign> and its derivatives are far more frequent in Attic
            writers,’ Schmidt is inclined to admit the existence of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >filo/neikos</foreign> as a separate word, connected with <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >nei/kh</foreign> as a byeform—so he thinks—of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >nei=kos</foreign>: but <foreign xml:lang="greek">nei/kh</foreign>, at least in classical
            Greek, is only a conjecture on Aeschylus <title>Ag.</title> 1378 and <title>Eum.</title>
            903: and in Plato, at all events, there is, I believe, no case in which <foreign

            although strictly speaking the <foreign xml:lang="greek">filo/sofon</foreign> can only care

            indeed quite true, as Nettleship reminds us (<title>Lect. and Rem.</title> II p. 322),
            that the higher kind of man learns more from the experience which he shares with the
            lower kind without having to go through nearly the same amount of it.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)lla\ mh\n ktl.</lem></app> Bosanquet observes that
            “this is perhaps a good argument to prove that the man of culture is
            preeminently competent to appraise the value of different ideals of life, but it is not
            a good argument to prove that he is a good judge of degrees of agreeable feeling in
            lives fundamentally different from his own” (similarly Nettleship l. c. p.
            321). True; but that is not the point. Plato is attempting to prove that the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">filo/sofos</foreign> is the best judge, not of ‘the degrees of
            agreeable feeling’ experienced, in one particular kind of life, but of the
            relative pleasure of three <hi rend="italic">different</hi> kinds of life, and his
            reasoning, granted that pleasures can be compared at all, is perfectly legitimate. Each
            of the three men pronounces his own life not merely <pb n="347"/> pleasant, but <hi
              rend="italic">pleasanter</hi> than those of the other two: how then are we to decide?
            Nothing but argument will help us, and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">filo/sofos</foreign> is
            the only one of the triad who possesses that weapon. It should be observed that
            throughout this part of the discussion Plato takes it for granted that some kinds of
            pleasure are in point of fact more pleasant than others. At present his object is to
            discover what these are, but in the argument which is still to come (585 B ff.), he
            grapples with the metaphysical question—for to him it was a question, not of
            psychology, but of metaphysics—and attempts to shew that pleasures contain
            more or less of pleasure according as there is in them more or less of truth.</p>

          <p>583B - 585A Our third and crowning proof is as follows. All the pleasures except those
            of the wise (<foreign xml:lang="greek">fro/nimoi</foreign>) are untrue and impure. We must
            recognise the existence of three distinct states, viz. Pleasure and Pain, which are
            positive and opposite, and the Neutral state, which is negative and intermediate. Men
            frequently identify the intermediate condition with Pleasure; but they are mistaken when
            they do so, for there are some pleasures, e.g. those of smell, which have a positive
            character of their own. Now bodily pleasures, so-called, together with the corresponding
            pleasures of anticipation, are for the most part merely ways of escape from pain, and
            belong to the neutral <pb n="348"/> state. They are falsely judged pleasant through

            only remains for us to hear the verdict of the metaphysical, to which Plato
            characteristically assigns the greatest value (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kai/toi
              —ptwma/twn</foreign> below). See on 577 C. Plato's theory of true or pure
            and false or impure pleasures reappears in the <title>Philebus.</title> Both dialogues
            teach (1) that Pleasure consists in <foreign xml:lang="greek">plh/rwsis</foreign>, (2) that
            the majority of bodily pleasures are not pleasures at all, but only <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">lupw=n a)pallagai/</foreign>, and (3) that there are other—true
            or pure—pleasures (e.g. smell) which are not preceded or followed by pain. The

            it earlier (see on VI 506 B and Jackson in <title>Journal of Philology</title> XXV pp.
            65—82), but the greater degree of elaboration which marks the treatment of

            hypothesis. Aristotle also touches on the question of Mixed and Unmixed Pleasures in

            discusthrowing, javelin-throwing) out of the five events in order to obtain the prize
            (see P. Gardner in <title>J. of H. Studies</title> I p. 217, where the evidence is
            quoted)? Schneider takes this view: but the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n
            ptwma/twn</foreign> below make it clear that the reference is only to wrestling. The
            point manifestly is, that as in wrestling the third throw decided the contest between
            two athletes (Schol. on <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 592">Aesch. <title>Eum.</title> 592</bibl>

            is pleasure said by Plato to be pure and true? It is pure when unadulterated by pain,
            whether antecedent, present or consequent; and there is also perhaps in Plato's use of
            the epithet ‘pure’ a relic or hint of the old half<pb n="349"/>
            ceremonial, half-religious idea of ‘pure from taint’: see App. III
            and Rohde <title>Psyche</title>^{2} II pp. 281 ff. al. But in its deepest signification
            the truth or purity of Pleasure involves the ontological theory that soul and its
            sustenance (knowledge etc.) have more part in Being and Truth than Body and its food:
            the spiritual and not the material is the true. See also on 586 E and especially

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tou=to ga\r ktl.</lem></app> The argument is as follows.
            While suffering pain, men are apt to look upon the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >h(suxi/a</foreign> from pain as the highest pleasure. Perhaps (suggests Glauco) at such
            a time the neutral state is in point of fact found positively pleasant and welcome by
            them. Socrates proceeds to shew (by a <hi rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum</hi> proof)
            that Glauco's suggestion is untenable. ‘In that case,’ he argues,
              ‘<foreign xml:lang="greek">h(suxi/a</foreign> from pleasure will in like manner
            be positively painful: and thus the neutral state, which we declared to be <hi
              rend="italic">between</hi> the two extremes, will upon occasions be both, viz. both
            pleasure and pain.’ Glauco allows that that which is neither cannot become
            both, and Socrates proceeds: In this instance the ‘both’ is a
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ki/nhsis</foreign>, and the ‘neither’ a
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(suxi/a</foreign>, and lies, as we have seen, between the two:
            so that it is wrong to identify the absence of pain with pleasure or the absence of
            pleasure with pain. Hence your suggestion is erroneous: <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)k
              e)/stin a)/ra tou=to, a)lla\ fai/netai ktl.</foreign> See below on 584 A. The argument

            the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ mh\n to/ ge h(du/</foreign> introduce a new reason

          <p>585A - 586C Consider the question also in this way. Hunger, thirst etc. are modes of
            physical depletion; and Ignorance is a form of spiritual emptiness. He who partakes of
            food, and he who acquires Knowledge or Reason, are each ‘filled’;
            but which of them is the more truly ‘filled’? Knowledge and its
            kindred have more reality and truth than Food etc., Soul than Body: hence the
            acquisition of knowledge is a truer form of replenishment than the other. The resulting
            Pleasure will therefore be more true. Those who are strangers to wisdom and virtue know
            nothing of true delights, but fight with one another for delusive and unsatisfying joys.</p>

            sentences are among the most perplexing in the whole of the <title>Republic</title>, or
            indeed in the whole of Plato's writings. That the reading of the MSS is corrupt has been
            admitted by the majority of critics, and will be proved in App. VI, to which I must
            refer for a full discussion on the text and interpretation of this difficult passage.
            Here it is possible only to set down what seems to me, after a review of all the
            conditions of the problem, the least unsatisfactory solution. The emendation in the
            text, which I printed in my <title>Text of the Republic</title>, has been approved by a
            critic in <title>Hermathena</title> XXIV p. 252. We have to discover whether food, drink
            etc. participate in pure Being more than true opinion, knowledge etc.; and the answer is
            arrived at by the following steps. (1) Which <hi rend="italic">is</hi>
            more—that which is connected with the ever-like, the immortal and Truth, and
            which is itself of this nature, and found in something of this nature; or that which is
            connected with the never-like and mortal, and which is itself of this nature (never-like
            etc.) and found in something of this nature? That which is connected with the ever-like,
            says Glauco, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> more. (2) Then does the Being of the <hi
              rend="italic">never</hi>-like (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ei\
            <emph>a)n</emph>omoi/ou</foreign>= <foreign xml:lang="greek">mhde/pote o(moi/ou</foreign>)
            participate in Being at all more than the Being of Knowledge does? Certainly not
              (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)=n</foreign> is strictly illative: if it is true that what
            is connected with the ever-like <hi rend="italic">is</hi> more than what is connected
            with the never-like, then the Being of the never-like cannot <hi rend="italic">be</hi>
            more than Knowledge is—for Knowledge of course <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/xetai
              tou= a)ei\ o(moi/ou</foreign>. Knowledge is in short taken as a type of that which
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/xetai tou= a)ei\ o(moi/ou</foreign>). (3) Or has the Being of
            the never-like more part in <title>Truth</title> than Knowledge has? To this also the
            answer is no: [for that which is connected with the ever-like—and Knowledge is
            so—is connected also with Truth: see above <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ tou=
              a)ei\ o(moi/ou e)xo/menon—kai\ a)lhqei/as</foreign>]. (4) And if it has <hi
              rend="italic">less</hi> part in truth [as it has], it must also have less part in
            Being. [This deduces from step (3) the conclusion already implied in (2), and also paves
            the way for <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)kou=n o(/lws—mete/xei</foreign>]. (5)
            Thus—since what is true of Knowledge is true of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the
            spiritual <foreign xml:lang="greek">ge/nh</foreign>, [and since food etc. are of course only
            particular examples of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ei\ a)no/moion</foreign> or
            never-like], universally (<foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/lws</foreign>) those <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ge/nh</foreign> which are concerned with the care of the body have less
            part in Being and Truth than those which are concerned with the care of the soul. For a

            perhaps more likely: for it is more in keeping with the somewhat loose structure of the

              (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ au)to/</foreign>) is most probably

          <p>586C - 588A The pleasures of anger, unless pursued in conformity with reason, are
            similarly unreal. We may even venture to say that it is only when obedient to knowledge
            that the desires of the two lower parts of soul can attain those pleasures which are in
            the highest sense their own and true—so far as it is possible for them to have
            true pleasures at all. Now the tyrannical desires are farthest from reason, so that the
            tyrant has least pleasure. By an elaborate calculation it is shewn that the king lives
            seven-hundred and twenty-nine times more pleasantly than the tyrant; and if the just man
            so far surpasses the unjust in respect of pleasure, how much greater will be his

            Plato concedes after all a certain measure of reality and truth to the pleasures of the

            Plato makes (cf. Grimmelt <hi rend="italic">de reip. comp. et unit.</hi> p. 76), and
            also remember that in the perfect city, which is the counterpart of the perfect soul,
            the lower orders found their truest pleasure in working for the common welfare under
            reason as embodied in the Guardians. The gist of the present passage is well expressed
            by Nettleship, who in his <title>Lectures and Remains</title> II p. 331 remarks
            “that in the most trivial satisfaction there may be a sense of serving

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o(/sw| a)hde/steron ktl.</lem></app> Plato loved to play
            with mathematics, and in the following passage he endeavours to give an arithmetical
            expression to the pleasures of justice and injustice. His motive in introducing this
            “hedonistic calculus,” as Bosanquet calls it, has been much
            discussed. The following considerations deserve attention. (1) On artistic grounds, now
            that the argument has been concluded, it is not inappropriate that Justice and
            Injustice, represented by the <pb n="359"/> King and the Tyrant, should as it were be
            weighed in the balance. The importance of <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)riqmei=n, metrei=n,
              i(sta/nai</foreign> is constantly present to Plato's mind. See on X 602 D. (2) The
            Pythagoreans were in the habit of expressing virtues and other immaterial ideas in terms
            of numbers (see Zeller^{5} I pp. 389 ff.), and there is reason to suppose that the
            number 729 played a part in a Pythagorean calendar (588 A note). Some of the terms
            employed by Plato, such as <foreign xml:lang="greek">tri/th au)/ch</foreign>, are also in
            all probability of Pythagorean origin. See App. I to Book VIII pp. 279 ff. (3) The
            arithmetical method of calculation enables Plato to set forth in a very striking and
            dramatic way his own dissent from the popular estimate of the tyrant's happiness
            (Schneider). (4) When all is said we must allow that some of the steps are arbitrary,
            and that Plato's main object is to reach the significant number 729, so as to indicate
            that the king has more pleasure than the tyrant every day and every night of his life.
            There is of course an element of playfulness in the episode, and we need not suppose
            that Plato set any particular store by his calculations: but neither ought we on the
            other hand to dismiss the whole reckoning as a meaningless and foolish jest. See also on
            VIII 545 C.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">triw=n h(donw=n ktl.</lem></app> The three pleasures are
            those of the king, the timocrat, and the oligarch. The first variety is genuine, the
            second and third spurious: but the tyrant has ‘crossed the line into the
            region beyond the spurious,’ i.e. his pleasures represent a still lower depth
            (see 571 B ff.), being in fact only <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/dwla</foreign> twice
            removed of the oligarch's spurious pleasures (587 C). Schleiermacher made <foreign

            defensible (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 112B"><title>Phaed.</title> 112 B</bibl>), and
            even attractive at first sight; but <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n no/qwn</foreign> must be

          <p>Nicom. <title>Introd. Ar.</title> p. 117 Ast. Relatively to themselves, we reckoned the
            oligarch, democrat, and tyrant, as 1, 2, 3; but we have since found that the distance of
            the oligarch from true pleasure is in reality 3 times I: hence that of the tyrant must
            be 3 times 3, as in the line AB. We should doubtless regard the intervening numbers (4,
            5, and 7, 8) as indicating different stages in the gradual degeneration of the oligarch
            into the democrat (559 D ff.) and the democrat into the tyrant or tyrannical man (572 D
            ff.). It might seem more natural to make the distance of the tyrant from true pleasure 5
            and not 9 (King 1, Timocrat 2, Oligarch 3, Democrat 4, Tyrant 5); but (as Schneider
            reminds us) the pleasures of the Democrat and Tyrant lie <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi>
            the two spurious pleasures, so that the modulus of progression may reasonably be
            increased. Plato's chief object is however to reach the number 729, and he could not do
            so except by making a fresh departure with the oligarch.</p>

            This explanation, which so far agrees with that of the Scholiast, is adopted by the
            English translators and editors; but Schneider (l.c. and on p. 313 of his translation)
            holds that <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi/pedon ktl.</foreign> invites us to raise to the
            second power not 3, but 9—the number which we are presently expected to raise
            to the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> power. The inferential <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >a)/ra</foreign> seems to me in favour of the Scholiast's view, as well as <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">kata\ to\n tou= mh/kous a)riqmo/n</foreign> (cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >kata\ to\ mh=kos</foreign> in Theo p. 31 al.), an expression which corresponds to
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)riqmw=|</foreign> in the previous sentence while at the same
            time preparing us for <foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\ de\ du/namin kai\ tri/thn
            au)/chn</foreign> in the next. The whole sentence is, I believe, only a way of saying
            that, if the tyrant is 3 x 3 degrees distant from true pleasure, his <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ei)/dwlon</foreign> of pleasure may be represented by 9. The use of the
            mathematical term <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi/pedon</foreign> has a playful effect, both
            in itself and also because it sounds wilful and eccentric to express a number of <hi
              rend="italic">one</hi> ‘increase’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n tou=
              mh/kous a)riqmo/n</foreign>) in terms of two. <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            increase (viz. of the unit or point) was <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( tou= mh/kous
            a)riqmo/s</foreign>, i.e. in this case (1 x 9=) 9: by the second-and-third increases (on
            the same scale) we obtain 9 x 9 (second increase or <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >du/namis</foreign>) x 9 (third increase or <foreign xml:lang="greek">tri/th
            au)/ch</foreign>)=729. See App. I to Book VIII p. 279. Schneider's erroneous idea that
            the squaring of 9 has already been alluded to in <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >e)pi/pedon—ei)/h</foreign> leads him to take <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >du/namin</foreign> as merely ‘power’ and <foreign xml:lang="greek"

              >du/namin</foreign> additum.” What motive induced Plato to cube the
            distance? Was it something purely fanciful, e.g. “in order to gauge the <hi
              rend="italic">depth</hi> of the tyrant's misery” (J. and C.), or because the
            king and the tyrant are themselves solid creatures (cf. Arist. Quint. <hi rend="italic"
              >de Mus.</hi> III p. 89. 35 Jahn)? I think not. He probably intended to suggest that
            “the degradation proceeds by increasingly wide intervals”
            (Bosanquet), but the actual calculations are inspired by a desire to reach the total
            729. See on 588 A. <pb n="361"/></p>

            at issue, as originally raised in Book II, was the relation between Justice and
            Injustice, not the relation between the King and the Tyrant: and before giving his final
            answer, Plato does well to remind us that the King and the Tyrant are only types of
            Justice and Injustice. Cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( a)gaqo\s—

            and Philolaus counted 364 1/2 days, and presumably therefore 364 1/2 nights in the year
            (Censor. <hi rend="italic">de die nat.</hi> 19). This explains <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >h(me/rai kai\ nu/ktes</foreign>. It is not so obvious in what way the number 729 is
            related to months. On this subject J. and C. remark “12 months in a year: 30 +
            1/3 days in a month: 12 x (30 + 1/3)= 364: 2 x 364 1/2=729.” I can see no
            point in such a calculation. Susemihl on the other hand reminds us that Philolaus
            believed in a so-called great year of 729 months, and as Plato is following Philolaus in
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(me/rai kai\ nu/ktes</foreign>, we may reasonably suppose that
            he does so in the rest of the passage, so that <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\
            mh=nes</foreign> will be a reference to Philolaus' great year. See Sus. <title>Gen.
              Entw.</title> II p. 244 note 3, and on the subject of Philolaus' year of 729 months
            Zeller^{5} I p. 428 note 3. I have as yet found no evidence for supposing that Philolaus
            went a step farther and postulated a yet greater year of 729 ordinary years, but the
            words <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ e)niautoi/</foreign> in Plato make it probable that he
            did so. On this supposition the full explanation of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >prosh/konta—e)niautoi/</foreign> will be</p>
          <p>days and nights=1 year.</p>

          <p>The general upshot is that the king is happier than the tyrant every day and every
            night of his life, rather than (as Bosanquet suggests) that “one day of the
            good life is worth a year of the bad”; “a day in thy courts is

            therefore be held to favour the reading <foreign xml:lang="greek">plei/oni</foreign>, which

          <p>588A - 589B We are now in a position to refute the thesis that Injustice combined with
            a reputation for Justice is profitable for him who is unjust. The soul may be likened to
            a composite creature —part bestial, part leonine, part human,
            —wearing the outward semblance of humanity. He who maintains that Injustice
            profits a man, holds that it is profitable to starve the human element and make strong
            the rest, and encourage strife and sedition within the soul. The advocate of Justice on
            the other hand asserts that the human element should have the mastery and bring the

            ‘parts’ of soul to the highest (586 E note); and this subjection is

          <p>589B - 591A The panegyrist of Justice is thus victorious on every count. His opponent
            will surrender when he understands that Virtue subjects the bestial to the human, nay
            rather to the element of God within us, while of Vice the opposite is true. Shall it
            profit a man to take gold unjustly and make his soul a slave? We may also define
            intemperance, selfwill, discontent, cowardice, servility and meanness, and the vulgarity
            which we associate with mechanical pursuits, in terms of our comparison. The better must
            rule the worse—such is our principle, and it is in harmony with the aims both

            appertains to the body and its state, as well as to the acquisition of riches and
            honours. Will he take part in political life? Perhaps not in the land of his birth, but
            in his own true city assuredly he will. It may be that the perfect city is an ensample

            reformation, since Punishment is the appointed cure for Vice. It may be doubted whether

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)to\ katoiki/zein</foreign> (Herwerden) do not merit

              “<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n ou)ranw=|</foreign>, that is, in the idea of the
            divinity: see the beginning of the following book.” Apparently he understood
            the words of the Heaven of Ideas, a view which has, with various modifications and
            qualifications, found favour also with other critics (see Steinhart
            <title>Einleitung</title> p. 254 and cf. Susemihl <title>Gen. Entw.</title> II p. 248
            ff. Proclus <hi rend="italic">in Tim.</hi> 269 E seems to interpret the <foreign

              xml:lang="greek">e)n ou)ranw=|</foreign> of the ‘Weltall’ or
            Macrocosm, as if the Universe itself were one great ideal city, after whose pattern we
            should regulate the City of the Soul (see Steinhart l. c. and p. 270 with <bibl
              n="Plat. Tim. 47B"><title>Tim.</title> 47 B</bibl>, 90 D); but, as Schneider points
            out, we can hardly reconcile such an interpretation with VII 529 C—530 C, and
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)na/keitai</foreign> is also against it. The sentence may be
            compared with <bibl n="Plat. Plt. 297C"><title>Pol.</title> 297 C</bibl>,
            <title>Laws</title> 713 B ff. and especially 739 D, E, where the polity of the

              xml:lang="greek">tw=| boulome/nw| o(ra=n kai\ o(rw=nti</foreign>. Plato's language is
            extraordinarily suggestive, and I confess that to me, as apparently to Susemihl (l. c.
            p. 249), these words suggest, not indeed the doctrine of Anamnesis in all its bearings,
            but something of the half-religious, half-poetical atmosphere with which Plato invests
            that doctrine in the <title>Phaedrus.</title> The mysterious and haunting phrase
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n ou)ranw=| para/deigma</foreign> recalls the
            ‘imperial palace whence we came,’ and the whole sentence reminds us
            once again of that profound and inspiring doctrine <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/nqrwpos
              ou)ra/nion futo/n, ou)k e)/ggeion</foreign>, which, as I have often pointed out,
            underlies so much of Platonism. The sister-doctrine of Immortality seems also to be
            implied, and from this point of view the Christian parallels are highly remarkable and
            significant: see for example <title>Philipp.</title> 3. 30 <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(mw=n
              ga\r to\ poli/teuma e)n ou)ranoi=s u(pa/rxei</foreign>, and many other passages in the
            New Testament, e.g. <title>Hebr.</title> 11. 16, 12. 23, 13. 14: 1 <title>Pet.</title>
            i. 4, 2. iii. 13. I do not venture to assert that Plato consciously and deliberately
            thought of Anamnesis and Immortality when he wrote <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n
            ou)ranw=|</foreign> etc., but the words are steeped in the fragrance of these beliefs;
            and to regard the reference to heaven “as a mere passing figure of
            speech” (Bosanquet) seems to me to do less than justice to the wonderful depth
            and fervour of this passage.</p>

            themselves, the words of Plato would mean only that the philosopher will abstain from
            public and political life except when some ‘divine chance’ enables
            him to exercise his true vocation. But taken in connexion with <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >e(auto\n katoiki/zein</foreign> they mean more. In founding the city <hi
              rend="italic">within himself</hi> after the likeness of the heavenly city the
            philosopher is in <pb n="371"/> reality a true <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            perfect State: even while he lives, he is already in a sense a citizen of Heaven, for
            the Kingdom of Heaven is reproduced within him. In existing cities the truest
            politicians are sometimes those who abstain from politics altogether, according to <bibl

              (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 254) and Christ (<title>Gr. Literaturgesch.</title> p.
            348 note 6) that Plato now speaks much less hopefully than before of the prospects of
            realising his ideal city upon earth: see on V 470 E, VI 499 C and 502 C. It is possible
            to force some of the earlier allusions into a sort of harmony with the words of this
            passage (see for example Hirmer <title>Entst. u. Komp. d. Pl. Pol.</title> pp. 637 ff.);
            but we cannot help feeling that the tone and atmosphere are very different. Steinhart
            (l.c. p. 703 note 264) traces the difference to Plato's disappointed hopes of the
            younger Dionysius. The conjecture is interesting, but even without this stimulus Plato
            may well have come to feel that his <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalli/polis</foreign> is
            hardly of this world (cf. <title>Laws</title> 713 B), and that its true value lies in
            the religious, political, and moral ideals which it holds before mankind. <pb n="384"/>

            Examine it in the light of the Ideas, and you will find that it is the production of
            images or appearances which are third in order from Reality and Truth. There are, for
            example, three beds: (1) that which is in Nature, made, as we may say, by God: (2) that

              >dhmiourgo/s</foreign>), viz. the carpenter. There is also (3) an imitator, i.e. the
            painter. Imitation is therefore concerned with a product third in sequence from Nature,
            and the tragic poet, among other imitators, is third from Royalty and Truth.</p>
          <p>ff. Book X falls into two divisions, the first (595 A—608 B) dealing with
            Poetry, the second (608 C—621 D) with Immortality and the rewards of Justice
            both here and hereafter. The second half of the Book forms a welcome supplement to
            Plato's treatment of the main thesis of the <title>Republic</title> (see on 608 C); but
            the first division is of the nature of an episode, and might have been omitted without
            injury to the artistic unity of the dialogue (cf. Hirmer <title>Entst. u. Komp. d. pl.
              Pol.</title> p. 623). It is in no sense, as supposed by Schleiermacher
              (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 55) and apparently also by Hirzel (<hi rend="italic">der
              Dialog</hi> I p. 237 note), a fulfilment of the promise held out in III 392 C; nor
            ought we to construe <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)/sws de\ kai\ plei/w e)/ti
            tou/twn</foreign> III 394 D as a hint that the subject of Poetry is to be resumed: see
            note ad loc. Why then is the episode introduced at all? The chorizontists (such as
            Siebeck <title>Unters. zur Phil. d. Griech.</title> pp. 142 ff., Pfleiderer <hi
              rend="italic">zur Lösung</hi> etc. p. 34 and Brandt <hi rend="italic">zur
              Entwick. d. Pl. Lehre d. Seelenteilen</hi> p. 27), relying partly on the tone of the
            exordium, partly on <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)polelogh/sqw</foreign> 607 B, assert that
            Plato is replying to certain comic poets (Pfleiderer), or to Antisthenes (Brandt), who
            had presumably fallen foul of Plato's treatment of Poetry in Books II and III. Cf. also
            Zeller^{4} II p. 556 note 2. But apart altogether from the question whether the
              <title>Republic</title> was issued <hi rend="italic">en bloc</hi> or piecemeal, there
            is no actual evidence to support the presumption on which this theory rests (cf. 598 D,
            607 B notes). The Platonic dialogue, like actual conversation, is at liberty to recall,
            modify, and expand the results of a discussion apparently finished (cf. Hirzel l.c. pp.
            228—230, 236); and we have already had an incidental recurrence to the subject
            of Poetry in VIII 568 A—D. Granted that Plato wished to justify his exclusion
            of the Muses by metaphysical and psychological as well as moral and paedagogic
            arguments, the beginning of Book X is his best, and indeed, as Hirmer shews (l.c. p.
            625), his only opportunity: see on 595 B. He may well have wished to do so: for his
            dethronement of the great educator of Greece (606 E) would be sure to arouse wide-spread
            hostility, and Plato almost seems to feel that it needs further justification even to
            himself (595 B note). Cf. Hirmer l.c. pp. 624—628 and see also on 598 D, 607

            Aesthetics in Walter <title>Gesch. d. Aesthetik im Altertum</title> (1893) pp.
            168—476. His attitude towards Poetry and Poets is <pb n="385"/> very fully
            discussed by Reber <title>Platon u. die Poesie</title> (1864). Heine <hi rend="italic"
              >de rat. quae Platoni cum poet. Gr. intercedit</hi>, etc. (1880), and more recently by

              <title>Die Stellung d. Poesie in d. plat. Phil.</title> (1901). Following on the path
            marked out by Belger in his dissertation <hi rend="italic">de Arist. etiam in arte
              poetica Platonis discip.</hi> (1872), Finsler has succeeded in shewing that
            Aristotle's debt to Plato in his Theory of Poetry is far greater than is commonly
            supposed: and although the treatment of Poetry in Book X of the <title>Republic</title>
            must be confessed to be inadequate and unjust, Plato himself, as Walter and
            Stählin have recognised, furnishes us elsewhere with the materials for
            constructing a truer and more generous theory. See also on 598 E. It may be added that a
            study of the <title>Poetics</title> of Aristotle side by side with 595 A— 608
            B will enable the student to understand both Plato and Aristotle better than if he

            with real feeling: no one who had so much of the poet in himself could be insensible to
            Homer's charm, and nearly every dialogue of Plato bears evidence of the affectionate
            admiration in which he held the ‘first of tragic poets.’ See Heine

            pain. From the way in which Plato here speaks, it looks as if he feared that his heart
            might after all get the better of his head (cf. infra 605 C, D, 606 B, 607 C ff.), and
            consequently tried by new and deeper arguments to provide an

            question-begging connotation, was in many ways an unfortunate word by which to describe
            the essence of Art, though in view of what Aristotle made of it, I should not go so far
            as to say that ‘Imitation is an unproductive principle, and dries up aesthetic
            life’ (ib.). If Poetry, and not Painting and Statuary, had determined the
            Greek view of Art, we should probably hear more of Creation (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >poi/hsis</foreign>), and less of Imitation, in ancient discussions on aesthetics; and
            it is difficult not to regret that Plato did not select a new and more fruitful point of

            A (see note ad loc.), so here, Plato does not try to prove the Ideal Theory, but treats
            Glauco as already a loyal Platonist. The account which Plato here gives of his Ideas has
            been widely canvassed from many different points of view. Bosanquet
            (<title>Companion</title> pp. 381 ff.) appears to me to err by interpreting it
            throughout only in terms of modern life and thought. Others refuse to regard it as
            serious, in view of the inherent difficulties, and because of Aristotle's remark

            Bonitz's note. Others, again, like Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> pp. 242 ff.), hold that
            the Ideal Theory in Bk X is inconsistent with the theory expounded in V—VII,
            where we do not hear of Ideas corresponding to concrete and artificial objects, but only
            of Ideas of qualities (such as Justice) and the like. In reply to the last school of
            critics, we may point out that Plato is not bound to give an exhaustive account of the
            Ideal theory whenever he has occasion to make use of it. On the previous occasion he
            confined himself to Ideas of the virtues etc., because they only were relevant to his
            immediate purpose (see on V 476 A and cf. Grimmelt <hi rend="italic">de reip. Pl. comp.
              et unit.</hi> pp. 81 ff., Hirmer l.c. pp. 646 ff. and Dümmler <hi
              rend="italic">zur Comp. d. Pl. St.</hi> p. 14), and it is exactly the same reason
            which makes him cite Ideas of concrete and artificial objects in Book X. The view that
            Plato should not be taken seriously is as old as Proclus, who (<hi rend="italic">in
            Tim.</hi> 104 F) observes <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou) ga\r kata/: tinas i)de/as o(

            recurrence of the same form of the theory in other dialogues (see on 596 B, C) justifies
            us in taking Plato here also at his word. The history of the controversy is ably
            reviewed by Dr Beckmann (<title>Num Plato artefactorum ideas statuerit</title>, Bonn
            1889), with whom and with Zeller^{4} II pp. 666, 701 al. I agree in believing this
            passage to be an authoritative exposition of the Ideal theory on one of its many sides.</p>

            although the difficulties which such a view involves are undeniably greater in the one

              xml:lang="greek">h( fu/sis</foreign> means ‘Nature’ i.e. <hi
              rend="italic">rerum natura</hi> (cf. R. G. Bury in <title>Cl. Rev.</title> VIII p.
            299), but for Plato <hi rend="italic">rerum natura</hi>, strictly interpreted, is the
            Ideal World. Plato's nomenclature is in harmony with the traditional usage of Greek
            philosophy, for “in Greek philosophical language, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >fu/sis</foreign> always means that which is primary, fundamental, and persistent, as
            opposed to that which is secondary, derivative, and transient” (Burnet
              <title>Early Greek Phil.</title> p. 11). Now in Platonism the primary, fundamental,
            persistent, is the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)=dos</foreign>: and hence the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">fu/sis</foreign> or ‘nature’ of anything means its
            Idea (e.g. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 254B"><title>Phaedr.</title> 254 B</bibl>
            <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( mnh/mh pro\s th\n tou= ka/llous fu/sin h)ne/xqh</foreign>), and
            the <foreign xml:lang="greek">fu/sis</foreign> or nature of <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
            things (<hi rend="italic">rerum natura</hi>) becomes an expression for the World of
            Ideas (“regio idearum, <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( nohto\s
            to/pos</foreign>” Schneider). Bosanquet would like to render <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">fu/sis</foreign> by ‘evolution,’ “without
            understanding any definite theory of origins.” Such a translation would be, in
            my judgment, not only gravely misleading, but linguistically wrong; for <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)n th=| fu/sei ou)=sa</foreign> cannot mean ‘which evolution
              <hi rend="italic">has produced</hi>’: the force of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >e)n</foreign> must be local—figuratively so, of course— exactly as
            in <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/sper paradei/gmata e(sta/nai e)n th=| fu/sei</foreign>
            referred to above. So also J. B. Mayor in <title>Cl. Rev.</title> X p. 121. To Krohn,
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">fu/sis</foreign> appears to be “die allgemeine
            Gesetzlichkeit des Universums, die dem <foreign xml:lang="greek">dhmiourgo/s</foreign> die
            Musterbilder liefert” (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 249). This is nearer the
            truth, but we must not surrender the self-existence of the Ideas. See also on 597 D.</p>

            “Occurrit, ut videtur, quasi ex improviso Platoni, Deum Idearum auctorem
            appellare” says Pansch (<hi rend="italic">de deo Platonis</hi> p. 45), truly
            enough, in the restricted sense that we ought to lay no stress on this passage <hi

            <pb n="391"/>
            <hi rend="italic">itself</hi> as evidence for the origin of the Ideas. But, if God and
            the Idea of Good are the same (see on VI 505 A ff.), Plato is merely saying in
            theological language what he formerly said in philosophical, when he derived the
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign> of all other Ideas from the Idea of Good (VI
            509 B). See Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> p. 242, where the same explanation is given,
            and Zeller^{4} II p. 666. It is not, I think, quite correct to dismiss <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">qeo/s</foreign> as merely “eine mythische
            Ausdrucksweise” (Hirmer <title>Entstehung u. Komp.</title> etc. p. 647), and
            Susemihl (<title>Einleitung</title> p. 262) is certainly wrong when he takes it to mean
              ‘<hi rend="italic">a</hi> god.’ The sentence has been much
            discussed in connexion with the theory that Plato's Ideas are ‘thoughts of
            God’: see for example Hermann <hi rend="italic">de loco Plat. de rep.</hi> VI
            505 sq. p. 5 with Bonitz's reply <title>Disput. Pl. duae</title> p. 33 and Hermann's

            664— 670. I have already said in App. III to Book VII that Plato himself says
            nothing to shew that he viewed his Ideas in this light; and it is only by reading into
            his words much more than they are naturally fitted to convey, that the present passage
            can be made to support the identification.</p>

            to do so, since he has made both this and all besides in their essential
            nature.’ Connected with the notion ‘bed’ (observe the
            neuter <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou/tou</foreign>), there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi>
            makers: (1) its <foreign xml:lang="greek">futourgo/s</foreign>, who makes <foreign

            >dhmi-ourgo/s</foreign>, who makes <foreign xml:lang="greek">kli/nh tis</foreign>, a
            particular material bed. The first is God— the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >futourgo/s</foreign> not only of ‘bed’ but of all else: the
            second a carpenter. <foreign xml:lang="greek">futourgo/s</foreign> is used by Plato in the
            peculiar sense of <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( fu/sei-ti poiw=n</foreign>, the maker of e.g.
            the bed-by-nature, the table-by-nature, etc.; and the peculiar form of Glauco's answer
              (<foreign xml:lang="greek">di/kaion gou=n ktl.</foreign>) shews that he was sensible of
            the linguistic experiment. Plato's meaning would have been easier for us to catch if
            (using substantives instead of pronouns), he had said <foreign xml:lang="greek">mi/an fu/sei
              kli/nhn e)/fusen</foreign> (created one bed-by-nature, cf. VI 501 B <foreign

            nature (i.e. the Idea) of the thing in q&lt;*&gt; tion. Schleiermacher,
            Schneider, &lt;*&gt; Müller, to judge from their
            translatio&lt;*&gt; held the same view. The English tra&lt;*&gt; lators

            crea&lt;*&gt; (D. and V.) or ‘by the natural proce&lt;*&gt;

            and 605 A) may be illustrated by Simonides' remark that ‘Poetry is vocal
            Painting,’ as ‘Painting is silent Poetry’ (<foreign

          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tri/tos tis ktl.</lem></app>: ‘as it were third
            from King and Truth.’ The metaphor is a genealogical one (cf. III 391 C
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">*phle/ws, swfronesta/tou te kai\ tri/tou a)po\
            *dio/s</foreign>), and the King corresponds of course to the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >futourgo/s</foreign> or God. On the one hand we have (1) God, (2) the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">te/ktwn</foreign>, (3) the <foreign xml:lang="greek">mimhth/s</foreign>: on

              tri/ton ge/nnhma a)po\ th=s fu/sews</foreign>, so the imitator is ‘third in
            descent’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">tri/tos — pefukw/s</foreign>) and
            consequently two degrees removed from <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( qeo/s</foreign>. The
            propriety of the term <foreign xml:lang="greek">basile/ws</foreign> will be seen if we
            translate Plato's theological phraseology into its philosophical equivalent. When he
            tells us that God constructs the Idea of Bed, he means that the Idea of Good is the
            source of that Idea (597 B note), and the Idea of Good is <title>King</title> of the
            Ideal World: see VI 509 D. This is the application of the phrase: but it is possible
            enough that the expression itself was half-proverbial in Plato's time, and referred
            originally to the person who stood next but one in order of succession to the Persian
            throne. See App. I. The general sense is well illustrated by J. and C. from Dante <hi
              rend="italic">In-</hi>
            <pb n="393"/>
            <hi rend="italic">ferno</hi> 11. 105 Si che vostr' arte a Dio quasi è nipote,
            i.e. Art is Nature's daughter, as Nature is God's: ‘so that your art is as it
            were the grandchild of God.’ It should be noticed that the drift of Plato's
            meaning can be expressed in terms of the simile of the line. The <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >au)to\ d e)/sti kli/nh</foreign>, for example, belongs to <title>EB</title> (see Fig.

            and the picture of a Bed to the realm of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)ko/nes</foreign>, that
            is to say <title>AD.</title> Similarly we may suppose that the state of mind of the
            carpenter is <foreign xml:lang="greek">pi/stis</foreign>, and that of the Painter <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ei)kasi/a</foreign>. See below on 601 E and cf. App. I to Book VII. Other

            I to Book VII). Yet the highest art has in every age claimed to portray, not the
            so-called actual, but the Ideal: see for example Arist. <title>Poet.</title> 25. 6 and
            17: “It may be impossible that there should be men such as Zeuxis painted.
            ‘Yes,’ we say, ‘but <hi rend="italic">the impossible is
              the higher thing; for the ideal type must surpass the
            reality</hi>’” (Butcher's translation), and the recent development
            of this idea by W. J. Courthope, <title>Life in Poetry and Law in Taste</title> pp. 152,
            165, 196 ff. and passim. In the present passage, Plato bases his unfavourable verdict on
            what must be admitted to be a narrow and scholastic interpretation of his own ontology,
            but in view of Books II and III as well as 605 C— 607 A below, we can hardly
            doubt that his attitude was determined in the first instance by educational rather than
            by metaphysical considerations, and that throughout the whole of Book X he was thinking
            less of the inherent possibilities of Art, than of actual Greek Art and Poetry
            considered as the exponents of a moral and religious creed which Plato himself
            emphatically disowns. See also on 607 A. In any case, the objections which he here urges
            do not touch the real essence of any form of Art except pure and unadulterated realism.
            Elsewhere throughout the Platonic writings there are not wanting indications of a juster
            estimate of the artistic faculty and its possibilities (see for example III 401
            B—403 C, and especially V 472 D, and cf. Walter <title>Gesch. d. Aesthetik im
              Altertum</title> pp. 441 ff., 459 ff. and Stählin <title>Stellung d. Poesie
              in d. Plat. Phil.</title> pp. 56—65), and the sympathetic student of Plato
            will find it easy to construct a nobler and more generous theory of Aesthetic Art out of
            the doctrine of Ideas together with its corollaries of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >a)na/mnhsis</foreign> and pre-existence. It is also a historical fact that Plato's own

            inspiration to some of the greatest artists, notably, for instance, in connexion with
            the Platonic Academy at Florence in the days of Michel Angelo: see Symonds,
              <title>Renaissance in Italy</title> II pp. 205, 207, 247, 323 ff. Those who have
            caught the spirit of Plato's teaching will agree with me when I say that the famous
            lines of Wordsworth on King's College Chapel</p>
          <p>“They dreamt not of a perishable home, Who thus could build,”</p>
          <p>are more truly and characteristically Platonic than Plato's attack upon poetry and
            painting in this passage.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)=ra oi(=a e)/stin ktl.</lem></app> The painter, as
            Bosanquet reminds us, operates in two dimensions, and so cannot copy the material bed
            “in its solid completeness, but <pb n="394"/> only his partial view of
            it” i.e. the bed as it <hi rend="italic">appears</hi> to him from one point of
            view, a particular <foreign xml:lang="greek">fa/ntasma</foreign> of bed. His work, in fact,
            is <foreign xml:lang="greek">skiagrafi/a</foreign> (II 365 C note). It will follow that
            Painting is a stage lower than ‘third from truth,’ but Plato does
            not press the point, and in 599 A and D Poetry—the sister art to
            Painting—remains as before only <foreign xml:lang="greek">tri/ton a)po\ th=s

              d. Poesie</title> etc. p. 26) takes this as a specific reference to Antisthenes.
            Antisthenes, in the first place, denied the Ideal theory and held that there could be no
            knowledge except of particulars: so that Plato might well insinuate that he was
            incapable of distinguishing knowledge from ignorance: cf. V 476 D note In the second
            place, Antisthenes was a champion of Homer, and discovered a sort of moral philosophy in
            his works (see <title>Frag.</title> 24—28 in Winckelmann <title>Antisth.
            Frag.</title> and Zeller^{4} II pp. 330 ff.). On the strength of these two facts
            Stählin has evolved the ingenious theory that Plato's motive throughout this
            part of the discussion is a purely polemical one, and that he did not seriously consider
            Poetry only ‘third from Royalty and Truth.’ Plato, thinks
            Stählin, says in effect: ‘Antisthenes holds that poets have knowledge
            of and copy particulars; but there is no knowledge of particulars, and particulars are
            copies of Ideas, so that on Antisthenes's own shewing Poets are ignorant, and Poetry is
            thrice removed from Truth: whereas Antisthenes thinks Homer was omniscient.’
            The dagger is only lath: for Antisthenes was not an Idealist. Yet it is tolerably clear
            that Plato is refuting a view of poetry which found enthusiastic advocates in his own
            time, and Antisthenes may have been one of these, though the evidence falls far short of
            proof (see next note): but the purpose of this investigation is certainly not polemical
            and nothing more, and in spite of other passages in which Plato takes a more generous
            view of Poetry (see on 598 E), there is no good reason to suppose that his hostility is
            otherwise than serious here. See also on line 28.</p>
          <p>598D - 601B We hear it said that tragedians, including Homer, have knowledge of that
            whereof they write; but it is not so. No one would seriously give himself to the
            production of copies if he could make originals. If the poet possessed true knowledge of
            what he imitates, he would rather do great deeds than sing of them; and Homer rendered
            no services to his fellow men in the sphere of action, <pb n="396"/> invention, or even
            education, as the neglect he suffered in his own lifetime abundantly proves. The fact is
            that the Poet writes without knowledge. His productions are but images of images, and
            owe all their charm to their poetic setting.</p>

            C note In <foreign xml:lang="greek">tinwn</foreign> Dümmler and Stälhlin
            (ll. cc.) again recognise Antisthenes, but although Antisthenes seems to have believed
            in Homer, there is no evidence that he was a champion of Tragedy (note <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o(/ti ou(=toi ktl.</foreign>); and he was certainly not the only person
            in whose eyes Homer was regarded as at once a universal genius and the educator of the
            whole of Greece. It is not necessary to suppose that Plato has any individual person in
            his mind: there must have been many such apologists of Homer and dramatic poetry in
            Plato's day, and Plato as usual individualizes the type. See for instance the
            <title>Ion</title> of Plato and <bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 1008">Ar. <title>Frogs</title>
            1008</bibl> ff. It will, no doubt, help us to appreciate Plato's attitude towards Poetry
            if we remember that she was the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> rival of Philosophy, and
            that (as Munk observes, <hi rend="italic">die nat. Ordnung d. Plat. Schr.</hi> pp. 313

            take the place which Poetry had hitherto filled in educational theory and practice: see

            to suppose that Plato was actuated by any feeling of personal jealousy towards Homer,
            and aspired to supplant him in the admiration of his countrvmen: ‘there is no
            envy in the choir divine’ (<bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 247A"><title>Phaedr.</title>
              247 A</bibl>). There is something almost pathetic in Dionysius' inability to
            understand and appreciate Plato when he assures us with monotonous and feeble iteration
            that ‘there was, there really was in Plato's nature, with all its excellences,
            something of vainglory. He shewed this particularly in his jealousy of Homer, whom he
            expels from his imaginary commonwealth after crowning him with a garland and anointing
            him with myrrh’ (<title>Letter to Pompeius</title> § 756, translated

            suppose (with Dümmler and Stählin, ll. cc.) that Antisthenes alone is
            intended, for Plato seems to be alluding to a tolerably widespread view and one which
            was freely represented in Apologies of Poetry. Understood in its full significance, the
            theory of Poetry which Plato is here combating requires us to believe that a poet who
            can represent a general, a pilot etc., knows the art of generalship, pilotage etc. (cf.
            599 C ff.), and we are told that Sophocles was actually made <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >strathgo/s</foreign> because of his <title>Antigone</title> (see the Argument
            ascribed to Aristophanes the grammarian). If we realise the part which Poetry, and
            especially the poetry of Homer, played in Greek education, and remember that
            Aristophanes makes Homer the teacher of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta/ceis, a)reta/s,
              o(pli/seis a)ndrw=n</foreign>, it is by no means extra<pb n="397"/> vagant to suppose
            that such views were actually maintained in Plato's time, though Pericles for example
            had a different criterion of strategic ability when he told Sophocles that he
            ‘knew how to write poetry, but not how to command an army’ (<foreign
              xml:lang="greek">*perikle/hs poie/ein me e)/fh, strathge/ein d' ou)k
            e)pi/stasqai</foreign> Athen. XIII 604 D). Cf. <title>Ion</title> 540 B—542 B
            and Stählin <title>Stellung d. Poesie</title> etc. p. 23 note 3. ‘The
            public,’ remarks Stählin, ‘whose views Plato here combats,
            allowed the authority of the poets to extend even to the domain of the particular arts.
            It was Plato who broke through this magic circle which surrounded Poetry.’
            Aristotle followed in the same path, refusing to allow that a mistake in respect of some
            particular art is necessarily a flaw in the poetry: see <title>Poet.</title> 25.
            1460^{b} 20 ff., 33 ff. Plato himself, of course, holds that poets are destitute of
            scientific knowledge, and compose their poems <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou) sofi/a|, a)lla\

            C</bibl>. The true Poet, according to Plato, is a seer: knowledge he has none, but
            instead of it intuition, enthusiasm and inspiration: he is in short <foreign

              katexo/menos e)k tou= qeou=</foreign> (<title>Men.</title> l.c.). This view of Poetry
            is of course earlier than Plato: we meet with something like it in a striking fragment
            of Democritus ap. Dio Chrys. LIII 274 (quoted by Stählin l.c. p. 12) <foreign

              pantoi/wn</foreign>, and Pindar likes to represent himself as the inspired mouthpiece
            of the Muses and Apollo. We cannot attain to a correct conception of Plato's aesthetic
            unless we are careful to remember that, although he refused to allow that the poet has
            knowledge, he did not deny him genius and inspiration. See also on 598 A supra.</p>

            the same feeling: cf. Plato's remarks on the effects of over-much feeding and athletics
            in III 411 C—E <foreign xml:lang="greek">miso/logos dh/, oi)=mai, o( toiou=tos

            proof of the pudding is in the eating: Homer must have been a poor teacher if his
            disciples (including Creophylus) learnt so little. Had he taught them successfully they
            would have proved their <foreign xml:lang="greek">paidei/a</foreign> by treating their
            master more respectfully: cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 519C"><title>Gorg.</title> 519
            C</bibl>, D, where we are told that if teachers of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >dikaiosu/nh</foreign> do not get paid by their pupils, it only shews that they have
            failed to teach their subject and therefore deserve no fees. <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            neglected even in his own age, when he was <hi rend="italic">alive</hi>,’
            whereas it is precisely during his lifetime that he would have been most respected if he
            had taught to any purpose: witness the enthusiasm aroused by Protagoras, Prodicus and
            other teachers! Thus understood, <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/te e)/zh</foreign> has a
            strong rhetorical emphasis and ought not to be discarded (with Cobet, Baiter, and

            survived to 399 at least, but Protagoras seems to have died about 411; so that if the
            date of action of the dialogue is 410, the reference to Protagoras as apparently still
            living may seem an anachronism. But the slip is a trifling one in any case; and Socrates

          <p>601B - 602B The condition of Imitative art in respect of knowledge may be apprehended
            in the following way. In connexion with every object we can distinguish three arts, that
            which uses, that which makes, and that which imitates it. The user alone has knowledge
            of the object; the maker, when the user instructs him, has correct opinion; but neither
            knowledge nor correct opinion can be attributed to the imitator. He merely copies what
            appears to be beautiful to the ignorant multitude.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">i)/qi dh/, to/de a)/qrei ktl.</lem></app> Plato has
            already proved that Imitation is ‘third from Truth’ <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)k th=s ei)wqui/as meqo/dou</foreign> (596 A), i.e. from the ontological
            standpoint provided by his own Ideal Theory. The following argument takes up a different
            standpoint, according to which knowledge is defined as <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >e)mpeiri/a</foreign> or practical familiarity (601 C, D, 602 A). The attitude assumed
            throughout this section resembles in some respects that of the historical Socrates (601
            D note). Can the two points of view be reconciled? Bosanquet makes an interesting
            attempt to do so (pp. 379, 389 ff.), but his misconception (as it seems to me) of
            Plato's Ideas renders his conclusions less valuable than they might otherwise have been.
            Krohn (<title>Pl. St.</title> p. 255) professes himself unable to effect a
            reconciliation. We must admit that Plato himself does not, as a matter of fact,
            endeavour in this passage to connect the two arguments. Had he chosen to make the
            effort, I think a careful study of <bibl n="Plat. Euthyd. 288E"><title>Euthyd.</title>
              288 E</bibl>— 290 D and <bibl n="Plat. Crat. 390B"><title>Crat.</title> 390
              B</bibl>—E will shew on what lines he might have proceeded (see on <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)mpeiro/taton</foreign> in 601 D), but it is safer to suppose that he
            has shifted his ground, and is applying a new and less strictly scientific <foreign

            metaphysical significance to the word ‘knowledge,’ which he often
            employs throughout his writings without any suggestion of the Ideas (e.g. II 374 D, IV
            422 C). There is no doubt a certain sense in which —if we have regard to <bibl
              n="Plat. Crat. 390B"><title>Crat.</title> 390 B</bibl> ff. and <bibl
              n="Plat. Euthyd. 288E"><title>Euthyd.</title> 288 E</bibl> ff.—<foreign
              xml:lang="greek">o( xrw/menos</foreign> has, not indeed scientific knowledge of the Idea,
            but something analogous thereto. Dialectic, which is the scientific Knowledge of Ideas,
            is <foreign xml:lang="greek">kat' e)coxh/n</foreign> the <foreign xml:lang="greek">xrwme/nh
              e)pisth/mh</foreign>, the Science which alone knows in what respect each thing is good

            royal or kingly science (VI 505 A note). Thus the man who uses a single instrument
            correctly occupies the same relative position in regard to that object which the
            dialectician occupies in regard to the totality of things, and is, in his own small way,
            a king compared with the maker and imitator of the instrument. Cf. Bosanquet p. 390. But
            if Plato had intended us to pursue this vein, he would, I think, have furnished us with
            some hints in the course of the argument itself. See also on 601 B.</p>

            ‘what good or bad things that which he uses does’—we
            cannot like the Greeks say ‘makes’— ‘in
            use.’ This interpretation, which is Schleiermacher's (“wie sich das
            was er gebraucht gut oder schlecht zeigt in Gebrauch”), seems to me the
            natural and obvious meaning of the Greek. In agreement, apparently, with Schneider's
            version, Campbell proposes “what specimens of that which he (the user)
            employs, the maker makes that are good or bad in actual use,” remarking that
            “the correlation of singular and plural arises from the collocation of
            particular and universal. The instrument (sing.) is <hi rend="italic">good in some
              cases, but bad in others</hi> (plur.).” Campbell's solution has the
            advantage of referring <foreign xml:lang="greek">poiei=</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >poihth/s</foreign>, and corresponds more exactly with <foreign xml:lang="greek">xrhstw=n
              kai\ ponh/rw=n au)lw=n</foreign> in E. The grammatical difficulty is however, I think,
            insuperable. If the subject to <foreign xml:lang="greek">poiei=</foreign> must be <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">poihth/s</foreign>, it would even be easier to make <foreign xml:lang="greek"

          <p>602C - 603B Consider, again, what is the part of our nature to which Imitation appeals.
            Painting depends for its effect on the optical delusions to which we are subject, and
            against which the arts of measurement, counting etc., are our only safeguard. The
            rational part of soul applies these arts, and proves itself the best by accepting their
            results. The opposing part is therefore one of the baser elements within us; and base
            will be the brood that springs from its union with imitative art, in Poetry as well as
            Painting.</p>
          <p>ff. The reasoning from here to 607 A has been supposed to rest on a psychological
            theory irreconcileable with that of Book IV, to which the discussion expressly alludes
            (in 602 E). See for example Krohn <title>Pl. St.</title> p. 255 and Pfleiderer <hi
              rend="italic">Zur Lösung</hi> etc., p. 38. It is true that Plato is here
            content, in view of his immediate purpose, with a twofold division of soul into (1) a
            rational and (2) an irrational, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)lo/giston</foreign> (604 D, 605
            B), or lower element. But the resemblance between the two theories is greater than the
            difference, for a the <foreign xml:lang="greek">logistiko/n</foreign> is common to both, and
            b on its moral side the irrational element appears sometimes as the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)piqumhtiko/n</foreign> (606 D <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ peri\
              a)frodisi/wn — kai\ peri\ pa/ntwn tw=n e)piqumhtikw=n ktl.</foreign>),
            sometimes as a degenerate form of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">qumoeide/s</foreign> (604 E,
            606 A : cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">qumou=</foreign> 606 D). What is new is the assignment
            to the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)lo/giston</foreign> of a certain quasi-intellectual
            power—viz. the power of forming false <hi rend="italic">opinions</hi> (603 A,
            605 C); but there was no occasion to raise this point in the earlier psychology, which
            was intended as a foundation for Plato's theory of the virtues. It becomes necessary to
            touch upon the question now, because imitative art aims at producing false opinions, and
            Plato accordingly assigns them to the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)lo/giston</foreign>.</p>

            the transitional sentence interrogative in form, but the extreme animation carries it

          <p>603B - 605C If we examine Poetry on its own merits, apart from the sisterart of
            Painting, we observe that Poetry imitates action. Now in action we often fluctuate
            between two impulses. When a great calamity befalls us, we are tempted to give way to
            grief, before the eyes of others; but Law bids us refrain, and try to cure the wound
            instead of hugging it. That which is best within us readily obeys: whereas the part that
            tempts us to dwell upon our sorrows is irrational, indolent, cowardly. Yet it is just
            this peevish, querulous side of human nature which most lends itself to imitation, and
            whose portrayal in dramatic art the vulgar most readily understand. Poetry is thus the
            counterpart of Painting; its products are low in point of truth, and it feeds our lower
            nature. We exclude the Poet from our city on both grounds.</p>

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)dwlopoiou=nta</foreign> seems also to have been the reading

            >a)festw=ta</foreign> as neuter plural. This interpretation, though grammatically
            tenable, is otherwise unsatisfactory. Plato (in 605 A) has just correlated Poetry with
            Painting because Poetry also a produces <foreign xml:lang="greek">fau=la pro\s
            a)lh/qeian</foreign> and b consorts with <foreign xml:lang="greek">fau=lo/n ti th=s
            yuxh=s</foreign>. On both grounds, he concludes, Poetry must be proscribed: for b

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/dwla ei)dwlopoiei=</foreign>. The chiastic sequence is usual

            only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of his two main reasons for the exclusion of Poetry,
            viz. b, and the correspondence between this and the preceding sentence disappears. On
            this account Stallbaum and others are, I believe, right in restoring the accusative, and
            making <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)festw=ta</foreign>, as well as <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ei)dwlopoiou=nta</foreign>, agree with <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n mimhtiko\n

          <p>605C - 607A But the most serious count in our indictment is that Poetry is capable of
            corrupting, with few exceptions, even men of character and virtue. Tragedy stirs in us
            just those emotions which we are ashamed to indulge when suffering misfortunes of our
            own, and the consequence is that we succumb more readily in the hour of trial. The same
            may be said, mutatis mutandis, of comedy also. We shall therefore decline to model our

            agree in holding that Pity is one of the principal emotions to which Tragedy ministers.
            The point at which they part company is where they begin to discuss the effect produced
            upon human life and conduct by the indulgence of this emotion in the mimicry of the
            stage. According to Plato, the emotion grows by what it feeds upon, and becomes more and
            more troublesome and deleterious in real life, the more we indulge it at the theatre:
            according to Aristotle, tragedy effects the ‘purgation’ of pity and
            its kindred emotions and tends to free us from their dominion in matters of more serious
            moment (<title>Poet.</title> 6. 1449^{b} 27 et al.). Aristotle hopes to effect by means
            of theatrical stimulation what Plato would attain by starving the emotions even in play.
            It is obvious that the Aristotelian theory of the drama was in this important respect
            developed in direct and conscious antagonism to the Platonic, to which, in other
            particulars, it owes much: see Finsler <title>Platon u. die Arist. Poetik</title> pp. 96
            ff. I think it may fairly be argued that Plato's view is not less true to experience
            than that of Aristotle; for a spectacle which ‘purges’ the <foreign

            times; and it is therefore inherently probable that the quotations are of very different
            dates. There is no <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> reason why some of them should not be
            from the contemporary drama; but some of them should be older; and those who refer them

              poet. Gr. intercedit</hi> p. 50 note 4), can hardly be right. Still less is Pfleiderer
            justified in citing them as expressions of the indignation which, according to his own
            chorizontic views, Books II and III had aroused in comic poets (<hi rend="italic">Zur

            seriously, in spite of Plato's immoveable conviction of the immortality of the soul (see
            on VI 498 D). The doctrine itself had of course long been an article of the Orphic and
            Pythagorean creeds (see Rohde <title>Psyche</title>^{2} II pp. 1 ff. and Laudowicz <hi
              rend="italic">Präexistenz d. Seele u. Seelenwand. in Gr. Phil.</hi> pp.
            1—29), and we must not suppose (with Thomas Gray) that it is the novelty of
            the idea which occasions Glauco's wonder. Glauco regards the originally half-theological
            doctrine of the immortality of the Soul with the same sort of well-bred incredulity
            which it inspired in most of Plato's contemporaries (cf. VI 498 D with I 330 D, E and
              <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 69E"><title>Phaed.</title> 69 E</bibl>, 70 A, 80 D), and is
            astonished that a well-balanced mind should treat it seriously as a philosophical dogma
            capable of being established by rational argument.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ei) mh\ a)dikw= ge</lem></app>. See on IV 430 D.</p>
          <p>608D - 611A Everything, which suffers destruction, is destroyed by its own peculiar
            evil or disease, and that which cannot be destroyed thereby is indestructible. Now the
            evil which is peculiar to the soul is vice, and vice is powerless to slay the soul. We
            must beware of supposing that the soul is destroyed by bodily disease, unless it can be
            proved that bodily disease engenders within the soul its own specific evil; and if any
            one has the boldness to assert that the souls of the dying do actually become more
            vicious, he must be prepared to shew that vice, alone and by itself, is fatal to its
            possessor, which is far from being true. Vice would lose its terrors if death were the
            end of all things. We conclude that the soul is immortal, since neither its own nor any
            alien evil can destroy it.</p>
          <p>ff. Socrates has already expressed his belief in the immortality of the soul in VI 498
            D: cf. also ib. 496 E and I 330 D, E. The proof which Plato gives here has been widely
            discussed and severely, though often unfairly and unintelligently, criticised by many
            critics, to some of whom reference is made in the <pb n="422"/> course of the notes.
            Plato does not stop to define what he means by ‘soul,’ nor the
            different senses in which he employs the word ‘death,’ and the
            consequence is that superficial inspection of his reasoning often sees a fallacy where
            there is only an ellipse. The best preparation for a study of this argument is a careful
            examination of the proofs in the <title>Phaedo</title>, to which Plato himself appears
            expressly to allude in 611 B: see note ad loc. It will be easier to understand the
            reasoning of Plato if we bear in mind the following considerations. (1) The duality of
            soul and body is assumed throughout the whole discussion. (2) It is the individual
            immortality of the soul which Plato wishes to prove. (In his excellent monograph <hi
              rend="italic">Unsterblichkeitslehre Plato's</hi>, Halle, 1878, Bertram appears to me
            to have conclusively and once for all established this point as against
            Teichmüller <title>Die Plat. Fr.</title> pp. 1—23. Cf. Simson
              <title>Der Begriff d. Seele bei Plato</title> pp. 126—143). (3) The
            conception of soul as the principle of life, though not expressly enunciated here, is
            present to Plato's mind (609 D note). The question whether immortality (in the fullest
            sense of the term) belongs to the entire soul, or only to part of it, is not raised in
            the course of the proof itself, but from 611 B—612 A, it would seem that the
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">logistiko/n</foreign> alone is indestructible (611 B note). At
            each successive incarnation the <foreign xml:lang="greek">logistiko/n</foreign> is defiled
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(po\ th=s tou= sw/matos koinwni/as</foreign>, and (according to
              <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 81B"><title>Phaed.</title> 81 B</bibl> ff.) the pollution
            frequently adheres even after death, causing the soul to seek re-incarnation. The
            ultimate aim is apparently to be delivered from bodily existence altogether, and live

            xro/non</foreign> (<bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 114C"><title>Phaed.</title> 114 C</bibl>), but
            even then the soul would not—so at least I think—seem to Plato to
            lose its essential individuality and become absorbed. See on the whole subject Simson

            dissolution of a the body (as described in C above <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/sper sw=ma
              — ei)s to\ mhde\ sw=ma ei)=nai</foreign>), b the soul, c the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">su/nolon</foreign>, or body <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> soul. If the soul
            is mortal, the moment at which it is dissolved and perishes is when the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">su/nolon</foreign> dies, i.e. (<bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 64C"
              ><title>Phaed.</title> 64 C</bibl>, 67 D) when soul is separated from body (cf. <bibl
              n="Plat. Phaedo 70A"><title>Phaed.</title> 70 A</bibl>, 77 B, D, E, 80 D and 84 B).
            Plato reminds us of this by saying <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(/ws a)\n ei)s qa/naton

            Glauco should assent so readily. He is apparently thinking (as in 610 E) of the activity
            and vitality which wicked men so frequently display; but we may fairly ask
            ‘Why should soul be the only thing which is incapable of being destroyed by
            its own vice?’ It would surely be more true to hold that vice is able to kill
            the soul just <hi rend="italic">because</hi> it is able <foreign xml:lang="greek">poiei=n
              au)th\n kakh/n</foreign> (609 B), and Panaetius actually made use of a similar
            argument in order to prove the soul mortal (“nihil esse, quod doleat, quin id
            aegrum esse quoque possit. quod autem in morbum cadat, id etiam interiturum; dolere

            appeal to experience? Even if we allowed that experience is the proper tribunal, our
            experience of the effect of injustice on a human soul is limited to a single life; and
            why should not one soul wear out many bodies and perish at last through its own vice
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ h)=| au)to\ tou=to qa/natos, yuxh=s o)/leqros</foreign>
            (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 87B"><title>Phaed.</title> 87 B</bibl>, 91 D. See also
            Deichert <hi rend="italic">Plato's Beweise f. die Unsterblichkeit d. Seele</hi> pp.
            46—48). These difficulties are serious, and possibly fatal: they have even led
            some critics to stigmatise the whole argument as a <hi rend="italic">petitio
            principii</hi> (e.g. Brandt <title>Zur Entwick. d. Pl. Lehre v. d. Seelentheilen</title>
            p. 29). Plato does not attempt to solve them here; but <pb n="424"/> a comparison of the
            present argument with <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 93A"><title>Phaed.</title> 93
            A</bibl>—94 B helps at all events to explain his position. Soul is always

                ><title>Phaed.</title> 93 B</bibl>); hence the soul which is made evil by vice
            retains its vitality unimpaired. It is in fact the conception of soul as the principle
            of life which explains (from the Platonic point of view) Glauco's emphatic <foreign

            may not be conclusive (609 D note); but we are surely not justified in charging Plato

            sins, so that Immortality would become a “postulate of the moral government of
            the universe” (Deichert l.c. p. 48). Plato <pb n="426"/> is content merely to
            suggest this argument: neither here nor elsewhere does he place it in the forefront of

            treated as composite (435 A note): for nothing that is composite can well be immortal
            (cf. <title>Phaed.</title> l.c.). According to the theory which is rather suggested (612

            are not of the essence of soul at all, but only incidental to its association with body,

            A). Plato hints that the new psychological standpoint will give us a new and higher
            conception of Justice. I agree with Hirzel (<hi rend="italic">der Dialog</hi> 1 pp. 237
            f.) in holding that this higher conception can only be the Idea. The plural refers to
            different conceptions of Justice and Injustice, rather than to “their various

          <p>612A - 613E Now that we have proved Justice to be in itself, apart from all
            consequences, best for the soul, we may safely dwell on the rewards of Virtue both in
            life and after death. We revoke the concession which, for the sake of the argument, we
            formerly made, and restore to Justice the appreciation which in point of fact she does
            receive from gods and men. The just are dear to the gods and the special object of their
            providence, but it is otherwise with the unjust. Among men too, Injustice, though for a
            time it may run well, breaks down before the race is finished; whereas Justice reaches
            the goal and wins the crown. The honours and prizes which Glauco claimed for successful
            Injustice fall to Justice, and it is the unjust who suffer the insults and torments
            which he foretold for the just.</p>

            Jackson is inclined— perhaps rightly—to make the sentence categoric

            that Justice is usually recommended not on its own merits, but for the sake of its
            results (II 362 E ff.). For <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)pelusa/meqa</foreign> cf. VI 499 E

            interpretation is that of Schneider and the other editors. A wholly different view is
            taken by Riddell (<title>Digest</title> § 111) and Madvig. They understand
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ ka/tw</foreign> of the lower, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\

            heard the narrative of their experiences from other souls that had fulfilled the

              <foreign xml:lang="greek">*ne/kuiai</foreign> before the time of Plato, and the
            investigations of Dieterich and others have made it clear that the materials of Plato's

            We ought, I think, to conceive the meadow as situated somewhere on what Plato in the

            stretching through all Heaven and Earth, and after a day's journey they saw at the
            middle of this light the extremities of the chains of Heaven, and stretching from these
            extremities the spindle of Necessity with its eight concentric whorls, the circles of
            whose rims as they revolve carry with them severally the fixed stars and all the planets

          <p>ff. The astronomical difficulties in this part of the <title>Republic</title> have

            translations of the <title>Republic</title> in English and German, and the commentaries
            of Proclus and Theo, the writers whom I have chiefly studied are Grote (<hi

            pp. 278—289) and Zeller^{5} I pp. 434 f. notes Donaldson's article, to which
            Dr Jackson first called my attention, although it lacks consistency and clearness, and
            passes over many difficulties, contains the germ of what I now believe to be the correct
            theory of the straight light. But nothing that has hitherto been published on the
            subject supplies at once a full and satisfactory explanation of the difficulties, and it
            is only through the kind cooperation of Professor Cook Wilson that I have at last been
            able to form a definite view as to the meaning and solution of this extremely
            complicated problem. From 616 B to the middle of 617 B my commentary is mainly based on
            the exhaustive criticisms and investigations which he has sent to me.</p>
          <p>The general scope and purpose of the astronomical part of the myth would seem to be to
            set before the souls a picture of the ‘harmonies and revolutions of the
            Universe’ in conformity with which it is their highest duty and privilege to
            live. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 90C"><title>Tim.</title> 90 C</bibl>, D <foreign

            observe in advance that Plato's description falls into two well-marked divisions or
            sections, viz. from <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)fiknei=sqai tetartai/ous</foreign> down to
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n perifora/n</foreign> (616 B, C), and from <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)k de\ tw=n a)/krwn</foreign> (616 C) to the end of the myth. In the
            first section we have a representation of the outermost or sidereal sphere, girdled by a
            circle of light, which is prolonged through the poles into a column or shaft of light
            spanning the Universe from pole to pole and symbolizing to all appearances the cosmical
            axis. See on line 14 below. In the second section the scene is shifted, and we are
            introduced to a new picture of the celestial system, including the fixed stars, but
            without the encompassing girdle of light, assimilated to the poetical and suggestive
            figure of Necessity and her spindle, the shaft of which again represents the axis of the
            Universe. The details are fully discussed in the notes, where it is shewn that the two
            parts of the description cannot from their very nature be combined into a coherent and
            consistent whole, and that in consequence of their essential inconsistency Plato's
            passing attempt to reconcile them inevitably fails. See on <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)k de\
              tw=n a)/krwn ktl.</foreign> 616 C and App. VI.</p>
          <p>If the question is asked, ‘Does Plato's description embody a serious
            astronomical theory of the visible heaven and its machinery?’ what answer
            should be returned? The following remarks will indicate the kind of reply which seems to
            be in harmony both with Plato's general attitude on astronomical questions and with the
            special peculiarities of the myth before us. (1) The visible heavens, according to the
              <title>Republic</title>, are not the object of true Astronomy. The true Astronomer is
            concerned with <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(\s to\ o)\n ta/xos kai\ h( ou)=sa braduth\s e)n
              tw=| a)lhqinw=| a)riqmw=| kai\ pa=si toi=s a)lhqe/si sxh/masi fora/s te pro\s a)/llhla
              fe/retai kai\ ta\ e)no/nta fe/rei</foreign> (VII 529 D. See note ad loc.). We may
            therefore expect imagination and idealism to play a large part in Plato's astronomical
            pictures, more especially when they form part of a myth. (2) The greater portion of this
            passage is in reality a similitude representing the celestial system under the figure of
            the spindle of Necessity. <pb n="442"/> Now it is clear that Plato deliberately
            sacrificed the reality of the sidereal sphere when he found it inconsistent with the
            figure which he had chosen (see on <foreign xml:lang="greek">ku/klous ktl.</foreign> 616 D).
            And if he could concede so much to his comparison, the question arises, ‘Are
            we justified in regarding <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of the machinery as seriously
            expressing Plato's real conception of the mechanism of the heavens?’ It will
            be found on reflection that the only satisfactory and safe reply is that all the
            machinery, including the material whorls and axis of the spindle, is poetical
            throughout. This does not of course exclude the supposition that some of the details of
            Plato's imagery are borrowed from earlier astronomical fancies, and it is highly
            probable that here, as elsewhere in the myth, he takes something from the Pythagoreans:
            see on 616 C, D, 617 B. (3) The entire description should in all probability be regarded
            as “essentially a symbolic representation and not an attempt at scientific
            explanation” (Cook Wilson). But ‘a symbolic representation should
            stand in some relation to the thing signified,’ and in this case all we can
            reasonably infer from Plato's symbolism is that, according to his belief, the Earth is
            in the middle: the Sun, Moon and Planets revolve round the Earth at different distances
            from the centre and with different velocities, participating in the general movement of
            the heavens and at the same time having a contrary movement of their own. As for the
            fixed stars, it would seem from the first part of Plato's description that he supposed
            them to be fixed in the outermost sphere of the Universe, round which he plainly
            supposes that the circle of the Milky Way extends. See also on 616 C, 617 A.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">kai\ a)fiknei=sqai ktl.</lem></app> ‘And on the
            fourth day they arrived at a point from which they descried extending from above through
            all the heaven and earth a straight light, like a pillar, resembling the rainbow more
            than anything else, but brighter and purer.’ The souls see the light for the
            first time on the fourth day after they begin their march, and consequently on the
            eleventh day from Er's arrival at the meadow. The remaining incidents occupy one day,
            and it is on the twelfth that Er revives (<foreign xml:lang="greek">dwdekatai=os—
              a)nebi/w</foreign> 614 B). See on <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(/wqen</foreign> in 621 B. As
            far as the Greek is concerned, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/nwqen</foreign> may be construed
            either with <foreign xml:lang="greek">kaqora=n</foreign> or with <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >tetame/non</foreign>. In the former case, we should probably have to suppose (with
            Boeckh l.c. p. 299) that Er's point of view is outside the Universe; but it will be
            shewn in Appendix VI that there are serious difficulties in the way of this supposition,
            and the second alternative is to be preferred. It has already been remarked that Plato
            in all probability thinks of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">leimw/n</foreign> as somewhere on
            the true surface of the Earth described by him in the myth of the <title>Phaedo</title>
            (614 C note), and it is apparently along this surface that the souls progress until they
            come in view of the light. As regards the shape and position of the light, Plato's
            language is clear and precise. The light is ‘straight, like a
            pillar,’ and ‘stretched through all the heaven and earth.’
            The only natural interpretation of these words is that a column or shaft of light spans
            the entire Universe, like the diameter of a circle, and passes through the centre of the
            Earth, which, according to Plato, is situated in the middle of the whole (<bibl
              n="Plat. Phaedo 108E"><title>Phaed.</title> 108 E</bibl> ff., <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 40B"

            refer, not of course to the shape, but to the colour of the light, as appears from
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">lampro/teron de\ kai\ kaqarw/teron</foreign>. The correction of
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">prosferh=</foreign> to <foreign xml:lang="greek"

            >prosfere/s</foreign> is intrinsically a better reading, and might easily have been
            altered to <foreign xml:lang="greek">prosferh=</foreign> under the influence of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ki/ona</foreign>. In defence of <foreign xml:lang="greek">prosferh=</foreign>
            Schneider cites <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)pwxeteume/non</foreign> in VI 485 D, but the two
            cases are not exactly parallel: see note ad loc. Other views on this passage are
            discussed in App. VI.</p>

            >proelqo/ntas</foreign>, A and other MSS have <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >proelqo/ntes</foreign> (see cr. n.), which Schneider defends by saying that the
            nominative refers not to all the party, but only to Er and his immediate companions. But
            even in that case the accusative would be more correct, and in point of fact it is clear
            from what follows that Er is accompanied throughout by <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the
            souls about to be born again. A few other MSS besides <hi rend="italic">q</hi> have the
            accusative. If the light is ‘straight, like a pillar,’ and stretches
            ‘through all the heaven and earth,’ it follows that as the Earth is
            in the middle of the Universe, the ‘middle of the light’ will be at
            the centre of the earth. See fig. i on p. 443. No other interpretation of <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">kata\ me/son to\ fw=s</foreign> is either natural or easy: see App. VI.
            It would seem therefore that at the end of the fourth day after leaving the meadow the
            souls are at the central point both of the Universe and of the Earth, as is maintained
            by, among others, Schneider and Donaldson (l.c. p. 307); and this view is also in
            harmony with some of the most important features in the remaining part of the narrative:
            see on 617 B, 621 A, B.</p>
          <p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">kai\ i)dei=n au)to/qi ktl.</lem></app> ‘and
            there, at the middle of the light, they saw, extended from heaven, the extremities of
            its chains; for this light chains the heavens, holding together all the revolving
            firmament, like the undergirders of men of war.’ The pronoun <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">au)tou=</foreign> is ambiguous, and as far as concerns the grammar might
            be referred either to <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou= ou)ranou=</foreign> or to <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">to\ fw=s</foreign>. If we choose the former alternative, <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">au)tou=</foreign> will be an objective genitive, denoting that which is
            bound; if the latter, the meaning, as Professor Cook Wilson points out, is
            ‘its chains,’ ‘its bands,’ i.e. ‘the
            chains of which the light consists,’ for in the next clause the light is said
            to be a chain (<foreign xml:lang="greek">cu/ndesmos</foreign>). The second of these views is
            on grammatical grounds somewhat more natural than the first; but whichever alternative
            we adopt, it is clear from the explanatory clause <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)=nai
              ga\r— perifora/n</foreign>, not only that the chains are the binding chains
            of heaven, but also that it is the light itself, and nothing else, which fulfils the
            function of binding the Universe together (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)=nai ga\r tou=to to\
              fw=s cu/ndesmon tou= ou)ranou=</foreign>). In what way the light performs this office,
            Plato indicates by the much-disputed words <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(=on ta\ u(pozw/mata
              tw=n trihrw=n</foreign>. The evidence on the subject of the
            ‘undergirders’ of ancient men of war has been collected and
            discussed by Boeckh <hi rend="italic">Urkundenüber d. Seewesen des Attischen
              Staates</hi> pp. 133—138: see also J. Smith <title>Voyage and Shipwreck of
              St Paul</title> pp. 210—215 and Breusing <title>Nautik d. Alten</title> pp.
            170—184. It may be taken as established that the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >u(pozw/mata</foreign> were ropes and not planks, as some of the ancient commentators
            supposed (e.g. Proclus <hi rend="italic">in remp.</hi> II p. 200. 25, a Scholiast quoted
            by Kroll l.c. II p. 381, and Suidas S.V. <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata</foreign>,
            who follows a scholium on <bibl n="Aristoph. Kn. 279">Ar. <title>Knights</title>
            279</bibl>), and also that they were fastened round the <hi rend="italic">outside</hi>
            of the vessel; but on the question whether the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >u(pozw/mata</foreign> ran round the ship in a horizontal direction, or were passed
            under the hull, there is more room for difference of opinion. The former view is
            maintained by Boeckh and Breusing, the latter by J. Smith (l.c. pp. 108 f., 115,
            210—215), who reminds us that a similar process, known by the name of
            ‘frapping,’ is still occasionally resorted to in the case of wooden
            ships during a storm at sea (pp. 108 f.). The evidence bearing on this matter has
            recently been investigated by Professor Cook Wilson (see Report of the Proceedings of
            the Oxford Philological Society for Hilary Term 1902 in <title>Cl. Rev.</title> XVI p.
            234), who will shortly publish a detailed discussion of the whole subject. In the
            meantime he writes to me as follows:—“After careful reading of all
            the passages quoted by the authorities I feel sure (what one might infer <hi
              rend="italic">a priori</hi> from the mechanical conditions) that this
            method” [i.e. frapping] “was known to the ancients, and was the
            method used in an emergency at sea, as e.g. in St Paul's ship. I conjecture also that
            these undergirders first had the name <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata</foreign>, and
            that if the belts or girdles supposed by Boeckh had this name, it was transferred to
            them from the true undergirders, which were probably the first and primitive form and
            remained in use always, even after the trireme belts had been invented.” The
            evidence in short, points to two kinds of <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata</foreign>
              (<title>Cl.</title>
            <pb n="446"/>
            <title>Rev.</title> l.c.), the first employed occasionally under exceptional
            circumstances, and passing under the hull of the vessel, the second (see Boeckh l.c. p.
            137) forming part of the regular equipment of a warship, attached before she went to
            sea, and running horizontally round the hull. The second variety is clearly represented
            on a bronze relief of the forepart of a war vessel, said to date from Roman imperial
            times, and now in the Berlin Museum. The sketch of the relief on p. 443, fig. ii is from
            a photograph in the possession of Professor Cook Wilson. There is also a (somewhat
            inaccurate) drawing of the relief in Beger <title>Thesauri regii et electoralis
              Brandenburgicii</title> Vol. III p. 406. (Some writers, and among them J. Smith, have
            maintained that the longitudinal bands in Beger's picture are only ornaments, and not
            ropes; but it is quite clear from the photograph that they are really ropes and serve as
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata</foreign> of the horizontal kind.) To which of the
            two varieties does Plato here allude? The words <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(=on ta\
              u(pozw/mata tw=n trihrw=n, ou(/tw pa=san sune/xon th\n perifora/n</foreign>, seem
            clearly to regard the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata</foreign> as permanent <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">skeu/h</foreign> of warships, holding the hull together in ordinary
            circumstances, and not merely resources to be employed in times of difficulty and
            danger; and since the light whose action the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata</foreign>
            serve to illustrate is (in Plato's view) an essential part of the Universe, the
            illustration is better and more pointed if the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >u(pozw/mata</foreign> are also of the more permanent sort. It may also be noted that if
            Plato had meant the undergirders which pass under the keel he would probably have
            written <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata tw=n new=n</foreign>, and not <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata tw=n trihrw=n</foreign>, for the vertical <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata</foreign> were not confined to triremes. For these reasons it
            would seem that Plato has in view such <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata</foreign> as
            are described by Boeckh, viz. girdles running round the hull from stern to stem outside
            the vessel.</p>
          <p>It is clear, therefore, that the light not only passes through the centre of the
            Universe, but also, since it holds the heavens together, like the undergirders of men of
            war, round the outer surface of the heavenly sphere.</p>
          <p>I have tried to represent the kind of picture in Plato's mind by fig. i on p. 443. The
            sphere of the heavens—represented by the circle <hi rend="italic">dd'</hi>,
            which is a section of the heavenly sphere—is virtually compared to a ship. The
            North pole, which is at <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, corresponds to the stem, and the South
            pole, which is at <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, to the stern of the vessel. The circular
            light <hi rend="italic">caba'c</hi> corresponds to the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
            >u(pozw/mata</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> being that part of the light which
            corresponds to the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata</foreign> on the port side, and <hi
              rend="italic">ca'b</hi> the portion which corresponds to the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >u(pozw/mata</foreign> on the starboard side. As the light in Plato's description
            passes through the centre of the Universe as well as round its exterior, the comparison
            of the light to horizontal <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata</foreign> would be all the
            more apposite if we might suppose that these <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata</foreign>
            were brought inside from stem to stern lengthwise and parallel to the ship's length, in
            a manner corresponding to the position of the straight part of the ‘binding
            light.’ But for this supposition there is no evidence, and it is clear from
            fig. ii that the lower <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata</foreign> at least could not
            have been brought inside, for they are below the water line. We must accordingly suppose
            that the comparison with <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pozw/mata</foreign> extends only to
            that part of the light which surrounds the surface of the heavenly sphere. That the ends
            of the light are brought inside the sphere in <hi rend="italic">Plato's</hi> picture is
            clear from the fact that the light stretches ‘through all the heaven and
            earth’ as well as round the Universe, and also because the souls see the
            ‘ends of its chains’ or bands at the middle of the light itself,
            which is also the centre of the Universe and Earth. We may presume that the <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">a)/kra tw=n desmw=n</foreign> meet together at the centre, so that <hi
              rend="italic">bc</hi> forms one continuous pillar of light stretching from pole to
            pole. See fig. i on p. 443.</p>
          <p>The light was interpreted by some ancient commentators as the axis of the Universe, or
            a cylinder of aetherial fire surrounding the axis (Theo p. 143 Hiller, Suidas and
            Photius S.V. <foreign xml:lang="greek">tetame/non fw=s</foreign>: cf. also Proclus <hi
              rend="italic">in remp.</hi> II p. 199. 31 ff.), by others as the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >galaci/as ku/klos</foreign> or Milky Way: see Proclus l.c. pp. 130. 4, 194. 19 ff.
            and Cicero <hi rend="italic">de rep.</hi> VI 16. According to the view given above, the
            column of light follows the direction of the axis of the Universe, if, as we may
            reasonably <pb n="447"/> suppose, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is the pole, and although
            Plato nowhere actually calls it the axis, we may fairly suppose that this is what it
            symbolises. I have found no parallel in ancient astronomical theories to this conception
            of a light stretching from pole to pole. The curved part of the light is no doubt
            suggested by the Milky Way, which was regarded by the Pythagoreans as either identical
            with, or an emanation from the circle of fire which, according to them, held the
            Universe together (Zeller^{5} I p. 435 note 2). I have sometimes thought that the soul
            with which in the <title>Timaeus</title> the Creator wrapped the body of the Universe
            without has reference also to the Milky Way as girdling the World; for the Pythagoreans
            called the <foreign xml:lang="greek">galaci/as ku/klos</foreign> the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >to/pos yuxw=n</foreign>. Plato's words are (<bibl n="Plat. Tim. 34B"

            complete envelopment of the heavens, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ panto/s</foreign> to
            the universal diffusion of the world-soul throughout the Universe.</p>

            from the extremities they saw extended the spindle of Necessity, by which all the
            revolving spheres are turned. The shaft and hook thereof are made of adamant, and the
            whorl partly of adamant, and partly of other materials.’ With this sentence we
            pass to the second part of Plato's description, in which he tries to depict the
            movements of the celestial bodies by a new image—that of Necessity and her
            spindle. Regarded in itself, this image is tolerably clear and coherent, if we are
            willing to allow a large admixture of supernatural mechanics; but Plato fails to shew
            how it is to be reconciled with what has just preceded, and no one has hitherto
            succeeded in effecting the reconciliation, without doing violence to the Greek. See on
            616 D, E and App. VI. The rapid imagination of the writer has already escaped from the
            earlier picture and fallen under the spell of a new conception, and we shall best
            apprehend his meaning if we consider what the peculiar nature of that conception
            demands. The ordinary spindle was shaped somewhat as in figure iii on p. 444, in which
              <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> is the shaft, and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the whorl.
            (There is no hook in the figure: but its position would of course be at <hi
              rend="italic">a.</hi>) The fibres were attached to the hook and twisted into a thread
            by the revolutions communicated to the spindle by the finger and thumb: see
            Blümner <title>Technologie</title> etc. I pp. 109—120, from whom the
            figure is borrowed. It is essential to the notion of a spindle that the hook should be
            fastened to the fibres which are to be spun. For this reason Plato finds it necessary,
            in using the similitude of a spindle, to attach the hook (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >a)/gkistron</foreign>) to something which may correspond to the fibres; and he
            accordingly fastens it to the ends of the chains of light depending from the heavens in
            his previous image, at the point where these ends meet the ends from below, <foreign
              xml:lang="greek">kata\ me/son to\ fw=s</foreign>. If we treat this construction as a piece
            of serious mechanics, Plato's device is open to many obvious criticisms. In fastening
            the spindle to the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/kra tw=n desmw=n</foreign> from above, he
            forgets or ignores the ends from below. It will further be observed that he says nothing
            about the direction of the spindle: it is merely ‘stretched from the
            ends’ of the chains. We shall presently see that the shaft of the spindle
            symbolises the axis of the Universe, so that—if we are to connect the two
            images in Plato's mind —it is natural to suppose that the spindle extends
            downwards, following the line of the light. Here again there are difficulties, the most
            serious of which perhaps is that, as the axis of the Universe must go through the earth,
            the effect of attaching the spindle ‘at the middle of the light’
            will be to depress the earth itself below the centre of the whole. But it should be
            remembered that Plato's object in this passage is not to furnish a scientific account of
            the celestial mechanism: see below on 616 D, E, 617 A. We are dealing with a work of
            literature and not of science, and the machinery of a myth ought not to be rigorously
            scrutinized from the scientific point of view. Inconsistencies of this kind are found to
            be inseparable from such poetical representations of the Universe. In the present case
            they arise chiefly from the juxtaposition of two essentially irreconcileable
            conceptions—that of a sphere girdled and traversed by light, and that of
            Necessity and her spindle. See on 616 D, E. For the rest, it should <pb n="448"/> be
            noted that adamant symbolises <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ a)paqe\s kai\
            a)da/maston</foreign> (cf. Proclus l.c. II 209. 22), and is the appropriate material for
            the <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)laka/th</foreign>, since in Plato's picture the <foreign

              xml:lang="greek">h)laka/th</foreign> is not elsewhere found in the sense of the shaft of a
            spindle: ordinarily it means ‘distaff.’ See on 616 D, E below. Plato
            does not inform us in what way the whorl is <foreign xml:lang="greek">meikto\n e)/k te

            are made, either in whole or in part, of less durable stuff. Herwerden rejects the

            The whorl of Necessity's spindle is a composite structure, consisting of eight
            concentric hemispheres, fitted into one another like a nest of boxes: see below on 616

          <p>Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 38C"><title>Tim.</title> 38 C</bibl> f., where also, as here,
            Plato is following the Pythagorean order of planets: see Zeller^{5} I pp. 426 f. and (on
            the whole subject of ancient arrangements of the planets) Hultsch in PaulyWissowa, art.
              <title>Astronomie</title> and Schaubach <title>Gr. Astron.</title> pp. 398 ff. Some
            later authorities make Plato place Venus before <pb n="449"/> Mercury (see for example
            Diels <title>Doxogr. Gr.</title> p. 345), but the order which I have given is in accord
            with [<title>Epin.</title>] 986 C— 987 C, and with the views represented by
            Proclus l.c. p. 219. 3 ff.</p>
          <p>This conception of close-fitting concentric whorls, carrying the heavenly bodies in
            their rims or ‘lips,’ appears to be unique in ancient astronomy. How
            was Plato led to devise so original an idea? Possibly in this way. It would seem that
            the Pythagoreans had already developed the astronomical doctrine of Anaximander into a
            theory of celestial spheres, maintaining that the stars were “fastened in
            transparent circles or spheres, and turned round by the revolution of these circles on
            their axes” (Zeller^{5} I p. 415). In order to suit his image of the spindle
            and whorl, Plato apparently takes these Pythagorean spheres, and cuts them in half,
            producing a series of hemispheric cups or whorls, in the circular
            ‘lips’ of which the celestial bodies are fastened or bound (<foreign
              xml:lang="greek">e)ndedeme/na</foreign>, says Theo 150. 14 Hiller: cf. also Proclus l.c.
            219. 24).</p>
          <p>So far as the Sun, Moon and Planets are concerned, the resulting picture is clear and
            intelligible, but it is impossible to conceive of the fixed stars as occupying the
            ‘lip’ of one of the hemispherical whorls in the way in which the Sun
            for example may be supposed to do so. Whatever view we hold of the rest of the picture,
            it is likely that in this particular at least Plato himself did not think his comparison
            adequate to exhibit the phenomena: for in C above he has already represented the
            outermost heavens, in which dwell the fixed stars, not as the lip of a hemispherical
            shell or hollow, but as an actual sphere (<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa=san sune/xon th\n
              perifora/n</foreign>). (The inconsistency is noteworthy as shewing that the two images
            employed by Plato are fundamentally irreconcileable. See on 616 C.) By this and other
            indications we may be led to suspect that the whole theory of hemispherical whorls is
            only a device rendered necessary by Plato's similitude. If he had any opinion on the
            subject at all, he may have accepted the Pythagorean doctrine of spheres; but no
            conclusion on this matter can be drawn from the <title>Republic.</title> Cf. 617 A

            >e(/ktou</foreign> (line 31) in Vat. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*q</foreign>, the order of
            the different whorls in respect of breadth of rim, beginning with the broadest, is as
            follows:—</p>
          <p>1. Whorl of Fixed Stars (first)</p>
          <p>2. Whorl of Venus (sixth)</p>
          <p>3. Whorl of Mars (fourth)</p>

          <p>6. Whorl of Mercury (fifth)</p>
          <p>7. Whorl of Jupiter (third)</p>
          <p>8. Whorl of Saturn (second).</p>
          <p>See fig. iv on p. 444. (This figure, which is a simplified form of a drawing in
            Professor Campbell's <hi rend="italic">Plato's Republic</hi>, published by Murray 1902,
            is intended to illustrate the upper surface of the whorl of Necessity's spindle. The
            small disc in the centre represents a section of the shaft, and the order of breadths of
            rim is indicated by the arabic numerals.) What does Plato mean us to understand by the
            different degrees of breadth of rim? On this subject I formerly
            wrote:—“The simple and natural explanation is that the breadth of
            the rims represents the size of the different planets. Each rim must of necessity be
            broad enough to contain the planet which resides in it, and no reason can be conceived
            why it should be any broader” (<title>Cl. Rev.</title> XV p. 392). In
            maintaining this view, I supposed that the surfaces of the different whorls were
            separated from one another by an interval representing the distances between the several
            planets, interpreting <foreign xml:lang="greek">nw=ton</foreign> in 616 E (with Jowett) as
            the <hi rend="italic">lower</hi> and not the <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> side of the
            entire whorl. But, as Professor Cook Wilson points out, the Greek does not allow of this
            interpretation, for <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(rmo/ttwn, kaqa/per oi( ka/doi oi( ei)s
              a)llh/lous a(rmo/ttontes</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">nw=ton sunexe\s e(no\s
              sfondu/lou a)pergazome/nous peri\ th\n h)laka/thn</foreign> (616 D, E) shew
            conclusively that the individual whorls are fitted closely into one another like a nest
            of boxes, their upper surfaces forming one continuous plane. Cf. Proclus <pb n="450"/>
            l. c. 216. 8 <foreign xml:lang="greek">mhdeno\s ga\r o)/ntos kenou= metacu\ tw=n
              e)nhrmosme/nwn sfondu/lwn ktl.</foreign> From this it follows that, if the breadth of
            a rim is equal to the diameter of its planet, “planets in the same part of
            their orbit will touch one another, and if we carry out the principle to the centre
            whorl, the moon will be always touching the earth. Moreover the outer planet will be
            continually grazing a fixed star” (Cook Wilson). These considerations are
            fatal to the view which I advocated; and I take this opportunity of retractation. The
            theory which has most in its favour, as I now see, is that “the breadth of the
            rims is intended to signify the supposed distances of the orbits from each
            other” (Jowett and Campbell). “It would be extraordinary,”
            writes Professor Cook Wilson, “that Plato in representing the heavenly system
            by his whorls should not have represented somehow the distances between the orbits of
            the heavenly bodies, and the obvious way to do this was by making the thickness of the
            spheres to which they are attached, or (as he prefers whorls on account of the distaff
            of Necessity), the breadth of the rims of the whorls, symbolise these different
            distances.” On this view the natural position of the planet will be
            “close to the outer edge of its rim, and touching the outer surface of its
            hemisphere.” For a further discussion of this subject see App. VI.</p>

            revolves from East to West, bearing with <pb n="451"/> it in its revolution the other
            seven whorls. In this way Plato portrays the apparent daily revolution of the stars and
            planets. In order to represent the movements of the Sun, Moon and planets in their own
            particular orbits, Plato says that each of the seven inner whorls is all the while
            pursuing on its own account a motion in the opposite direction, viz. from West to East.
            The revolving whorls in the words of Proclus, ‘carry round the
            stars’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">peria/gousi tou\s a)ste/ras</foreign> l. c. p.
            226. 12) which are situated in their rims.</p>
          <p>Would the mechanism of Plato's picture really produce the movements which it is
            intended to portray? The question may be interesting, but is irrelevant. Imaginary
            machines have imaginary properties; and Plato himself invokes the assistance of
            supernatural beings to carry on the movements (617 C). The important point to keep in
            mind, as Professor Cook Wilson observes, is that “Plato has realised that the
            apparent phenomena are what we call a composition of movements (or velocities). This
            composition of movements he is not attempting to explain, by giving the sort of
            machinery which he thought really produced it, but he is endeavouring to make us

            represent to the senses, and which would produce such movements in the objects as they
            actually have.” For similar reasons it is impossible to draw any inference
            from this passage as to the question whether Plato believed in the daily revolution of
            the earth. In the <title>Timaeus</title>, according to Grote (<hi rend="italic">Plato on
              the Earth's Rotation</hi>, pp. 13 ff.), the cosmical axis is “a solid
            cylinder revolving or turning round, and causing thereby the revolution of the
            circumference or the sidereal sphere,” and necessarily also carrying round
            with itself the Earth, which is massed or globed round the axis of the whole (<foreign
              xml:lang="greek">ei)llome/nhn peri\ to\n dia\ panto\s po/lon tetame/non</foreign>
            <bibl n="Plat. Tim. 40B"><title>Tim.</title> 40 B</bibl>. ‘Massed’
            or ‘packed’ is Boeckh's interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
              >ei)llome/nhn</foreign>, with which Grote also agrees; but whether the word really
            bears this meaning, is another question, which we need not here discuss.) In support of
            his explanation of the passage in the <title>Timaeus</title>, Grote appeals to the myth
            of the <title>Republic</title>; and the appeal would be justified if Plato's figure of

            merely to represent the <hi rend="italic">form</hi>, of the celestial motions. As it is,

            travel at the same pace, and if their speed is the same, obviously they cannot complete
            their orbits in the same period. But it is doubtful whether the contradiction was
            present to Plato's mind, and Proclus may be right in holding that Plato was really
            thinking of the periods of the planets (l.c. and <hi rend="italic">in Tim.</hi> 259 C).

            Plato goes beyond Shakespeare, setting the angels on the orbs and making them sing. Cf.
            Milton <title>Arcades</title> 63 ff. “the celestial Sirens' harmony That sit
            upon the nine”—in Plato there are only eight—
            “infolded Spheres.” The seven planets by their movements were
            supposed by the Pythagoreans to give forth sounds corresponding to the notes of the
            Heptachord. This was probably the original form of the ‘Music of the
            Spheres.’ Later, it was held that the circle of the fixed stars had also a
            note of its own, and a ‘harmony’ or mode (see on III 398 E ff.)
            resulted like that of the Octachord. The underlying idea of the doctrine of the
            ‘Music of the Spheres’ was well expressed by Dorylaus when he said
            the Universe was the ‘organum Dei’ (Censor. <hi rend="italic">de die

            259 C and <hi rend="italic">in remp.</hi> l.c. et al. It is difficult to understand
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)na\ to/non</foreign>, which Hermann and Baiter read, following
              <hi rend="italic">q</hi> and a few inferior MSS. <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)na\
            to/non</foreign> could hardly mean ‘one note each,’ as Hermann
            supposes. With regard to the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(rmoni/a</foreign> itself, the pitch
            of the several notes will of course be determined by the speed of the different whorls
            (cf. VII 530 D note), so that if we express the notes by the names of the circles which
            produce them, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(rmoni/a</foreign> will be:—
            <figure/></p>
          <p>It is clear that Plato is thinking of a sort of mode (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)k pasw=n
              de\ o)ktw\ ou)sw=n mi/an a(rmoni/an cumfwnei=n</foreign>), but if we understand
              <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(/ma a)llh/lois</foreign> strictly, there will only be six
            notes, because Mercury, Venus and the Sun will each have the same note. Difficulties of
            this sort might have troubled the later Pythagoreans, but scarcely Plato, least of all
            in an imaginative picture of this kind. We note however that according to Plato the
            speed of the planets—except in the case of the Sun, Venus and
            Mercury—diminishes in proportion to their distance from the Earth. Now we may
            reasonably suppose that Plato thought the more distant planets took longer to complete
            their orbit than those which are nearer, so that <pb n="453"/> it is by no means
            improbable that in speaking of the speed of the planetary movements, Plato really had in
            his mind the time occupied by the orbital periods and not the rate of progression of the
            planets themselves. See also above on <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(/ma a)llh/lois</foreign>.
            In that case the octave will be complete, because in order to complete their orbits in
            the same time, the Sun, Venus and Mercury will have to travel at different rates of
            speed. Later writers knew all about the Music of the Spheres, and a choir of eight
            Neo-Pythagoreans would have had no difficulty in rendering it on a small scale: see for
            example von Jan's <title>Mus. Scr. Gr.</title> pp. 241 ff., 271 ff., 418 f. Cf. also

            what Plato means: for it would seem from what is said of Clotho and Lachesis that the
            right hand is appropriated to the circle of the Same, the left to that of the Other: see
            on 617 C. The words <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n me/rei</foreign>—if my view is

            depends both the Present and the Future. A similar lesson is conveyed by representing
            the lots and samples of lives as lying in the lap of Lachesis: cf. also 620 A <foreign

            in so far as it is good (VI 509 B ff.), so that our truest individuality is nothing more
            or less than that which is the best and highest part of our nature: cf. the words of

            We therefore attain our fullest development and enjoy our only true liberty as

            Gesetz nur kann uns Freiheit geben.” Proclus' comment, though true and
            instructive as far as it goes, does not exhaust the significance of Plato's saying:

            to account for the conspicuous inequalities between different men in respect of

            believe in the transmigration of the soul? Teichmüller summarily dismisses the
            entire theory as unplatonic (<title>Die Plat. Frage</title> pp. 1—20), while
            Susemihl, in harmony with certain ancient writers (see the references in Simson
              <title>Der Begriff d. Seele bei Platon</title> p. 152 note), takes Plato at his word
            so far as concerns the passage of the soul into new human bodies, but refuses to allow
            that he could have believed in transmigration into the forms of the lower animals
              (<title>Genet. Entwick.</title> II p. 272). Plato's language is however quite
            explicit, and there is the less reason for resorting to an allegorical interpretation,
            because the doctrine was already familiar in Greek philosophical and religious thought
            (see F. Laudowicz <hi rend="italic">Wesen u. Ursprung d. Lehre v. d.
              Präexistenz d. Seele</hi> etc. pp. 12—29 and Rohde
            <title>Psyche</title>^{2} II pp. 162 ff.), and is itself in general conformity with
            Plato's own conception of immortality. The doctrine of transmigration meets us
            frequently in Plato's dialogues, e.g. in <bibl n="Plat. Meno 81A"><title>Men.</title> 81
              A</bibl> ff.; <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 81E"><title>Phaed.</title> 81 E</bibl> ff., 113 A;
              <bibl n="Plat. Phaedrus 249B"><title>Phaedr.</title> 249 B</bibl>; <bibl
              n="Plat. Tim. 42B"><title>Tim.</title> 42 B</bibl> ff.: cf. 91 D ff. Most if not all
            of these passages have a mythical colouring, and should therefore be read in the light
            of the caveat which Plato subjoins to the eschatological myth of the
            <title>Phaedo</title>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ me\n ou)=n tau=ta diisxuri/sasqai

            wonder. In most cases, the souls chose in conformity with their previous
            lives—Orpheus, for example, selecting the life of a swan, Ajax that of a lion,

            contendere non magis potest, quam ut vincat, quum palmam fert victoriae.” This
            is true enough, but a similar objection may be made against Schneider's own solution,
            which makes Plato say <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(/na,

            is also, as Richards says, ‘very weak.’ Beginning as if he would say
            ‘both here and hereafter’ Plato elaborates the
            ‘hereafter’ into <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)peida\n—
              komizw/meqa</foreign>, not without some sacrifice of logical coherence.</p>
