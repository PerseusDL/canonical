					<head>INTRODUCTION</head>
					<p>THE author of the <hi rend="italics">Satyricon</hi> is identified by the
						large majority of scholars with Gaius Petronius,<note>He is called Titus
							Petronius by Plutarch (De Adulatore et Amico, 27).</note> the courtier
						of Nero. There is a long tradition in support of the identification, and the
						probability that it is correct appears especially strong in the light of
						Tacitus's account of the character and death of Gaius Petronius in the
						eighteenth and nineteenth chapters of the sixteenth book of the Annals. Mr.
						John Jackson has translated the passage as follows:</p>
					<p>"Petronius deserves a word in retrospect. He was a man who passed his days in
						sleep, his nights in the ordinary duties and recreations of life: others had
						achieved greatness by the sweat of their brows— Petronius idled into
						fame. Unlike most who walk the road to ruin, he was never regarded as either
						debauchee or wastrel, but rather as the finished artist in extravagance. In
						both word and action, he displayed a freedom and a sort of self-abandonment
						which were welcomed as the indiscretions of an unsophisticated nature. Yet,
						in his proconsulship of Bithynia, and later as consul elect, he showed
						himself an energetic and capable administrator. Then came the revulsion: his
						genuine or affected vices won him admittance into the narrow circle of
						Nero's intimates, and he became the Arbiter of Elegance, whose sanction
						alone divested pleasure of vulgarity and luxury of grossness.</p>
					<pb xml:id="p.viii"/>
					<p>"His success aroused the jealousy of Tigellinus against a possible
						rival—a professor of voluptuousness better equipped than himself.
						Playing on the emperor's lust for cruelty, to which all other lusts were
						secondary, he suborned a slave to turn informer, charged Petronius with his
						friendship for Scaevinus, deprived him of the opportunity of defence, and
						threw most of his household into prison.</p>
					<p>
						<quote>At that time, it happened, the court had migrated to Campania; and
							Petronius had reached Cumae, when his detention was ordered. He
							disdained to await the lingering issue of hopes and fears: still, he
							would not take a brusque farewell of life. An incision was made in his
							veins: they were bound up under his directions, and opened again, while
							he conversed with his friends—not on the gravest of themes, nor in
							the key of the dying hero. He listened to no disquisitions on the
							immortality of the soul or the dogmas of philosophy, but to frivolous
							song and playful verses. Some of his slaves tasted of his bounty, others
							of the whip. He sat down to dinner, and then drowsed a little; so that
							death, if compulsory, should at least be natural. Even in his will, he
							broke through the routine of suicide, and flattered neither Nero nor
							Tigellinus nor any other of the mighty: instead, he described the
							emperor's enormities; added a list of his catamites, his women, and his
							innovations in lasciviousness; then sealed the document, sent it to
							Nero, and broke his signet-ring to prevent it from being used to
							endanger others.</quote>
					</p>
					<p>The reflection arises at once that, given the <hi rend="italics"
							>Satyricon,</hi> this kind of book postulates this kind of author. The
						loose tongue, the levity, and the love of style are common to both. If books
						betray their writers<pb xml:id="p.ix"/> characteristics, Gaius Petronius, as
						seen by Tacitus, had the imagination and experience needed to depict the
						adventures of Encolpius.</p>
					<p>There is a little evidence, still based on the primary assumption, more exact
						in its bearing. The <hi rend="italics">Satyricon</hi> contains a detailed
						criticism of and a poem directed against the style of a writer who must be
						Lucan. Gaius Petronius was not the man to pass over the poet, epigrammatist,
						and courtier, in whose epoch and circle he himself shone. He may have
						deplored Lucan's poetic influence, but he could not neglect it, for Lucan
						was essentially the singer of his own day. No age was so favourable as that
						of Nero for the introduction into a supremely scandalous tale of a reasoned
						and appreciative review of the <hi rend="italics">Pharsalia,</hi> the
						outstanding poem of the time.</p>
					<p>The criticism of the schools of rhetoric in their effect upon education and
						language, and the general style of the book in reflective and descriptive
						passages, point more vaguely to a similar date of composition.</p>
					<p>Gaius Petronius found in his work a form which allowed complete expression to
						the many sides of his active and uncontrolled intellect. Its loose
						construction is matched by its indifference to any but stylistic reforms; it
						draws no moral; it is solely and properly occupied in presenting an aspect
						of things seen by a loiterer at one particular corner of the world. What we
						possess of it is a fragment, or rather a series of excerpts from the
						fifteenth and sixteenth books, we know not how representative of the
						original whole.</p>
					<pb xml:id="p.x"/>
					<p>Of this the best-known portion, the description of Trimalchio's dinner, was
						hidden from the modern world until the middle of the seventeenth century,
						and was first printed in 1664.<note>See section on the text, <hi
								rend="italics">codex Traguriensis.</hi></note></p>
					<p>It is as difficult to grasp any structural outline in the <hi rend="italics"
							>Satyricon</hi> as it is in <hi rend="italics">Tristram Shandy.</hi>
						Both alternate with flashing rapidity between exhibitions of pedantry,
						attacks on pedants, and indecency, in which Sterne is the more successful
						because he is the less obvious.</p>
					<p>But Petronius, so far as his plan was not entirely original, was following as
						model Varro's Menippean satires, and had before him the libel of Seneca on
						Claudius, the <hi rend="italics">Apocolocyntosis.</hi> The traditional title
						of his work, <hi rend="italics">Satyricon,</hi> is derived from the word <hi
							rend="italics">Satura, a medley,</hi> and means that he was free to pass
						at will from subject to subject, and from prose to verse and back: it is his
						achievement that the threads of his story, broken as we hold them, yet show
						something of the colour and variety of life itself. We call his book a
						novel, and so pay him a compliment which he alone of Roman writers has
						earned.</p>
					<p>Petronius's novel shares with life the quality of moving ceaselessly without
						knowing why. It differs from most existences in being very seldom dull. An
						anonymous writer of the eighteenth century, making Observations on the Greek
						and Roman Classics in a Series of Letters to a Young
							Nobleman,<note>Published in London, 1753.</note> is of the opinion that:
							<quote>You will in no Writer, my dear Lord, meet with so much true
							delicacy of thought, in none with purer language.</quote> This judgment
							is<pb xml:id="p.xi"/> meant for the age of Smollett and Fielding; but
						there is no question of the justice of the later remark:<quote>You will be
							charmed with the ease, and you will be surprised with the variety of his
							characters.</quote></p>
					<p>These characters are one and all the product of a period in history when the
						primary aim of the ripest civilization in the world was money-making. It was
						this aim which drew Trimalchio from his unknown birthplace in Asia Minor to
						the glitter and luxury and unnatural passion of a South Italian town. He
						differs from the minor personages who crowd his dining-room only in the
						enormous success with which he has plied the arts of prostitution,
						seduction, flattery and fraud. The persons in whom the action of the novel
						centres, Encolpius, the mouthpiece of the author, Ascyltos, and Giton, are
						there by the kindness of Agamemnon, a parasite teacher of the rhetoric which
						ate swiftly into the heart of Latin language and thought. Giton lives by his
						charms, Ascyltos is hardly more than a foil to Encolpius, a quarrelsome and
						lecherous butt.</p>
					<p>That part of the novel which deals with Trimalchio's dinner introduces a
						crowd of characters, and gives the most vivid picture extant in classical
						literature of the life of the small town. The pulsating energy of greed is
						felt in it everywhere. Men become millionaires with American rapidity, and
						enjoy that condition as hazardously in Cumae as in Wall Street. The
						shoulders of one who wallows in Trimalchio's cushions are still sore with
						carrying firewood for sale; another, perhaps the first undertaker who made a
						fortune out of extravagant funerals, a gourmet and spendthrift, sits there
						composing lies to baffle his hungry creditors. Trimalchio towers above them
							by<pb xml:id="p.xii"/> reason of his more stable fortunes and his
						colossal impudence. He can afford to delegate the conduct of his business,
						to grow a little negligent, even—for his accounts are six months in
						arrear—to care for the life of the spirit.</p>
					<p>He believes, of course, in astrology; he sings excerpts out of tune from the
						last musical play, and takes phrases from the lips of the comic star whom
						Nero delights to honour. He has two<note>The MS. says three, and may be
							right; he is drunk when he boasts of them.</note> libraries, one of
						Greek, one of Latin books, and mythology courses through his brain in
						incorrigible confusion.</p>
					<p>His fellow townsmen and guests, whom he insults, do not aspire to these
						heights. Dama, Seleucus, and Phileros are rich merely in the common coin of
						everyday talk, in the proverbial wisdom which seems to gather strength and
						brightness from being constantly exchanged. <quote>A hot drink is as good as
							an overcoat</quote>—<quote>Flies have their virtues, we are
							nothing but bubbles</quote>—<quote>An old love pinches like a
							crab</quote>—<quote>It is easy when everything goes fair and
							square.</quote> In these phrases and their like literature speaks to us
						for once in the tones we know in England through Justice Shallow or Joseph
						Poorgrass. Nearly all warm themselves with this fatuous talk of riches and
						drink and deaths, but one man, Ganymede, a shrewd Asiatic immigrant like
						Trimalchio himself, blows cold on their sentimentality with his searching
						talk of bread-prices in Cumae, rising pitilessly through drought and the
						operation of a ring of bakers in league with officials. He tells us in
						brilliant phrases of the starving poor, of the decay of religion, of lost
						pride in using good flour. Then Echion, an old<pb xml:id="p.xiii"/> clothes
						dealer, overwhelms him with a flood of suburban chatter about games, and
						children, and chickens, and the material blessings of education. But
						Ganymede is the sole character in Petronius's novel who brings to light the
						reverse side of Trimalchio's splendour. A system of local government which
						showers honours upon vulgarity, and allows Trimalchio his bath, his improved
						sanitation, his host of servants, his house with so many doors that no guest
						may go in and out by the same one, is invariably true to type in leaving
						poor men to die in the streets. The very existence of poverty becomes dim
						for Trimalchio, half unreal, so that he can jest at Agamemnon for taking as
						the theme of a set speech the eternal quarrel of rich and poor.</p>
					<p>Between rich and poor in Cumae the one link is commerce in vice. Trimalchio
						finds Fortunata the chorus-girl standing for sale in the open market, and
						calls her up to be the partner of his sterile and unmeaning prodigality. She
						has learnt all the painful lessons of the slums; she will not grace
						Trimalchio's table until dinner is over, and she has seen the plate safely
						collected from his guests, and the broken meats apportioned to his slaves;
						she knows the sting of jealousy, and the solace of intoxication or tears;
						normally she rules him, as Petruchio ruled Katharine, with loud assertion
						and tempest of words. The only other woman present at the dinner, Scintilla,
						the wife of Trimalchio's friend Habinnas, a monumental mason, is more
						drunken and unseemly, and leaves behind her a less sharp taste of
						character.</p>
					<p>Trimalchio's dinner breaks up with a false alarm of fire, and the infamous
						heroes of the story give Agamemnon the slip. Trimalchio vanishes, and with
						his loss<pb xml:id="p.xiv"/> the story becomes fragmentary once more, and
						declines in interest almost as much as in decency. Its attraction lies in
						the verse and criticism put into the mouth of Eumolpus, a debased poet whom
						Encolpius meets in a picture gallery. With him the adventures of the trio
						continue. There is a lodging-house brawl, a voyage where they find
						themselves in the hands of old enemies, the ship's captain Lichas, whose
						wife Hedyle they appear to have led astray, and Tryphaena, a peripatetic
						courtesan who takes the Mediterranean coast for her province, and has some
						unexplained claim on Giton's affections. They settle these disputes only to
						be involved in a shipwreck and cast ashore at Croton, where they grow fat on
						their pretension to be men of fortune, and disappear from sight, Encolpius
						after a disgraceful series of vain encounters with a woman named Circe, and
						Eumolpus after a scene where he bequeaths his body to be eaten by his
						heirs.</p>
					<p>Coherence almost fails long before the end: the episode in which Encolpius
						kills a goose, the sacred bird of Priapus, gives a hint, but no more, that
						the wrath of Priapus was the thread on which the whole<hi rend="italics"
							>Satyricon</hi> was strung. But the life of the later portions of the
						novel lies in the critical and poetical fragments scattered through it.
						These show Petronius at his best as a lord of language, a great critic, an
						intelligent enthusiast for the traditions of classical poetry and oratory.
						The love of style which was stronger in him even than his interest in
						manners doubly enriches his work. It brings ready to his pen the proverbs
						with their misleading hints of modernity,<note>See especially c. 41 to 46,
							57 to 59.</note> the debased syntax and abuse of gender, which fell from
							common<pb xml:id="p.xv"/> lips daily, but is reproduced here alone in
						its fullness;<note>See e.g. the notes of Buecheler or Friedlaender on the
								verbs<hi rend="italics">apoculamus</hi> (c. 62), <hi rend="italics"
								>duxissenz</hi> (c. 57), <hi rend="italics">plovebat</hi> (c. 44),
								<hi rend="italics">percolopabant</hi> (c. 44), the nouns <hi
								rend="italics">agaga</hi> (c. 69), <hi rend="italics"
								>babaecalis</hi> (c. 37),<hi rend="italics">bacalusias</hi> (c. 41),
								<hi rend="italics">barcalae</hi> (c. 67), <hi rend="italics"
								>burdubasta</hi> (c. 45), <hi rend="italics">gingilipho</hi> (c.
							73), and such expressions as <hi rend="italics">caelus hic</hi> (c. 39),
								<hi rend="italics">malus Fatzhs</hi> (c. 42), <hi rend="italics"
								>olim oliorum</hi> (c. 43), <hi rend="italics">nummorum Izzmmos</hi>
							(c. 37), and the Graecisms <hi rend="italics">saplutus</hi> and <hi
								rend="italics">topanta</hi> (c. 37).</note> and side by side with
						these mirrored vulgarisms the gravity of the attack on professional rhetoric
						with which the novel begins, and the weight of the teacher's defence, that
						the parent will have education set to a tune of his own calling; Eumolpus's
						brilliant exposition of the supremacy of the poet's task over that of the
						rhetorician or historian; the curious, violent, epic fragment by which he
						upholds his doctrine.</p>
					<p>Petronius employed a pause in literary invention and production in
						assimilating and expressing a view upon the makers<note>e.g. c. I to 5, 55,
							83, 88, 118.</note> of poems, prose, pictures, philosophies, and
						statues, who preceded him, and thereby deepened his interpretation of
						contemporary life. His cynicism, his continual backward look at the
						splendours and severities of earlier art and other morals, are the
						inevitable outcome of this self-education.</p>
					<p>By far the most genuine and pathetic expressions of his weariness are the
						poems which one is glad to be able to attribute to him. The best of them
						speak of quiet country and seaside, of love deeper than desire and founded
						on the durable grace of mind as well as the loveliness of the flesh, of
						simplicity and escape from Court.<note>See e.g. Poems 2, 8, 11, 13–15,
							and 22; of the love-poems, 25 and 26, but above all 16 and 27, which
							show (if they can be by him) a side of Petronius entirely hidden in the
							Satyricon.</note></p>
					<pb xml:id="p.xvi"/>
					<p>He knew the antidote to the fevered life which burnt him up. His book is
						befouled with obscenity, and, like obscenity itself, is ceasing by degrees
						to be part of a gentleman's education. But he will always be read as a
						critic; he tells admirable stories of werewolves and faithless
							widows;<note>In c.61 through Niceros, in c. 63 through Trimalchio, and
							in c. 111 through Eumolpus (the famous and cosmopolitan tale of the
							Widow of Ephesus).</note> he is one of the very few novelists who can
						distil common talk to their purpose without destroying its flavour. The
						translator dulls his brilliance, and must leave whole pages in the decent
						obscurity of Latin: he is fortunate if he adds a few to those who know
						something of Petronius beyond his name and the worst of his reputation.</p>
					<p>The thanks of the editors and the translator are due to Messrs. Weidmann of
						Berlin, who have generously placed at their disposal a copyright text of
							the<hi rend="italics">Satyricon,</hi> the epoch-making work of the late
						Professor Buecheler.</p>
					<p>Mr. H. E. Butler, Professor of Latin in the University of London, is
						responsible for the selection of critical notes from Buecheler's <hi
							rend="italics">editio maior,</hi> the Introduction to and text of the
						poems, and the Bibliography: the translator is indebted to him and to the
						editors for invaluable assistance in attempting to meet the difficulties
						which a rendering of Petronius continues to present.</p>

					<head>THE TEXT OF PETRONIUS</head>
