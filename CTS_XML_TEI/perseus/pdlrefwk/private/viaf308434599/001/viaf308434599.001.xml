<p>Though the names of well over a thousand Greek sculptors have survived, very few emerge as concrete personalities through either securely attributed works, or extended treatment in ancient texts, or (very occasionally) both. Here I select only the most prominent of them, offering an up-dated version of Part III of my <title>Greek Sculpture: An Exploration</title> (New Haven 1990). The rest remain mere shadows: for them, the reader is referred to the primary sources collected by <bibl>Overbeck 1868/1959</bibl>; <bibl>Löwy 1885/1976</bibl>; <bibl>Marcadé 1953</bibl>; <bibl>Marcadé 1957</bibl>; <bibl>Hebert 1989</bibl>; the selections from these translated into English by <bibl>Pollitt 1990</bibl>; and the thorough discussions by <bibl>Lippold 1950</bibl> and the various contributors to Pauly-Wissowa's <title>Realencyclopedie</title> (1894-present; here abbreviated to <title>RE</title>)(<bibl>Pauly-Wissowa 1920</bibl>, Thieme-Becker's <title>Kunstlerlexicon</title> (1907-1950; here abbreviated to <title>ThB</title>)(<bibl>Thieme &amp; Becker 1929</bibl>)  and the  <title>Enciclopedia dell'Arte Antica</title> (1958-1970; here abbreviated to <bibl><title>EAA</title></bibl>).</p>

<p>As in <title>Greek Sculpture</title> Part III, here I include only the "hard" evidence for the lives and works of the men I have selected: texts, inscriptions, extant works, and attributions. For fuller descriptions of their styles (where the evidence permits) and for critical assessments of their aims and achievements, the reader is referred to the scholarship collected in the bibliographies appended to each entry, and to the relevant pages of Parts I and II of <title>Greek Sculpture</title>.</p>

<p>Ancient writing about Greek sculpture was rich and extensive. The first attempt to gather all of it in one place, Franciscus Junius's <title>De Pictura Veterum</title> of 1637, included well over a thousand entries, and in 1868, Johannes Overbeck was able to increase this number to almost 2500; since then, the appearance of new texts (chiefly papyri) and further investigation of hitherto-overlooked ones have added quite a few more. Furthermore, archaeologists are continually unearthing new inscriptions either cut by or for sculptors (signatures) or mentioning them (dedications and decrees), quadrupling the number known to Emmanuel Löwy when he compiled his pioneering catalogue of them in 1885. Here, only the most important or revealing of these sources are translated. These <foreign xml:lang="la">testimonia</foreign> are numbered sequentially, <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>-<ref target="t171" n="U">T 171</ref>. Names of people and places have not been standardized but simply transcribed from the original Greek and Latin. This both avoids the awkwardness of "Hellenizing" Latin versions of Greek names in the middle of a text by a Roman writer and does not gloss over the not infrequent cases where medieval scribes have garbled the name sufficiently to make the original Greek a matter of debate.</p></div>

<div type="section" n="1"><head>The Literary Sources</head>

<p>The first descriptions of works of art in Greek literature are as old as Homer, where costly and beautiful articles are all part of the glittering world of the heroes, "a wonder to see" (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.725">Hom. Il. 5.725</bibl>, etc.). As befits his relentlessly objective, brightly illuminated portrait of a competitive society of conspicuous consumers, Homer places a high premium on beauty (equated with artistic realism) and skill his authority here will bias ancient attitudes on art to the end. Thereafter, authors of all periods commonly make reference to art works, sometimes merely for "local color", but often with some ulterior motive in mind.</p>

<p>J.J. Pollitt (<bibl>Pollitt 1990</bibl>) has conveniently separated these writers into four reasonably distinct groups: <term>literary analogists</term>, <term>moral aestheticians</term>, <term>professional critics</term>, and <term>compilers of tradition</term>. To take each in turn.</p>

<p>The use of the phenomenal world for <term>literary analogy</term> begins with Homer's similes; as an increasingly conspicuous part of his world, works of art were gradually likewise employed, though references to sculpture are rarer than to painting or decorative art. Examples are legion, but in each case, the work of art is but a tool, a springboard for a purely literary point. Thus around 485, Pindar may contrast his winged words of praise with a sculptor's offering, "doomed to linger only on the pedestal where it stands" (<bibl n="Pind. N. 5">Pind. N. 5. l-3</bibl>), while four centuries later the literary critic Dionysios of Halikarnassos can now compare a "classic" prose style "with the art of Polykleitos and Pheidias because of its august, dignified, and grand style" (<ref target="t61" n="U">T 61</ref>). Soon, the terminology of literary criticism was widely and often sensitively employed in this way, using lists of artists specially compiled by Alexandrian or Pergamene rhetoricians (e.g. <ref target="t115" n="U">T 115</ref>). Yet one must remember that such comparisons, while illuminating Greco-Roman perceptions of Greek sculpture, were often partially conditioned by prevailing neo-classical tastes, and that the analytical terminology of one discipline is seldom transferable to another without strain.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Ostensibly more independent are the literary descriptions of works of art; the genre ultimately derives from Homer's Shield of Achilles in <title>Iliad</title> 18. Yet even here rhetoric remains paramount: thus to Kallistratos, writing ca. A.D. 300, the iconography and style of Skopas's Maenad (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 547) matter little against such extravagances as these: "The statue of a Maenad, wrought from Parian marble, has been transformed into a real Maenad. For the stone, while retaining its own nature, yet seemed to depart from the law which governs stone; what one saw was really an image, but art carried imitation over into actual reality.... When we saw her face we stood speechless...." (<ref target="t114" n="U">T 114</ref>).</p>

<p>Finally, there is the humorist Lucian (ca. A.D. l20-180). Once a sculptor's apprentice, he tells how he switched to rhetoric because Education told him: "Even if you should become a Pheidias or a Polykleitos and should create many marvellous works, everyone will praise your skill for sure, but none of your admirers, if he had sense, would want to be like you; for whoever you might become, you would still be considered a laborer, a man who lives by his hands and has nothing but his hands" (<title>The Dream</title> 9). His remarks on sculpture (such as, for example, <ref target="t44" n="U">T 44</ref> and <ref target="t91" n="U">T 91</ref>) are important; he also devotes a whole essay to selecting features from various female statues to form an ideal beauty, an eclecticism typical of his age (<ref target="t58" n="U">T 58</ref>; cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 314, 507):</p>

<quote><p>From the Knidia [the sculptor] takes only the head...allowing the hair, forehead, and that lovely brow-line to remain as Praxiteles made them; and the liquid yet clear and winsome gaze of the eyes shall stay as Praxiteles conceived it. But he will take the curve of the cheeks and the fore part of the face from Alkamenes' [Aphrodite] in the Gardens, plus her hands, graceful wrists and supple, tapering fingers. But the facial contour, its sides and shapely nose will be supplied by the Lemnian Athena by Pheidias, who will also furnish the meeting of the lips and the neck, taken from the Amazon. Sosandra and Kalamis shall adorn her with modesty, and with a faint, holy smile....</p></quote>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Rhetorical criticism sometimes makes moral judgements, blaming as well as praising. This <emph>moral</emph> dimension of art first interested philosophers in the fifth century, when the Sophists began to discuss representation (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">mimesis</foreign>) in the arts and to evaluate it as a skill or craft (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">techne</foreign>). With unabashed relativism, the Sophist Gorgias hailed deception as the aim of all mimesis, so that while rhetoric entrances the ears, "the creation of statues and the working of images furnishes a divine sweetness to the eyes" (<title>Helen</title> 18), persuading by a sort of magical power. Philosophers who believed in universals responded quickly: conceding the power (and danger) of techne. Plato attacked it for its third-hand mimesis of "true" reality and absolute beauty. Painting, by now increasingly powerful and impressionistic, is particularly lambasted, but sculpture does not escape unscathed, as in his stinging indictment of "doctored" proportions in the Sophist (<ref target="t135" n="U">T 135</ref>). Such deception is morally damaging, and Plato (though no philistine) has to prefer Egyptian sculpture, timeless, unchanging, and ideal (<bibl n="Plat. Laws 656e">Plat. Laws 656e</bibl>). To Aristotle, however, techne not merely imitates but completes nature, since it uses natural materials to create objects unknown in nature. Mimesis thereby has its own purposes, laws, and "virtues" if pursued properly and in accordance with its true function; in particular, it should aim at the mean.</p>

<p>Such theorising had little practical effect on art itself. The notion that form may follow function indeed pervades Hellenistic art, but Aristotle's opinions hardly <emph>caused</emph> such a development, however well they may have appeared to justify it. The same goes for the last great aesthetic theory of antiquity, the so-called <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">phantasia</foreign> theory. Probably working from a definition of <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">techne</foreign> by the Stoic Chrysippos (ca. 280-207) as "a skill proceeding methodically by the aid of mental images (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">phantasiai</foreign>)", (Long-Sedley no. 42A), its adherents held that the creative artist's intuition could penetrate as if by divine inspiration directly to the heart of his subject. It first appears in connection with the classical "Old Masters", particularly Pheidias (<ref target="t54" n="U">T 54</ref>), and Hellenistic-Roman neo-classical attitudes to art. Thus Cicero praises Pheidias's "perfection" then adds that "when he created his Zeus or Athena, he did not contemplate any persons from whom he drew a likeness, but rather a sort of extraordinary apparition of beauty resided in his mind, and, concentrating on it and intuiting its nature, he directed his art and his hand towards reproducing it" (<title>Orator</title> 2.9; cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 361, 372).</p>

<p>Finally, there are the early Christian fathers, whose attacks on idolatry regularly included descriptions or catalogues of such idols, of widely varying fidelity. Fairly typical of these, though more informative than most, is Clement of Alexandria's <title>Exhortation to the Greeks</title> or Protreptikos, published around A.D. 200, whose fourth chapter is entirely directed against image-worship of all kinds, from primitive <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">xoana</foreign> to Sarapis and the statues of the Emperors. He regularly cites his sources but in the heat of divinely-inspired invective tends to paraphrase them sloppily. Nevertheless, his witness is crucial for the history of such important cult-images as the Samian Hera and the Alexandrian Sarapis (<ref target="t14" n="U">T 14</ref> and 149; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 14-15, 632-34).</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Greek moral philosophy, then, gives us a series of individual intellectual perspectives on art. With the possible exceptions of Sophistic relativism, the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">phantasia</foreign>-theory, and Christian iconoclasm it can seldom have influenced either artists themselves or their wider public, though both may at times have responded to other aspects of the intelligentsia's thinking, such as their ideas on the Gods. For example, both Pheidias and the materialistic philosopher Anaxagoras were friends of Perikles (<ref target="t47" n="U">T 47</ref>), though whether they all ever saw eye to eye is problematic.</p>

<p>The case of Polykleitos is different. The ambience which produced his <title>Canon</title> (<ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref>, <ref target="t66 t67 t68 t69" n="U">66-9</ref>), the mathematical treatise on ideal proportion that is the first known example of <term>professional criticism</term> in sculpture, was fiercely competitive: the nude male was the focus, achievement of absolute beauty the goal, recognition the prize, and a treatise a prime way to assert one's claims. The intellectual roots of his work are obscure, though in architecture a long line of such books had been inaugurated by the sculptor-architect Theodoros of Samos ca. 550. Two prime ingredients may have been a workshop tradition of handing down proportional schemes for (cf. <ref target="t21" n="U">T 21</ref>), perhaps verbally or in simple diagrammatic form, plus the number-theory of the influential philosopher Pythagoras (active around 500). With mathematics in its infancy and still closely tied to geometry, sculptors and philosophers could talk the same language.</p>

<p>Polykleitos's Canon, now lost but for two or three fragments, dominated its field for a century and more, though around 350 Euphranor and Silanion published "alternative" canons (<ref target="t117" n="U">T 117</ref>; Vitruvius 7 praef. l4), and finally in the early third century, the sculptor Xenokrates (<ref target="t145 t146" n="U">T 145-6</ref>) wrote a treatise that attempted a historical perspective for the first time, enthroning "the new and hitherto untried canon" (<ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>) of his own "master" Lysippos, as the culmination of the entire tradition. <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">Symmetria</foreign> (commensurability), <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">rhythmos</foreign> (composition), and <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">akribeia</foreign> (accuracy of detail) were Xenokrates' criteria, and his writings, now lost but probably the source for some remarks of Pliny's (<ref target="t40" n="U">T 40</ref>, <ref target="t43" n="U">T 43</ref>, <ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref>, <ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>, <ref target="t145" n="U">T 145</ref>, <ref target="t146" n="U">T 146</ref>), were the first true art history of antiquity.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>This retrospective atmosphere intensified during the Hellenistic period with the sense that Greece's period of true creativity was over. Scholars turned to classifying and recording, to writing handbooks on every subject imaginable, and it was inevitable that sculpture would soon be among them. Among these <term>compilers of tradition</term>, Douris of Samos (active ca. 280; cf. <ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>) produced a set of anecdotal and highly-colored lives of major artists, and Antigonos of Karystos (active ca. 240: cf. <ref target="t78" n="U">T 78</ref> and <ref target="t145" n="U">T 145</ref>) combined this biographical approach with the professional criticism of Xenokrates. In the second century, Polemon of Elis wrote a critique of Antigonos, while Heliodoros of Athens published a guidebook to the Akropolis and elsewhere (<ref target="t145" n="U">T 145</ref>). Finally, in the first century, the neoclassic sculptor Pasiteles wrote five volumes on the world's masterpieces of sculpture (<ref target="t145" n="U">T 145</ref>, <ref target="t163" n="U">T 163</ref>) and Strabo included many statues in his <title>Geography</title> (e.g. <ref target="t21" n="U">T 21</ref>, 49). Two Romans continued the practice: M. Terentius Varro (116-28) paraphrased these Hellenistic authors extensively in his works (<ref target="t145" n="U">T 145</ref>, cf. 62, 163), and C. Lucinius Mucianus (died before A.D. 77) wrote an account of Asian antiquities.</p>

<p>Strabo survives, but of the others only fragments remain, chiefly in Pliny's encyclopedia or <title>Natural History</title>, published in A.D. 77. Books 34 and 36 deal with bronzes and marbles respectively, and give us a cut-and-paste synopsis of Hellenistic and Roman connoisseurship. In book 34, brief histories of alloys, statue-types, patronage, and technique are followed by a chronological list (the only one extant) of bronze sculptors by Olympiads, beginning with Pheidias in Ol. 83 (448-445 BC) (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>). Its accuracy, poor at the beginning, improves markedly for the fourth century, until with Lysippos' pupils in Ol. 121 (296-293 BC) "the art ceased". A classical revival by "inferiors, yet still men of repute" is put in Ol. 156 (156-153). Accounts of the major artists come next, enlivened by anecdotes from Douris and brief analytical passages from Xenokrates, then a catalogue of lesser masters and their works. Book 36 (marble sculpture) is straightforwardly chronological, from supposed beginnings under Dipoinos and Skyllis in Ol. 50 (580-577 BC) to Greco-Roman sculptors like the masters of the Laokoon and Pasiteles. Throughout, Pliny rarely offers extensive descriptions or praise other than for realism (e.g. <ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>), which sits uneasily with his generally classical bias: Hellenistic sculpture is seldom mentioned and never dated. Some works were apparently selected specially to flatter the emperor Vespasian and his son, Titus (e.g. <ref target="t171" n="U">T 171</ref>).</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Our only other extant account of Greek sculpture was also a late offspring of Hellenistic curiosity. The traveller Pausanias wrote his <title>Description of Greece</title> around A.D. 170, covering Greece as far north as Boeotia. A careful, pedestrian writer, he is interested not only in the grandiose or the exquisite but in unusual sights and obscure ritual. He is occasionally careless, or makes unwarranted inferences, and his guides or even his own notes sometimes mislead him; yet his honesty is unquestionable, and his value without par. He dutifully lists sculptures of all periods, but reserves detailed descriptions and real praise for Pheidias and his pupils (<ref target="t50" n="U">T 50</ref>, 77), and for their second-century imitator, Damophon of Messene (<ref target="t156" n="U">T 156</ref>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 788-92). Yet his tastes were not wholly conformist: the Athena Lemnia, not the Parthenos, "is the best of all Pheidias's works to see" (1.28.2; compare Lucian, above; cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 313, 361), and, more surprisingly, he has a special affection for certain pre-Pheidian masters, particularly Pythagoras of Rhegion, "a good sculptor, if ever there was one" (<ref target="t41" n="U">T 41</ref>) and Onatas of Aegina, "second to none of the successors of Daidalos and the Attic school" (<ref target="t38" n="U">T 38</ref>). He even appreciates archaic statues, "somewhat uncouth to the eye, but with a touch of the divine in them nevertheless" (<ref target="t7" n="U">T 7</ref>).</p>

<p>Without Pliny and Pausanias our knowledge of Greek sculpture would be meager indeed. Yet with imagination one can flesh over the bare bones of now-vanished glories which they offer from another source, still virtually untapped: the entire span of Greek literature. Thus archaic poetry may tell us what delights the gods in their sanctuaries, and so help to unveil the meaning of kouroi and korai; classical prose writers may address the problem of the individual and polis, and so contribute to an understanding of contemporary portraiture; and a late fourth-century hymn may present an unusual picture of Dionysos and Apollo, and so lead to insights into syncretism in early Hellenistic art. The possibilities are great, the horizons as yet unmarked.</p></div>

<div type="section" n="2"><head>The Inscriptions</head>

<p>Inscriptions on stone are precious evidence for Greek sculpture of all periods. Unfortunately, comparatively few are exactly datable, through the inclusion of a magistrate's name or a reference to a known historical event. Personalities mentioned in the text can sometimes help towards an approximate dating, if their life-spans or family trees are otherwise attested. For the rest, however, the general content of the inscription and the stage of development of the script (an increasingly hazardous criterion after ca. 400) are our only guides. The form of the monument and the type of inscription can sometimes help, or at any rate give an initial or terminal date. Thus the use of columns as statue-bases stops at Athens ca. 460, and Attic decrees honoring public benefactors with portraits cannot be earlier than 394.</p>

<p>For our purposes, inscriptions fall into two classes: those engraved on the sculpture itself or its base, and those not.</p>

<p>Since most Greek sculpture was religious, most inscriptions on it are votive or funerary. Early votive dedications are often cut on the statue itself and are regularly in verse. Thus (<rs key="Boston 03.997" type="sculpture">Boston 03.997</rs>):</p>

<quote><l>Mantiklos dedicated me to the far-shooting Lord of the Silver Bow, a tithe</l>
<l>You, Phoibos, might give me some pleasing favor in return.</l></quote>

<p>Formulas vary, but the dedicant's patronymic, city, and profession, the occasion or purpose of the dedication, and the sculptor's signature can be added, especially later. Thus, ca. 300,</p>

<cit>
<quote><p>Megakles son of Megakles of Rhamnous dedicated (this) to Themis; he was crowned by the demesmen for his fairness when Kallistrato was priestess, and he won victories as boys' and men's trainer, and when Pheidostrate was priestess of Nemesis, as chorus-master in the comedies. Chairestratos son of Chairedemos of Rhamnous made it.</p></quote>
<bibl>IG, 22 no. 3109. <rs key="Athens 231" type="sculpture">Athens 231</rs></bibl>
</cit>

<p>Such texts are often critical for identifications: with her attributes missing, the Themis herself would otherwise be anonymous, and in the case of the Samian group by Geneleos (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 97), the seated figure (which looks male) is named Phileia.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>In the archaic period, the statue itself sometimes speaks in the first person. Compare the following with Mantiklos' dedication: "I am Chares, son of Kleisias, ruler of Teichioussa. The <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">agalma</foreign> is Apollo's." (<rs key="Boston 03.997" type="sculpture">Boston 03.997</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 107.) This suggests a kind of animism that in fact harmonises closely not only with the feelings that led the Greeks to see a god in a river, or to animate mirror-supports as human figures and table legs as lions' paws, but also with their idea that a craftsman's work was divinely inspired, and so somehow numinous. In monumental sculpture, at least until the growth of classical rationalism, the temptation to make the statue's novel and arresting naturalism explicit in this way must have been almost overwhelming. Furthermore, as personal statements by the subject of the statue, such inscriptions help to individualize the work and so herald the emergence of portraiture. As for the word <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">agalma</foreign>, "delight", this becomes standard archaic usage for "votive", and eventually comes to describe statues of divinities and temple-sculpture in general.</p>

<p>From ca. 350, both official and private honorary dedications of portraits, a result of increasing individual self-assertion as the polis declines, become ever more popular. Thus: "Her mother Archippe, daughter of Kouphagoros of Aixione, dedicated Archippe, daughter of Kleogenes of Aixione. Praxiteles made it" (<bibl>Marcadé 1957</bibl>, 115).</p>

<p>Sculptors made dedications too. Though relatively rare, they persist throughout the period, and testify to the profits the trade could bring. The earliest sculptor's signature (ca. 630) is one such: "Euthykartides the Naxian dedicated me, having made [me]" (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 40).</p>

<p>Sepulchral inscriptions are almost as numerous and heterogeneous as votives. The simplest type includes only the deceased's name, but more grandiose monuments are more forthcoming, and again often speak in verse. Thus from early sixth century Boeotia: "Amphalkes erected this for Kitylos and Dermys." (<rs key="Athens, NM 56" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 56</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 61). And from late sixth-century Attica:</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Classical Athens also erected official carved war-memorials; Dexileos himself is mentioned on the one for 394.</p>

<p>Some of these inscriptions have included sculptor's signatures. These began around 630 (Euthykartides: <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 40), fifty years before vase-painters' signatures but nearly a century after the first potters', and by ca. 500 were usually cut by professional masons, not the sculptors themselves. A personal act of self-assertion by artists, this move was virtually unprecedented: we have only a handful of Egyptian signatures, and none from elsewhere. Yet even in Greece, signatures are relatively infrequent (rather over a thousand survive), as in Renaissance Italy when Raphael signed only a few paintings and Michelangelo only his Pietà and that in a fit of pique. Yet this by no means diminishes the significance of the practice: what is astonishing is that artists signed at all.</p>

<p>The usual formulae are represented by the signatures of Chairestratos, Praxiteles and, Aristion, above, though occasionally "the work of..." is used instead (<ref target="t152" n="U">T 152</ref>). At home, most sculptors omitted the ethnic ("of Athens", etc.); architectural sculpture and gravestones were almost never signed. Several sculptors may collaborate on a group, like Polykleitos's followers at Delphi around 400 (each man taking two or three statues, cf. <ref target="t85" n="U">T 85</ref>), or Hagesandros, Athanodoros, and Polydoros of Rhodes at Sperlonga; dual signatures sometimes appear on one base (Kritios and Nesiotes, ca. 470). Here it is uncertain how the work was divided, though in Hellenistic Rhodes bronze portraits often bore the signatures of artist and caster. In Attica, even early signatures were cut on the base, not the statue itself; elsewhere, they gravitate there by ca. 500, though Hellenistic exporters sign on the supports of their statues, which then get a base on arrival. Whether their statues are copies or not, they sign with their own names, but Greek originals taken to Pergamon and Rome received new bases bearing their real authors' names, as on a recent find from Ostia (<ref target="t155" n="U">T 155</ref>).</p>

<p>Very occasionally, the sculptor ventures something more. In mid sixth-century Attica, the remarkably self-assertive Phaidimos ("brilliant") calls himself <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">sophos</foreign>, "clever", and describes a kore of his as "beautiful to behold" (<bibl>Jeffery 1962</bibl>, 137, 139 nos. 44, 48), while on a Boeotian stele of ca. 490 where one foot has been boldly foreshortened we read "Alxenor of Paros made me: just look!" (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 254). And ca. 420, Paionios proudly announces below his Nike at Olympia that "he also won the competition for making the akroteria for the temple [of Zeus]" (<ref target="t81" n="U">T 81</ref>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 408-11).</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Sometimes, to conclude, inscriptions were added to sculptures for clarification. The names of Dermys and Kitylos are inscribed beside them, a practice that recurs on the friezes of the Sikyonian and Siphnian treasuries at Delphi, ca. 570 and 530, and on later relief sculpture, both architectural and votive. At both Tegea and the Mausoleum, ca. 350, letters were cut into the backs of the figures to mark their positions in the ensemble.</p>

<p>Inscriptions dealing with but not directly appended to statues fall into two main classes: decrees and public accounts. The democracies, especially Athens, inscribed official resolutions to erect temples from ca. 450, and from the fourth century as the cities' dependence upon outside benefactors grew, so did the passing of honorary decrees. "So that all will know that the Athenian people remembers and thanks its helpers, and worthily honors their beneficence for all time, [BE IT RESOLVED] to set up a 3000-drachma bronze statue of Asklepiades in Byzantion, and to crown it with a 1000-drachma golden crown...." (<title>IG</title> 22 no. 555: ca. 305). Honors to sculptors, even, are occasionally found: a particularly full and revealing example is translated in <ref target="t137" n="U">T 137</ref>.</p>

<p>Public accounts are the reverse side of the coin. Those for Pheidias's Athena Promachos (ca. 450) and the Parthenon (447-432) are the earliest, but are too fragmentary to quote here. The Erechtheum inscriptions (409-406) are more complete, especially concerning the frieze (<ref target="t80" n="U">T 80</ref>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 433-35). Here, both resident aliens (Mynnion and Soklos) and citizens (Phyromachos and Iasos) are hired on piece-work rates, and payments are carefully matched to the size of the job. Elsewhere, and at other times, we learn that conditions varied markedly. Thus at Epidauros ca. 380, <ref target="t88" n="U">T 88</ref> tells us that the temple's architectural sculptures (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 455-65) were paid for in lump sums in advance.</p>

<p>Like the literary sources, the epigraphical evidence can be a goldmine if used imaginatively. Occasionally it allows us to correct the testimony of the literature and often supplements it, particularly in the Archaic and Hellenistic periods. Some inscriptions may furnish crucial information as to the wealth, status, and self-evaluation of sculptors; others can be used to gauge patrons' motives and to chart patterns of patronage; while still others such as epitaphs point to the way in which the sculpture itself should be "read."  The art historian neglects them at his peril.</p></div></div></div>

<p>I preface the entries for individual sculptors by three Roman "histories" of the art and one critical comment that place the literary evidence in its context and sometimes help to explain its shortcomings (<ref target="t1 t2 t3 t4" n="U">T 1-4</ref>). In particular, the classicistic leanings of the Roman writers should be obvious, and account for the great imbalance in our evidence as a whole: scanty for the archaic period, voluminous and varied for the classical, and scanty again for the Hellenistic. In sum, our perspective upon the creators of what was arguably the world's most vital sculptural tradition is essentially a Roman one. This is regrettable, but not to be denied; epigraphical and other sources may amplify the picture somewhat, but cannot really correct its distortions.</p>

<p>The only comprehensive chronology to survive is Pliny's, which is restricted to bronze-workers:</p>

<cit xml:id="t1" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, N.H. 35.49-52</bibl>

<quote><p>An almost innumerable multitude of artists achieved fame for smaller statues and images; but preeminent among them is Phidias the Athenian, celebrated for the Olympian Jupiter (in fact of ivory and gold, though he also made bronze statues). He flourished in the 83rd Olympiad, about the 300th year of our city [448-445] and at this same time his rivals were Alcamenes, Critias, Nesiotes, and Hegias; later, in the 87th Olympiad [432-429] were Hagelades, Callon, and the Spartan Gorgias; again, in the 90th [420-417] there were Polyclitus, Phradmon, Myron, Pythagoras, Scopas, and Perellus. Of these Polyclitus had as pupils Argius, Asopodorus, Alexis, Aristides, Phryno, [Dino], Athenodorus, and Demeas of Cleitor; and Myron had Lycius. In the 95th Olympiad [400-397] flourished Naucydes, Dinomenes, Canachus, and Patroclus; in the 102nd [372-369] Polycles, Cephisodotus, Leuchares, Hypatodorus; in the 104th [364-361] Praxiteles and Euphranor; in the 107th [352-349] Aetion and Therimachus. Lysippus was in the 113th, the time of Alexander the Great [328-325], and also his brother Lysistratus, Sthennis, Euphron, [Eucles], Sostratus, Ion, and Silanion — concerning him it is remarkable that he became famous without a teacher; he himself had Zeuxiades as pupil; — and in the 121st [296-293] Eutychides, Euthycrates, Laippus, Cephisodotus, Timarchus, and Pyromachus. Then the art ceased, but revived again in the 156th Olympiad [156-153] when there were the following, far inferior it is true to those listed above, but still artists of repute: Antaeus, Callistratus, Polycles of Athens, Callixenus, Pythocles, Pythias, and Timocles.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Besides its narrow chronological range, this list contains a number of "adjustments" and several egregious errors. Its original compiler was presumably an extreme neo-classicist at work soon after Ol. 156 (156-153), perhaps Apollodoros of Athens (ca. 180-110) whose <title>Chronika</title>, dedicated to Attalos II of Pergamon, ended in 144 B.C. He could either find no dates prior to 450 or, more likely, simply ignored them in order to justify the inaugurative role he gives to Pheidias. Furthermore, he also wrote off most of the Hellenistic period, and only grudgingly admitted the neo-classical sculptors of his own day into the "canon".</p>

<p>In fact, other sources show that Kritios, Nesiotes, and Hegias/Hegesias (Ol. 83 = 448-445) are placed a generation too late (cf. <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>, 34, etc.); Hageladas (cf. <ref target="t25" n="U">T 25</ref>), Kalon, and Gorgias flourished not ca. 430 but ca. 500; and Myron and Pythagoras (Ol. 90 = 420-417) actually belong around 470-440 and 480-450, respectively. By contrast, the classical and neo-classical sculptors, where identifiable, seem correctly placed but for Skopas (Ol. 90 = 420-417), who worked around 350, and Phyromachos (Ol. 121 = 296-293), who was active in the late third or early second centuries. Skopas (if not a homonymous ancestor of the late classical master) remains a puzzle, but Phyromachos' inclusion may have been prompted by his appearance in the Hellenistic lists of great masters (e.g. <ref target="t115" n="U">T 115</ref>); once again Pliny's source either knew nothing of his real date and very "baroque" style, or simply ignored them in order to save his preconceived scheme.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Aside from the central chapters of <title>Natural History</title> 34 and 36 (many extracts from which will appear below), the only other historically-organized accounts of the sculptors are by Cicero and Quintilian. Like Pliny, both apparently drew upon Hellenistic sources which saw the classic (as represented by the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">andrianta</foreign> of Polykleitos and the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">agalmata</foreign> of Pheidias) as the apex of Greek sculptural achievement. Both their accounts cover painting as well, and were included only as analogies to the development of oratory:</p>

<cit xml:id="t2" n="testimonium"><bibl>Cicero, Brutus 18.70</bibl>

<quote><p>For who among those who pay attention to the lesser arts is not aware that the statues of Canachus are too stiff to imitate natural truth? Those of Calamis are also hard, though more supple than Canachus'; even Myron's have not yet fully attained true naturalness, though at that stage one would not hesitate to call them beautiful; still more beautiful are those of Polyclitus, now in my view indeed quite perfect. A similar systematic development exists in painting ... and the same sort of thing happens in all the other arts ...</p></quote></cit>

<cit xml:id="t3" n="testimonium"><bibl>Quintilian 12.7-9</bibl>

<quote><p>The same differences [as in painting] exist among the sculptors. The statues of Callon and Hegesias are rather hard and closest to the Etruscans', but already Calamis is less stiff, and Myron made ones that are more supple still. In precision of detail and appropriateness Polyclitus surpassed all others, but although most critics hand him the victor's palm, to avoid making him faultless they hold that he lacks gravity. For while he gave the human body a form so appropriate that it surpassed reality, he is felt not to have done justice to the impressiveness of the gods. He is also said to have shunned subjects of maturer years, daring nothing beyond fresh-cheeked youths. But those qualities lacking in Polyclitus are attributed to Phidias and Alcamenes. Phidias is regarded as better at representing gods than men, and indeed in ivory he would have no peer even had he made nothing but his Minerva at Athens or Olympian Jupiter in Elis, whose beauty is said to have added something to the traditional religion, so much did the majesty of the work equal that of the god. Lysippus and Praxiteles are said to have best attained true naturalism. For Demetrius is blamed as too extreme in this respect, being more fond of likeness than beauty. Turning to the various oratorical styles...</p></quote></cit>

<p>Both authors supplement the abrupt opening of <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref> by a "hardness scale" proceeding from the "primitive" archaic style of ca. 500 to the classic of ca. 450. In contrast to Pliny's, the relative chronology seems quite sound: on Kanachos and Myron, see <ref target="t26 t27 t43 t44 t45" n="U">T 26-27, 43-45</ref>. Quintilian's further remarks on fourth-century sculptors and "naturalism" perhaps reflect an attempt to reconcile the pro-Pheidian view of sculptural development with that proposed by the early Hellenistic critic Xenokrates (<ref target="t40" n="U">T 40</ref>, 42, 43, 62, 124, 145-46), who saw his teacher Lysippos as the supreme master of the art. See the thorough commentary by R.G. Austin, <title>Quintiliani Institutionis Oratoriae, Liber 12</title> (Oxford 1948): 135-152.</p>

<p>Taking <ref target="t1 t2 t3" n="U">T 1-3</ref> together, then, it is clear that by the mid first century A.D., and probably much earlier, observers had divided Greek sculptural development into four periods: "primitive" (to ca. 450), "classic" (from ca. 450-300), "degenerate" (ca. 300-150), and "resurgent" or neo-classic (from ca. 150 on). This scheme is exactly congruent with that proposed in the later first century B.C. for Greek and Roman rhetoric by Cicero and Dionysios of Halikarnassos (in the prologue to <title>On the Ancient Orators</title>: cf. <ref target="t61" n="U">T 61</ref>), and so once again is probably derived, like so much ancient art criticism, from late Hellenistic and Roman republican classicistic rhetorical theory (see esp. <bibl>Schweitzer 1932/1963</bibl>, 144; <bibl>Preisshofen 1978</bibl>; <bibl>Gabba 1982</bibl>, 46). Its devastating effect upon our knowledge of the two periods thus proscribed hardly needs to be rehearsed afresh; less well appreciated, though, is that its baneful influence still persists today, for whereas archaic sculpture was admitted to the status of "art" a century ago, Hellenistic sculpture, despite valiant attempts at rehabilitation, is still generally underrated, even at times openly scorned, by historians still hobbled by the prejudices of the past.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Yet even where the sources are most informative, for the classic period, they by no means furnish a complete and reliable mercator-map of personalities and styles, and thus a rock-solid basis for attributions. The reasons for this lie partly in the diverse interests of writers and copyists, partly in the often-overlooked fact that even in antiquity, to distinguish the styles of even first-rank artists was recognized as extremely difficult:</p>

<cit xml:id="t4" n="testimonium"><bibl>Dionysios of Halikarnassos, Demosthenes 50</bibl>

<quote><p>For not even sculptors and painters, unless they undertake an extended course in connoisseurship, scrutinizing the styles of the old masters at length — not even they can readily identify them and confidently say that this statue is by Polykleitos, this by Pheidias, this by Alkamenes, and that that painting is by Polygnotos, that by Timanthes, that by Parrhasios. So it is with literature ...</p></quote></cit>

<p>Compare here Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 36.27-8. Dionysios was not so trained yet in <ref target="t61" n="U">T 61</ref> etc. is regularly to be found characterizing individual sculptors' styles to illustrate his investigations into rhetorical style. The fact that he was able to let slip such a confession should be borne in mind as one approaches these last few chapters. How far are we entitled either to treat the judgements of the Greeks and Romans as gospel, or indeed to assume that our eyes can be significantly more discriminating than theirs, particularly when we have enormously less evidence at hand with which to train them?</p>

<p>Though the place-name <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">dadarejode</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">daidaleonde</foreign> is known from the Knossian Linear B tablets (ca. 1400 B.C.), the first mention of the artist Daidalos ("Cunning-Worker") is in Homer's description of the Shield of Achilles:</p>

<p>Thereafter, the sources are silent till the fifth century, when an Aeschylean satyr-chorus describes a lifelike series of masks on a temple, "wrought by superhuman skill":</p>

<p>Many classical and later authors elaborate upon this theme, and a few offer other (sometimes conflicting) judgments and miscellaneous information about his innovations:</p>

<cit xml:id="t7" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 2.4.5">Pausanias 2.4.5</bibl>

<quote><p>The sanctuary of Athena Chalinitis is by the theater [of Corinth], and near it is a naked wooden image of Herakles, said to be by Daidalos. All the works of this artist, though somewhat uncouth to look at, nevertheless have a touch of the divine in them.</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p>Daedalus invented carpentry, and with it the saw, axe, plumb-line, drill, glue, and isinglass; but Theodorus of Samos discovered the square, plummet, lathe, and lever.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Though the "Daedalic" style in Greek seventh-century sculpture owes its name wholly to nineteenth-century wishful thinking, Pausanias lists several more of Daidalos' supposed works, and other sources added others as the desire to attribute obviously primitive statues to the legendary virtuoso took hold:</p>

<cit xml:id="t9" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 9.40.3">Pausanias 9.40.3</bibl>

<quote><p>Of the works of Daidalos there are two in Boeotia, a Herakles in Thebes and the Trophonios at Lebadeia. There are also two other <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">xoana</foreign> in Crete, a Britomartis at Olous and an Athena at Knossos. There too is also Ariadne's Dance, mentioned by Homer in the Iliad, carved in relief on white stone. At Delos, too, there is a small <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">xoanon</foreign> of Aphrodite, its right hand damaged by time, and instead of feet its lower part is square. I am persuaded that Ariadne got this image from Daidalos ... I know of no other extant works of Daidalos; for those dedicated by the Argives in the Heraion and those brought to Gela in Sicily from Omphake have disappeared in the course of time.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Elsewhere, Pausanias mentions Dipoinos and Skyllis of Crete and Endoios of Athens as his pupils (<bibl n="Paus. 2.15.1">Paus. 2.15.1</bibl>; <ref target="t28" n="U">T 28</ref>), disregarding the chronological impossibility this entails; other genealogically inclined writers compound the confusion by adding yet more dates and names.</p>

<p>These and other sources enable one to trace Daidalos' supposed career in broad outline. The grandson of the legendary king Erechtheus of Athens, maker of extraordinarily lifelike statues, architect, woodworker, and inventor, Daidalos fled after killing his nephew to Knossos where among other achievements he built the Labyrinth for king Minos. After aiding Theseus' escape, however, he and his son Ikaros were imprisoned, but escaped after Daidalos made waxen wings for both of them. While Ikaros flew too close to the sun and crashed, his father was able to reach Sicily, and worked there under the protection of king Kokalos till his death.</p>

<p>This historically-intractable farrago of "evidence", heavily tinged with Athenian cultural chauvinism, has prompted a structuralist analysis by <bibl>Frontisi-Ducroux 1975</bibl>; critique in <title>Gnomon</title> 51 (1979): 42-8. <bibl>Philipp 1970</bibl> seeks a kernel of historical truth, arguing from the fifth-century sources and their later imitators:</p>

<cit xml:id="t10" n="testimonium"><bibl>Euripides, Eurystheus Satyrikos fr. 372 ed. Nauck (2nd ed.)</bibl>

<quote><p>It is said about Daidalos that he made statues that walked of their own accord. This seems impossible to me, that statues should move about spontaneously. The truth is this: in those days the sculptors of gods and men made the feet joined together and the arms hanging by the sides. Daidalos first made one foot striding forward, which is why men said, Daidalos has made this statue walk ...</p></quote></cit>

<cit xml:id="t12" n="testimonium"><bibl>Diodoros 1.97.5</bibl>

<quote><p>The composition (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">rhythmos</foreign>) of the ancient statues of Egypt is the same as those made by Daidalos among the Greeks.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Philipp suggests two possible explanations. Either the connection of Daidalos with the invention of "walking" statues is preclassical, and <ref target="t11" n="U">T 11</ref> offers a rationalistic critique developed in the fifth to fourth centuries, or <ref target="t10 t11 t12" n="U">T 10-12</ref> echo an original fifth-century observation about changes of posture in "primitive" sculpture, which was soon grafted onto the vaguer legend of Daidalos' seemingly alive <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">mimemata</foreign> (<ref target="t6" n="U">T 6</ref>) without regard to chronological niceties. Marginally favoring her second hypothesis are the well-known Greek love of attaching major advances in <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">techne</foreign> to famous names (cf. <ref target="t8" n="U">T 8</ref>), and more specifically, the fact that the conservative Pindar describes the invention of walking statues as Athena's gift to the children of Helios (<bibl n="Pind. O. 7">Pind. O. 7.50-53</bibl>, 464 B.C.) : if Daidalos were already accepted as their inventor by his time, Pindar would probably have credited him instead. Perhaps, then, this aspect of the Daidalos legend offers further testimony of a burgeoning historical consciousness about art in fifth-century Greece, presumably sparked by the creation of the classical style itself. Plato, (<bibl n="Plat. Meno 97d">Plat. Meno 97d</bibl> and <bibl n="Plat. Hipp. Maj. 282a">Plat. Hipp. Maj. 282a</bibl> also suggests as much, and a late source even reports Aischylos as saying that "the old statues, though simply made, are thought divine; while the new, though superbly wrought, have less of the divine in them" (in Porphyry, <title>de Abstinentia</title> 2.18).</p>

<p>Most recently, Boardman has suggested a more specific explanation still: that "it was the memory of the role of travelling Cretan artists at this decisive point in the history of Greek sculpture that determined that it was to a Cretan Daidalos that these innovations should be attributed" (<bibl>Boardman 1980b</bibl>, 47). Though this is certainly compatible with the scheme outlined above, and the emigration of several of the Daidalidai to Greece was definitely remembered (<ref target="t15" n="U">T 15</ref>), Daidalos the legendary virtuoso was in any case the obvious candidate regardless of historical truth; furthermore, this theory disregards the pro-Athenian and anti-Cretan bias of the sources on Daidalos himself, which as earlier remarked, prefer an Attic ancestry and send him to Sicily, not Greece, from Crete.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Smilis, son of Eukleides, of Aegina</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Smilis</persName></head>

<p>Smilis is almost as problematical as Daidalos. His name was primarily associated with the ancient wooden statue of Hera in Samos; as usual, Pausanias gives the fullest account:</p>

<cit xml:id="t13" n="testimonium">
<bibl n="Paus. 7.4.4">Pausanias 7.4.4, 7</bibl>

<quote><p>Some say that the men who sailed in the Argo built the sanctuary of Hera in Samos, and that they brought the image from Argos. But the Samians themselves think that the goddess was born on the island by the river Imbrasos, and under the willow which even in my time still grew in the Heraion. That this sanctuary at all events is among the very oldest might be inferred not least from the image: for it is the work of Aeginetan Smilis, son of Eukleides. This Smilis was a contemporary of Daidalos, though less famous than he ... and it is not clear if he visited other places than Samos and Elis. But he did travel to these, and it was he who made the image of Hera in Samos.</p></quote>
</cit>

<p>The form and rich <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">kosmesis</foreign> of this statue is certified by the Samian temple inventories and attested by representations in other media (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 14-15). In addition:</p>

<cit xml:id="t14" n="testimonium"><bibl>Aethlios and Olympichos, ap. Clement of Alexandria, Protrepticus 40, 41</bibl>

<quote><p>The statue of Samian Hera, as Aethilos says, was a wooden beam at first, but afterwards, when Prokles was ruler, it was humanized in form... Olympichos in his Samian History relates that the xoanon of Hera in Samos was made by Smilis son of Eukleides.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Aethlios of Samos (<bibl><title>FGH</title></bibl> , 536 F 3) probably wrote in the fifth century B.C., and is thus a source to be reckoned with, while Olympichos (<bibl><title>FGH</title></bibl>, 537 F 1) lived a century or two later. As to dates, Pausanias (<bibl n="Paus. 7.4.2">Paus. 7.4.2-3</bibl>) says that Prokles took Samos at the end of the heroic age, though a later "ruler" called Prokles is theoretically possible any time down to the early sixth century, when the Aiakes-Polykrates family became preeminent. Yet two other writers contradict this otherwise neat package. First, around 270 Kallimachos (fr. 100 Loeb) calls the ancient plank-idol "not yet a well-carved Skelmian work"; and second, Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 36.90 lists Smilis, together with the mid sixth-century architects and sculptors Rhoikos and Theodoros (see below) as one of the makers of the "Lemnian labyrinth", evidently a misunderstanding of the Samian temple's location <title>en limnais</title>, "in the marsh"; so neither nomenclature nor chronology tally.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>As to names, since Smilis and Skelmis are both derived from the Greek and Thracian words (respectively) for "chisel", both are often dismissed as fictions. Yet programmatic names and nicknames are common throughout Greek art, and Kallimachos may simply have been indulging in his usual word-games; furthermore, for what it is worth, the following other works were attributed to Smilis:</p>

<list type="simple">
<item n="2"><rs type="work">Hera, at Argos (misunderstanding of <ref target="t13" n="U">T 13</ref>?)</rs></item>
<item n="3"><rs type="work">Seasons, in the Heraion at Olympia (<ref target="t16" n="U">T 16</ref>)</rs></item>
</list>

<p>Concerning the chronology, the inscriptions show that the Hera stood in the temple porch; most likely, then, either Pliny once more misread his sources (presumably the same group of Samian chronicles used by Kallimachos, Pausanias, and Clement), and erroneously included the sculptor with the great temple's two architects, or was drawing upon a careless intermediary, perhaps Varro or Mucianus.</p>

<p>Whether Daidalos existed or not, a number of pupils from Crete, Greece, and South Italy, all of whom apparently belong to the sixth century, were attributed to him:</p>

<cit xml:id="t15" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, N.H. 36.9-10</bibl>

<quote><p>The very first men to become famous as marble sculptors were Dipoenus and Scyllis, born in Crete while the Median empire still existed and before Cyrus began to rule in Persia. This was approximately in the 50th Olympiad [580-577]. They moved to Sicyon, which had long been the home of all such industries. The Sicyonians had given them a state contract to make statues of the gods, but before they had finished, the artists, complaining of an injustice, retired to Aetolia. A famine immediately struck Sicyon, as well as barrenness and dire sorrow. When the people sought Pythian Apollo for relief, he replied,only if Dipoenus and Scyllis finish the images of the gods. This was accomplished only at great expense and with much flattery. The statues, incidentally, were of Apollo, Diana, Hercules, and Minerva, the last of which was later struck by lightning.</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p>In the temple of Hera [at Olympia] is an image of Zeus, and the image of Hera is sitting on a throne, with Zeus standing by her, bearded and with a helmet on his head; they are simple works. Next to them are the Seasons, sitting on thrones, made by Smilis of Aegina. Beside them stands an image of Themis, the mother of the Seasons, the work of Dorykleidas, a Spartan and a pupil of Dipoinos and Skyllis. Theokles made the Hesperides, five in number; he was a Spartan too, the son of Hegylos, and is said to have studied under Dipoinos and Skyllis. The Athena wearing a helmet and carrying a spear and shield is reputed to be the work of Medon of Sparta, brother of Dorykleidas and a pupil of the same masters. Then come Kore, Demeter, Apollo, and Artemis; the first two sit opposite each other, the second two stand opposite one another. Also dedicated here are Leto, Tyche, Dionysos and a winged Nike; I cannot say who made them, but in my opinion all are extremely ancient. All these are of ivory and gold, but later on others were dedicated in the Heraion ...</p></quote>

<p>Of these, <ref target="t15" n="U">T 15</ref> opens a series of six chapters on early marble sculpture (continuation, <ref target="t18" n="U">T 18</ref>), presumably derived from some anecdotally-inclined Hellenistic connoisseur (see commentary to <ref target="t18 t19" n="U">T 18-19</ref>, for a possible candidate). Of his two absolute dates (the only ones extant for the period), that for Dipoinos and Skyllis coincides exactly with the historians' date for Sikyon's pre-eminence under its tyrant Kleisthenes (581/0-576), so may be a pure fabrication; furthermore, at least their works at Argos (A.3 below: <bibl n="Paus. 2.22.5">Paus. 2.22.5</bibl>) were not in marble but wood, which suggests an armchair compiler at work at some stage. No statues by the Daidalidai have been recovered (cf. <bibl>Ridgway 1977</bibl>, 297 for possible reasons), though a list gives a good conspectus of the thematic and technical range of this early archaic sculpture:</p>

<div type="section" n="3"><head>Ripe Archaic (1) The Cyclades and East Greece</head>

<p>The most comprehensive account of ripe archaic sculptors is by <bibl>Lippold 1950</bibl>; <bibl>Ridgway 1977</bibl>, 283-302 reviews the preserved signatures. Almost two-thirds of the total of both inscriptions and names (about 40) are Attic: see here esp.<bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl> and <bibl>Deyhle 1969</bibl>. The other major sculptural centers have provided at most only two or three apiece, while the West is a virtual blank. The literary sources are much more even-handed; with the honorable exception of Pausanias (who diligently records some of the major names, and describes a few monuments at length), they ignore the period almost entirely, though the rare occasions when their interest is engaged (e.g. <ref target="t19" n="U">T 19</ref>, <ref target="t21" n="U">T 21</ref>, <ref target="t29" n="U">T 29</ref>) are worth their weight in gold.</p>

<p>Despite the early prominence of the Cyclades in the archaeological record, including the earliest sculptor's signature of all, by Euthykartides of Naxos (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 40), only Aristion of Paros emerges as a personality and that only because his <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">kore</foreign> survives (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 121-22). The Chiot and Samian sculptors, however, have fared a little better.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Archermos, son of Mikkiades, of Chios, and his family</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Archermos</persName></head>

<p>Archermos is among only three archaic sculptors known from both literary and epigraphical sources, plus (probably) a preserved statue: <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 92. He was apparently active ca. 550-500, and like Dipoinos and Skyllis (<ref target="t15" n="U">T 15</ref>) appears to have attracted enough attention from some later connoisseur to arouse Pliny's curiosity:</p>

<cit xml:id="t18" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, N.H. 36.11-14</bibl>

<quote><p>Before the time of Dipoenus and Scyllis the sculptor Melas already lived on the island of Chios, followed by his son Micciades and grandson Archermus. His sons Bupalus and Athenis were quite the most eminent in this craft at the time of the poet Hipponax, who was certainly alive in the 60th Olympiad [540-537]. Now if we trace their lineage back to their great-grandfather, we find that the beginnings of this art coincided with the beginning of the Olympiads [776]. Hipponax had a notoriously ugly face, and because of this they exhibited his portrait and made dirty jokes about it to their circles of fun-loving companions. Whereupon the indignant Hipponax rebuked them so bitterly in his poems that some believe he drove them to hang themselves. This is false, for they later made many statues in the neighbouring islands, for example on Delos, to which they attached verses saying that Chios is esteemed not merely for its vines, but also for the works of the sons of Archermus. Furthermore, the Iasians exhibit a Diana made by their hands. In Chios itself there is said to be a face of Diana which is also their work; it is set on high, and appears sad to those entering, cheerful to those departing. At Rome there are statues of theirs on the gable of the temple of Apollo on the Palatine and on almost all the buildings erected by the deified Augustus. There were works by their father too at Delos and on the island of Lesbos.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Pliny's source evidently knew the verses on the base of Archermos' Delian statue, still preserved today, but erroneously included Melas, the mythical founder of Chios mentioned in line 3, in the genealogy. The reading of the inscription is uncertain: the latest study, <bibl>Scherrer 1983</bibl>, even denies that Mikkiades and Archermos sign as sculptors at all, making them the dedicators of the statue. Since the lower part of the Nike found nearby (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 92) is lost, its attribution to this base will never be completely certain: supporting the connection, however, are its scale and a scholiast's note:</p>

<cit xml:id="t19" n="testimonium"><bibl>Scholium to Aristophanes, Birds 573</bibl>

<quote><p>Only more recently have Nike and Eros acquired wings. For some say that it was Archennos [sic] the father of Boupalos and Athenis, others that it was Aglaophon the Thasian painter who made Nike winged, as Karystios of Pergamon relates.</p></quote></cit>

<p><bibl>Münzer 1895</bibl>, 522-25 proposed that the otherwise obscure "Karystios of Pergamon" could be the Hellenistic connoisseur Antigonos of Karystos (<ref target="t78" n="U">T 78</ref>, <ref target="t145" n="U">T 145</ref>), who made Pergamon his base, and further suggested him as Pliny's authority for both <ref target="t15" n="U">T 15</ref> and <ref target="t18" n="U">T 18</ref>. Yet though the range of interests there displayed coincides exactly with his, Pliny only includes him in his source list for books 34-35 (cf. <ref target="t145" n="U">T 145</ref>), and not in that for book 36. Since <ref target="t78" n="U">T 78</ref> certifies him as a competent epigrapher and no "armchair archaeologist" (cf. the commentary to <ref target="t15" n="U">T 15</ref>), Pliny may be relying upon a Latin intermediary here, like Varro or the (none too careful) Mucianus, both cited by him as prime sources for book 36. <bibl>Sheedy 1985</bibl>, 625 dismisses Pliny's account as largely fiction based on the Romans' desire for tidy genealogies and famous names, but overlooks the inscribed base found in Rome (no. 9, below).</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Aside from the Delian statue and Pliny's vague mention of Lesbos, the only hard evidence as to Archermos' career is a signed column from the Akropolis (<bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl> no. 3; <bibl>Marcadé 1957</bibl>, 21(v)-22: later sixth century); for another (?), see also <bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl> no. 9. His sons, active from ca. 540 (<ref target="t18" n="U">T 18</ref>) are hardly less shadowy, though their oeuvre is far more extensive. In addition to the five works listed in <ref target="t18" n="U">T 18</ref>, Boupalos alone is given the following:</p>

<list type="simple">

</list>

<p>Once again, the Pergamene connection is clear, and could have been what sparked the interest of "Karystios"/Antigonos. Concerning the other images, Pausanias (<bibl n="Paus. 4.30.6">Paus. 4.30.6</bibl>) credits him with the invention of the Tyche type with polos and cornucopia, and remarks that his Graces were decorously draped (in contrast to later practice: cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 809). It has also been suggested that the Jekyll-and-Hyde expression of the Artemis on Chios (<ref target="t18" n="U">T 18</ref>) describes "the effect of an archaic smile viewed close from below and head-on at a distance, respectively" (<bibl>Boardman 1978a</bibl>, 88). Pausanias (<bibl n="Paus. 4.30.6">Paus. 4.30.6</bibl>) also calls Boupalos a "builder of temples."</p>

<p>Modern scholarship often associates the kore from the Acropolis (<rs key="Athens, Acropolis 675" type="sculpture">Athens, Acropolis 675</rs>, <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 148) and the "ex-Knidian" caryatid from Delphi (<rs key="Delphi, Anonymous Caryatid" type="sculpture">Delphi, Anonymous Caryatid</rs>) with the Nike, but agrees on little else. <bibl>Croissant 1983</bibl>, 73-83 sees strong influence from this tradition upon the Peplos kore (<rs key="Athens, Acropolis 679" type="sculpture">Athens, Acropolis 679</rs>, <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 147), and associates the East frieze of the Siphnian treasury (<rs key="Delphi, Siphnian Treasury Frieze--East" type="sculpture">Delphi, Siphnian Treasury Frieze--East</rs>, <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 192-93; but not the North, in defiance of the signature on the latter, which declares that the two were made by the same sculptor) with the "Chiot school." Others even attribute a fragment of a Palladion, found on the Palatine, to Boupalos and Athenis; Zanker 1988, 242, fig. 188 (cf. 9). <bibl>Sheedy 1985</bibl>, on the other hand, dissects the evidence critically and thoroughly, and comes to the conclusion that although korai found on Chios do share some interesting characteristics, they have very little in common with the Nike. The Chiot school as currently conceived, he concludes, is a "mirage" (1985, 625).</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Rhoikos, Telekles, and Theodoros of Samos</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Rhoikos</persName></head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Theodoros</persName></head>

<p>The surviving ancient accounts of these three sculptors' achievements are the product of two quite different Greek historical traditions, whose contradictions are sometimes misunderstood as evidence for two Theodoroi, not one (e.g. Bieber in <title>ThB</title> 1934 and 1938 — see select bibliography below).</p>

<p>Writing around 450, Herodotos knew of Rhoikos (son of Philes) only as "first" architect of the great temple of Hera on Samos, and describes Theodoros (son of Telekles) as the maker of the tyrant Polykrates' famous ring, of two massive silver kraters dedicated by Croesus at Delphi, and of a golden vine for the Lydian Pythios, which he later gave to Darius (<bibl n="Hdt. 1.51">Hdt. 1.51</bibl>; <bibl n="Hdt. 3.41">Hdt. 3.41</bibl>; <bibl n="Hdt. 3.60">Hdt. 3.60</bibl>; <bibl n="Hdt. 7.27">Hdt. 7.27</bibl>); the temple was begun ca. 560, while Polykrates ruled from ca. 533 to 522, and Croesus from ca. 560-547/6. Six hundred years later, Herodotos' admirer Pausanias accepted this testimony, adding that Theodoros also built the "Skias" (an assembly-place) in Sparta and that:</p>

<cit xml:id="t20" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 10.38.6">Pausanias 10.38.6-7</bibl>

<quote><p>These two Samians were the first to discover the art of founding the bronze to perfection, and the first to cast it in a mold. I have found no surviving work of Theodoros, at least in bronze.</p></quote></cit>


<p>In addition, Vitruvius 7 praef. 12 records a book by Theodoros on the "Doric" (<foreign xml:lang="la">sic</foreign>) Heraion, while Pliny lists Smilis, Rhoikos, and him (in that order) as architects of the "Lemnian Labyrinth" (see above, to <ref target="t14" n="U">T 14</ref>) with its lathe-turned columns, describes the two Samians as inventors of clay modelling (!), and Theodoros alone as inventor of certain tools, the lathe included (<title>N.H.</title> 35.152; 36.90; <ref target="t8" n="U">T 8</ref>). In fact, the columns of the mid sixth-century Heraion were indeed lathe-turned, apparently a 'first' in Greek architecture. Finally, Diogenes Laertius credits Theodoros with designing the foundations for the Ephesian Artemision (begun by 547/6), but remarks that he was Rhoikos' son (2.103, cf. <title>N.H.</title> 36.95). All this information clearly derives from a common source, perhaps a Hellenistic writer who had Theodoros' original text.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Along with Diogenes' variant geneology, this brings us to the second historical tradition, which is both more problematic and in some ways more interesting. The crucial witness here is Diodoros:</p>

<cit xml:id="t21" n="testimonium"><bibl>Diodoros 1.98</bibl>

<quote><p>The most distinguished of the ancient sculptors, namely Telekles and Theodoros, the sons of Rhoikos, spent time in Egypt. They made the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">xoanon</foreign> of Pythian Apollo for the Samians, and it is said that one half of it was carved by Telekles in Samos, the other half by his brother Theodoros in Ephesos; and when the parts were brought together, they fitted so well that the whole statue seemed to have been made by one man. This sort of technique is practised nowhere among the Greeks, but it is especially common among the Egyptians. For with them the commensurability (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign>) of statues is not calculated according to the appearance (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">phantasia</foreign>) presented to the eye, as among the Greeks, but when they have laid out the stones and divided them up, they begin work on them by taking the proportions from the smallest parts to the largest; for, dividing the layout of the whole body into twenty-one parts and an additional quarter, they produce the entire <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign> of the figure. Consequently, as soon as the artisans have agreed upon the size of the figure, they split up and make the parts to the agreed size so accurately as to cause amazement at this peculiar system of theirs. The <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">xoanon</foreign> in Samos, in accordance with the Egyptian technique, is divided into two parts from the crown of the head through the middle to the groin, each part exactly matching the other at every point. And they say that for the most part this statue is rather like those of the Egyptians, having the arms suspended at the sides and the legs separated in a stride.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Now most of Diodoros' first book was lifted wholesale from an early Alexandrian historian, Hekataios of Abdera (<bibl><title>FGH</title></bibl> , 264 F 25), whose declared aims were to discredit Greek writers on Egypt, particularly Herodotos (cf. Diod. Sic. 1.69.7) in favor of Egyptian priestly traditions, and to show that everything worthwhile in Greek culture came from Egypt. Hence the different family tree, which surely reflects the received opinion that Theodoros was somehow a "junior partner" to Rhoikos on the Heraion, and the author's clear preference for the absolute perfection of Egyptian sculpture over the subjectivity or <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">phantasia</foreign> of the Greek.</p>

<p>In fact, Egyptologists have long recognized that Hekataios is describing — and misunderstanding — the traditional Egyptian workshop practice of having apprentices make canonical trial pieces (chiefly heads, hands, and feet) as a part of their training; the grid he describes is the revised one current from the seventh century. As <bibl>Lippold 1950</bibl>, 59 suggests, a double signature of Rhoikos and Theodoros may have prompted the whole fantastic anecdote (for another explanation, <bibl>Davaras 1972</bibl>, 22-3). For since East Greek sculptors normally cut inscriptions into the legs of their kouroi, the two perhaps signed one leg each. Of course, none of this disqualifies them from possessing the firsthand knowledge of Egyptian methods that Hekataios attributes to them: the Egyptian canon was used on the New York kouros around 600-580 (New York 32.11.1; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 49-55), Samos had close artistic, commercial, and political ties with Egypt, and an early sixth-century cup dedicated by one Rhoikos (a rare name) to Aphrodite was even found at Naukratis in the 1880s: see most recently <bibl>Samos</bibl>, 7: 113-4, pl. 122; <bibl>Boardman 1980a</bibl>, 131-2.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Finally, Theodoros' self-portrait, for which Pliny is the only source:</p>

<cit xml:id="t22" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, N.H. 34.83</bibl>

<quote><p>Theodorus, who made the Labyrinth at Samos, cast a portrait of himself in bronze. Besides its remarkable fame as a likeness, it is celebrated for its great finesse; the right hand holds a file, and the three fingers of the left a little chariot and four, but this has been taken away to the Praeneste as a marvel of miniaturization: if it were reproduced in a drawing, together with its charioteer, the fly which Theodorus made at the same time would cover it with its wings.</p></quote></cit>

<p>On the likely extent of this "realism" see <bibl>Metzler 1971</bibl>, 175-9, with comments on the growing self-assertiveness of the artist and the use of realism as a differentiating device (though to see it in Marxist terms, as a working-class riposte to the aristocratic beauty of the kouroi, is surely anachronistic). Pliny's use of <foreign xml:lang="la">similitudo</foreign> or "likeness" here links Theodoros with Demetrios of Alopeke (<ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>, 91) and Lysistratos, brother of Lysippos (<ref target="t133" n="U">T 133</ref>); <bibl>Pollitt 1974</bibl>, 430-34 discusses the Hellenistic background to all this, including the neo-classic distaste revealed in <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref> for "likeness" as opposed to "beauty".</p>

<p>If one is to credit the sources, then, Theodoros was a kind of archaic Cellini, inventive and versatile as none other, and particularly expert in metalwork; one only wishes that something had survived to confirm his stellar reputation.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Bathykles of Magnesia</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Bathykles</persName></head>

<p>Nothing is known of Bathykles apart from Pausanias' description of his "throne" for Apollo at Spartan Amyklai, with its encyclopedic compendium of reliefs, and the (expensive) votives he set up upon its conclusion:</p>

<cit xml:id="t23" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 3.18.9">Pausanias 3.18.9-19.2</bibl>

<quote><p>Bathykles of Magnesia, who made the Amyklaian throne, dedicated votives on its completion: the Graces and an image of Artemis Leukophryene. Whose pupil this Bathykles was, and who was king in Sparta when he made the throne, I will pass over, but I did see the throne and will describe its details. Two Graces and two Seasons support in front, and in the same manner, at the back. On the left stand Echidna and Typhos, on the right Tritons. To describe the reliefs one by one in detail would only bore my readers; but to give a brief description (since many of them are not unfamiliar), Poseidon and Zeus are carrying Taygete, daughter of Atlas, and her sister Alkyone. There are also reliefs of Atlas, Herakles' duel with Kyknos, and the centaur battle at the cave of Pholos. I do not know why Bathykles represented the so-called Minotaur bound and led away by Theseus; the dance of the Phaiakians is represented on the throne, with Demodokos singing; and the exploit of Perseus against Medusa is also depicted. Passing over the fight between Herakles and the giant Thourios and that of Tyndareus with Eurytos, one comes to the rape of the daughters of Leukippos. Here are Dionysos, too, and Herakles; Hermes is carrying the former, still a child, to heaven, while Athena is leading Herakles to live henceforth among the gods. Peleus is handing over Achilles to be brought up by Cheiron, who is also said to have been his teacher. Kephalos is being abducted by Day because of his beauty, and the gods are bringing gifts to the wedding of Harmonia. The duel between Achilles and Memnon is represented, and so is Herakles revenging himself upon Diomedes the Thracian and upon Nessos at the river Euenos. Hermes is leading the goddesses to be judged by Paris, Adrastos and Tydeus are staying the fight between Amphiaraos and Lykourgos the son of Pronax. Hera is gazing at Io, the daughter of Inachos, who is already a cow, and Athena is fleeing Hephaistos, who pursues her. Next to these are depicted, from the Labors of Herakles, the Hydra and how he led up the dog from Hades. There are Anaxias and Mnasinous, each on horseback, but only one horse is carrying Megapenthes son of Menelaos and Nikostratos. Bellerophon is killing the beast in Lycia, and Herakles is driving off Geryon's cattle. On the upper edges of the throne are placed, one on each side, the sons of Tyndareus on horseback; there are sphinxes beneath the horses, and wild beasts running upwards, on one side a leopard, by Polydeukes a lioness. On the very top of the throne is wrought a band of dancers, the Magnesians who helped Bathykles make the throne. Beneath the throne on the inside, away from the Tritons, is the hunt of the Kalydonian boar, and Herakles killing Aktor's children; Kalais and Zetes are driving the Harpies away from Phineus; Peirithoos and Theseus have abducted Helen, and Herakles is strangling the lion; Apollo and Artemis are shooting Tityos; also represented is Herakles' fight with Oreios the Centaur and Theseus' battle with the Minotaur. In addition are represented Herakles wrestling Acheloos, the fabled binding of Hephaistos, the games Akastos held for his father, and the story of Menelaos and Egyptian Proteus from the <title>Odyssey</title>. And finally there is Admetos yoking a boar and a lion to his chariot and the Trojans are bringing libations to Hektor. The part of the throne where the god would sit is not continuous. There are several seats, and by the side of each seat is left a wide empty space; that in the middle is widest, and it is there that the image stands. I know of no-one who has measured its height, but at a guess it must be about thirty cubits [45 feet]. It is not the work of Bathykles, but is primitive and crude, for though it has a face, feet and hands, the rest resembles a bronze column. On its head is a helmet, and in its hands a spear and bow.</p></quote></cit>

<p>The architectural fragments, which seem late sixth century, mix Doric and Ionic; nothing survives of the reliefs, which from Pausanias seem to have been chosen almost by free association (compare archaic epic poetry: e.g. M.L. West, <title>Hesiod: Works and Days</title> [Oxford 1978]: 41-59) and occasionally make direct reference to Sparta. On the reconstruction of the "throne" see <bibl>Romano 1980</bibl>, 99-114, with <bibl>DeVries 1982</bibl>; <bibl>Pollitt 1990</bibl>, 24 fig. 1.</p>

<div type="section" n="4"><head>Ripe Archaic (2) The Mainland</head>

<p>Bathykles conveniently returns us to the mainland:</p>
<p>Almost no signed works are known outside Attica, though Peloponnesian (but not Boeotian) sculpture did catch Pausanias' eye, and receives scattered comments from others. For Athens, this situation is all but reversed. As already indicated, by far the fullest crop of names comes from here: 24 in all, including foreigners like Aristion and Archermos, though only a few can be connected with extant sculpture, and fewer still attracted notice from later writers. As usual, too, some of the most striking personalities that emerge from the monuments themselves, like the Rampin master (<rs key="Athens, Acropolis 590" type="sculpture">Athens, Acropolis 590</rs> and <rs key="Louvre MA 3104" type="sculpture">Louvre MA 3104</rs>, the Rampin Rider; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, 120, figs. 125, 127-28) remain completely anonymous. Of those whose names we know, Endoios and Antenor (the only two attested by both signatures and texts) will receive further attention below.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Gitiadas of Sparta</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Gitiadas</persName></head>

<p>Pausanias is our only authority here:</p>

<cit xml:id="t24" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 3.17.2">Pausanias 3.17.2-3</bibl>

<quote><p>The builder [of the Brazen House at Sparta] was Gitiadas, a local man, who also composed Dorian lyrics, including a hymn to the goddess [Athena]. On the bronze are wrought in relief many of Herakles' Labors, and many of his voluntary exploits, together with the rape of the daughter of Leukippos and other achievements of the sons of Tyndareus. There is also Hephaistos releasing his mother from her fetters ... There too are the Nymphs giving gifts to Perseus as he sets out against Medusa in Libya, a cap and the shoes that would bear him through the sky. Also wrought there are the birth of Athena, and Amphitrite and Poseidon too — the largest figures and in my opinion the best worth seeing.</p></quote></cit>


<p>Elsewhere (<ref target="t86" n="U">T 86</ref> and <bibl n="Paus. 4.14.2">Paus. 4.14.2</bibl>) Pausanias connects Gitiadas with the first Messenian war (supposedly ca. 736-716) and the late sixth century sculptor Kallon of Aegina (variant chronology, <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>, but cf. <ref target="t13" n="U">T 13</ref> and <bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl>, 90 no. 85, 508-9). In fact, the remains of the Brazen House are datable to ca. 550. The cult image, a columnar statue brandishing spear and shield, is depicted on Roman coins, while the reliefs were embossed and nailed to the wall. Archaic Laconian shield-bands use the same technique and many of the same themes, but in miniature: <bibl>Kunze 1950</bibl>, passim.</p>

<p>Before Hageladas, the only known Argive sculptor is [Aga]medes, who signed the twins at Delphi ca. 580 (<rs key="Delphi, Kleobis and Biton" type="sculpture">Delphi, Kleobis and Biton</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 56-57). Hageladas himself is dated to 432-29 by Pliny, but see commentary on <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>. More helpful is Pausanias' mention of his bronzes of victors in the Olympics of 520 and 516 (1, 2 below: <bibl n="Paus. 6.10.6">Paus. 6.10.6,</bibl> <bibl n="Paus. 6.14.11">Paus. 6.14.11</bibl>), and of another killed at Athens in 507 (3 below, cf. 6.8.6 and <bibl n="Hdt. 5.72">Hdt. 5.72</bibl>).

<p>The two statues of Zeus may be those reproduced on later Messenian and Achaean coins, which strongly recall the Zeus of Ugento (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 184-85), while the Herakles was apparently rededicated during the plague of 430-427; for the Tarentine monument, dedicated before 473, see esp. <bibl>G.

Hageladas was obviously a vigorous and versatile sculptor, and through his sons and pupils (among whom a late — and untrustworthy — source numbers Pheidias) was clearly the founder of the Argive school of bronzeworking, which reached its acme with Polykleitos (<ref target="t62 t63 t64 t65 t66 t67 t68 t69 t70 t71" n="U">T 62-71</ref>) and continued to flourish, in association with Sikyon, through the fourth century.</p>

<p>Kanachos and his shadowy brother Aristokles are dated only by their collaboration with Hageladas (above, work no. 7), and the removal of Kanachos' bronze Apollo Philesios from Didyma, either by Darius in 494 (cf. <bibl n="Hdt. 6.19">Hdt. 6.19</bibl>) or, less likely, by Xerxes (so <bibl n="Paus. 1.16.3">Paus. 1.16.3</bibl>, <bibl n="Paus. 7.46.3">Paus. 7.46.3</bibl>). Their <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> should therefore lie around 500. Aside from their Muses and Kanachos' chryselephantine Aphrodite for Sikyon, we hear only of the Apollo and its wooden replica — or archetype — at Thebes:</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Endoios of Athens</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Endoios</persName></head>

<p>Endoios' father remains unknown, though Pausanias describes his alleged origins:</p>

<cit xml:id="t28" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 1.26.4">Pausanias 1.26.4</bibl>

<quote><p>Endoios was an Athenian by birth and a pupil of Daidalos, who even followed Daidalos to Crete when he was exiled for the death of Kalos; he made the seated image of Athena, with an inscription saying that Kallias dedicated it, but Endoios made it. There is also the building called the Erechtheion ...</p></quote></cit>

<p>Yet since the anecdote is clearly a fabrication, the ethnic may be too. As for Kallias' Athena, the dedicator should be Peisistratos' opponent Kallias son of Hipponikos, who lived around 570-520, unless (since the piece evidently survived the sack of 480) Pausanias was looking at a rededication by Kallias II, his grandson and a leading politician of the 460s: <bibl>M. Robertson 1975</bibl>, 107. The Athena (<rs key="Athens, Acropolis 625" type="sculpture">Athens, Acropolis 625</rs>), found on the slope below the Erechtheion is commonly identified with this statue because of its very weathered state; <foreign xml:lang="la">contra</foreign>, <bibl>Bundgaard 1974</bibl>, 16: "The conclusion seems unwarranted. Kore 671, found built into the North citadel wall, was heavily weathered on the right side which...was turned inside the wall. In this case the weathering had obviously taken place before the wall was built. On the other hand, if the figure comes from the [destruction debris] in the corner, which seems likely, it may very well have lain exposed in the breach for a long time before tumbling down."</p>

<p>The Athena being problematic, more recent studies have preferred to start with Raubitschek's restoration of the signature on the potter relief, <rs key="Athens, Acropolis 1332" type="sculpture">Athens, Acropolis 1332</rs>, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)En[doios epoies]en</foreign> (<bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl>, no. 70; cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 161), and Jeffery's independent observation that the stylistically-related Ballplayer base <rs key="Athens, NM 3476" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 3476</rs> (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 138-40) was possibly one of a trio including a base originally bearing a painted scene and signed "and Endoios made this too" (<bibl>Jeffery 1962</bibl>, 127); yet if so, the third base, carved with hoplites and hockey-players, is by a different hand — an apprentice? Also a school-piece, if one accepts the Athena, is the little kore <rs key="Athens, Acropolis 602" type="sculpture">Athens, Acropolis 602</rs>, stylistically dependent upon it and thus often connected to the second of Endoios' Akropolis signatures, on a column co-signed by (his pupil?) Philergos (not "Philermos", as <bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl>, no. 7: cf. <title>AM</title> 84 [1969]: pl. 6).</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>These pieces, with the addition of the Rayet head (with possible body-fragments, <title>AM</title> 84 [1969]: pls. 29-37), a little bronze jumper from the Akropolis, and the Athena from the Gigantomachy pediment, are now generally accepted as constituting the core of Endoios' oeuvre and immediate following (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 136-37, 205-06; cf. e.g. <bibl>Deyhle 1969</bibl>, 12-27; <bibl>M. Robertson 1975</bibl>, 106-8; <bibl>Boardman 1978a</bibl>, 82-83). They date between ca. 530 and 500.</p>

<p>The seated Athena is the only link — and a weak one — between this group and the texts, which naturally concentrate upon the all-important genre of cult images, listing the following statues:</p>

<list type="simple">
<item n="1"><rs type="work">Artemis at Ephesos; wood (type disputed)</rs></item>
<item n="2"><rs type="work">"Old" Athena; olivewood</rs></item>

<item n="6"><rs type="work">Athena Alea at Tegea, taken to Rome by Augustus; ivory</rs></item>
</list>

<p>Of these, (6) may be echoed in Tegean small bronzes: <title>BCH</title> 99 (1975): 348-9, figs. 16-19; <bibl>Rolley 1983/1986</bibl>, 120 fig. 95; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 182. (1)-(3) are all listed by the same source:</p>

<cit xml:id="t29" n="testimonium"><bibl>Athenagoras, Embassy for the Christians 17.3</bibl>

<quote><p>Endoios, a pupil of Daidalos, made the Artemis in Ephesos, the ancient olivewood statue of Athena ... and the seated Athena.</p></quote></cit>

<p xml:id="t30">[<ref target="t30" n="U">T 30</ref>]: see <ref target="t113" n="U">T 113</ref> below, under Skopas.</p>

<p>On Mucianus' authority, Pliny also attributes the Ephesian Artemis (1) to Endoios (<title>N.H.</title> 16.213-15): cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 174. Perhaps the most widely-copied and influential cult-image of antiquity, its material and original form are equally uncertain, though its many "breasts" may be an ancient Anatolian feature. The Ephesian temple was begun by 547/6 and still remained incomplete ca. 500: see <bibl>Romano 1980</bibl>, 236-49 for a useful resumé. As for (2) and (3), since Athenagoras (writing in A.D. 177) was an Athenian he is surely referring to statues familiar to him and his readers, namely, the olivewood Athena Polias of the Akropolis and Kallias' dedication. The former's history has been brilliantly pieced together by <bibl>Kroll 1982</bibl>, who identifies coin-pictures and shows that Endoios, like Smilis (<ref target="t14" n="U">T 14</ref>) was apparently responsible for "humanizing" the original plank-idol with face, arms, and feet.</p>

<p>If one accepts the attributions, Endoios emerges as a strong and innovative personality. He seems to bestride the ripe and late archaic, drawing strength from the mature Attic style of the later sixth century but vigorously pursuing new directions, and heavily influencing the early fifth century.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Antenor, son of Eumares, of Athens</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Antenor</persName></head>

<p>Antenor's father, who made a dedication on the Akropolis ca. 525 (<bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl>, no. 244) may have been the painter "Eumarus of Athens, the first to distinguish the male from the female sex in painting (!), venturing to render every sort of figure, whose inventions were improved upon by Cimon of Cleonae. He first discovered <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">katagrapha</foreign>, or three-quarter images...." (Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 35.56). The latter first appear on vases ca. 510 (cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 142) making "Eumarus" contemporary with Eumares. Antenor's brother [...]andr[os] was also a sculptor: <bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl>, no. 51.</p>

<p>Antenor's oeuvre reads like a microcosm of Endoios'. The giant kore <rs key="Athens, Acropolis 681" type="sculpture">Athens, Acropolis 681</rs> most probably stood on a high base signed by him and dedicated by the potter Nearchos (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 154); the Delphi pediments are probably from his workshop (<rs key="Delphi, Temple of Apollo, East Pediment" type="sculpture">Delphi, Temple of Apollo, East Pediment</rs> and <rs key="Delphi, Temple of Apollo, West Pediment" type="sculpture">Delphi, Temple of Apollo, West Pediment</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 199-204); and Pausanias names him as author of the bronze Tyrannicides stolen by Xerxes in 480 but returned by Alexander or the Seleukids (<ref target="t31" n="U">T 31</ref>). <bibl>Dörig 1969</bibl> plausibly suggests a Roman marble head, stylistically similar to the kore's, as a copy of the Harmodios. The pattern, then, is depressingly familiar: surviving works by leading artists are likely to be minor ones in marble, ignored by the sources and only occasionally certified by signatures, while their attested masterpieces, in more vulnerable media, have vanished; as for replicas, even when complete these never bear the original master's name, so attribution is at best tentative, at worst mere fantasy.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>For Antenor's conservative and monumental style, see <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, 86-89, 124. It remains only to quote the major sources and to note that if one adheres to the generally-accepted dating of the Tyrannicides to 510/9 (cf. <ref target="t32" n="U">T 32</ref>; <foreign xml:lang="la">contra</foreign> <bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl>, 481-82; <bibl>Landwehr 1985</bibl>, 27-47, preferring the years after 488; but see now <bibl>Weber 1983</bibl>), then he becomes an exact contemporary of Endoios.</p>

They then fortified Leipsydrion, north of Paionia, and (using every means to fight the Peisistratids) made a contract with the Amphiktyons to build the temple at Delphi, the one that exists now but was not there then.

<div type="Chapter" n="2"><head>The Early and High Classic Periods</head>
<div type="section" n="1"><head>From Archaic to Classic</head>

<p>The sources connect a number of names with the transition to the early classic, but most are mere shadows today. Even Kalamis, though clearly an important figure (<ref target="t2" n="U">T 2</ref>, <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>), remains deeply problematic, for not only has no attribution gained general acceptance, but the sources clearly point to <emph>two</emph> sculptors called Kalamis, one active ca. 470 and the other after ca. 400 (e.g. <ref target="t61" n="U">T 61</ref>): see esp. <bibl>Overbeck 1868/1959</bibl>, nos. 508-32, 857; <bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl>,, 505-08; <bibl>Delivorrias 1978</bibl>; <bibl>Pollitt 1990</bibl>, 46-48, 94, 222-23. We shall meet a similar situation with regard to Bryaxis in the fourth-third centuries (<ref target="t107" n="U">T 107</ref>, <ref target="t108" n="U">T 108</ref>).</p>

<p>As to the following selection, though it ostensibly covers all the major centers, in fact neither East Greek nor Peloponnesian sculptors can be adequately represented, simply because no ancient author cared about their work. Pythagoras of Samos and the Olympia master are no real substitute, for the former apparently migrated to the West when young, and (<foreign xml:lang="la">pace</foreign> Pausanias, <ref target="t39" n="U">T 39</ref>) the latter remains an enigma: though his workshop perhaps included Parians, his own identity remains obscure.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Kritios and Nesiotes of Athens(?)</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Kritios</persName></head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Nesiotes</persName></head>

<p>Since the Tyrannicides of Kritios and Nesiotes (cf. <rs key="Naples G103-104" type="sculpture">Naples G103-104</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 227-31) are usually taken to mark the official "birthday" of the Severe style, these two sculptors deserve first place in the series. Yet although no fewer than six Akropolis signatures of theirs survive, on dedications by wealthy Athenians or foreign residents, only their association with the Tyrannicides saved them from oblivion in antiquity. The crucial witnesses here are Pausanias (<ref target="t31" n="U">T 31</ref>) and the third-century Marmor Parium (<bibl><title>FGH</title></bibl> 239 A 54) which gives a date equivalent to 477/6. So prestigious a commission bespeaks a certain standing in their craft, and indeed Nesiotes' name was appended to a dedication of ca. 500 (but puzzlingly alone, without the verb "made [it]": <bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl>, no. 84), while two of their jointly-signed bases (<bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl>, nos. 122, 161) were found in the Persian debris, so should also pre-date 480. The others may extend to ca. 460, though none is as late as 448-445, the (surely tendentious) <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign>  given by Pliny: see commentary to <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>.</p>

<p>In <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>, Pliny links them to the shadowy Hegesias (or Hegias), singled out in <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref> and elsewhere as an early exponent of the new manner, and reportedly Pheidias' teacher. Lucian repeats the association, adding details that suggest a Hellenistic art critic as a source; since Antigonos of Karystos actually wrote on Kritios' pupils (Diogenes Laertius 9.49), he may be a good candidate.</p>

<p>The division of labor within the partnership remains obscure: <bibl>Brunnsaaker 1971</bibl>, 138-141 argues against a modeler/caster duo, while <bibl>Mattusch 1980</bibl>, 441 tries to reinstate the distinction; yet on the Foundry Cup (<rs key="Munich 2650" type="vase">Munich 2650</rs>) the two master-sculptors — if such they are, and not clients — are not shown in this guise but preside as equals over the finishing touches.</p>

<p>Despite the fame of "Aeginetan bronze" (Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 34.10), ancient critics virtually ignored Aeginetan sculpture as such; only Pausanias was interested in it, so that apart from a single Hellenistic epigram (<bibl>Anth. Pal. 9.238</bibl>) he is our sole witness to the achievements of the foremost Aeginetan sculptor, Onatas.</p>

<cit xml:id="t36" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 8.42.1">Pausanias 8.42.1-8</bibl>

<quote><p>The second mountain, Mt. Elaios, is about 30 stades from Phigaleia, and has a cave sacred to Demeter surnamed Black ... [Pausanias then tells the story of Poseidon's rape of Demeter and Persephone's abduction by Hades] ... As a result, the Phigalians say, they accounted the cave sacred to Demeter, and set up a wooden image in it. The image was made in the following fashion: it was seated on a rock, and was like a woman in all respects save the head. She had the head and hair of a horse, and serpents and other beasts grew out of her head. Her chiton reached right to her feet, and she held a dolphin in one hand, a dove in the other. Why they made the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">xoanon</foreign> like this should be clear to any intelligent man who is versed in tradition. They say they named her Black because the goddess wore black clothing. However, they cannot remember who made this <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">xoanon</foreign> or how it caught fire; but when it was destroyed the Phigalians gave no new image to the goddess and largely neglected her festivals and sacrifices, until finally barrenness fell upon the land ... [They then consulted Delphi, and were told that good times would return only if they restored her former honors to her] ... So when they heard the oracle that was brought back, they held Demeter in even higher honor than before, and particularly they persuaded Onatas son of Mikon of Aegina to make them an image of Demeter at any price he asked. The Pergamenes have a bronze Apollo of his, which they marvel at both for its size and its art. This man, then, discovering a picture or copy of the ancient <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">xoanon</foreign> —but guided for the most part (as it is said) by a vision he saw in his dreams — made a bronze image for the Phigalians about a generation after the Persian invasion of Greece [480]. My evidence for the date is as follows: when Xerxes invaded Europe, Gelon son of Deinomenes was tyrant of Syracuse and the rest of Sicily. When Gelon died [478] the rule passed on to Hieron, his brother. But when Hieron died [467/66] before he could dedicate to Olympian Zeus the offerings which he had vowed for his victories in the horse-races, his son Deinomenes set them up on behalf of his father. These too are the works of Onatas, and there are inscriptions at Olympia, of which the one over the offering reads:

<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">For his victories in your holy games, Olympian Zeus,</l>
<l>Once in the chariot-and-four, twice with the race-horse,</l>
<l>Hieron bestowed these gifts on you; but his son dedicated them,</l>
<l>Deinomenes, in memory of his Syracusan sire.</l></quote>

The other inscription is:

<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">Onatas, son of Mikon, fashioned me</l>
<l>Who has his home on Aegina's isle.</l></quote>

Onatas was contemporary with Hegias of Athens and Hageladas of Argos.</p><p>It was mainly to see this Demeter that I came to Phigaleia.</p><p>... But the image made by Onatas no longer existed in my time, and most of the Phigalians were not aware that it had ever existed at all. The oldest of the inhabitants I met said that three generations before his time some rocks had fallen on it from the cave roof, crushing it and destroying it utterly. Indeed, I could still see clearly the place in the roof where the rocks had broken away.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Pausanias' dating roughly coincides with the archaeological evidence: a signed base from the Akropolis may belong to the Persian debris and predate 480, and his Achaean monument in Olympia lies below the temple fill and so should be earlier than ca. 460. Unfortunately, however, landscaping done <emph>after</emph> the temple's completion ca. 457 cannot be ruled out entirely.</p>

<p>A mutilated signature from Pergamon, <bibl>Pergamon 8.1, no. 48</bibl>, may come from the base of no. 9. Parts of the base of no. 3 also survive, and fit Pausanias' description:</p>

<cit xml:id="t37" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 5.25.8">Pausanias 5.25.8</bibl>

<quote><p>There are also offerings dedicated by the whole Achaean race in common: they represent those who, when Hektor challenged any Greek to meet him in single combat, dared to await the outcome of the lot. They stand near the great temple armed with spears and shields. Right opposite, Nestor stands on another base, casting the lot of each into the helmet. Those who are drawing lots to meet Hektor are now only eight in number — for the ninth, the statue of Odysseus, was carried off to Rome, they say, by Nero — and of the eight remaining only Agamemnon's has his name inscribed below: the inscription runs, moreover, from right to left. The figure with the cock emblazoned on his shield is Idomeneus the descendant of Minos: they say that Idomeneus was descended from Helios the father of Pasiphae, and that the cock is sacred to Helios and announces when he is about to rise. An inscription is written on the pedestal:

<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">These images were dedicated to Zeus by the Achaeans,</l>
<l>Descendants of Pelops, the godlike Tantalid.</l></quote>

This is written on the pedestal, but the sculptor's signature is written on Idomeneus's shield:

<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">This is one of the many works of clever Onatas,</l>

<p>In this epigram Onatas calls himself <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">sophos</foreign>, "clever", in the tradition of Phaidimos and other archaic sculptors (cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, 68); yet this self-assertiveness did not prevent him from collaborating with others on at least three of the monuments listed above: with Kalamis on no. 2 (<bibl n="Paus. 6.12.1">Paus. 6.12.1</bibl>; cf. <ref target="t2 t3" n="U">T 2-3</ref>), Kalliteles on no. 4, and Kalynthos(?) on no. 7.

<quote><p>The Thasians ... dedicated a Herakles at Olympia, the base as well as the image being of bronze. The image is ten cubits [15 feet] high, and has a club in his right hand and a bow in his left... On this dedication by the Thasians at Olympia is an elegiac couplet:

<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">Onatas, son of Mikon, fashioned me</l>
<l>He who has his home on Aegina.</l></quote>

This Onatas, though his sculptural style is Aeginetan, I shall place second to none of the pupils of Daidalos and the Attic school.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Yet this essentially unhelpful remark has not inhibited attributions, which fall into five more-or-less mutually exclusive groups, as follows: (a) the Artemision Zeus (<rs key="Athens, NM Br. 15161" type="sculpture">Athens, NM Br. 15161</rs>), "Omphalos" Apollo (<rs key="Athens, NM 45" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 45</rs>; <rs key="Munich GL 265" type="sculpture">Munich GL 265</rs>), Aegina sphinx, "Aspasia"/Europa, and Corinth/Mocenigo goddess (<rs key="London 209" type="sculpture">London 209</rs>) (cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 285-88); (b) an Athena head from Aegina in the Louvre and the Delphi charioteer (<rs key="Delphi 3520" type="sculpture">Delphi 3520</rs>; cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 301-02); (c) <rs key="Aegina East Pediment 2" type="sculpture">Aegina East Pediment 2</rs> (cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 245-53) and a bronze head from the Akropolis (<rs key="Athens, NM 6446" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 6446</rs>, cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 249); (d) a Herakles in Cherchel, a small bronze Hermes kriophoros in Paris, a bearded head on the Akropolis, and three warriors in Mariemont and Rome — all copies; and (e) the Riace bronzes (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 292-96). Others give (a) to Kalamis, (c) to Kalon, and (e) to Pheidias, which suggests that though some connection with Aegina is apparent in each case, to choose between them is hopelessly arbitrary.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>The Olympia Master</head>

<p>Pausanias' attribution of the Olympia pediments to Paionios (E) and Alkamenes (W) is probably a misreading of his own notes. In his Nike inscription (<ref target="t81" n="U">T 81</ref>) Paionios tells us that he made the (east?) <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">akroteria</foreign> for the temple, and <bibl>Lippold 1950</bibl>, 205 (cf. <bibl>Jeffery 1980a</bibl>, 1234-35) has plausibly suggested that Alkamenes made the other set. Modern suggestions for the pediments and metopes, often less happy still, are summarized in <bibl><title>EAA</title></bibl> 5: 656-7 (Becatti, 1963). The identity of the Olympia Master remains a mystery.</p>

<cit xml:id="t39" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 5.10.2">Pausanias 5.10.2-10</bibl>

<quote><p>The temple and image were made for Zeus from spoils, when the Eleans crushed Pisa and her allies in war [ca. 470] .... The temple is Doric in style, and the outside is colonnaded. It is built of local limestone. Its height up to the pediment is 68 feet, its breadth 95 feet, its length 230 feet. The architect was Libon, a local man .... A gilded cauldron stands on each corner of the roof, and a Nike, also gilded, stands right above the middle of the pediment. Beneath the Nike is a golden shield, with Medusa the Gorgon in relief...[Pausanias then cites the shield's Spartan dedication commemorating their defeat of the Athenians at Tanagra in 457]...
</p>
<p>Turning to the pediments, the one in front represents the contest, not yet begun, between Pelops and Oinomaos in chariot-racing, with both sides involved in preparations for the actual race. An image of Zeus stands right in the center of the pediment; and on the right of Zeus is Oinomaos with a helmet on his head, flanked by his wife Sterope, one of the daughters of Atlas. Myrtilos, who drove the chariot of Oinomaos, sits in front of the horses, which are four in number. After him there are two men: they have no names, but must have been ordered by Oinomaos to attend to the horses. On the very end reclines Kladeos, the river which in other ways also is most honored by the Eleans after the Alpheios. On the left from Zeus are Pelops, Hippodameia, the charioteer of Pelops, horses, and two men, who are apparently grooms for Pelops too. Then the pediment narrows again, and in this corner Alpheios is represented. The name of the man who is Pelops' charioteer in the Troezenian version of the story is Sphairos, but the guide at Olympia alleges that it is Killas. The figures in the front pediment are by Paionios of Mende in Thrace, and those in the back are by Alkamenes, a contemporary of Pheidias and second only to him in cleverness as a sculptor. What he carved in the pediment is the fight between the Lapiths and Centaurs at the wedding of Peirithoos. In the center of the pediment is Peirithoos. On one side of him is Eurytion who has seized the woman who is Peirithoos' wife, and Kaineus protecting Peirithoos, and on the other is Theseus defending himself against the Centaurs with an axe. One Centaur has seized a maiden, the other a handsome boy. Alkamenes carved this scene, I think, because he had learned from Homer's poems that Peirithoos was a descendant of Zeus and Theseus a great-grandson of Pelops.
</p>
<p>Most of the Labors of Herakles are also represented at Olympia. Above the temple doors is the hunt of the Arcadian boar, his exploit against Diomedes the Thracian, and that against Geryon at Erytheia; he is also about to receive the burden from Atlas, and he is cleansing the land of dung for the Eleans. Above the doors of the rear chamber he is taking the girdle from the Amazon, and also represented there are the exploits against the deer, the bull at Knossos, the Stymphalian birds, the Hydra, and the Argive lion.</p></quote></cit></div>

<p>Pliny places Pythagoras fourth in his selection of five bronze-casters, after Pheidias, Polykleitos, and Myron, and before Lysippos. This position, repeated in Pliny's chronology (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>), clearly derives from "Xenokratic" art criticism (cf. <ref target="t43" n="U">T 43</ref>, <ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref>, <ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>) and is complemented by Pausanias' considered praise for his work:</p>

<cit xml:id="t40" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, N.H. 34.59</bibl>

<quote><p>Pythagoras of Rhegium in Italy surpassed Myron with his pancratiast which stands at Delphi, and Leontiscus too. He also made the runner Astylus, which is on show at Olympia, a Libyan [and a] boy holding a tablet there too, a nude figure holding apples, a lame man at Syracuse which makes people who look at it actually feel the pain of its sore, an Apollo shooting the Python with his arrows, and a cithara-player called <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">dikaios</foreign> ("honest") because when Alexander took Thebes [336] a sum of gold hidden in its drapery folds by a fugitive remained undisturbed. He was the first to represent sinews and veins, and was more exact in modeling hair. There was also another Pythagoras, a Samian, who began as a painter, whose seven nudes and an old man in the temple of Today's Fortune are praised. He is recorded to have resembled the other Pythagoras so closely that even their features were indistinguishable, and we are told that Sostratus was a son of this Pythagoras' sister but a pupil of Pythagoras of Rhegium.</p></quote></cit>

<cit xml:id="t41" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 6.4.3">Pausanias 6.4.3</bibl>

<quote><p>[At Olympia] there is a statue of Leontiskos, a wrestler in the men's category and a Sicilian from Messene on the Strait. He was crowned, they say, by the Amphiktyons and twice by the Eleans, and his wrestling style was that of Sostratos of Sikyon in the pankration: for they say that he did not know how to throw his opponents, but won by bending their fingers. The statue was made by Pythagoras of Rhegion — a good sculptor if ever there was one. They say he studied under Klearchos, who was also a native of Rhegion, and a pupil of Eucheir.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Now for the problems. First, Pliny, Pausanias, and Diogenes Laertius (<ref target="t42" n="U">T 42</ref>) all give his home as Rhegion, on the toe of Italy; yet when he signed the statue of Euthynos at Olympia (victor in 472), he called himself a Samian. Pliny and Diogenes compound the confusion by introducing a look-alike relative, Pythagoras of Samos, formerly a painter.</p>

<p>The solution to all this was suggested [almost] a century ago (cf. <bibl>Münzer 1895</bibl>, 520-21; <bibl>Pollitt 1974</bibl>, 91-92); namely, that Pythagoras migrated from Samos to Italy, perhaps in 494, but kept his original ethnic. Xenokrates either did not know of his Samian ancestry or preferred to cite his real (if adopted) home instead, but Antigonos of Karystos read his signature(s), recognized the problem, and conjured up the solution repeated in <ref target="t40" n="U">T 40</ref> and 42. Pliny's omission of the Euthymos from his list of the Rhegian's works, even though he knew of the statue (<title>N.H.</title> 7.152), points in the same direction.</p>

<p>The second problem is chronological, and also traceable to Xenokrates. <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref> dates Polykleitos, Myron, and Pythagoras to 420-417, yet Pythagoras' statues of victors in the games of 480 through 452 clearly contradict this; one may be earlier (488 or 484), another later (464 or possibly 432: <bibl>Moretti 1957</bibl>, nos. 194, 257), but a <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> as late as 420 remains impossible, particularly if he studied with Klearchos [<ref target="t17" n="U">T 17</ref>].</p>

<milestone ed="NC" unit="Card"/>

<p>Rather, Xenokrates' relative chronology (rendered absolute by Pliny's source for <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>) was perhaps based not upon historical evidence but upon purely formal considerations, namely the supposed development of Greek bronze work toward even greater naturalism (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">aletheia</foreign>/<foreign xml:lang="la">veritas:</foreign> cf. <bibl>Pollitt 1974</bibl>, 125-38 and commentary to <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>, 124) whereby Pythagoras' surface realism, experiments with violent motion (his Perseus: Dio Chrysostom 37.10), and suchlike would seem more "advanced" and thus closer to Lysippos' than the comparatively conservative and "stereotyped" (<ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref>) Polykleitan statues or even those of Myron.</p>

<p>A Philoktetes on some later gems has been connected with (11) and Krotonian coin-images with (10), but the most far-reaching study, <bibl>Hofkes-Brukker 1964</bibl>, is not based on these but upon some versions of an early classical Perseus (cf. 14, but attributed by others to Myron after <ref target="t43" n="U">T 43</ref> and <bibl n="Paus. 1.23.7">Paus. 1.23.7</bibl>), concluding that he sought an "unbounded" <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">rhythmos</foreign> in place of the closure preferred by Polykleitos and Myron. Though pure conjecture, this does have the merit of explaining why the Xenokratic tradition saw him as a transitional figure between Myron and Lysippos.</p>

<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Myron</persName></head>

<p>Eleutherai was just inside Attica on the Boeotian border, which is why Pausanias (6.8.4, etc.) calls him an Athenian. Once again the only synoptic account of his oeuvre is Pliny's:</p>

<cit xml:id="t43" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, N.H. 34.57-8</bibl>

<quote><p>Myron was born at Eleutherae and was a pupil of Hageladas. He was particularly famous for his statue of a heifer, celebrated in well-known epigrams — for most people owe their reputations more to someone else's talent than their own. He also made a dog, a discobolus, a Perseus and the sea-monsters (?), a satyr marveling at the flutes and a Minerva, pentathletes at Delphi, pancratiasts, and a Hercules now in the shrine dedicated by Pompey the Great at the Circus Maximus. Erinna also mentions in her poems that he made a cicada and a locust. He also made an Apollo which Antony the triumvir took from the Ephesians, but the deified Augustus restored it again after being warned in a dream. He seems to have been the first to extend the representation of natural truth, being more rhythmical in his art than Polykleitos and more careful over proportion (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign>); yet though he was very attentive to the bodies of his figures he does not seem to have expressed the feelings of the mind, and also did not treat the hair and the pubes any more correctly than did the rude art of old.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Pliny places him third in the "Xenokratic" sequence of bronze-workers, between Polykleitos (<ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref>) and Pythagoras (<ref target="t40" n="U">T 40</ref>), and consequently the late Hellenistic source for <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref> gave him a <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> of 420-417; for an explanation as to why, see the commentary to <ref target="t40" n="U">T 40</ref>, above. Contradicted by (a) his supposed apprenticeship to Hageladas (<ref target="t25" n="U">T 25</ref>); (b) the "histories" of Cicero and Quintilian (<ref target="t2" n="U">T 2</ref>, <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>); (c) his Aeginetan commission (no. 1), presumably pre-dating the Athenian conquest of 457/6; and (d) the activities of his son Lykios in the 440s and 430s (<bibl>Jeffery 1980b</bibl>), this erroneous chronology also suggests that his allegedly greater attentiveness to <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign> than — of all people! — Polykleitos (<ref target="t43" n="U">T 43</ref>) could simply be a rationalization introduced by Xenokrates or Varro (cf. <ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref>) to save this evolutionary scheme, rigidly formalistic as it apparently was.</p>

<p>The Diskobolos (no. 13; <rs key="Rome, Terme 126371" type="sculpture">Rome, Terme 126371</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 300) is the only work identified beyond doubt in the copies, owing to a rare detailed description of one allegedly displayed with the Tyrannicides, Polykleitos's Diadoumenos, and Demetrios' Pellichos (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 227-31; 383-85; <ref target="t91" n="U">T 91</ref>, with commentary) in a house in Athens:</p>

<quote><p>"When you came in the hall," he said, "didn't you notice a totally gorgeous statue up there, by Demetrios the portraitist?"

"Not that one, he said, that's one of Myron's works, that Diskobolos you speak of..."</p></quote></cit>

<p>On the Athena and Marsyas, often identified as a group after <bibl n="Paus. 1.24.1">Paus. 1.24.1</bibl>, see <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, 147, figs. 290-91, and the copy <rs key="Louvre 2208" type="sculpture">Louvre 2208</rs>; as for the others, optimists have recognized nos. 2, 8, 10, and 11 in Roman copies (though the Perseus is just as regularly given to Pythagoras), while <bibl>Mingazzini 1972-3</bibl> and others attribute nos. 12 and 16 to namesakes of the Hellenistic period (<foreign xml:lang="la">contra</foreign> e.g. <bibl>Moretti 1957</bibl>, nos. 260, 319, 529, 535). These individuals are shadowy figures at best: one, the Myron "of Thebes" whose signatures graced a dedication at Pergamon (along with Praxiteles' and Xenokrates': Pergamon, 8.1, nos. 135-140) and another found in Rome may well be a Hellenistic fiction perpetuated by locals charged with furnishing new bases for war-booty, for Eleutherai was disputed between Athens and Boeotia. Certainly, the epigrams describing the Ladas are by no means incompatible with early classical experimentation:</p>

<cit xml:id="t45" n="testimonium"><bibl><title>Anthologia Palatina</title> 16.54</bibl>

<quote><l>Just as you were in life, Ladas, flying before wind-footed</l>
<l>Thymos, touching the ground with the tips of your toes,</l>
<l>So did Myron cast you in bronze, on all of your body</l>
<l>Stamping your expectation of an Olympian crown.</l></quote></cit>

<p>On the other hand, Pliny's attribution of a marble "Drunken old Woman" at Smyrna (<title>N.H.</title> 36.32) has been universally rejected, not least because its most unclassical theme recurs in a copy of a work of advanced Hellenistic date, in Rome (<rs key="Munich 437" type="sculpture">Munich 437</rs>; <bibl>Bieber 1961b</bibl>, 81; <bibl>Laubscher 1982</bibl>, 118-21; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 753-54). To connect this with the Myron of Athens who worked on Delos ca. 140 (<bibl>Marcadé 1957</bibl>, 57) is tempting but purely arbitrary.</p>

<p>Many have pondered over Myron's signal contribution to Greek sculpture; yet one must remember that in antiquity, though his statues of men were justly renowned (<ref target="t115" n="U">T 115</ref>), his most famous work was not the Diskobolos but his cow (no. 20), whose realism inspired countless epigrams (<ref target="t43" n="U">T 43</ref>; <bibl>Overbeck 1868/1959</bibl>, nos. 550-591, etc.), mostly vacuous in the extreme. His son Lykios carried on his work, also gaining major commissions at Olympia and Athens.</p>

<div type="section" n="2"><head>Pheidias Son of Charmides of Athens</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Pheidias</persName></head>

<p>Though certainly the most renowned of Greek sculptors in antiquity, Pheidias remains an enigma. Not only are key dates in his career a matter of serious dispute, but with the disappearance of his great cult statues, the uncertainty over his contribution to the Parthenon marbles, and the difficulty of separating "authentic" copies from the multitude of derivations, his personal legacy to Greek sculpture becomes a tricky issue indeed.</p>

<p>As to chronology, his <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> in 448-445 (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>), if not completely arbitrary, should celebrate either the dedication or the commissioning of one of his major works at Athens. The obvious candidates are either the Athena Parthenos, begun in 447/6 (<title>IG</title>, 1(3): nos. 453-60) and finished in 438/7 (<ref target="t48" n="U">T 48</ref>), or the Athena Promachos, which must predate the Parthenos, but by how much is not clear, since the nine years of accounts attributed to it (<title>IG</title>, 1(3): no. 435) are themselves not dated. At the very least, though, they project his career back to ca. 460, perhaps earlier if the Promachos celebrated Kimon's defeat of the Persians at the Eurymedon in 467 or the peace of Kallias in ca. 465 (<bibl>Walsh 1981</bibl>; <bibl n="Plut. Per. 17">Plut. Per. 17</bibl>). His Marathon group at Delphi, which celebrated Kimon's disgraced father Miltiades (<bibl n="Paus. 10.10.1">Paus. 10.10.1</bibl>) was probably made around this time, at least before Kimon's ostracism in 461, or just possibly upon his brief come-back in 451-449. At any rate it is generally agreed that Pheidias began work around 470, or maybe even earlier if his teachers really were Hegias (<ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>) and Hageladas (<ref target="t25" n="U">T 25</ref>) as the ancients believed; cf. also <bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl>, 27. According to Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 35.54, he was originally a painter.</p>

<milestone ed="NC" unit="Card"/>

<p>The only other absolute date in his career is his trial, variously placed between 438/7 and 433/2. The earliest "evidence" of wrongdoing is from a comedy presented in 422/1:</p>

<cit xml:id="t46" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Aristoph. Peace 605">Aristophanes, <title>Peace</title> 605-611</bibl>

<l>With one teensy spark, the anti-Megara Decree,</l>
<l>He started such a fight that every eye in Greece</l>
<l>Was smarting with the smoke... and Peace: she disappeared!</l></quote></cit>

<p>Later historians, hungry for facts, turned this supposed chain of events into "history": thus Ephoros (<bibl><title>FGH</title></bibl> 70 F 196: ca. 350), Diodoros 12.39 (<bibl n="Diod. 12.39">Diod. 12.39</bibl>), and especially Plutarch:</p>

<cit xml:id="t47" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Plut. Per. 13.4">Plutarch, <title>Perikles</title> 13.4 and 13.31-2 (excerpts)</bibl>

<quote><p>(13.4) Perikles' general manager and overseer was Pheidias, though the several works had great architects and artists besides. The Parthenon, for instance, ... was built by Kallikrates and Iktinos ... but it was Pheidias who produced the great golden image of the goddess, and he is acknowledged as its artist on the stele. Almost everything was under his supervision, and he was overseer of all the other artists, owing to his friendship with Perikles. This brought envy upon the one and slander against the other, to the effect that Pheidias was in the habit of procuring free-born women for Perikles when they came to see the building site. The comic poets took up this story and began a smear campaign...
</p>
<p>(13.31) But the worst charge of all, and yet the one best supported by evidence, was the following: Pheidias the sculptor was contractor for the great statue, as I have said, and being a friend of Perikles and having great influence with him, made on that account a number of jealous enemies. Others, too, decided to use him to test the people, in order to see what the popular judgment would be in a case involving Perikles. They therefore persuaded one Menon, an assistant of Pheidias, to sit in the agora as a suppliant and to ask for immunity in return for laying information and bringing a charge against Pheidias. The demos granted the man's plea, and a motion to prosecute was laid before the Assembly. Yet the charge of theft was not proven, because right from the very beginning, at Perikles' suggestion, the gold had been worked and fitted to the statue in such a way that it could all be taken off and weighed, and this was now what Perikles ordered the prosecutors to do.
</p>
<p>But the fame of his works still aroused jealousy against Pheidias, especially since when he made the Amazonomachy on the shield he included both his own portrait among the reliefs, as a bald old man lifting a stone high with both hands, and a very handsome one of Perikles fighting an Amazon. And the position of Perikles' arm, which is holding a spear before his eyes, is cunningly contrived for the purpose of concealing the likeness — which is, however, perfectly plain from either side.
</p>
<p>So Pheidias was led away to prison and there fell sick and died; some even say he was poisoned by Perikles' enemies in order to blacken Perikles still further. And as for the informer, Menon, a proposal was passed, on a motion of Glykon, to grant him immunity, and the generals were instructed to provide for his safety.
</p>
<p>[32: cases for impiety are brought against Perikles' mistress, Aspasia, and friend Anaxagoras the philosopher, and he is impeached for embezzlement.] Since in the case of Pheidias he had fallen foul of the people, he feared the judgment of the court, and so kindled into flame the war that was threatening, hoping thereby to dissipate the charges against him ... These are the motives alleged for his refusal to allow the demos to give in to the Spartan demands: but the truth is not clear.</p></quote></cit>

<p>But Plutarch notes even here that "the truth is unclear", and elsewhere explicitly charges Aristophanes with slander (<title>Moralia</title> 856A). These successive indictments for <emph>both</emph> embezzlement <emph>and</emph> impiety (the portraits) are problematic indeed, for the decree protecting Menon would not have been passed had the embezzlement charge failed, and his death in jail after the impiety conviction is contradicted by the archaeological evidence dating his workshop at Olympia to the 430s (<bibl>Mallwitz 1964</bibl>) and by the Pantarkes anecdote (<ref target="t50" n="U">T 50</ref>); on the other hand, the lesser sentence of deprivation of civil rights (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">atimia</foreign>) and exile should have precluded him from signing the Zeus as a citizen (<ref target="t50" n="U">T 50</ref>).</p>

<p>More to the point, perhaps, is that Aristophanes was writing comedy, not history, and that the whole concoction, put into the mouth of Hermes the trickster and paralleled by an equally implausible one on the Spartan side (620-27), in fact astounds Hermes' audience by its novelty (615-18). This is not surprising, for four years earlier Aristophanes had made trusty old Dikaiopolis offer quite another motive for the war, a burlesque on the tit-for-tat rapes preceding the Trojan war (cf. Herodotus 1.1-5), also accepted by the chorus with "true and right; he tells no lies at all" (<bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 509">Aristoph. Ach. 509-61</bibl>).</p>

<milestone ed="NC" unit="Card"/>

<p>Altogether more plausible is a scholiast's note to <ref target="t46" n="U">T 46</ref>:</p>

<cit xml:id="t48" n="testimonium"><bibl>Scholium to Aristophanes, <title>Peace</title> 605 (Philochoros, <title>FGH</title> 328 F 121)</bibl>

<quote><p>(First scholiast). Concerning the archonship of [The]odoros [438/7], Philochoros says: The gold image of Athena was set up in the great temple and the gold weighed 44 talents; Perikles was the supervisor, and Pheidias made it. And Pheidias, after he had finished, was tried for embezzlement of some of the ivory for the scales [i.e. of Athena's snake]. Fleeing to Elis, he is said to have contracted to make the image of Zeus at Olympia, and after he had made it, to have been put to death by the Eleans. In the archonship of [P]ythodoros, seven years later [432/1, counting inclusively as usual], he says concerning the Megarians ... [there follows discussion of the Megarian decrees, then the version of the story referred to under <ref target="t46" n="U">T 46</ref>].
</p>
<p>(Second scholiast). But the suspicion against Perikles seems groundless, since the Pheidias affair occurred seven years before the war. Pheidias, as Philochoros says, worked on the image of Athena in the archonship of [The]odoros [438/7] and stole the gold from her chryselephantine statue, on account of which he was prosecuted and condemned to exile. When he was in Elis as contractor for the Olympian Zeus he was condemned by them and killed while in exile.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Now as in <ref target="t34" n="U">T 34</ref> Philochoros is a source of a quite different order. Though the archon's names are garbled and the second scholiast's note has been contaminated by the tradition of <ref target="t47" n="U">T 47</ref>, the seven years' interval secures the chronology, dating the trial to 438/7, probably just after the statue's completion and dedication in summer 438, when the committee of overseers (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">epistatai</foreign>) would have submitted their accounts. Suggestively, in <title>IG</title> I(3) 453-60 the gold is always meticulously weighed whereas the ivory is only listed according to its price.</p>

<p>Fleeing to Elis, Pheidias (whose wealth was soon legendary: <bibl n="Plat. Meno 91D">Plat. Meno 91D</bibl>) then made the Zeus, which was promptly imitated by Theokosmas at Megara (<bibl n="Paus. 1.40.4">Paus. 1.40.4</bibl>), though work on this latter statue stopped when war broke out in 431. The molds from the Olympia workshop (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 376), for a thrice-life-size <emph>female</emph> figure, found with Pheidias' inscribed mug and closely related to the copies from the shield of the Parthenos in style, suggest further commissions still. His Aphrodite Ourania and Athena for Elis (<bibl n="Paus. 6.25.1">Paus. 6.25.1, 6.26.3</bibl>) come to mind, though there are obstacles: the copies now attributed to the Ourania (<bibl>E.B. Harrison 1984</bibl>) are quite uniformly life-size, while Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 35.54 gives the Athena to his pupil Kolotes. The date and circumstances of his death are equally unclear (cf. <ref target="t48" n="U">T 48</ref>), though some argue that his supposed condemnation by the Eleans was what prompted Aristophanes' remarks in the first place.</p>

<p>As for the presumed portraits of him and Perikles on the shield (<ref target="t47" n="U">T 47</ref>; <rs key="London 302" type="sculpture">London 302</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 366), <bibl>Preisshofen 1974b</bibl> has shown that the seven mentions of one or other of these, and an eighth that substitutes Daidalos (Ampelius 8.10) emanate from a Hellenistic tradition of marvel literature that sought to explain the unusual iconography of the two Athenians nearest the spectator, even inventing a miraculous mechanism that would destroy the entire composition if the presumed "portraits" were removed. These fantasies appear to have even stimulated someone to create a Pheidias type in the round, represented today by a marble head (a copy) in Copenhagen, a superb Hellenistic (Alexandrian?) statuette in New York, and some later gems.</p>

<p>Of these it was the Zeus (no. 1) that secured Pheidias' reputation in antiquity (cf. <ref target="t115" n="U">T 115</ref>), and which inspired a vast literature, passing from straightforward description (<ref target="t49" n="U">T 49</ref>, 50) through controlled religious awe (<ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>, 52) to lyrical encomium (e.g. Dio Chrysostomos 12, <foreign xml:lang="la">passim</foreign>); in particular, it not only became the paradigm for neoclassical sculptors, but helped to stimulate the so-called "<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">phantasia</foreign> -theory" of art criticism (<ref target="t53" n="U">T 53</ref>, 54).</p>

<quote><p>The greatest [of the offerings in the temple of Zeus] was the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">xoanon</foreign> of Zeus made by Pheidias of Athens, son of Charmides. Made of ivory, it was so big that, although the temple itself was very large, the artist seems to have failed to hit the right proportions; for although the god is represented as seated, he almost touches the peak of the roof, and so gives the impression that if he stood up he would unroof the temple. Some have recorded the measurements of the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">xoanon</foreign> , and Kallimachos wrote an iambic poem about them. Panainos the painter, Pheidias' nephew and co-worker, helped him greatly in embellishing the statue with colors, especially the drapery. And many wonderful paintings of his are on display round the temple. It is said that when Panainos asked Pheidias what model he was going to use for the image of Zeus, he replied that it was the model Homer provided in the following lines:
<cit>
<quote><l>He spoke, the son of Kronos, and nodded his dark brow,</l>
<l>And the ambrosial locks of the great god swept down</l>
<l>From his immortal head, and all Olympos quaked.</l></quote>

<quote><p>(10) The image was made by Pheidias, as is witnessed by an inscription written under the feet of Zeus: Pheidias son of Charmides, an Athenian, made me. (11) The god sits on a throne made of gold and ivory. On his head lies a garland in the form of olive shoots. In his right hand he holds a Nike of ivory and gold as well, which carries a fillet and wears a garland on her head. In the god's left hand is a scepter made of all kinds of metal, and an eagle perches on top of it. The god's shoes and cloak are of gold. On the cloak are inlaid figures and lily-flowers.
</p>
<p>The throne is rich with gold and jewels, and ebony and ivory too; and upon it there are painted figures and sculptured images. Four Nikai in a dancing pose are represented on each leg of the throne, and two more at the foot of each leg. On each of the two front feet are Theban children seized by sphinxes, and under the sphinxes Apollo and Artemis are shooting down Niobe's children. Between the feet of the throne are four bars, each stretching from foot to foot. The bar right opposite the entrance has seven sculptured images: the eighth has disappeared, but they know not how... They say that the youth binding a fillet on his head resembles Pantarkes, an Elean boy who Pheidias loved. Pantarkes won a victory in the boys' wrestling contest during the 86th Olympiad [436]. On the other bars there is the company that fought with Herakles against the Amazons. Taking both sides together the figures number 29 in all, and Theseus too is lined up among the allies of Herakles.
</p>
<p>The throne is supported not merely by its legs, but by columns which stand between the legs and equal them in size. One cannot go under the throne as one can at Amyklai. At Olympia there are screens built like walls to keep people out. Of these screens the section opposite the door is glazed with blue enamel, but the rest have paintings by Panainos. Among them is Atlas holding up heaven and earth, with Herakles standing by ready to take the weight, and also Theseus and Peirithoos, Hellas and Salamis (who holds in her hand an ornament for a ship's prow), and from the Labors of Herakles there is the battle with the Nemean lion, followed by the outrage against Kassandra committed by Ajax, Hippodameia the daughter of Oinomaos with her mother, and Prometheus, still chained up even though Herakles has climbed up to him.... Finally there is a picture of Penthesilea dying as Achilles holds her in his arms. There are also two Hesperides who carry the apples entrusted to them for safety. This Panainos was a brother of Pheidias, and painted the Battle of Marathon in the Painted Stoa at Athens.
</p>
<p>On the uppermost part of the throne, above the head of the image, Pheidias has placed three Graces on one side, three Seasons on the other. These are included among the daughters of Zeus in the epics: in the <title>Iliad</title>, for example, Homer says that they were entrusted with the sky like guards at a king's court [5.749ff]. The footstool of Zeus ... has golden lions and, in relief, the battle of Theseus with the Amazons, the first heroic deed of the Athenians against non-Greeks.

<milestone ed="NC" unit="Card"/>
</p>
<p>On the base which supports the throne and Zeus with all his adornment, there are works of gold: Helios mounted on his chariot, Zeus and Hera, [Hephaistos] and next to him Charis. After her comes Hermes, and after Hermes, Hestia; after Hestia is Eros receiving Aphrodite as she rises from the sea; Persuasion is crowning Aphrodite. Also represented there are Apollo with Artemis, and Athena and Herakles; and near the end of the base, Amphitrite and Poseidon, and Selene riding what looks to be a horse. Some call it a mule, not a horse, and tell a silly story about the mule. I know that the height and breadth of the Zeus at Olympia have been measured and recorded, but I will not praise those who made the measurements, for they fall far short of the impression made by the sight of the image ....
</p>
<p>All the floor in front of the image has been paved not with white but with black tiles. A raised rim of Parian marble runs around the border of the black stone, to keep in the olive oil that is poured out. For olive oil is beneficial to the image at Olympia, and it is olive oil which keeps the ivory from being harmed by the marshiness of the Altis. On the Athenian Akropolis it is water, not olive oil, which benefits the so-called Parthenos. For the Akropolis is extremely dry owing to its excessive height, so that the image, being made of ivory, yearns for the dampness it brings.</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p>L. Aemilius [Paullus, the conqueror of Macedonia in 166] visited the temple in Olympia, and when he saw the statue of Zeus he was awestruck , and said simply that Pheidias seemed to him to have been the only artist who had made a likeness of Homer's Zeus; for he himself had come to Olympia with high expectations but the reality had far surpassed them.</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p>I am of the firm opinion that nothing of any kind is so beautiful as to surpass in beauty the thing which it reproduces — like a mask copied from the face. That which cannot be perceived with the eyes, ears, or other senses we can, however, conceive in our minds through imagination. So in the case of the statues of Pheidias, the most perfect of their kind which we have ever seen, and in the case of the paintings I have named, we can, despite their beauty, visualize something even more beautiful. Surely that artist, when he created his Jupiter or Minerva, did not look at any person for use as a model, but rather in his own mind there resided a sort of extraordinary apparition of beauty; concentrating on it and intuiting its nature, he directed his art and his hand towards producing a likeness of it.</p></quote></cit>

<cit xml:id="t54" n="testimonium"><bibl>Philostratos, <title>Life of Apollonios of Tyana</title> 6.19</bibl>

<quote><p>"Your artists like Pheidias," he [Thespesion] said, "and like Praxiteles, after going up to heaven and making copies of the forms of the gods, did they then represent them by art, or was there something else which stood by them as they worked?" "There was indeed," Apollonios replied, "something full of wisdom." "What is that? said the other, for certainly you would not say it was anything but <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">mimesis</foreign> ." "Imagination (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">phantasia</foreign>) made them," Apollonios answered, a far wiser artist than <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">mimesis</foreign> ; for <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">mimesis</foreign> will represent only what the eyes can see, but imagination will represent what they cannot... When you entertain a notion of Zeus you must, I suppose, envisage him along with heaven and seasons and stars, as Pheidias tried to do."</p></quote></cit>

<p>A truly "cosmic" image of the supreme god's limitless power to accomplish good and punish <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">hybris</foreign>, the Zeus was too large and complex to copy entire: <ref target="t50" n="U">T 50</ref>, a big red-figure krater of ca. 400 in Leningrad, and Hadrianic coins of Elis are our only guides (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 372-75). Yet as with the Parthenos, the subsidiary figures were copied, though far less frequently: the Niobids (certified by the krater as being on the side-bars of the throne) and perhaps the Birth of Aphrodite on Neo-Attic and other reliefs, and the sphinxes and kneeling Nikai near the throne-legs (shown on the coins) in versions in the round. Eventually taken to Constantinople, it was burnt in the Lauseion fire of A.D. 476 (<ref target="t128" n="U">T 128</ref>).</p>

<p>By contrast, we have a host of replicas of the Parthenos (no. 4: cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 361-71); these have inspired numerous restorations, including a small-scale model in Toronto (Leipen 1971) and a full-size version in Nashville. The pseudo-portraits apart (<ref target="t47" n="U">T 47</ref>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 366), the crucial sources are Philochoros (<ref target="t48" n="U">T 48</ref>) and the following:</p>

<cit xml:id="t55" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 1.24.5">Pausanias 1.24.5-7, 25.7</bibl>

<quote><p>(24) As to the temple they call the Parthenon, all the figures in the gable over the front entrance relate to the Birth of Athena, while in the rear gable is the strife between Poseidon and Athena for the country. The statue itself is made of ivory and gold. In the middle of her helmet is placed an image of the Sphinx... and on either side of it are griffins in relief. Aristeas of Prokonnesos says in his poem that these griffins fight for the gold of the Arimaspians who live beyond the Issedones, and that the gold which the griffins guard comes out of the earth. The Arimaspians are men all born with one eye, and griffins are beasts like lions but have the wings and beaks of eagles. So much for griffins.
</p>
<p>The statue of Athena stands upright, dressed in a full-length chiton, and on her breast a head of Medusa is represented in ivory. She carries a statue of Nike about 4 cubits [6 feet] high, and a spear in the other hand; a shield is placed by her feet, and near the shield is a serpent. This serpent would be Erichthonios. On the base of the image is represented the Birth of Pandora in relief. Hesiod and others have told how this Pandora was the first woman.

<quote><p>That Phidias is the most famous sculptor among all peoples who appreciate the reputation of his Olympian Jupiter, nobody doubts, but in order that even those who have not seen his works may know that he is justly praised, I will offer some small pieces of evidence as to his ability. To do this I will not appeal to the beauty of his Olympian Jupiter, nor to the size of his Minerva at Athens, even though she is 26 cubits [39 feet] high and made of ivory and gold. Rather, I shall use the battle of the Amazons which he embossed on the convex side of her shield, the fights between the gods and the giants on its concave side, and those between the Lapiths and Centaurs on her sandals. So truly did every detail lend itself to his art. On the base is carved in relief what they call the Birth of Pandora, with twenty gods in attendance. Although the figure of Victory is marvelous, connoisseurs admire the serpent and the bronze sphinx just below the tip of her spear.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Other authors occasionally add more facts, such as that her eyes were of stone (<bibl n="Plat. Hipp. Maj. 290b">Plat. Hipp. Maj. 290b</bibl>), and the inscribed accounts, though too fragmentary to translate here, offer glimpses of the administrative process at work; <ref target="t48" n="U">T 48</ref> seems to quote from another such official document, now lost. Finally, her later history is recounted not only by <ref target="t55" n="U">T 55</ref> but also by Roman and Byzantine sources, though her eventual fate remains unclear.</p>

<p>Pheidias' other works are far more problematic. Sketchy coin images of the Promachos (Work no. 6) in situ have prompted several competing identifications, including the colossal Athena Medici, which certainly looks Pheidian but seems too advanced for a work planned ca. 460; the other candidates appear only in the minor arts. Furtwängler's identification of the Lemnia (Work no. 7) with two statues in Dresden and the Palagi head in Bologna (<bibl>Furtwängler 1895/1964</bibl>, 4-26; cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 313-14) was based upon gem-engravings and a combination of testimonia, particularly Pausanias' and Lucian's remarks on her beauty, and by their resemblance to a passage of Himerios:</p>

<p>(6) From the Knidia the sculptor [of Panthea] will take only the head, ... allowing the hair, forehead, and that lovely brow-line to remain just as Praxiteles made them, and the liquid yet clear and winsome gaze of the eyes shall stay as Praxiteles conceived it. But he will take the curve of the cheeks and the fore part of the face from Alkamenes' [Aphrodite] in the Gardens, plus her hands, graceful wrists, and supple, tapering fingers. But the facial contour, its softness, and her well-proportioned nose will be supplied by the Lemnian Athena of Pheidias, who will also furnish the meeting of the lips and the neck, taken from the Amazon."</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p>Pheidias did not always make images of Zeus, nor did he always cast Athena armed into bronze, but turned his art to the other gods and adorned the Maiden's cheeks with a rosy blush, so that in place of her helmet this should cover the goddess's beauty.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Against this, <bibl>Hartswick 1983</bibl> has shown that the Palagi head (<rs key="Rome 62.69" type="sculpture">Rome 62.69</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 314) cannot have come from Dresden statue B, that the gems could be post-antique, and that the sources are impossibly vague; his further conclusions, that the head of Dresden A is alien and the entire Palagi type is Hadrianic are, however, unwarranted; cf. <bibl>Palagia 1987</bibl>. So while the type remains intact and looks Pheidian, Furtwängler's further hypotheses concerning its identity and date (451-448) remain unproven.</p>

<milestone ed="NC" unit="Card"/>

<p>Of the other Athenas, (9) has also been associated with the Medici type despite an Akropolis relief showing a version beside Athena's olive tree there, and <bibl n="Paus. 7.27.2">Paus. 7.27.2</bibl> reports a local tradition that (10) predated both it (9) and the Parthenos (4); yet it is suspicious that a remote Arkadian town should commission a chryselephantine Athena before the Parthenos had set the fashion.</p>

<p>As for the rest, <bibl>E.B. Harrison 1984</bibl> challenges (12) and attributes the so-called "Sappho" type (given by <bibl>Delivorrias 1978</bibl> and others to Kalamis) to (13), dating it to the 420s; the Apollo (15) is often identified with the Kassel type (<rs key="Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Kassel A 51825" type="sculpture">Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Kassel A 51825</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 312). It is certainly closer to the Parthenon frieze than are the Riace bronzes (<rs key="Reggio di Calabria, Riace A" type="sculpture">Reggio di Calabria, Riace A</rs>; <rs key="Reggio di Calabria, Riace B" type="sculpture">Reggio di Calabria, Riace B</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 292-96), recently connected with the Marathon group (17), three of whose Eponymous heroes were evidently missing by the late second century A.D. (<bibl n="Paus. 10.10.1">Paus. 10.10.1-2</bibl>); Riace A's resemblance to the portrait of Anakreon (<bibl>Richter 1965</bibl>, 75-78, figs. 291-98) is often mentioned in support of this thesis, but since <bibl n="Paus. 1.25.1">Paus. 1.25.1</bibl> fails to mention the author of the latter, this is no help. Completely different again from any of these male nudes is the Farnese Diadoumenos, regularly considered a copy of (19), but now persuasively identified as Roman neo-classic work after Polykleitos (<bibl>Zanker 1974</bibl>, 13-14).</p>

<p>Finally, the Amazon (20). While Lucian, <title>Imagines</title> 4 and 6 (<ref target="t58" n="U">T 58</ref>) tells us that she leant on her spear and praises the beauty of her features, Pliny alone records the tradition of the contest at Ephesos:</p>

The most celebrated, though born at different times, came into competition because they made Amazons. When these were dedicated in the temple of Diana at Ephesus, it was resolved to choose the most praiseworthy by vote of the artists themselves, who were present. Then it became evident that there was one which each artist judged second to his own: this was by Polyclitus, and next came that of Phidias, third Cresilas', fourth Cydon's, and fifth Phradmon's.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Among the copies, four Amazon types have regularly been associated with the contest: the Mattei (<rs key="Rome, Museo Capitolino 733" type="sculpture">Rome, Museo Capitolino 733</rs>), quiver of Mattei type (<rs key="Rome 75.2236" type="sculpture">Rome 75.2236</rs>), ancient cast of the girdle and adjacent area of the chiton of the Mattei type (<rs key="Rome 78.1854" type="sculpture">Rome 78.1854</rs>), ancient cast of the right foot of  the Mattei type (<rs key="Baiae 174.531" type="sculpture">Baiae 174.531</rs>), Sosikles (Capitoline: <rs key="Rome, Museo Capitolino 651" type="sculpture">Rome, Museo Capitolino 651</rs>; <rs key="Louvre Ma 552" type="sculpture">Louvre Ma 552</rs>), head of Sosikles type (<rs key="Rome, Palazzo dei Conservatori 1091" type="sculpture">Rome, Palazzo dei Conservatori 1091</rs>), Sciarra (a.k.a. Lansdowne: <rs key="Vatican 2252" type="sculpture">Vatican 2252</rs>; <rs key="New York 32.11.4" type="sculpture">New York 32.11.4</rs>; <rs key="Berlin 7" type="sculpture">Berlin 7</rs>), and Doria-Pamphili (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 388-96). As usual there is no consensus on who made which, though since only the Mattei actually leans on her spear, and the Sosikles conforms most strictly to the principles of Polykleitan contrapposto, many attribute these two types to Pheidias and Polykleitos respectively.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Others, however, have found Pliny's account incredible, not least because the voting procedure duplicates Herodotos' account of the Greek prize-giving after Salamis (8.123). Yet to the unprejudiced this might appear to support rather than undermine the tradition's claim to authenticity. Furthermore, the skeptics often forget that the contest has no bearing upon the <emph>fact</emph> of the dedication, which evidently came first, and which is independently corroborated by the appearance of two Amazon types on the Ephesian theater-reliefs, a replica of the Sosikles Amazon and a version of the same figure that wears a mantle over her chiton. (Compare Kanachos' Apollo at Didyma (<rs key="Berlin 1592" type="sculpture">Berlin 1592</rs>), which was also copied for the local theater: <ref target="t26 t27" n="U">T 26-7</ref> and commentary; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 167). <bibl>Hartswick 1986</bibl> plausibly identifies the mantle-bearer as a personification of Ephesos itself, increasing the probability that its prototype, the Sosikles Amazon, indeed copies Polykleitos' statue, the winner of the contest.</p>

<p>As for the rest, while the statue in the Villa Doria Pamphili is probably only a classicizing variant of the Sciarra, two heads (the pendant to the Doryphoros herm in the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum and another from Hadrian's villa at Tivoli) apparently represent a genuine fifth type. Formerly assigned to the Mattei Amazon, this actually bears little resemblance to the (admittedly schematic) head of the Mattei-type figure on a Peloponnesian relief now in Athens; furthermore, first-hand examination of the head on a third Mattei-type replica, in Petworth, strongly suggests that it is original to that statue, not a restorer's addition, as Furtwängler and others believed. Not only does its coiffure resemble the relief figure's, but its elongated facial structure and emphatic features are strikingly close to both the Palagi "Lemnia" (<rs key="Rome 62.69" type="sculpture">Rome 62.69</rs>; cf. no. 6; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 314) and the Amazons on the Piraeus copies of the Parthenos shield (<rs key="Piraeus Parthenos Shield" type="sculpture">Piraeus Parthenos Shield</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 364), closer indeed than is the "Sappho"-Ourania (cf. <bibl>Weber 1978</bibl>, <bibl>E.B. Harrison 1984</bibl>; no. 13).</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Though the Mattei type seems likely, then, to be Pheidian, and the Sosikles Polykleitan, to attribute the others is hazardous indeed. Kresilas of Kydonia in Crete (not necessarily identical with the "Ctesilaus" who "made a Doryphoros and a wounded Amazon": <title>N.H.</title> 34.75) is often given the Sciarra type, though his style is only known from the Perikles portrait (Ch. 6.3) if the copies we have indeed reproduce the statue noted by Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 34.74 and Pausanias (<ref target="t57" n="U">T 57</ref> — but omitting the sculptor). "Cydon" probably repeats Kresilas's own ethnic, a slip which may have eliminated another name (Strongylion, whose Amazon is praised by Pliny in <title>N.H.</title> 34.82?); while Phradmon of Argos is known for three other works, all lost (for one of them, see <ref target="t155" n="U">T 155</ref>).</p>

<p>The Sosikles, Mattei, and Sciarra Amazons are also represented among the Baiae plaster casts (<bibl>Landwehr 1985</bibl>, 60-76); significant departures in the handling of flesh and drapery show that, once again, faithfulness to the original took second place to the copyists' own notions of <foreign xml:lang="la">decor</foreign> and the period style of their own time. This fact alone is sufficient to gainsay current attempts to reassign two or three of the types to the fourth, second, or even first centuries B.C. (e.g. <bibl>Ridgway 1974</bibl>; <bibl>E.B. Harrison 1982b</bibl>) on the basis of fairly minor stylistic discrepancies between the copies; indeed, even Pliny (<ref target="t60" n="U">T 60</ref>) was aware that though their careers overlapped, the five sculptors represented quite different stages in the development of the art.</p>

<p>As for ancient accounts of Pheidias' style, these either lapse into unhelpful generalities or are rhetorically conceived. So although he heads the "Xenokratic" list of five exemplary bronze workers in <title>N.H.</title> 34.53-65, Pliny says only that he "first opened up the art" (34.54) and nothing else; the rhetoricians are somewhat more enlightening, though concerned not with fact but impressions:</p>

<cit xml:id="t61" n="testimonium"><bibl>Dionysios of Halikarnassos, <title>Isokrates</title> 3</bibl>

<quote><p>I think one would not be wide of the mark in comparing the oratory of Isokrates to the art of Polykleitos and Pheidias for its august, dignified, and grand style, and that of Lysias to the art of Kalamis and Kallimachos for its lightness and grace.</p></quote></cit>

<p>By the later first century A.D. these observations, no doubt Hellenistic in origin, had been further refined in order to address the differences between Pheidias and Polykleitos: <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>. Yet another critical tradition is represented by the writers on <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">phantasia</foreign> , <ref target="t53 t54" n="U">T 53-4</ref>: the two are bridged by Dio Chrysostomos' extraordinary 12th ("Olympic") oration on the Zeus, delivered from the temple porch in A.D. 97, which is too long to quote here. Finally, Pheidias plays a key role in ancient notions of the craftsman's status, as evidenced by authors from Isokrates (<bibl n="Isoc. 15. 2">Isoc. 15. 2</bibl>) to Lucian (<bibl>The Dream 9</bibl>).</p>

<p>So whereas Pheidias' standing as the greatest of Greek sculptors has not been seriously challenged since first advanced in antiquity, his personality remains elusive. His reputation was mainly based upon his extreme versatility, his technical virtuosity, and, above all, the magnificence of his cult statues (<ref target="t115" n="U">T 115</ref>); the conservative "Attic" stance of the Parthenos (<rs key="Athena Parthenos reconstruction" type="sculpture">Athena Parthenos reconstruction</rs>; and others? cf. the Medici and "Lemnian" Athenas, nos. 6, 7), with shoulders squared and one leg partially relaxed, was perhaps responsible not only for much of this "majesty" (<ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>), but also for the inaugurative role given him in the "Xenokratic" canon, before the compositionally-innovative Polykleitos (<ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref>) and still more adventurous Myron (<ref target="t43" n="U">T 43</ref>). Yet the Amazon and Niobid reliefs show a quite different side of his art, daring, experimental, but still lucid as none other. Modern observers (e.g. <bibl>Richter 1951</bibl>, 7-14) often seem baffled by this seeming contradiction; perhaps, though, it is no contradiction at all, but merely a matter of supreme sensitivity to genre on the part of a sculptor whose address — and consequent appeal — was quite simply universal.</p>

<div type="section" n="3"><head>Polykleitos of Argos</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Polykleitos</persName></head>

<p>Polykleitos both signs as an Argive and is named as such by all except Pliny; here he is placed second (after Pheidias and before Myron) in the "Xenokratic" catalogue of leading bronze workers:</p>

<cit xml:id="t62" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 34.55-6</bibl>

<quote><p>Polyclitus of Sicyon, a pupil of Hageladas, made a "Diadoumenus", a supple youth, famous for having cost 100 talents, and a "Doryphorus", a virile-looking boy. He also made a statue that artists call the "Canon", and from which they derive the principles of their art, as if from a law of some kind, and he alone of men is deemed to have rendered art itself in a work of art. He also made a man scraping himself with a strigil, a nude stepping on a knucklebone, and two boys, also nude, playing with knuckle-bones; these are called the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">astragalizontes</foreign> and are in the emperor Titus's atrium — a work which, some claim, has no rivals in perfection. He also made a Mercury that was once at Lysimachea, a Hercules now in Rome, a commander taking up arms, and Artemon, called the Man in the Litter. He is deemed to have perfected this science and to have refined the art of metalwork, just as Phidias had revealed its possibilities. It was strictly his invention to have his statues throw their weight onto one leg, though Varro says that they are foursquare and all virtually stereotyped.</p></quote></cit>

<p>The change of ethnic looks like a clear case of pro-Sikyonian bias from a time when Sikyon had largely usurped Argos's leading role in Peloponnesian bronze work, and in turn helps to confirm Xenokrates, an adherent of the Sikyonian school, as the ultimate source for Pliny's account, which culminates with Lysippos' own work in Chs. 61-5 (<ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>).</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Close reading reveals more inconsistencies. Supposedly (with Myron and Pheidias) a pupil of Hageladas (cf. <ref target="t25" n="U">T 25</ref>), he nevertheless seems to have worked almost to the century's end, if he really made the Argive Hera (<ref target="t63 t64" n="U">T 63-4</ref>, <ref target="t87" n="U">87</ref>, etc.) as antiquity unanimously believed: the old temple burned in 423 (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.133">Thuc. 4.133</bibl>), the new was completed ca. 400 (Ch. 14.2). Noting that Pliny ignores this statue entirely while elsewhere recording a <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> (420-417: <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>) that neatly coincides with its presumed date, Ridgway (1981a, 201) and others have preferred to attribute this statue to Polykleitos II, apparently active ca. 405-350. Yet in <ref target="t87" n="U">T 87</ref> Pausanias emphatically distinguishes the Hera's author from the younger Polykleitos, "pupil of Naukydes", and the whole problem vanishes if one accepts that Pliny drew <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref> and <ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref> from different sources, and that Xenokrates was not interested in chryselephantine but bronze.</p>

<p>If the Hera, his only venture outside bronze, marks the climax of Polykleitos' work, his early career remains extremely problematic. Though <bibl n="Paus. 6.4.11">Paus. 6.4.11</bibl> attributes a statue of the boy-boxer Kyniskos at Olympia to him, its base (datable epigraphically to ca. 470-450) is unsigned; Kyniskos triumphed either in 464 or 460 (<bibl>Moretti 1957</bibl>, no. 265, cf. 256), so if the attribution holds, this must be a very early work. The "Westmacott boy" in London (<rs key="London 1754" type="sculpture">London 1754</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 386-87) seems to match the footprints on this base and could — just — be this early, though most now prefer to place it in the 420s or later; see also Berger 1978 for a completely different identification. Of the statues Pliny mentions, the Doryphoros (<rs key="Naples, Museo Nazionale Archaeologico 6146" type="sculpture">Naples, Museo Nazionale Archaeologico 6146</rs>) and Diadoumenos (<rs key="Athens, NM 1826" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 1826</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 378-85) are usually dated to the 440s and 420s, respectively, the Amazon (<rs key="Rome, Museo Capitolino 651" type="sculpture">Rome, Museo Capitolino 651</rs>; <ref target="t60" n="U">T 60</ref>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 388) to ca. 430.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>All in all, a career lasting from the 450s to ca. 410 seems not incredible; he was probably dead or retired by 405, when Lysander commissioned his pupils to make his great victory monument at Delphi (<ref target="t85" n="U">T 85</ref>). One of them, Antiphanes, already belonged to the school's second generation (<bibl n="Paus. 5.17.3">Paus. 5.17.3-4</bibl>). Plato's note that his sons — both nonentities! — were youths in 433 and contemporaries of Perikles' children (<title>Protagoras</title> 328C; cf. Guthrie 1975, 214-15) may point the same way; the latter were apparently born before 450. At any rate, Donnay's decisively lower chronology (1965, 462: birth of Polykleitos ca. 460, activity ca. 435-395) seems untenable.</p>

<p>Pausanias describes the Heraion at length, while Strabo compares the Hera with Pheidias' chryselephantine work:</p>

<cit xml:id="t63" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 2.17">Pausanias 2.17</bibl>

<quote><p>They say the architect was Eupolemos, an Argive; concerning the sculptures carved above the columns, some refer to the birth of Zeus and the battle of the gods and giants, others to the Trojan War and the sack of Troy .... The statue of Hera sits on a throne and is huge; made of gold and ivory, it is the work of Polykleitos. She wears a crown with Graces and Seasons worked in relief, and in one hand carries a pomegranate, in the other a scepter. About the pomegranate I must say nothing, for its story may not be told, but concerning the cuckoo that sits on the scepter they say that Zeus, when he was in love with the virgin Hera, turned himself into this bird, and she caught it to be her pet. This and other similar tales about the gods I relate without believing them, but relate them nevertheless. By Hera's side stands what is said to be an image of Hebe, by Naukydes, of ivory and gold also, and by its side is an ancient image of Hera on a column. This, the oldest image of her, is made of wild pear-wood, and was dedicated at Tiryns by Peirasos son of Argos, but when the Argives destroyed Tiryns they carried it off to the Heraion; I saw it myself, a small, seated image.</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p>In this temple are <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">xoana</foreign> made by Polykleitos, in execution the most beautiful in the world, but in costliness and size inferior to those of Pheidias.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Indeed, unlike the Zeus, the Hera has left no secure copies at all. Though Dionysios of Halikarnassos (<ref target="t61" n="U">T 61</ref>) praises Pheidias and Polykleitos equally, that the judgment of <ref target="t64" n="U">T 64</ref> was generally accepted in antiquity is shown by Quintilian's more sophisticated version of it in <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>, and by the vastly greater attention paid to the Zeus by Greek and Latin authors generally.</p>

<p>In fact, Polykleitos' statues of gods or <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">agalmata</foreign> were apparently as neglected by the copyists as were Pheidias' statues of mortals (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">andrianta</foreign>; the special case of the Amazon apart), though this did not prevent occasional attempts to furnish his figures with divine attributes: cf. <bibl>Fleischer 1978</bibl>; <bibl>Wrede 1981</bibl>, 30, 276, 279. Clearly, in Roman eyes Pheidias the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">agalmatopoios</foreign> and Polykleitos the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">andriantopoios</foreign> (<ref target="t115" n="U">T 115</ref>) were each supreme in their own specialty, and that was that. The germ of this judgment is even recognizable in Aristotle:</p>

<cit xml:id="t65" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1141a">Aristotle, <title>Nicomachean Ethics</title> 6.7, 1141a9-13</bibl>

<quote><p>The term <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">sophia</foreign> is employed in the crafts to denote those men who are the most perfect masters of their craft, like Pheidias in stone-carving and Polykleitos in making statues of men (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">andriantopoia</foreign>).</p></quote></cit>

<p>As for his other works, copies have been recognized of (3), (5)-(9), and (13), with varying degrees of plausibility; once again, Roman adaptations, lost attributes, and the stereotypical tendencies of the canon itself (<ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref>) confuse the issue for all but the Doryphoros (<rs key="Naples, Museo Nazionale Archaeologico 6146" type="sculpture">Naples, Museo Nazionale Archaeologico 6146</rs>) and Diadoumenos (<rs key="Athens, NM 1826" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 1826</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 378-85), though even their exact identities remain uncertain. Casts of the (Sosikles) Amazon, the Westmacott Boy (cf. 9), and perhaps the Doryphoros have been identified among the finds at Baiae: <bibl>Landwehr 1985</bibl>, 70-76, 94-100, 177; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 387. As for the rest, (11) and (12) are problematic, not least because Pliny's meaning is unclear (cf. Berger 1978), while (13) may be Theseus finding the tokens or <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">gnorismata</foreign> left under a rock at Troezen. No. 14 looks suspiciously like law-court hyperbole (<bibl n="Cic. Ver. 2.4.5">Cicero, <title>In Verrem</title> 4.3.5</bibl>; in the same local private collection with works supposedly by Myron and Praxiteles!); perhaps all three were high-class copies. Finally, (15) may be Perikles' engineer Artemon; decidedly alien to the rest of Polykleitos' oeuvre, it too remains a puzzle.</p>

<p>The canon itself — surely identical with the Doryphoros (cf. esp. <bibl>Linfert 1982</bibl>, 60 n. 22) — has inspired many attempts at reconstruction, some of which are critiqued in <bibl>Stewart 1978b</bibl>. Ironically, the most original and (to my mind) convincing attempt is still unpublished (<bibl>Leftwich 1987</bibl>), so is almost completely unknown to the scholarly community at large. Adducing nine hitherto-overlooked citations of the canon in Galen, Leftwich shows both that it was probably based upon recent advances in medicine and science: the contemporary Hippokratic principle of <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">isonomia</foreign> or 'equilibrium', and the ratios established by Pythagoras for the perfect intervals of the musical scale (so <bibl>Stewart 1978b</bibl>, 130-31), namely, 1:2 (octave), 2:3 (fifth), and 3:4 (fourth).</p>

<quote><p>Many, though, have begun the construction of weapons of the same size, and have made use of the same system of rules, the same types of wood, and the same amounts of iron, and have kept to the same weight, yet of these some have made machines that throw their missiles far and with great force, while those made by others have lagged behind their specifications. When asked why this happened, the latter have been at a loss for an answer. So it is appropriate to warn the prospective engineer of the saying of Polykleitos the sculptor: perfection, he said, comes about little by little [<title>para mikron</title>] through many numbers. And in the same way, as far as concerns our science, it happens that in many of the items that go to make up the machine a tiny deviation is made each time, resulting in a large cumulative error.</p></quote></cit>

<p>The range of <ref target="t65 t66 t67 t68 t69 t70 t71" n="U">T 65-71</ref>, encompassing six centuries, five literary genres, and two cultures, is revealing: like that of Pheidias, Polykleitos's achievement swiftly entered the consciousness of both the literary élite and its wider audience, becoming a handy simile, even a cliché, to be deployed as appropriate. And also like Pheidias, he appears constantly in ancient discussions of the artist's status, from <ref target="t65" n="U">T 65</ref> to Lucian's <title>Dream</title>.

<div type="section" n="1"><head>Attic Sculptors in the Peloponnesian War</head>

<p>Among the numerous sculptors active in or based upon Athens in the later fifth century, the sources explicitly name four as pupils of Pheidias and <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">agalmatopoioi</foreign> (makers of divinities) par excellence: Alkamenes, Agorakritos, Kolotes, and Theokosmas. By common consent (cf. <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>) the greatest of these was Alkamenes:</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Alkamenes of Athens/Lemnos</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Alkamenes</persName></head>

<p>The <title>Souda</title> (q.v.) calls Alkamenes a Lemnian, so he was perhaps born or (more likely) raised in the Athenian colony (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">cleruchy</foreign>) established on the island around 450. The sources often mention him in the same breath with Pheidias (cf. <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>, 4), which may account for the somewhat early <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign>  of 448-445 assigned him by <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>. At any rate, he was still active in or after 403, when he made a colossal relief to celebrate the expulsion of the pro-Spartan puppet oligarchy from Athens (no. 9, below). His Hephaistos at Athens (work no. 6), if identical with that exhibited in the Hephaisteion and apparently recorded in <title>IG</title> 13 nos. 370-1, can be dated by the archons named on the stone to 421/20 -416/5. His early career is obscure, but he presumably served his apprenticeship either on the Parthenon or on the Zeus; if the former, he may have followed Pheidias to Olympia in 438/7 or stayed to complete the pediments.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Like Pheidias, Alkamenes worked in chryselephantine, bronze, and marble, and tackled a similar range of subjects:</p>

</list>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>In addition, Pliny (<ref target="t76" n="U">T 76</ref>) records a victory over Agorakritos, gained because the Athenians preferred a citizen to a foreigner; the subject was supposedly an Aphrodite (cf. no. 1). A second such competition, between him and Pheidias, is recorded in Byzantine sources (Tzetzes, <title>Chiliades</title> 340-369), but seems purely anecdotal. Finally:</p>

<cit xml:id="t72" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 1.24.3">Pausanias 1.24.3</bibl>

<quote><p>[On the Athenian Akropolis] there is Prokne too, who has already made up her mind about the boy, and Itys too, a group dedicated by Alkamenes.</p></quote></cit>

<p>This is usually identified with a marble group found on the Akropolis: <rs key="Athens, Acropolis 1358" type="sculpture">Athens, Acropolis 1358</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 399. Prokne's head, however, does not join the body break-on-break, and may not belong.</p>

<p>Despite Alkamenes' high reputation, modern scholarship has encountered problems with every one of the types regularly attributed to him in copy. Thus the two archaistic works (3 and 7) each survive in two versions; while the Hekate (3: <bibl n="Paus. 2.30.2">Paus. 2.30.2</bibl>) may be represented most faithfully by a headless statuette in the British School at Athens, the Hermes is attested by inscribed replicas from Pergamon (<rs key="Istanbul, Archaeological Museum 527" type="sculpture">Istanbul, Archaeological Museum 527</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 400) and Ephesos that both claim to be authentic but nevertheless differ markedly from each other:</p>

<cit xml:id="t73" n="testimonium"><bibl><title>JdI</title> 82: 40</bibl>

<quote><lg type="couplet"><l>Here you see Alkamenes' most beautiful image,</l>
<l>The Hermes before the Gates; Pergamios dedicated it.</l></lg><lg>
<l>I'm not just anyone's work; my form,</l>
<l>If you'll look closely, was wrought by Alkamenes.</l></lg></quote></cit>

<p>Recent scholarship (e.g. <bibl>Willers 1967</bibl>) has tended to regard the Pergamene type as a classicizing variant. Less unanimity exists concerning his most famous creation, the Aphrodite in the Gardens (1), mentioned by both Pliny and Pausanias (<bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.16">Pliny 36.16</bibl>; <bibl n="Paus. 1.19.2">Paus. 1.19.2</bibl>) but only described by Lucian (<ref target="t58" n="U">T 58</ref>). Even before Delivorrias' publication of the version from Daphni (<bibl>Delivorrias 1968</bibl>) most identified her with the so-called Leaning Aphrodite type, but once more the statue exists in several recensions, both veiled and unveiled. The debate continues.</p>

<p>As for the male cult-images, the Ares (4) is often recognized in the so-called Borghese Ares, though <bibl>Bruneau 1982</bibl> exposes the attribution as totally gratuitous; fragments of a high-relief frieze found around the temple are often ascribed to the base of this cult statue, and at times indeed resemble the Prokne in style, though both their original location and subject-matter remain unclear. The Hephaistos (6) is described by Cicero, <title>de natura Deorum</title> 1.30, 83 and, more fully, by Valerius Maximus:</p>

<cit xml:id="t74" n="testimonium"><bibl>Valerius Maximus 8.11 ext. 3</bibl>

<quote><p>Visitors at Athens are impressed by the Vulcan made by the hands of Alkamenes; besides the other conspicuous signs of his supreme art, there is one thing in particular that they admire — the god's lameness is masked. He stands there displaying a trace of it unobtrusively beneath his garment, so that this is no blemish that could be censured, but a definite and personal characteristic of the god, becomingly represented.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Since Athens boasted only one cult image of Hephaistos, the following passage of Pausanias is usually taken to refer to the same statue, and the temple in question is identified with the so-called "Theseion" in the Agora.</p>

<cit xml:id="t75" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 1.14.6">Pausanias 1.14.6</bibl>

<quote><p>Above the Kerameikos and the so-called Royal Stoa is a temple of Hephaistos. I was not surprised that a statue of Athena stands beside him because I knew the story about Erichthonios. But when I saw that the image of Athena had blue eyes I found out that the legend about them is Libyan. For they have a saying that she is the daughter of Poseidon and Lake Tritonis, and so has blue eyes like Poseidon.</p></quote></cit>

<p>A marble torso in Athens and a head in the Vatican, both copies, were associated with this statue by <bibl>Karouzou 1954/5</bibl>, working from representations on Roman-period lamps; since <title>IG</title> 13 nos. 370-1, probably the accounts for the group, also mentions an <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">anthemon</foreign> or "floral", she also resurrected the nineteenth-century identification of an Athena from Cherchel, which has a floral against her left leg, as the Athena Hephaistia.</p>

<p>Against this, <bibl>E.B. Harrison 1977a</bibl> has argued that so much metal was budgeted for the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">anthemon</foreign> that it had to be enormous, that Neo-Attic reliefs (stylistically related to the "Ares" frieze and the Prokne) showing Erichthonios's birth (<ref target="t75" n="U">T 75</ref>) demanded a high, wide base, and that the "Cherchel" Athena type is early fourth century. For it she substitutes the colossal "Velletri" type and hangs the Rondanini Medusa (<rs key="Munich 252" type="sculpture">Munich 252</rs>; cf. <bibl>Belson 1980</bibl> and <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 783) on the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">anthemon</foreign> . Since this whole ensemble is too large for the "Theseion", she prefers to call this building the temple of Artemis Eukleia and identifies the "real" Hephaisteion with the large Hellenistic foundation to the North on the same hill.</p>

<p>This thesis has met with considerable skepticism, not least because the Velletri Athena does not resemble the Prokne, and the "Theseion" is roughly where Pausanias tells us that the Hephaisteion should be, while he places Artemis Eukleia at the opposite corner of the Agora (<bibl n="Paus. 1.14.4">Paus. 1.14.4-5</bibl>); but see now <bibl>Mansfield 1985</bibl>, 361-65 for additional arguments against the traditional view.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>His archaistic work apart, then, Alkamenes remains an enigma, though this very aspect of this output, together with the later tendency to pair him with Pheidias (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>, 3) has suggested to some a conservative sculptor, perhaps ministering to traditionalists among the wartime Athenians. The Prokne's style, so close to some sections of the Parthenon frieze, might support this if only we could be sure that he carved it, though the democrats' relief (no. 9) hints at an altogether less straightforward situation. Indeed, since both the political implications (if any) of stylistic choice and the artistic preferences (if any) of the ever-volatile demos remain obscure in the extreme (cf. <ref target="t76" n="U">T 76</ref>), such neat equations may hinder understanding rather than advance it.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Agorakritos of Paros</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Agorakritos</persName></head>

<p>No absolute dates are available for Agorakritos, but his career evidently coincided roughly with Alkamenes'. Furthermore, only three works of his are recorded in the sources, as follows:</p>

<list type="simple">
<item n="1"><rs type="work">Nemesis at Rhamnous in Attica, of Parian marble (<ref target="t76 t77 t78" n="U">T 76-8</ref>)</rs></item>
<item n="2"><rs type="work">Mother of the Gods, in the Metroon at Athens, of marble</rs></item>
<item n="3"><rs type="work">Athena Itonia and Zeus/Hades at Koroneia in Boiotia, of bronze</rs></item>
</list>

<p>Of these, the first two were regularly attributed to Pheidias. Pliny attempts to explain why:</p>

<cit xml:id="t76" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 36.16-17</bibl>

<quote><p>Another of [Phidias'] pupils was Agoracritus of Paros, who pleased him also because of his youth and beauty, so that Phidias is said to have allowed him to put his name to several of his, the master's, own works. In any case, the two pupils [Alcamenes and Agoracritus] competed with each other in making a Venus, and Alcamenes won the contest not through superior skill but through the votes of the citizenry, who favored one of their own against a foreigner. So Agoracritus is said to have sold his statue on condition that it should not remain in Athens, and that it should be named "Nemesis". It was set up at Rhamnus, a deme of Attica, and Marcus Varro preferred it above all other statues.</p></quote></cit>

<p>This passage is richer and more revealing of the strengths and weaknesses of Greek and Roman connoisseurship than first appears, though only with Despinis's' recent rediscovery of the statue's fragments (<bibl>Despinis1971</bibl>) has its full significance become clear. To help demonstrate this, two second-century A.D. accounts of the piece (much renowned in antiquity) must be quoted first:</p>

<cit xml:id="t77" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 1.33">Pausanias 1.33</bibl>

<quote><p>About 60 stades from Marathon as you go along the coast-road to Oropos is Rhamnous. The inhabitants live by the sea, but a little way inland is the sanctuary of Nemesis, the most implacable of the gods towards <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">hybristai</foreign> . It seems that the wrath of this goddess descended upon the barbarians who landed at Marathon [490]; for thinking in their pride that no obstacle stood in the way of their taking Athens, they brought a piece of Parian marble to make a trophy, as if their task were already finished. It was this stone that Pheidias made into a statue of Nemesis; on her head she wears a crown with deer and some small images of Nike; in her left hand she holds an apple branch, and in her right an offering dish, embellished with Ethiopians. [Pausanias now expresses puzzlement over their presence, noting that they dwell "near Ocean" at the ends of the earth, and remarks upon Ethiopian geography.] I must now resume. Neither this nor any of the old statues of Nemesis have wings, not even the holiest <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">xoana</foreign> of the Smyrnaeans, but later artists, maintaining that the goddess is wont to appear most of all after a love-affair, gave wings to Nemesis as they do to Eros. Now I will describe the scene on the base of the image, having made this preface for clarity's sake. The Greeks say that Nemesis was the mother of Helen, but that Leda suckled and nursed her; as to Helen's father, the Greeks like everyone else think it was Zeus, not Tyndareus. Having heard this legend Pheidias represented Helen being led to Nemesis by Leda, Tyndareus and his children, and a man called Hippeus standing by with a horse. There are Agamemnon, Menelaos, and Pyrrhos the son of Achilles and first husband of Helen's daughter Hermione. Orestes was omitted because of his crimes against his mother, yet Hermione stood by him through it all and even bore him a child. Next on the base is a man called Epochos and another youth; all I heard about them was that they were the brothers of Oinoe, from whom the name of the deme comes.</p></quote></cit>

<cit xml:id="t78" n="testimonium"><bibl>Zenobios 5.82</bibl>

<quote><p>The Nemesis at Rhamnous. In Rhamnous there stands an image of Nemesis, ten cubits [15 feet] in height, stone throughout, the work of Pheidias; she holds an apple branch in her hand. Antigonos of Karystos claims that a little tablet hangs from this, and is inscribed as follows: "Agorakritos of Paros made [me]." Yet this is no wonder, for many others have inscribed someone else's name upon their own work. It is likely that Pheidias conceded this to Agorakritos because he was his lover, and was generally much excited over boys.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Antigonos' careful epigraphical researches (<ref target="t78" n="U">T 78</ref>), accepted by Varro and then Pliny (<ref target="t76" n="U">T 76</ref>) must have been undertaken to counter the very tendency to give works by Pheidias' pupils to the master himself that surfaces in Pausanias (<ref target="t77" n="U">T 77</ref>) and a host of other writers besides: see above, "Pheidias" nos. 24-30. The fact that even the normally acute Pausanias made this mistake only reinforces one's suspicion about such attributions in general (<ref target="t4" n="U">T 4</ref>).</p>

<p>The feeble rebuttal of Antigonos' conclusions in the last sentence of <ref target="t78" n="U">T 78</ref> may derive from the antiquary Polemon of Ilion, who wrote a six-book polemic against him around 130 B.C. The story that Pheidias was Agorakritos' lover was either invented by Polemon or (perhaps more likely) was already current, and he simply recognized its utility as ammunition for his feud. Typically, Varro's synthesis of the two authors was evidently accepted wholesale by the uncritical Pliny, who cites neither Antigonos nor Polemon in his source-list for book 36 (<title>N.H.</title> 1.36) but in <ref target="t76" n="U">T 76</ref> repeats the gist of the rebuttal in his first sentence.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>What then of the contest in <ref target="t76" n="U">T 76</ref> and the claim that the Nemesis was originally an Aphrodite? To begin with the later point, <bibl>Wilamowitz-Moellendorf 1881</bibl>, 11 was the first to realize that this story was coined to explain the fact that Agorakritos' statue differed from the winged type in use by the Hellenistic period (cf. <ref target="t77" n="U">T 77</ref>, with an even wilder account of the statue's origins); indeed, not only did the sculptor employ the same generic schema used for Aphrodite, Kore, and other goddesses in the fifth century, but Nemesis' apple branch was also an attribute of Aphrodite. Antigonos, an iconographical specialist too (<ref target="t19" n="U">T 19</ref>, etc.) thereby becomes this anecdote's probable source as well.</p>

<p>As for the contest, though any such event would have involved maquettes (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">paradeigmata</foreign>), not finished statues, Paionios' inscription on his Nike (<ref target="t81" n="U">T 81</ref>) certifies that sculptors' competitions <emph>were</emph> held in the fifth century. This leaves two possibilities: either that the contest is basically historical, and only its association with the supposed "Venus"/Nemesis was Antigonos' doing, or that he actually invented the entire affair, perhaps working up a tradition of rivalry between the two star pupils, in order to explain the statue's otherwise puzzling iconography. The first seems altogether more credible, for while Antigonos was certainly apt to rationalize, outright fabrication seems alien to his personality, at least as reconstructed by Wilamowitz and others (cf. <bibl>Jex-Blake 1896</bibl>, xxxvi-xlv).</p>

<p>Also accepting the story's basic historicity, <bibl>Schlörb 1964</bibl>, 14-15 further suggests that it reflects a supposed <emph>political</emph> (as well as stylistic) polarization among Pheidias' followers, whereby Alkamenes aligned himself with Athenian "conservatives" and Agorakritos with "radicals". Yet as argued concerning Alkamenes (see above) this not only oversimplifies the politics but also finds no clear support in the testimonia; indeed Pliny explicitly attributes Agorakritos' defeat to chauvinism, not to politics.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>As to the Nemesis herself (<rs key="Copenhagen, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek 304a" type="sculpture">Copenhagen, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek 304a</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 403-07), the base is not yet fully reconstructed (relief with figures excerpted from the base of the Nemesis: <rs key="Stockholm, Nationalmuseum Sk 150" type="sculpture">Stockholm, Nationalmuseum Sk 150</rs>), and new fragments are appearing occasionally in the excavations: fragment from right side of the chiton overfold of the Nemesis (<rs key="Athens, NM" type="sculpture">Athens, NM</rs>), corresponding area of another reduced copy of the Nemesis (<rs key="Athens, NM 3949" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 3949</rs>). Preliminary reports (<bibl>B. Petrakos 1981</bibl>, <bibl>V. Petrakos 1986</bibl>) suggest that at the least, Pausanias' account is incomplete; see <bibl>Shapiro-Lapatin 1992</bibl> for a thorough discussion and convincing reinterpretation of the iconography. <bibl>Despinis 1971</bibl> dates the statue to ca. 430, the base ten years later, though the rather small discrepancies between them may reflect differences in quality rather than chronology. The drapery style is certainly novel, but Pausanias' acceptance of Pheidias as author (<ref target="t77" n="U">T 77</ref>) should be a further caution against labeling Agorakritos a "radical", rebelling against Pheidian and Alkamenean "orthodoxy".</p>

<p>As for his other works, (2) is represented by numerous statuettes presumably intended for private cult, while the recovery of the Nemesis has prompted Despinis to make other attributions: the Dresden Zeus and Hope Athena (3?), the so-called Borghese Hera (probably another Aphrodite), the Doria-Pamphili Aphrodite, the figures K, L, and M from the east pediment of the Parthenon (<rs key="London 303" type="sculpture">London 303</rs>; <rs key="Parthenon East Pediment" type="sculpture">Parthenon East Pediment</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 350-52), the slabs of the Nike temple parapet attributed by Carpenter to Master A, and so on. Some are closer than others, but given the number of good sculptors active in Athens at the time, and the amount of cross-fertilization that evidently occurred (cf. <bibl>Ridgway 1981</bibl>, 176-7) such a search is unlikely ever to be conclusive.</p>

<p>As for Pheidias' two other pupils, Kolotes collaborated on the Zeus (Pliny <title>N.H.</title> 34.87) and continued to work in Elis (see "Pheidias", no. 26) while Theokosmas is only notable for Pausanias' useful description of his Zeus at Megara, left unfinished in 431:</p>

<cit xml:id="t79" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 1.40.4">Pausanias 1.40.4</bibl>

<quote><p>After this when you have entered the precinct of Zeus called the Olympeion you see a noteworthy temple. But the image of Zeus was not finished, for the work was interrupted by the war of the Peloponnesians against the Athenians, in which the Athenians ravaged the land of the Megarians every year with a fleet and an army, damaging public revenues and pushing private families to dire distress. The face of the image of Zeus is of ivory and gold, but the rest is of clay and gypsum. The artist is said to have been Theokosmas, a native, helped by Pheidias. Above the head of Zeus are the Seasons and the Fates, and all may see that he is the only god obeyed by Destiny, and that he apportions the seasons as necessary. Behind the temple lie half-finished blocks of wood, which Theokosmas intended to overlay with ivory and gold in order to complete the image of Zeus.</p></quote></cit>

<p>By ca. 400, Theokosmas was working with the Polykleitan school on Lysander's great victory monument at Delphi: <ref target="t85" n="U">T 85</ref>.</p>

<p>Independents are more numerous, though few can have escaped some Pheidian influence: the texts name several non-Athenians, and the Erechtheion accounts add a mass of carvers almost completely overlooked in the literary tradition:</p>

<quote><p>The Dorian Messenians who at one time received Naupaktos from the Athenians dedicated at Olympia the image of Nike on a pillar. It is the work of Paionios of Mende, made from spoils taken from the enemy, I think from the war with the Akarnanians and the people of Oiniadai [452]. The Messenians themselves say than their dedication resulted from their exploit on the island of Sphakteria along with the Athenians [425], and that they did not inscribe the name of the enemy through fear of the Spartans, whereas they had no fear at all of the people of Oiniadai and Akarnania.</p></quote></cit>

<p>His nationality and patronymic are unrecorded; his known works are:</p>

<list type="simple">
<item n="1"><rs type="work">"Bridal" Hera at Plataia</rs></item>
<item n="2"><rs type="work">"Laconian Dancers", in bronze (<ref target="t83" n="U">T 83</ref>)</rs></item>

<item n="4"><rs type="work">The first Corinthian capital, at Corinth, in marble</rs></item>
</list>

<p>The temple of Hera at Plataia (1) was built just after 427 (<bibl n="Thuc. 3.68">Thuc. 3.68</bibl>; cf. <bibl n="Paus. 9.2.7">Paus. 9.2.7</bibl>), and (3) cannot have been made before the Erechtheion received its roof and interior fittings in ca. 409-406; so he was an exact contemporary of Alkamenes and Agorakritos.</p>

<p>A virtuoso carver and metal-smith, he was notorious in antiquity for his extremely finicky technique:</p>

<cit xml:id="t83" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 34.92</bibl>

<quote><p>Of all sculptors, though, Callimachus is the most remarkable for his surname: he always deprecated his own work, and made no end of attention to detail, so that he was called the Niggler (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">katatexitechnos</foreign>), a memorable example of the need to limit meticulousness. He made the Laconian Women Dancing, a flawless work, but one in which meticulousness has taken away all charm. He is said also to have been a painter.</p></quote></cit>

<p>The meaning of <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">katatexitechnos</foreign> , though generally clear from the text, is secured by Dionysios of Halikarnassos, <title>Demosthenes</title> 51, where sculptors and painters obsessed with petty details are said to "fritter away" (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">katatekein</foreign>) their art. The charge is repeated by Vitruvius 4.1.10 and garbled by Pausanias:</p>

<cit xml:id="t84" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 1.26.7">Pausanias 1.26.7</bibl>

<quote><p>Kallimachos made the golden lamp for the goddess [Athena in the Erechtheion on the Akropolis] . . . and though he was inferior to the foremost practitioners of the art, he was nevertheless cleverer than all, so that he became the first to drill stone and so named himself <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">katatexitechnos</foreign> , unless others did so and he adopted it for his own.</p></quote></cit>

<p>For Kallimachos' innovations with the drill see <bibl>Stewart 1975</bibl>. In <ref target="t61" n="U">T 61</ref>, however, Dionysios strikes a more positive note, in words remarkably similar to Vitruvius': since the two were contemporaries, they presumably drew on a common (Hellenistic?) source that valued such refinement and took it as support for similar trends in rhetoric: cf. <bibl>Pollitt 1974</bibl>, 364-65.</p>

<p>What little we know of his style broadly supports the testimonia: though the Hera is lost, and the lamp and prototype Corinthian capital (<bibl n="Vitr. 4.1.10">Vitruvius 4.1.10</bibl>) are only vaguely to be imagined from later developments in these genres, his "Laconian Dancers" (2) have been recognized in a series of Neo-Attic reliefs. Extremely refined in both posture and drapery, they seem typical of late fifth century Attic mannerism. The stylistic judgments of Dionysios (<ref target="t61" n="U">T 61</ref>), Pliny (<ref target="t83" n="U">T 83</ref>) and the rest have also prompted further attributions, including the work of Master "A" from the Nike temple parapet (<rs key="Athens, Acropolis 973" type="sculpture">Athens, Acropolis 973</rs>). Others prefer Master "E", the "Genetrix" Aphrodite (<rs key="Louvre MA 525" type="sculpture">Louvre MA 525</rs>), and the Neo-Attic Maenad reliefs (<rs key="Rome, Palazzo dei Conservatori 1094" type="sculpture">Rome, Palazzo dei Conservatori 1094</rs>; <rs key="Madrid, Prado 42" type="sculpture">Madrid, Prado 42</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 420, 426, 436-37). This relatively compact group may indeed originate in the same workshop, though its extreme purity of line distances it somewhat both from the crosscut, finicky treatment of the Dancers and maybe also from Pliny's criticisms.</p>

<cit xml:id="t85" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 10.9.7">Pausanias 10.9.7</bibl>

<quote><p>Opposite [the Tegean dedication] are the Spartan offerings from the spoils of their victory over the Athenians: the Dioskouroi, Zeus, Apollo, Artemis, and beside these Poseidon, Lysander son of Aristokritos (who is being crowned by Poseidon), Agias, who was Lysander's soothsayer at the time, and Hermon the pilot of Lysander's ship. This statue of Hermon was made, as one might expect, by Thekosmas of Megara because Hermon had been enrolled as citizen of that city. The Dioskouroi were made by Antiphanes of Argos, the soothsayer by Pison from Kalaureia, which belongs to Troezen. As for Athenodoros and Dameas, the latter made the Poseidon, Artemis, and Lysander, while Athenodoros made the Apollo and Zeus. These two were Arkadians from Kleitor.
</p>
<p>Behind the works just described are statues of those who, whether Spartans or Spartan allies, assisted Lysander at Aigospotamoi [405]. These are Arakos and Erianthes, the first a Spartan, Erianthes a Boiotian . . . [lacuna] . . . above Mimas, whence came Astykrates; Kephisokles, Hermophantos, and Hikesios of Chios, Timarchos and Diagoras of Rhodes, Theodamos of Knidos, Kimmerios of Ephesos, and Aiantides of Miletos. Tisander made these, but the next were made by Alypos of Sikyon: Theopompos of Myndos, Kleomedes of Samos, the two Euboians Aristokles of Karystos and Antonomos of Eretria, Aristophantos of Corinth, Apollodoros of Troezen, and Dion from Epidauros in the Argolid. Next to these come Axionikos, an Achaian from Pellene, Theares from Hermione, Phyrrias of Phokia, Komon of Megara, Agasimenes of Sikyon, Telykrates of Leukas, Pythodotos of Corinth, and Euantidas of Ambrakia; last come the Spartans Epikydidas and Eteonikos. They say that these are the works of Patrokles and Kanachos.
</p>
<p>The Athenians refuse to admit that they were fairly beaten at Aigospotamoi . . ..</p></quote></cit>

<p>Some of the bases of these statues are extant. Another dedication, of tripods with statues beneath, was put up at Amyklai; this joined earlier votives from the Messenian wars, the work of Gitiadas of Sparta (commentary to <ref target="t24" n="U">T 24</ref>), another by Kalon of Aegina, and Bathykles' throne (<ref target="t23" n="U">T 23</ref>):</p>

<cit xml:id="t86" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 3.18.8">Pausanias 3.18.8</bibl>

<quote><p>The older tripods are said to be a tithe of the Messenian War. Under the first stood an image of Aphrodite, and under the second an Artemis; these and the reliefs [on the tripods] are by Gitiadas, but the third is by Kallon of Aigina; Kore, daughter of Demeter, stands under it. Aristandros of Paros and Polykleitos of Argos made, respectively, the woman with the lyre, supposedly Sparta, and the Aphrodite "beside the Amyklaian." These tripods are larger than the others, and were dedicated from the spoils of the victory at Aigospotamoi.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Aristandros was probably Skopas' father (see <ref target="t112 t113 t114 t115" n="U">T 112-15</ref>, below), and Polykleitos is probably not the school's founder but his younger namesake (cf. <ref target="t87" n="U">T 87</ref>), who was still active around 350, making victor-statues and cult images (for Megalopolis, founded in 369: <bibl n="Paus. 8.31.4">Paus. 8.31.4</bibl>), and perhaps also designing the tholos and theater at Epidauros (<bibl n="Paus. 2.27.5">Paus. 2.27.5</bibl>). This Polykleitos apparently belonged to a semi-independent branch of the School, whose filial and master-pupil relationships are extremely complicated: cf. <bibl>Arnold 1969</bibl>, 6-17; Linfert, in <bibl>Beck 1990</bibl>, 240-43. Aside from him, the other important names are his two brothers Naukydes and Daidalos, and Antiphanes' pupil Kleon of Sikyon (<ref target="t93" n="U">T 93</ref>), all of whose careers extended at least into the second quarter of the fourth century, and Kleon's perhaps beyond that. A list of Naukydes' known works gives some idea of their output, which was heavily biased toward Olympic victor-statues, and almost exclusively in bronze:</p>

</list>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Though a bronze statuette in Malibu and the Capitoline diskobolos type have been linked with (4) and (10), we in fact know almost nothing about any of these works beyond their bare subject-matter; for the School was all but ignored by the ancient critics, leaving only Pausanias' laconic descriptions and Pliny's even briefer lists to enlighten us. The following is a typical citation:</p>

<cit xml:id="t87" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 6.6.2">Pausanias 6.6.2</bibl>

<quote><p>Next [at Olympia] comes a statue of Eukles, son of Kallianax, a Rhodian of the house of the Diagoridai. For he was the son of Diagoras' daughter, and won an Olympic victory in the boxing-match for men [400]. His statue is by Naukydes, while Polykleitos of Argos, not the man who made the image of Hera but a pupil of Naukydes, made the statue of the boy wrestler Agenor of Thebes. This was dedicated by the Phokian Commonwealth, for Theopompos, Agenor's father, was honorary consul for their nation.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Yet whereas attributions to individuals seem all but hopeless, a number of types may be plausibly ascribed to the School as such; some are comparatively small, roughly equaling the normal height of classical males (1.70m). Suggestively in this context, Olympic rules apparently forbade "heroic" scale victor-statues in the Altis. The main types, listed in their approximate chronological order (cf. <bibl>Arnold 1969</bibl>; Linfert, in <bibl>Beck 1990</bibl>, 243-92) are as follows: the "Pan", Dresden youth, "Narkissos", Berlin-Pitti Hermes, Capitoline Diskobolos, Capelli-Kyrene youth, Conservatori runner, Vatican oil pourer, armed ("Epidauros") Aphrodite, Richelieu Hermes, "Centocelle" Apollo, and Barberini Hermes. There are also a few small bronzes (including the Getty Phrixos, above), and one original statue from around 350, the Antikythera Perseus (<rs key="Athens, NM Br. 13396" type="sculpture">Athens, NM Br. 13396</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 550). The well-known Idolino, long considered to be another original, most probably belongs among that array of neo-Polykleitan types invented in Roman times to serve as lamp-holders and the like: cf. <bibl>Zanker 1974</bibl>; <bibl>Wünsche 1972</bibl>; and <bibl>Hallett 1983</bibl>.</p>

<p>The sculpture contracts proceed in zigzag fashion from one façade to the other, though which comes first remains controversial: see below.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Of the sculptors, Theo[.....] may be Theodoros the architect of the temple, and Hektoridas signed a free-standing dedication in the sanctuary (<title>IG</title> 421 no. 695), but like the Erechtheion carvers both are mere names. Thrasymedes son of Arignotos of Paros is slightly better documented, for he made the temple's chryselephantine cult statue (elsewhere inevitably attributed to Pheidias):</p>

<cit xml:id="t89" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 2.27.2">Pausanias 2.27.2</bibl>

<quote><p>The image of Asklepios is half the size of that of the Olympian Zeus at Athens, and is made of ivory and gold. An inscription says that it was made by Thrasymedes son of Arignotos of Paros. The god is seated on a throne and holds a staff in one hand; his other hand is above the head of the serpent, and a dog lies by his side. On the throne are wrought the exploits of Argive heroes: Bellerophon against the Chimaira, and Perseus carrying off the head of Medusa.</p></quote></cit>

<p>A new fragment of an inscription hitherto identified as the accounts for this statue (<title>SEG</title> 15.208; <bibl>Burford 1966</bibl>, no. 2; 1969, 59-61) now shows that it actually refers to the incubation-building or <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">enkoimaterion</foreign> of the sanctuary: <bibl>Mitsos 1967</bibl>. Here Thrasymedes appears only as a hardware-supplier, but elsewhere he emerges as an extremely versatile carpenter and metalworker, able to turn his hand to a ceiling, a grille, a bronze statue (<title>IG</title> 421 no. 198) or a chryselephantine one, as required. <bibl>Krause 1972</bibl> has identified a replica of this cult image in Copenhagen from representations on Epidaurian coins (cf. <bibl>M. Price 1977</bibl>, fig. 355).</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Finally, Timotheos. His <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">typoi</foreign> are problematic: since the basic meaning of this word is "mold-made image," they may refer to models for the pediments, but this is by no means certain, and other interpretations have been suggested. His other documented works, which extend his career to at least ca. 360, are:</p>

<list type="simple">
<item n="2"><rs type="work">Artemis in marble, later in Rome (<ref target="t90" n="U">T 90</ref>)</rs></item>
<item n="3"><rs type="work">Asklepios/Hippolytos in Troezen</rs></item>

</list>

<p>Upon this somewhat uncertain foundation, <bibl>Schlörb 1964</bibl> constructs a major personality to bridge the eras of the Nike temple parapet and the Mausoleum; though her account of the Asklepieion sculptures themselves must be modified in the light of recent discoveries and joins, it does seem that whereas the drapery styles of the western pediment and akroteria are somewhat different, those of the east end seem fairly compatible: cf. <bibl>M. Robertson 1975</bibl>, 401. Her suggestion that the western set are therefore to be attributed to Hektoridas and Theo[.....] respectively (<ref target="t88" n="U">T 88</ref>, lines 87, 95, 109) and the eastern to Timotheos (line 88) is thus attractive but because of the damage to line 96 remains unprovable. As she affirms, a Hygieia from Epidauros and a Leda known in over two dozen copies are closely related to this style, though both are unattested in the literary sources. Her other attributions, particularly the Pastoret head (<rs key="Copenhagen, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek 438" type="sculpture">Copenhagen, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek 438</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 481), the Rospigliosi Athena, and certain pieces from the Mausoleum, are rather less compelling. As for the works mentioned in the sources, only the Artemis (2) has been positively identified, thanks to a note in Pliny:</p>

<p>Encouraged by <title>N.H.</title> 36.24 and 25, mentioning an Apollo of Skopas and a Leto of Kephisodotos (II) in the same shrine, and by Propertius' extended description of the complex, dedicated by Augustus in 27 (<bibl n="Prop. 2.31">Prop. 2.31</bibl>), scholars have recognized the trio on an early imperial relief from Sorrento (most recently, Zanker 1988, fig. 186); yet though copies of the central Apollo survive, the two flanking figures have apparently left no other trace.</p>

<p>In addition, two inscribed base-fragments from the Akropolis may have supported a dedication of his, though the association is not absolutely certain, and the script seems to pre-date most of his signatures: <bibl>Raubitschek 1949</bibl>, no. 143. Of the others, <bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34.19">Pliny <title>N.H.</title> 34.76</bibl> relates that Lysimache (4) was priestess for 64 years, and an inscribed base from the Akropolis (<title>IG</title> 22 no. 3453) may belong to this monument; for though the names of both subject and artist are lost, it mentions "[six]ty-four years [service] to Athena" and stresses the woman's great age. The size of the base and foot-prints suggest a smallish figure; for this and other reasons <bibl>Berger 1968</bibl> has proposed a statue of an old woman in Basel as a copy. Its once-inset head is lost, but two heads in Rome and London (<rs key="London 2001" type="sculpture">London 2001</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 488), long conjectured to copy the Lysimache, conform in both scale and type. The features are lined and drawn, with sunken eyes and furrowed brow, just as one should expect from an artist notorious for his realism (<ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>; see further below).</p>

<p>Yet a pyramid of mutually-supporting hypotheses is not proof, and others prefer the evidence of Roman terracotta plaques showing Eurykleia in very similar guise, attending the mourning Penelope (cf. <bibl n="Hom. Od. 19">Hom. Od. 19ff</bibl>). This raises other problems, however, including whether the "mourning Penelope" type, known in several versions including one from Persepolis (buried when Alexander burnt the palace in 330), belongs: this is usually dated to ca. 460 (cf. <bibl>Ridgway 1970</bibl>, 101-5), the Basel statue to ca. 430, and the Akropolis base to ca. 370! The issue remains moot, though a snippet of evidence so far ignored in the debate is <bibl n="Strab. 14.1.23">Strab. 14.1.23</bibl>, describing wax images of Penelope and Eurykleia at Ephesos by one Thrason (<bibl><title>EAA</title></bibl> q.v.): matrixes for stolen bronzes?</p>

<p>Demetrios' other works are equally problematic. (7) may be the Simon who was cavalry commander in 424; Xenophon, <title>On Horsemanship</title> 1.1 records his debt to Simon "who wrote on horsemanship" and mentions a dedication in the Agora of a bronze horse with a pedestal-reliefs showing the man's exploits: is this Pliny's statue or another? Finally (8) is known only through Lucian's satires:</p>

<cit xml:id="t91" n="testimonium"><bibl>Lucian, <title>Philopseudes</title> 18</bibl>

<quote><p>"When you came in the hall," he said, "didn't you notice a totally gorgeous statue up there, by Demetrios the portraitist?"
</p>
<p>"Surely you don't mean the discus-thrower . . .?" "[No not that one, nor the Diadoumenos, nor the Tyrannicides, but] perhaps you saw the one by the fountain with a pot belly, a bald head, half exposed by the hang of his cloak, with some of the hairs of his beard blown by the wind, and with big, conspicuous veins, just like the man himself, that's the one I mean; he's thought to be Pellichos, the Corinthian general." "Good God," said I, "I saw it on the right of the spout, wearing fillets and withered wreaths, its chest covered with gilded leaves!" "I put on the gilt leaves myself," said Eukrates, "when it cured me of the gout that was torturing me every other day."</p></quote></cit>

<p>This is extremely suspicious. Described by a notorious liar and only "thought" to be Pellichos, the statue appears in the middle of a satirical dialogue, accompanied by Myron's Diskobolos (<ref target="t44" n="U">T 44</ref>), the Diadoumenos (<ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref>), and the Tyrannicides (<ref target="t31 t32" n="U">T 31-32</ref>), as a comic foil to these acknowledged masterpieces of classic beauty, all supposedly in the liar's own private collection. In fact, it soon transpires that its inclusion is merely the pretext for a double joke: that the liar only prizes it because it cures the gout, and that it is so lifelike that it actually walks the house at night, singing and taking baths. To such fantasizing the narrator can only retort that if so, it ought rather to be wooden, and made by Daidalos (cf. <ref target="t10 t11" n="U">T 10-11</ref>)!</p>

<p>In fact, since (1) the only known Pellichos was the father of a commander active ca. 434, (2) Demetrios is not otherwise attested to have worked outside Athens or on non-Athenians, (3) a statue of a Corinthian general erected <emph>inside</emph> Athens would be quite extraordinary in this period, and (4) in any case such a monument could never have been removed from the Agora or Akropolis to a private house, the likelihood is that the entire description was manufactured for comic effect. Of course, Lucian knew his sculpture and here if anywhere seems concerned to be plausible in his descriptions (cf. <ref target="t44" n="U">T 44</ref>), so that with <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref> this still ranks as an extremely valuable source for this radical and uncompromising realist, even if Pellichos himself better belongs in fantasy land.</p>

<p>The names Kephisodotos and Praxiteles apparently alternated in this family (cf. <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>), suggesting that Kephisodotos I was indeed the father of the great Praxiteles (see <ref target="t93 t94 t95 t96 t97 t98 t99 t100 t101 t102 t103 t104 t105 t106" n="U">T 93-106</ref>, below). <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref> gives his <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> as 372-369; this coincides with the most likely date for his most famous work, the Eirene (<rs key="Munich GL 219" type="sculpture">Munich GL 219</rs>; 5, below). According to Plutarch, <title>Phokion</title> 19, his sister became the first wife of this Athenian statesman (b. 402), which already bespeaks a certain standing for the family in Athenian society. His recorded works are:</p>

<p>Some recognize (1) in a Renaissance drawing and an (eclectic) statue in Madrid, while Waywell 1971 connects (2) — where the MSS of <title>N.H.</title> 34.74 actually read "Cephisodorus" — with the Piraeus Athena (<rs key="Piraeus Museum" type="sculpture">Piraeus Museum</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 511), even though the latter was buried out of sight long before Pausanias' visit (1.1.3); <bibl>Palagia 1980</bibl> prefers an attribution to Euphranor. In fact only the Eirene (<rs key="Munich 219" type="sculpture">Munich 219</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 485-87) can be identified with certainty, thanks to Pausanias' note concerning a similar work in Thebes:</p>

<cit xml:id="t92" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 9.16.1">Pausanias 9.16.1-2</bibl>

<quote><p>[At Thebes] is a sanctuary of Tyche [Fortune], who carries the child Ploutos [Wealth]. According to the Thebans, the hands and face of the image were made by Xenophon of Athens, and the rest by Kallistonikos, a native. It was a clever idea of theirs, to place Ploutos in the arms of Tyche, and so to suggest that she is his mother or nurse. Equally clever was the conception of Kephisodotos, for he made the image of Eirene [Peace] for the Athenians with Ploutos in her arms.</p></quote></cit>

<p>The Baiae finds include fragments of a cast of the Ploutos. Other attributions (e.g. <bibl>Hill 1974</bibl>) seem somewhat optimistic given the evidence at hand, though one can conjecture that Kephisodotos was a less radical figure than Demetrios, making cult statues in the Attic tradition yet cautiously experimenting with new subjects and modes of rendering.</p>

<div type="Chapter" n="4"><head>The Fourth-century Virtuosi</head>
<div type="section" n="1"><head>Praxiteles of Athens</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Praxiteles</persName></head>

<p>Praxiteles' career is documented by over a hundred references in the literary sources, ranging in date from Hellenistic through Byzantine, and eight inscribed bases with his signature (some of them later renewals). Since the names Praxiteles and Kephisodotos alternated in this family after ca. 350, it is likely that he was the son of the Kephisodotos of <ref target="t92" n="U">T 92</ref>. The family's history has been succinctly charted by <bibl>J.K. Davies 1971</bibl> (no. 8334): <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref> gives him a <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> of 364-361, but a base (<title>IG</title> 22 no. 4390) signed by his son Kephisodotos (II) permits a rather more precise chronology, since it mentions Asklepios' priest for 344/3.</p>

<p>Now Kephisodotos II <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> in 296-293 (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>), so this must have been a very early work of his, suggesting that he was born around 365, and his father (for the Athenian males rarely married before the age of 25) by ca. 390 at the latest. Praxiteles may have died shortly before 326, since by then Kephisodotos (II) was paying heavy naval liturgies (<title>IG</title> 22 nos. 1628, lines 57, 68, 74, 11; 1629, line 674; 1633, line 100), perhaps as heir to the family fortune — evidently little diminished by his father's spectacular liaison with the courtesan Phryne (<ref target="t100" n="U">T 100</ref>, 102). Praxiteles' Mantinea group (no. 19, below), done "in the third generation after Alkamenes" (<ref target="t94" n="U">T 94</ref>: cf. <ref target="t72 t73 t74 t75" n="U">T 72-75</ref> for the latter's dates, ca. 440-400) must therefore have been a late work. The case of his various statues for Phryne's home town, Thespiae (almost desolate between 374/3 and 338) is more complicated, and will be addressed below. Finally, to return to his <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> with Euphranor in 364-361 (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>), this may derive from the date either of his most famous work, the Knidia (compare Pheidias and Polykleitos here), or of Euphranor's, the Battle of Mantinea (fought in 362).</p>

<p>Including Praxiteles' grandson (but not his later descendants, for whom see <bibl>J.K. Davies 1971</bibl>, 288-90 and <bibl>Stewart 1979</bibl>, 157-76), the family's chronology thus becomes:</p>

<p>Praxiteles: born ca. 400/390, active ca. 380/70-ca. 330/25</p>
<p>Kephisodotos (II): born ca. 365, active ca. 345-290</p>
<p>Timarchos: born ca. 360, active ca. 340-290</p>
<p>Praxiteles (II): active ca. 290-280</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Praxiteles' known works are almost equally distributed between bronzes and marbles despite his admirers' clear preference for the latter (Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 34.69; <ref target="t95" n="U">T 95</ref>); just as clearly, too, he was both an <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">agalmatopoios</foreign> and an accomplished <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">andriantopoios</foreign> , a maker of gods <emph>and</emph> men, despite the Hellenistic practice of listing him only among the former (<ref target="t115" n="U">T 115</ref>).</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>The length of this list — far greater than one man could produce in a lifetime — suggests either the activities of a sizable workshop and/or following, or a phenomenon equivalent to that of the proudly-displayed Raphael in every self-respecting Italian church, or both. The two definite survivors are the Hermes (no. 13) and the Mantinea base (Apollo, Skythian, and Marsayas: <rs key="Athens, NM 215" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 215</rs>); three Muses (<rs key="Athens, NM 216" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 216</rs>); three Muses (<rs key="Athens, NM 217" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 217</rs>; no. 19), and modern scholarship has added four others, the "Eubouleus" (<rs key="Athens, NM 181" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 181</rs>), the Marathon Boy (<rs key="Athens, NM Br. 15118" type="sculpture">Athens, NM Br. 15118</rs>), the Aberdeen head (<rs key="London 1600" type="sculpture">London 1600</rs>), and the Leconfield Aphrodite (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 492-97, 499-500).</p>

<p>Of these, (13) and (19) were seen by Pausanias:</p>

<quote><p>[Continuing the text of <ref target="t16" n="U">T 16</ref>], at a later time other statues were dedicated in the Heraion: a marble Hermes carrying the baby Dionysos, the work of Praxiteles, and a bronze Aphrodite made by Kleon of Sikyon. The master of this Kleon, called Antiphanes, was a pupil of Periklytos, who was taught by Polykleitos of Argos. A nude, gilded child is seated before the Aphrodite; Boethos of Kalchedon was its <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">toreutes</foreign> [metal-smith].

<quote><p>The Mantineans have a two-part temple, divided right across the middle by a wall. In one section of the temple is an image of Asklepios, the work of Alkamenes, while the other is a sanctuary of Leto and her children; Praxiteles made the images in the third generation after Alkamenes. On their base are carved the Muses and Marsyas playing the flutes.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Yet even so, the Hermes is probably Hellenistic (see most recently, <bibl>Pfrommer 1984</bibl>, 176; <bibl>Morrow 1985</bibl>, 83-84; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, 177), while the base is clearly a workshop product, like the Marathon Boy (<rs key="Athens, NM Br. 15118" type="sculpture">Athens, NM Br. 15118</rs>). The Leconfield and Aberdeen heads look authentically Praxitelean and late fourth-century, so could be by either the master himself or by his sons. As for the "Eubouleus", though a Roman inscription certifies Praxiteles' authorship of this minor Eleusinian underworld deity, and the bust was found with a dedication to Eubouleus in the Ploutonion there, the large number of copies (eight, including two on the Akropolis, of all places) is disturbing. Perhaps he merely reproduced his Triptolemos or Iakchos/Dionysos (24, 25), both of whom could easily prompt such a rendering, and generate the copies we have. The piece is evidently cut down from a complete statue: the tooling around the shoulders, the high polish on the face, and the deep drilling in the hair are all secondary, perhaps repairs after the Kostovokian sack of A.D. 170. It is surely not an Alexander: see <bibl>Furtwängler 1895/1964</bibl>, 330-33; <bibl>Lippold 1950</bibl>, 241; <bibl>Bieber 1964</bibl>, 26; <bibl>Vierneisel-Schlörb 1979</bibl>, 375-78; and Stewart 1993, Chapter 4.2 for a range of opinions.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>The meager fragments so far recovered from (52) appear early Hellenistic, and none seems particularly Praxitelean: see <title>ÖJh</title> 50 (1972-75): <title>Beiblatt</title> 462-67 and <title>Grabungen</title> 50 fig. 44. Finally, the head from Chios attributed by Marshall 1909 (<rs key="Boston 10.70" type="sculpture">Boston 10.70</rs>; cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 606) is now also universally accepted as post-Praxitelean, while the recent suggestion that limb-fragments found near the Knidian Aphrodite sanctuary, and a head, B.M. 1314, found in the Demeter sanctuary — a mile away! — are all from (1) (<bibl>Love 1972</bibl>, 75-76, 401 n.1) are contradicted by <ref target="t128" n="U">T 128</ref>, locating her among the works burnt in the Lauseion at Constantinople in A.D. 476: see further, <bibl>Haynes 1972</bibl>, 731-37.</p>

<p>Pliny places Praxiteles next after Pheidias and his star pupils in his catalogue of the great marble-workers, with the words:</p>

<cit xml:id="t95" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Plin. Nat. 36.4">Pliny <title>N.H.</title> 36.20-22</bibl>

<quote><p>(20) I have mentioned the date of Praxiteles among those sculptors who worked in bronze [T1]; yet in his fame as a marble-worker he surpassed even himself. There are works by him at Athens in the Ceramicus, but first and foremost not only of this, but indeed in the whole world, is the Venus that many have sailed to Cnidus to see. He made two statues and put them up for sale together: one was draped and for that reason was preferred by the people of Cos, who had an option on the sale, even though it was the same price as the other, for they judged this to be the sober and proper thing to do. The Cnidians bought the rejected one, whose fame became immensely greater.
</p>
<p>(21) Later King Nicomedes [of Bithynia, reigned 90-74] wanted to buy it, promising that he would pay off the city's entire foreign debt, which was enormous. The Cnidians, however, preferred to suffer anything but this, and not without reason, for with this statue, Praxiteles had made Cnidus famous. The shrine she stands in is completely open, so that one can view the image of the goddess from all sides, an arrangement (so it is believed) that she herself favored. The statue is equally admirable from every angle. There is a story that a man was once overcome with love for it, hid inside during the night, and embraced it, leaving a stain to mark his lust.
</p>
<p>(22) In Cnidus there are other marbles by famous artists, a Father Liber [Dionysos] by Bryaxis, another and a Minerva too by Scopas, but there is no greater witness to the quality of Praxiteles' Venus that among all these it alone receives attention.</p></quote></cit>

<p>There follows a brief list of Praxitelean works at Rome. The erotic anecdotes are typical of Greco-Roman writing on Praxiteles: since unlike the classical bronze workers the marble sculptors inspired no substantial critical tradition, such erotica, often worked up into verse by Hellenistic and later poets, constitute our major source for the reception of his work in antiquity. The classic case is of course the Knidia:</p>

<cit xml:id="t98" n="testimonium"><bibl>Ps.-Lucian, <title>Amores</title> 13-14</bibl>

<quote><p>When we had taken sufficient delight in the garden plants, we entered the temple. The goddess is placed in the middle — she's a most beautiful statue of Parian marble — smiling just a little haughty smile. Since she is swathed in no clothes all her naked beauty is revealed, except that she unobtrusively uses one hand to hide her modesty. So great was the power of the craftsman's art that the hard unyielding marble has done justice to every limb. . . . The temple has a door on both sides for those who wish to see the goddess directly from behind so that no part of her be left unadmired. It's easy, therefore, for people to enter by this other door and survey the beauty of her back.
</p>
<p>Deciding, then, to see all of the goddess we went round to the rear. And as the door was opened by the woman responsible for keeping the keys, immediate amazement at her beauty seized us. The Athenian who had been an impassive observer shortly before . . . suddenly shouted, "Herakles! What a well-shaped back, what generous flanks, what an armful to embrace! How delicately moulded the flesh of her behind, neither too thin and close to the bone, nor yet revealing too great an expanse of fat! And as for those precious parts sealed in on either side by the hips, how inexpressibly sweetly they smile! How perfect the shape of the thighs and shins as they stretch down to the ankle!" [The story of the stain follows].</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p>At the festival of the Eleusinia and at the festival of Poseidon, Phryne took off her cloak in full view of all the Greeks, let down her hair, and stepped into the sea; and it was with her as a model that Apelles painted his Aphrodite Anadyomene [Rising from the Sea]. And Praxiteles the sculptor fell in love with her and modeled his Knidian Aphrodite on her . . . . [More about their love-affair follows, ending with the dedication of the gold statue, no. 44 above].</p></quote></cit>

<p>At first sight the temple described in <ref target="t98" n="U">T 98</ref> (written ca. A.D. 300) seems incompatible with that of <ref target="t95" n="U">T 95</ref>; clearly either the Doric rotunda found by Love (<bibl>Love 1972</bibl>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 502) had been remodeled to limit access to the statue or she had been moved elsewhere. The rotunda itself seems third-century, though could be a reconstruction, since fragments of an earlier building were also recovered at the site. For the copies, many of which seem to be taken from a mid or late Hellenistic recension (<bibl>Pfrommer 1985</bibl>), see <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 503-07: from Italy (<rs key="Vatican 812" type="sculpture">Vatican 812</rs>); from Syria (<rs key="Malibu 72.AA.93" type="sculpture">Malibu 72.AA.93</rs>); from Tralleis (<rs key="Louvre 3518" type="sculpture">Louvre 3518</rs>).</p>

<p>Of the other types recognizable in copy, the early Arles Aphrodite (<rs key="Louvre 439" type="sculpture">Louvre 439</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 501; condemned as neo-classical by <bibl>Ridgway 1976</bibl>) resembles one shown with a statuette of a woman on Thespian coins, so could copy (3); the checkered career of the Thespian Eros (7), on the other hand, suggests that we should probably not expect monumental replicas:</p>

<cit xml:id="t101" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 9.27.3">Pausanias 9.27.3</bibl>

<quote><p>Later on Lysippos made a bronze Eros for Thespiae, and even before him Praxiteles made one of Pentelic marble. The story of Phryne and the trick she played on Praxiteles, I have already related elsewhere. The first to remove the image of Eros, it is said, was Gaius [Caligula] the Roman emperor; Claudius sent it back to Thespiae but Nero carried it off a second time to Rome. There a fire finally destroyed it... The statue of Eros at Thespiae which exists now was made by the Athenian Menodoros, who copied the work of Praxiteles. Here too and by Praxiteles also are an Aphrodite and a portrait of Phryne, both of marble.</p></quote></cit>

<p>And for the trick:</p>

<cit xml:id="t102" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 1.20.1">Pausanias 1.20.1</bibl>

<quote><p>[The Street of the Tripods at Athens] also contains some really remarkable works of art. For there is a Satyr, of which Praxiteles is said to have been very proud. And once Phryne asked him for the most beautiful of all his works, and he agreed, lover-like, to give it to her, but refused to say which he thought was the most beautiful. So a slave of Phryne rushed in with the news that fire had broken out in Praxiteles' studio, and that most of his works were lost, though not all. Praxiteles immediately ran out through the doors and said that all his labor was wasted if indeed the flames had caught his Satyr and Eros. But Phryne told him to stay and cheer up, for he had suffered nothing grievous, but by a ruse she had trapped him into confessing which of all his works was the most beautiful. So Phryne chose the Eros.</p></quote></cit>

<p>No. 8 also only appears on coins, though Hermary 1986 has now reconnected the (sadly, headless) Palatine Eros type with (7). With the Pouring Satyr (Dresden type: <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 408) and the Dresden Artemis (REF: cf. 10, 16-19, 22, 23 — but which?) it too looks early, ca. 380-370 (cf. <bibl>Arnold 1969</bibl>, 161 and 210 for the chronology). On the other hand, the Leaning Satyr (<rs key="Rome, Museo Capitolino 739" type="sculpture">Rome, Museo Capitolino 739</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 510) and two youthful Dionysos types at present known only from herms are clearly later, one approaching the Olympia Hermes (<bibl>Ashmole 1922a</bibl>, 242-4; cf. Stewart 1977a, 139).</p>

<p>The Apollo Sauroktonos (21; <rs key="Louvre 441" type="sculpture">Louvre 441</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 509) is securely identified from Pliny <title>N.H.</title> 34.70 and Martial 14.172. The Gabii Artemis (<rs key="Louvre MA 441" type="sculpture">Louvre MA 441</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 508) may copy the Brauronia (22); <bibl>Treheux 1964</bibl> shows how this statue cannot date to 346/5, as often stated, but must belong between 345/4 and 336/5. Finally, the Apollo Lykeios described in Lucian, <title>Anacharsis</title> 7 — but without naming the author — and recognized both on Athenian coins and on numerous replicas in the round, is regularly attributed to him [REF]. Other suggestions, coin-pictures of lost works, and supposed versions on reliefs and other media, are more problematic, and cannot be addressed here.</p>

<p>Because Praxiteles wrote no book on his art and inspired no proper critical tradition about it, sources for his style are pitifully few in number. While Quintilian (<ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>) only contrasts his tact in naturalistic representation with Demetrios (cf. <ref target="t91" n="U">T 91</ref>), others are sometimes a little more explicit:</p>

<quote><p>Neither poet nor historian, nor indeed any craftsman of literature can in all respects satisfy all his readers. For ... not even Pheidias, admired above all for the fabrication of ivory statues, nor Praxiteles, who masterfully embodied the emotions of the soul in works of stone, nor Apelles nor Parrhasios ... attained such success in their work that they could display a product of their skill that was totally above censure.</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p>Praxiteles used to say about Nicias, when questioned as to which one of his marbles he preferred above all: those to which Nicias has set his hand — so much value did he put upon his ability to articulate with color.

<p>Praxiteles is also regularly cited by writers on <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">phantasia</foreign> (<ref target="t54" n="U">T 54</ref>) and in the various disputes concerning the status of the artist, and by the Augustan period his popularity was prompting quite an industry in forgeries:</p>

<div type="section" n="2"><head>The Mausoleum Sculptors</head>

<p>The only detailed descriptions of the Mausoleum are by Vitruvius and Pliny:</p>

<cit xml:id="t107" n="testimonium"><bibl>Vitruvius 7. Praef. 12-13</bibl>

<quote><p>Satyrus and Pytheus wrote a book on the Mausoleum. On these men good fortune conferred the greatest and highest tribute. For their works of art are judged to possess merits renowned for all time and unfading for eternity, and from their deliberations were produced works of high distinction. For example, individual artists undertook one side each, competing against each other in embellishing and scrutinizing the work: Leochares, Bryaxis, Scopas, and Praxiteles, while some add Timotheus. The outstanding quality of their art caused the fame of the building to be included among the Seven Wonders of the World.</p></quote></cit>

<cit xml:id="t108" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 36.30-1</bibl>

<quote><p>The rivals and contemporaries of Scopas were Bryaxis, Timotheus, and Leochares, whom we must discuss together because they all worked on the carvings for the Mausoleum. This was the tomb built by Artemisia for her husband Mausolus, the satrap of Caria, who died in the 2nd year of the 107th Olympiad [351; he actually died in 353]. These artists were chiefly responsible for the work's inclusion among the Seven Wonders of the World. On the North and South sides it extends for 63 feet [actually 120 feet] but the length of the facades is less, giving a total circumference of 440 feet. It rises to a height of 25 cubits [probably the colonnade alone] and is enclosed by 36 columns . . . Scopas carved the east side, Bryaxis the north, Timotheus the south, and Leochares the west, but before they had finished, the queen died [351]. However, they refused to stop working until it was complete, since they had decided that it would be a monument both to their own glory and to that of their art, and even today their rivalry persists. A fifth artist also joined them. For above the colonnade is a pyramid that equals the building's podium in height, tapering in 24 steps to its peak; at the top is a marble chariot-and-four that Pythis made.

<p>As to personalities, Pytheos of Priene (a noted theorist of the Ionic order) was clearly the building's architect and carved the great four-horsed chariot that crowned its summit; according to <bibl n="Vitr. 1.12">Vitruvius 1.12</bibl> and <bibl n="Vitr. 7.preface.12">7 Praef. 12</bibl>, he later went on to design the temple of Athena Polias at Priene, which was still under construction when Alexander passed through in 334.</p>

<div>
<p>Satyros, who co-authored the book on the building (<ref target="t107" n="U">T 107</ref>), was surely the Satyros son of Isotimos of Paros who made statues of Maussolos's successors, Ada and Idrieus, at Delphi around 345 (<bibl>Marcadé 1953</bibl>, 93); he may have been Maussolos's court sculptor. Timotheos has received attention above (<ref target="t88 t89 t90" n="U">T 88-90</ref>). This leaves Bryaxis, Leochares, and Skopas.</p>
</div>

<div type="subsection"><head>Bryaxis (I) of Athens</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Bryaxis</persName></head>

<p>After Fraser's work on the Sarapis cult (<bibl>Fraser 1972</bibl>, 246-76) it now seems quite clear that <emph>two</emph> sculptors named Bryaxis were active between 370 and 270; this is supported by <ref target="t149" n="U">T 149</ref>, which distinguishes an Athenian Bryaxis — presumably the sculptor of <ref target="t107 t108" n="U">T 107-08</ref>, active ca. 353-351 — from the maker of the Sarapis, installed in the Alexandrian Serapeion around 286-278. This later Bryaxis was probably the one responsible for the Apollo at Daphne around 300-281 (<ref target="t147 t148" n="U">T 147-8</ref>, below), and perhaps the portrait of Seleukos mentioned along with an Asklepios by Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 34.73. Not to separate the two in this way entails that the Bryaxis born ca. 390 (for the Mausoleum was begun in the 360s) would be almost a centenarian when hired by the Seleukids and Ptolemies.</p>

<p>This leaves precious little for Bryaxis I. For not only is it not clear which of the other attested works (five colossal bronze divinities in Rhodes, a Zeus, Apollo and lions at Patara in Lykia, a marble Dionysos at Knidos (<ref target="t95" n="U">T 95</ref>), an Asklepios at Megara, and a Pasiphae later in Rome) belong to which sculptor, but the finds from the North side of the Mausoleum are too heterogeneous to provide a firm base for attributions. Only a tripod-base from Athens with three horsemen in relief, signed by Bryaxis in a mid fourth-century script, can be securely attributed to him; its powerfully-built horses have (predictably) been seized upon by those anxious to discover him in he extant slabs of the Amazon frieze: most favored is B.M. 1019. Finally, a base from Rome, now lost, bore the words "the work of Bryaxis" in Latin, clearly a renewal.</p>

<p>Though with the partial exception of (20) none of these works survives in the original, several of them can be dated and furnish unusually full information as to Leochares' career. The first date is given by Pliny (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>), who places his <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> very early, in 372-369; some try to connect this with (1), arguing on circumstantial grounds that it was perhaps made for Megalopolis, founded after the Spartan defeat at Leuktra in 371. A remark in a letter purportedly sent by Plato to Dionysios II of Syracuse in 365/4 also stresses his youth, in connection with (21):</p>

<cit xml:id="t109" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Plat. L. 13.361A">[Plato] <title>Epistle</title> 13, 361A</bibl>

<quote><p>About the things you wrote asking me to send you, I bought the Apollo and Leptines is bringing it; it is by a fine young artist named Leochares. There was another work there by him that I thought very elegant, so I bought it to give to your wife.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Yet philosophers dispute this letter's authenticity, and indeed the transaction is hardly conceivable before the Hellenistic period. More securely, (10) must predate Timotheos' exile in 356/5, while (20) belongs around 368-350. The mention of Asklepios' priest Teisias puts (13) in 338/7, overlapping (7), begun just after the battle of Chaironeia in 338 and still unfinished at Philip's murder in 336 (<ref target="t111" n="U">T 111</ref>); (11) can hardly pre-date ca. 330, for Pandaites was born ca. 351 (cf. <bibl>J.K. Davies 1971</bibl> no. 643); and finally, though the hunt commemorated by (8) occurred either in 333 or when Alexander was campaigning in central Asia in 331-327, its inscription (<ref target="t123" n="U">T 123</ref>) records that Krateros died before its dedication. Since he was killed in 320, and Plutarch, <title>Alexander</title> 40 records that Lysippos made some of the figures, it is arguable that Leochares also died at around this time, and Lysippos was hired to complete the work.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>When one scans his oeuvre, Leochares emerges as something of a complementary figure to Praxiteles, albeit at a rather lesser level of achievement. For while selecting the same genres (divinities and portraits) as Praxiteles, he now concentrated upon male gods, specialized in bronze, and worked mainly in Attica. There are hints of a distinctive political strategy too, for while from ca. 340 Praxiteles' sons were busy sustaining Athens' navy and working for the patriot Lykourgos and his circle (cf. <ref target="t134 t135 t136" n="U">T 134-36</ref>, below), he cultivated the Macedonians and their partisans (7, 8, perhaps 13) — sympathies perhaps prefigured in the commission for the panhellenist and eventually pro-Macedonian Isokrates (12).</p>

<p>If only his sculpture had survived in like measure to the testimonia. Nothing significant was found <title>in situ</title> on the West side of the Mausoleum (<bibl>Waywell 1978</bibl>, 11-12), and repeated attempts at speculative attribution have never gained universal support, even though Pliny's account seems unusually full (caution: no. 22 and <ref target="t4" n="U">T 4</ref>):</p>

<cit xml:id="t110" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny <title>N.H.</title> 34.79</bibl>

<quote><p>Leochares made an eagle which is aware of just what it is abducting in Ganymede and for whom it is carrying him, and therefore refrains from injuring the boy with its claws, even through his clothing; [he also made] the pancratiast victor Autolycus, in whose honor Xenophon wrote his <title>Symposium</title> , a Jove the Thunderer now on the Capitol, praised above all others, a diademed Apollo, Lyciscus, Lango, a boy with the crafty cringing look of a household slave.</p></quote></cit>

<p>The description of the Ganymede (6), probably based on a Hellenistic epigram (cf. <title>Anth. Pal.</title> 12.221: Hadrianic) has led many to see this in a heavily restored Vatican statuette, The Zeus (1) is pictured on Roman coins (most recently, Zanker 1988, 108, fig. 89a), and has been recognized in a series of fine Roman bronze statuettes (most recently, Kozloff-Mitten 1988, no. 30, correcting the attribution to Lysippos favored in <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, 190-91, fig. 568). Unfortunately the Autolykos (often gratuitously given to Lykios son of Myron: but see <bibl>Gallet de Santerre 1983</bibl>, 257) and the diademed Apollo (cf. <bibl n="Paus. 1.8.4">Paus. 1.8.4</bibl>) seem lost forever.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Of the others, (4) — cf. <ref target="t118" n="U">T 118</ref> — is regularly identified with the Belvedere Apollo (<rs key="Vatican 1015" type="sculpture">Vatican 1015</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 573). Two points are at issue here: the status of the Belvedere copy, and the attribution itself. As to the first, a statuette in Arezzo certifies the motif (Bocci Pacini, P., and Nocentini Sbolci, S., <title>Museo Nazionale di Arezzo. Catalogo di Sculture Romane</title> [Rome 1983]: no. 17: contra, <bibl>Deubner 1979</bibl>, 225 n. 6), while plaster fragments from Baiae (<bibl>Landwehr 1985</bibl>, 104-111 nos. 64-76) establish its classical pedigree. Concerning the attribution, Hedrick 1984 conclusively identifies Leochares' statue (<ref target="t118" n="U">T 118</ref>) as an Apollo Pythios, which helps to support the traditional view, since the Baiae casts prove that the type was indeed prepubescent, and the epithet derives from his boyhood battle against the Pythoness at Delphi, when "the lord Apollo, the far-shooter / shot a strong arrow at her / and she lay there, torn with terrible pain" (Homeric <title>Hymn to Pythian Apollo</title> 356-59). Though the Versailles Artemis type is often attributed to the same hand, <bibl>Pfrommer 1984</bibl> has shown that her sandals are late Hellenistic, and argues strongly for a date ca. 100.</p>

<p>As to the portraits, (7) is described by Pausanias:</p>

<cit xml:id="t111" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 5.20.9">Paus. 5.20.9</bibl>

<quote><p>[The Philippeion at Olympia] was built by Philip after the fall of Greece at Chaironeia [338]. Here are displayed statues of Philip and Alexander, and with them is Philip's father Amyntas. These works too are by Leochares, and are of ivory and gold, like the portraits of Olympias and Eurydike.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Cf. <ref target="t93" n="U">T 93</ref>; though hard evidence is lacking, the so-called 'Alkibiades'/Philip and Akropolis-Erbach Alexander (<rs key="Athens, Acropolis 1331" type="sculpture">Athens, Acropolis 1331</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 560; Stewart 1993, figs. 4-5) are often considered replicas of this group, though opinion is divided upon whether the Akropolis head is fourth century (but recut), late Hellenistic, or even Roman. I incline to a fourth-century date. (8) is apparently reflected in a relief from Elis, now in Paris, while the Isokrates preserved in a single poor copy in the Villa Albani could equally reproduce (10) or the statue set up after his death in 338 (<bibl n="Paus. 1.18.8">Paus. 1.18.8</bibl>; <bibl>Plut. <title>Mor.</title> 839B</bibl>; cf. <bibl>Richter 1965</bibl>, 208-10). Finally, of the numerous attempts to resurrect Leochares from the debris of the Mausoleum (20), perhaps the most attractive is still Ashmole's (<bibl>Ashmole 1951a</bibl>), who establishes a relatively tight association between B.M. slabs <rs key="London 1013" type="sculpture">London 1013</rs>, <rs key="London 1014" type="sculpture">London 1014</rs>, <rs key="London 1015" type="sculpture">London 1015</rs>, <rs key="London 1037" type="sculpture">London 1037</rs> (now stripped of its lower part: Cook 1976, 53-4), the Akropolis Alexander (<rs key="Athens, Acropolis 1331" type="sculpture">Athens, Acropolis 1331</rs>), and the Demeter of Knidos, <rs key="London 1300" type="sculpture">London 1300</rs> (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 529-31, 560, 572). None of these seems incompatible with the Belvedere Apollo, discussed above.</p>

<p>If all this is not fantasy, then it reveals a sculptor who is compositionally daring yet in other respects costively conservative: an unorthodox but strangely appealing address that first surprises then reassures the spectator. Whether attributable to Leochares or not, the combination can hardly have failed to be a winner.</p>

<p>The Mausoleum apart (24), none of these is exactly datable, and the <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> of <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref> is clearly wrong. What other information we have tends to cluster in the 340s and 330s. The old temple at Tegea (25) was burnt in 395 (<ref target="t113" n="U">T 113</ref>), but it now seems that Skopas's replacement postdates the Mausoleum (<bibl>Norman 1986</bibl>), with which it shares the same foot-module. A relief with Ada, Idrieus, and Zeus Stratios found at the site and dated to 345 was presumably dedicated by a worker he brought back with him from Halikarnassos. The Temenos at Samothrace, probably the location of (2) and provided with coffer reliefs in the style of the Tegea heads (25) was built in the 330s. (7) and (11), on the other hand, must predate the destruction of Thebes in 335. Finally, (23) was also begun around 340, to replace the temple burnt in 356.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Skopas' career is thus only documented from ca. 360 to ca. 335, though most studies assume that it began in the 370s, and make him an exact contemporary of Praxiteles (<ref target="t112" n="U">T 112</ref>). In fact, Praxiteles apparently collaborated on (18) and was a rival candidate for (26)-(28); elsewhere, the two are often paired by Greek and Roman writers, Pliny included:</p>

<cit xml:id="t112" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny <title>N.H.</title> 36.25-6</bibl>

<quote><p>Scopas rivals these [Praxiteles and his sons] in merit. He made the Venus and Pothos which are worshipped with the most solemn ritual in Samothrace, also the Palatine Apollo, the seated and much-praised Vesta in the Gardens of Servilius, two turning-posts beside her (duplicated in Asinius [Pollio's] collection, where his Basket-bearer is also to be found). But most highly esteemed are those works in the shrine of Cn. Domitius in the Circus Flaminius: Neptune himself, Thetis, Achilles, Nereids seated on dolphins, sea-dragons, or sea-horses, Tritons, the chorus of Phorcys, swordfish and many other sea-creatures, all carved by the same hand, a magnificent achievement, even if it had taken his whole life. As it is, apart from the works just mentioned and those unknown to us, there is furthermore the colossal seated Mars by the same artist in the temple of Brutus Callaecus, also in the Circus, and especially a nude Venus, that surpasses the one by Praxiteles and would have brought fame to anywhere else but Rome.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Given the limitations of ancient connoisseurship (<ref target="t4" n="U">T 4</ref>), some caution is necessary, but such a consistent pattern of association may shed unexpected light on Skopas' style, at least in those genres where their work overlapped: see <bibl>Stewart 1977a</bibl>, 2-3, 104, and further below.</p>

<quote><p>(45) [The old temple at Tegea] was completely destroyed by a sudden fire when Diophantos was archon at Athens, in the 2nd year of the 96th Olympiad, when Eupolemos of Elis won the foot-race [395]. The present temple is far superior to all other temples in the Peloponnese on many grounds, but particularly as regards its embellishment and size. The first colonnade is Doric, and the one after that is Corinthian; also [in]side the temple stand Ionic columns. I learnt that its architect was Skopas of Paros, who made the images in many places in ancient Greece, and some besides in Ionia and Caria.
</p>
<p>Concerning the pedimental sculptures, on the front is the Hunt of the Kalydonian Boar. The boar stands right in the center, and on one side are Atalante, Meleager, Theseus, Telamon and Peleus, Polydeukes, and Iolaos — Herakles' companion in most of his Labors — and the sons of Thestios and brothers of Althaia, Prothoos and Kometes. On the other side of the boar comes [. . . lacuna? . . .], Epochos supporting Ankaios who is now wounded and has dropped his axe, then Kastor, Amphiaraos son of Oikles, then Hippothous son of Kerkyon, son of Agamedes, son of Stymphalos. The last figure is Peirithous. On the rear pediment is the battle between Telephos and Achilles on the plain of Kaikos.

<p>(46) The ancient image of Alea Athena was carried off by the Roman emperor Augustus, together with the tusks of the Kalydonian boar, after he defeated Antony and his allies [31], among whom were all the Arcadians except the Mantineans . . . .

<p>(47) The present image at Tegea was brought from the deme of Manthyrenses, and was surnamed by them "Hippia" . . .

<cit xml:id="t114" n="testimonium"><bibl>Kallistratos, <title>Descriptions</title> 2.1-4 (selections)</bibl>

<quote><p>Skopas, as if moved by some inspiration, imparted to the making of his statue the divine frenzy that possessed him. Why should I not describe to you from the beginning the inspiration of this work of art?
</p>
<p>The statue of a Maenad, wrought from Parian marble, has been transformed into a real Maenad. For the stone, while retaining its own nature, yet seemed to depart from the law which governs stone; what one saw was really an image, but art carried imitation over into actual reality. You would have seen that, hard as it was, it became soft to resemble the feminine, though its vigor corrected the femininity, and that, though it lacked the power to move, it knew how to dance in Bacchic frenzy, responding to the god as he entered within.
</p>
<p>When we saw her face we stood speechless, so clear upon it was the evidence of sense perception, though perception was not present; so clear was the intimation of Bacchic divine possession stirring Bacchic frenzy, though no such possession aroused it; and as many signs of passion that a soul goaded by divine madness displays, these blazed out from it, fashioned by art in fashion indescribable. The hair fell free to be tossed by the wind, and was divided to show the glory of each strand; this most of all transcended reason, since, stone though the material was, it obeyed the lightness of hair and yielded to imitation of its tresses, and though void of life's vitality it was vital withal.
</p>
<p>Indeed you might say that art has harnessed the impulses of growth, so unbelievable is what you see, so visible is what you do not believe. It actually even showed hands in motion — for it was not waving the Bacchic thyrsos, but carried a victim as if crying "Euoi"! — sign of a more poignant madness. And the figure of the kid was livid in color, and the stone took on the appearance of dead flesh; and though the material was one and the same, it severally imitated life and death . . . .</p></quote></cit>

<p>Now Hellenistic critics recognized Skopas' <foreign xml:lang="fr">forte</foreign> to be statues of the gods (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">agalmata</foreign>), a genre unfortunately very poorly represented among the surviving monuments:</p>

<p>Yet it is here if anywhere that the heroic manner of the extant marbles would be most muted and his rivalry with Praxiteles would be most intense. Together, <ref target="t112" n="U">T 112</ref> and the copies of the Pothos might confirm this if only we could be sure that his work in this most Praxitelean of subjects was typical.

<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Euphranor</persName></head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Silanion</persName></head>

<p>Contemporaries competing for the same Attic market, these two adopted radically different strategies to secure their commissions. Euphranor the sculptor-painter became a true all-rounder in both technique and subject matter, while Silanion concentrated exclusively upon <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">andriantopoia</foreign> in bronze.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Euphranor</head>

<p>Euphranor is variously reported as being an 'Isthmian' and an Athenian; yet whether an immigrant or not his major paintings were certainly done for Athens. His chronology is also confused, for though Pliny twice dates him to 364-361 (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref> and <title>N.H.</title> 35.128), he places him after the flower-painter Pausias, who taught Apelles (<foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> 332-329: <title>N.H.</title> 35.79): <ref target="t116" n="U">T 116</ref>, below. Indeed, in <title>N.H.</title> 35.111 he lowers the chronology still further, by apprenticing him to Apelles' contemporary the Theban painter Aristeides (cf. <title>N.H.</title> 35.98). Something has to give, and since (1) his own <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> in <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref> coincides with the Battle of Mantinea (362), the occasion for his acknowledged masterpiece (see below), and (2) <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref> also gives his son Sostratos a <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> in 328-325, the most likely explanation is that Pliny has made one Aristeides out of two: the earlier, active ca. 400 (<title>N.H.</title> 35.75) and grandfather of the later (<title>N.H.</title> 35.108-10), would then be Euphranor's master: cf. <bibl>Palagia 1980</bibl>, 8, 86. Euphranor's work on the Apollo Patroos and for the Macedonian kings (1, 10, below) extends his career at least to ca. 330.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Euphranor excited far less attention than Praxiteles or even Skopas, and his bronzes are only listed by Pliny in his alphabetical catalogue of second-rank masters:</p>

<cit xml:id="t116" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny <title>N.H.</title> 34.77-8</bibl>

<quote><p>The Alexander Paris is by Euphranor, and is praised because in it all aspects of his personality can be discerned at once: the judge of the goddesses, the lover of Helen, and yet the slayer of Achilles. His too is the Minerva at Rome called the Catuliana, dedicated below the Capitol by Q. Lutatius Catulus [consul, 78]; the Bonus Adventus holding a dish in his right hand and an ear of corn and some poppies in his left; the Leto after childbirth in the temple of Concord, holding the babes Apollo and Diana in her arms. He also made two- and four-horse chariots, and an exceptionally lovely Key-Bearer, a Virtue and Greece, both colossal, a woman wondering and worshipping, and an Alexander and Philip in four-horse chariots.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Fortunately, however, Pliny elsewhere quotes two 'professional' evaluations of his work, one culled from his own writings, the other (more critical) from the 'Xenokratic' tradition; these occur in his book on painting, for which he explicitly acknowledges treatises by Euphranor, Xenokrates, and Antigonos as sources (<title>N.H.</title> 1.35).</p>

<cit xml:id="t117" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny <title>N.H.</title> 35.128-9</bibl>

<quote><p>After Pausias Euphranor of the Isthmus was by far the most distinguished painter, flourishing in the 104th Olympiad [364-361], whom we have also included among the sculptors. He made colossal statues, works in marble, and <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">typoi</foreign> , and was studious and industrious above all others, excelling in every field and never falling below his own standards. He seems to have been the first to express the dignity of the heroes and to have made habitual use of <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign> [in painting], though his bodies were too slight throughout, and his heads and limbs too large. He wrote treatises on <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign> and color.</p></quote></cit>

<p>For the praise of his versatility see also Quintilian 12.10.6 and 12 (a rhetorical comparison with Cicero). The remarks concerning his dignified heroes and mastery of <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign> may well derive from Euphranor himself, though it is not clear precisely <emph>how</emph> he rendered the former — whether by colors (so <bibl>Palagia 1980</bibl>, 9; cf. Val. Max. 8.115), by sheer size (so <bibl>Coulson 1972</bibl>, 325; cf. 'colossi' in <ref target="t116" n="U">T 116</ref>), or by strengthening their physique (so <bibl>Pollitt 1974</bibl>, 368-69, after the comment concerning Theseus in <title>N.H.</title> 35.129). This last suggestion would find support from his alleged mastery of <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign> were it not for a revealing comment that follows (<ref target="t117" n="U">T 117</ref>).</p>

<p>Here, Pliny criticizes him exactly as he did Zeuxis (<title>N.H.</title> 35.64), and <bibl>Coulson 1972</bibl>, 325-26 has shown that just as <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign> in painting was perhaps derivative of <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign> in sculpture (it was only introduced around 400, by Parrhasios), so this remark should derive from a sculptor's critique of a system that sought to slim down the 'foursquare' Polykleitan canon (<ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref>) but failed to achieve the fully gracile proportions of Xenokrates' own master, Lysippos (<ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>). For despite <bibl>Palagia 1980</bibl>, 11 n. 45 one may safely assume that Euphranor applied his principles to both arts. Indeed, the sources often couple him with Polykleitos, though to identify his master Aristeides with Polykleitos' pupil of the same name (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref> and <title>N.H.</title> 34.72) is perhaps wishful thinking.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Attributions usually begin with the colossal marble Apollo found in the Metroon in 1907, next door to the temple of Apollo Patroos (1: <rs key="Athens, Agora S 2154" type="sculpture">Athens, Agora S 2154</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 512):</p>

<cit xml:id="t118" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 1.3.4">Pausanias 1.3.4</bibl>

<quote><p>These pictures [of the Battle of Mantinea and others, in the Royal Stoa] were painted for the Athenians by Euphranor, who also made the Apollo Patroos in the temple next door; in front of the temple is an Apollo by Leochares and another by Kalamis, called Alexikakos [Averter of Evil], so-called, they say, because by an oracle from Delphi he stayed the plague that struck during the Peloponnesian War [430-427].</p></quote></cit>

<p>Yet though despite this inconvenient change of location the attribution "has never been contested in print" (<bibl>Palagia 1980</bibl>, 14), few bother to note that pieces of a <emph>second</emph> Apollo Kitharoidos were found there too (<bibl>H.A. Thompson 1953/4</bibl>: 37-38, 43 n. 2). So although the colossus cannot be the Pythios of Leochares (cf. <ref target="t109 t110 t111" n="U">T 109-111</ref>, above, with Hedrick 1984) or the Alexikakos of Kalamis, for both were evidently fighters, a small question-mark still hangs over its creator. <bibl>Palagia 1980</bibl>, 21-25 groups a number of other works with this, including the bronze Athena from Piraeus (<rs key="Piraeus Athena" type="sculpture">Piraeus Athena</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 511), while Dontas 1982 vigorously repudiates the attribution and substitutes the Piraeus Artemis (<rs key="Piraeus Small Artemis" type="sculpture">Piraeus Small Artemis</rs><bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 569-70). True, the Athena's sentimental air and uneven quality seem to belie Pliny's praise of his consistently high standards (<ref target="t117" n="U">T 117</ref>), but the Artemis is hardly as close to the Apollo as she.</p>

<p>As for the rest, a possible candidate for (9) is the Lansdowne-type Paris, rejected by <bibl>Palagia 1980</bibl>, 34 on the dubious grounds that Euphranor's slimmer cannon was not applied to his sculpture. More to the point, it is difficult to see in it the complex characterization recorded by Pliny in <ref target="t116" n="U">T 116</ref>. Yet like <ref target="t110" n="U">T 110</ref> this should derive from a Hellenistic epigram, so may be more freely imaginative than accurate. Finally, the Rondanini Alexander in Munich has long been connected with (10), though the arms are lowered too much to be holding reins; the statue may portray the king as a New Achilles arming himself for battle, or simply resting his forearms on his thighs (discussion, Stewart 1993, Chapter 4.3); Schwarzenberg 1975b opts for Achilles himself and a late Hellenistic date. In addition, the Alsdorf relief in Chicago (<bibl>Palagia 1980</bibl> fig. 66; Andronikos 1980 no. 40; Stewart 1993, fig. 15) shows a very similar figure (Alexander?) in a tableau with two youths, Herakles, and a nymph, with a horse (Boukephalos?) to right. The relief is Attic, carved in the early third century A.D., and the composition is quite acceptable for the late fourth century B.C. The question remains open.</p>

<p>Silanion was thus exclusively an <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">andriantopoios</foreign>, and one of the few Athenians to challenge the Argive-Sikyonian school on its own territory (8)-(10). Indeed, and perhaps not entirely by coincidence, he was also apparently the first portraitist to follow Polykleitos and Euphranor (<ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref>, 117) and to write on <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign> (Vitruvius 7, Praef. 12); unfortunately, Pliny ignored his book entirely. Yet his virtuosity inspired some far-fetched anecdotes about his work, including the (surely fictitious) assertion that silver was mixed in with the bronze to catch the pallor on the face of (3) (Plutarch, <title>Moralia</title> 674A), and:</p>

<cit xml:id="t119" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 34.81-2</bibl>

<quote><p>Silanion cast a portrait of Apollodoros, himself a sculptor, but among all artists the most meticulous in his art and a harsh critic of his own work, frequently smashing his finished statues, since his zeal for his art always left him unsatisfied; consequently they nicknamed him "the Madman". This quality Silanion expressed in his portrait, and so represented in bronze not a man, but anger personified. He also made a famous Achilles, and a trainer of athletes.</p></quote></cit>

<p>None of these has been identified in copy, and his other works have fared almost as badly: Lattimore's identification of (1) with the Ludovisi `Ares' is purely hypothetical (<bibl>S. Lattimore1979</bibl>), <bibl>Brommer 1982</bibl> rejects the Ince `Theseus' for (2), the Getty 'Sappho' head (cf. no. 4) is a fake, and the miserable little Korinna from Compiègne (cf. no. 5) has no exact correlates at full size. Only the Plato (6) and the 'Satyros' (8; <rs key="Athens, NM Br. 6439" type="sculpture">Athens, NM Br. 6439</rs>) begin to be convincing as attributions (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 513-14). The former is noted (but not described) by Diogenes Laertius:</p>

<p>The Satyros is given similar treatment by Pausanias (6.4.5), and <bibl>Moretti 1957</bibl> no. 462 has established probable dates of 332 and 328 for his victories; the dates of (9) and (10) are unknown.</p>

<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Lysistratos</persName></head>

<p>Lysippos is among the most richly documented of all Greek sculptors; for besides the guide-book writers and rhetoricians, Pliny preserves a precious testimonial apparently from his own follower, Xenokrates (<ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>), the Alexander historians studied his portrait bronzes (<ref target="t121" n="U">T 121</ref>, 131-32), and both poets and prose writers chose several of his acknowledged masterpieces for extended essays in description (<ref target="t127" n="U">T 127</ref>, 129-30); in addition, numerous inscriptions both confirm and supplement the texts.</p>

<p>According to <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref> Lysippos "flourished" in 328-325, but his career certainly began about four decades before this date (nos. 32, made after 372/368, and 22, datable ca. 363/62), and continued at least until 316, when Kassander commissioned him to design a distinctive amphora-shape for newly-founded Kassandreia (Athenaeus 11.784); he was thus born around 390, and as <ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref> relates, began work as a common bronze-smith. His recorded works, all bronzes, are:</p>

<p>After the two early statues (32, 22) at Delphi and Olympia, dated works are not to be had till the 340s. (27) must pre-date the marble version set up at Delphi in 336-332 (<rs key="Delphi 369" type="sculpture">Delphi 369</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 551-53), and (30), displayed with a statue by Polykleitos (II) was almost certainly restored after Kassander refounded Thebes in 316, so should pre-date the sack of 335: since the first boys' pankration at the Pythian games, in 346, was won by another, Korveidas triumphed in either 342 or 338. The association with Alexander (16)-(20), who was born in 356, must have begun by 340 (<ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>), though of all his Macedonian commissions only the Granikos group (19), erected after 334, is exactly dated, thanks to the historians:</p>

<cit xml:id="t121" n="testimonium"><bibl>Velleius Paterculus 1.11.3-4</bibl>

<quote><p>Metellus Macedonicus . . . brought from Macedonia the group of equestrian statues which stand facing the temples [in the Porticus Octaviae] and which today are the chief ornament of the place. As to the origin of the group, they say that Alexander the Great prevailed upon Lysippus, a sculptor unequaled for works of this sort, to make realistic portraits of his cavalry Companions who had fallen at the river Granicus [334], and to place his own likeness among them.</p></quote></cit>

<p>As to his last years, two epigrams offer some clues. The first, for Cheilon (28) is discussed by Pausanias:</p>

<cit xml:id="t122" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 6.4.6">Pausanias 6.4.6</bibl>

<quote><p>Cheilon, an Achaean from Patras, won two victories for men wrestlers at Olympia, one at Delphi, four at the Isthmos, and three at Nemea. He was buried at public expense by the Achaeans, and it was his fate to lose his life in battle. My statement is corroborated by the inscription at Olympia:

<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">In wrestling I alone conquered twice at Olympia and Pytho,</l>
<l>Thrice at Nemea, and four times at the Isthmos near the sea;</l>
<l>Cheilon son of Cheilon of Patras, whom the Achaean race</l>
<l>Buried for my valor when I fell in war.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>This much the inscription reveals. But the date of Lysippos, who made the statue, leads me to infer about the war in which Cheilon fell, that he either marched to Chaironeia with all the Achaeans [338], or else his personal valor and daring led him, alone of the Achaeans, to fight against the Macedonians under Antipater at the battle of Lamia in Thessaly [323-322].</p></quote></cit>

<p>Today, most prefer the later date. As for the second, the Krateros group (20) has already been mentioned in connection with Leochares (<ref target="t109 t110 t111" n="U">T 109-111</ref>, above), and with Plutarch, <title>Alexander</title> 40 the inscribed epigram reveals that it was finished after the Macedonian's death in 320.</p>

<cit xml:id="t123" n="testimonium"><bibl><title>Fouilles de Delphes</title> 3.4.2 no. 137</bibl>

<quote><l>Alexander's son, Krateros, offered these to Apollo,</l>
<l>A man exalted, honored, and far-famed.</l>
<l>But he who placed them here was Krateros his orphaned child,</l>
<l>Fulfilling every promise for his sire,</l>
<l>To bring him glory, sweet and everlasting, O stranger,</l>
<l>As hunter of that bull-devouring lion.</l>
<l>Along with Alexander, Asia's much-praised monarch,</l>
<l>Companion to his king in victory,</l>
<l>He destroyed it as it rushed upon them, killed it thus</l>
<l>At sheep-rearing Syria's furthest bounds.</l></quote></cit>

<p><bibl>Moreno 1974</bibl>, 33-41 attempts to lower this work to ca. 305, and thus to prolong Lysippos' career to the century's end; but though <title>Anth. Pal</title> 16.336 indeed declares (16) to have been a product of his old age, it seems more likely that the inscription for (45), cut around 300 but now damaged at the critical point, read "Lysippos <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">neos</foreign> " (junior) rather than "<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">geron</foreign> " (old man). There is still no evidence that he worked much, if at all, beyond 316, when he would have been around 75 years old.</p>

<p>So much for chronology: clearly, to attempt to distinguish an "Asian period" (with Alexander) or a "Tarentine period" (1, 10) is futile without further evidence. More likely, his career was far more complicated, a mixture of crisscrossing travels and work made to order at Sikyon. Preserved originals and attributed copies help little here: in the former category, the Delphi Agias (<rs key="Delphi Museum 369" type="sculpture">Delphi Museum 369</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 551-53; cf. 27) allows us only a second-hand glimpse of his mature style, and the Poulydamas base (31; <bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, figs. 8-10) is too badly damaged to do more than suggest a date in the century's second half. The Getty bronze (<rs key="Malibu 77.AB.30" type="sculpture">Malibu 77.AB.30</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 618, 620), the so-called 'Philandridas' head (of marble!) from Olympia (cf. 33) and the San Marco horses (cf. 7) are all post-Lysippic, the last perhaps by six hundred years.</p>

<p>Replica hunters have universally begun with Pliny. Culled almost equally from Douris' biographies and the connoisseurship of Lysippos' own follower Xenokrates (cf. <ref target="t145" n="U">T 145</ref>; both were active ca. 300), his synthesis was probably the work of Antigonos of Karystos late in the third century; Varro then paraphrased it into Latin, leaving Pliny himself to spice it with a liberal admixture of contemporary anecdotes:</p>

<cit xml:id="t124" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Plin. Nat. 34.61">Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 34.61-5</bibl>

<quote><p>(61) Duris says that Lysippus of Sicyon was nobody's pupil; originally a bronze-smith, he joined the discipline after hearing a response from the painter Eupompus. When asked which of his predecessors he followed, Eupompus pointed to a crowd of people and said that it was Nature herself, not another artist, whom one should imitate.
</p>
<p>(62) He was a most prolific artist, and made more statues than any other sculptor, among them a Man Scraping Himself with a Strigil, which M. Agrippa dedicated in front of his baths, and which the emperor Tiberius was astonishingly fond of. Although at the beginning of his principate he kept control of himself, he was unable to do so in this case, and had the statue removed to his bedroom, substituting another in its place. But the Roman people became so indignant at this that they raised an outcry at the theater, shouting, "Give us back our Apoxyomenos!" So despite his admiration for it, the emperor returned it.

<p>(63) Lysippus is famed for his drunken flute-girl, his hounds and huntsmen, and particularly for his chariot of the Sun at Rhodes. He also made many studies of Alexander the Great, beginning with one in his boyhood which so entranced the emperor Nero that he ordered it to be gilded, but this addition to its monetary value so diminished its artistic appeal that the gold was later removed, and in that condition it was considered more valuable even though it retained the scars from the work done on it and the incisions for fastening the gold.
</p>
<p>(64) He also made an Hephaestion, Alexander's friend, which some ascribe to Polyclitus, though he lived a century earlier, an Alexander's Hunt dedicated at Delphi, a satyr now at Athens, and Alexander's Squadron, in which he rendered the portraits of his friends with the highest degree of likeness possible in every case; Metellus removed this to Rome after the conquest of Macedonia [148]. He also made chariot groups of various kinds.
</p>
<p>(65) Lysippus is said to have contributed much to the art of sculpture, by rendering the hair in more detail, by making the heads of his figures smaller than the old sculptors used to do, and the bodies slenderer and leaner, to give his statues the appearance of greater height. Latin has no word for the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign> which he most scrupulously preserved by a new and hitherto untried system that modified the foursquare figures of the ancients; and he used to say publicly that while they had made men as they were, he made them as they appeared to be. A distinguishing characteristic of his is seen to be the scrupulous attention to detail maintained in even the smallest particulars.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Eupompos was a contemporary of Zeuxis (<title>N.H.</title> 35.64, 75), who <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> ca. 400 (<title>N.H.</title> 35.61), but though the dates fit, the anecdote may be a fiction to cover Douris' ignorance of Lysippos' true teacher, engineered to fit the supposed realism of his style (<ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>, and further below).</p>

<p>By-passing the attributions for the moment, the manifold problems of the final, Xenokratic section have provoked considerable discussion. Here the art that allegedly began with Pheidias in <title>N.H.</title> 34.54 and continued through Polykleitos, Myron, and Pythagoras (<ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref>, 43, 40), now climaxes with Lysippos himself. Xenokrates clearly included the remark that "he made men as they appeared to be" to distance his master from this supposedly increasing trend towards realism, culminating in Pythagoras (<ref target="t40" n="U">T 40</ref>). In fact, Lysippos may have meant it more generally: compare <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref> and the strikingly similar passage from Plato's <title>Sophist</title> of ca. 460:</p>

<quote><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Those who model or paint certain large-scale works of art do not [attempt exact mimesis]. For if they rendered the actual commensurable proportioning [symmetria] of beautiful forms, you would think that the upper parts were smaller than necessary and the lower were larger, because the former are seen far away, the latter at close-hand.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Correct.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>So artists simply wave good-bye to Truth, and now render not real commensurate proportions but only those which appear to be beautiful.</p></sp></quote></cit>

<p>From this point of view, Polykleitos' severely objective attempt to uncover the true median proportions of the human body (<ref target="t68" n="U">T 68</ref>) would indeed bring his "foursquare" canon (<ref target="t62" n="U">T 62</ref>, cf. <ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>), no matter how ideal it appears to us, within the scope of Lysippos' criticism.</p>

<p>As to the works themselves, the most convenient and best-illustrated compendium is <bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, though not all his attributions have been accepted (or are acceptable). For the most complete (presumed) copy of the Apoxyomenos (34) see <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 554, with <bibl>Schauenburg 1963b</bibl>, 78-9, pls. 60-62; <bibl>Lauter 1967</bibl>; and <bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, figs. 69-79 (more copies); the rest are perhaps best discussed in the order of the complete list above.</p>

<p>Pliny describes (1) as follows:</p>

<cit xml:id="t126" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny <title>N.H.</title> 34.40</bibl>

<quote><p>In the case of the colossus of Tarentum by Lysippus, which is 40 cubits [60 feet] high, the astonishing thing is that though it can be moved by hand (so they say), its system of weight-distribution is such that no storm can dislodge it. The artist himself is said to have provided against this by erecting a column a short distance from it on the side where it was most necessary to break the force of the wind. Accordingly, because of its size and the difficulty of moving it, Fabius Verrucosus left it alone when he transferred the Hercules from there to the Capitol [209].</p></quote></cit>

<p><bibl>Moreno 1971</bibl> has identified it, complete with column, on a terracotta mold from nearby Policoro (Herakleia); cf. <bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, figs. 142-43; (2)-(4) are regularly recognized on coins of their respective cities, with which several fine series of bronze statuettes are often associated: see <bibl>Volk 1984</bibl>, though the type she studies is more likely to reproduce Leochares' Zeus Brontaios (<ref target="t110" n="U">T 110</ref>). (5) may be the 'Lateran' Poseidon type, perhaps originally displayed at the Corinthian port of Kenchreai (cf. <bibl n="Paus. 2.2.3">Paus. 2.2.3</bibl>; <bibl>Walde 1978</bibl>; <bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, figs. 94-95). <bibl>Dörig 1973</bibl> sees (6) in a head in Venice related to the Apoxyomenos, while (7) appears on Rhodian amphora-stamps (<bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, fig. 61) and was perhaps imitated on the Pergamon altar. Attempts to connect the (surely Roman) horses taken from Constantinople to the Piazza San Marco with it or a presumed duplicate at Delphi are now generally discounted. An influential Eros type shown stringing or unstringing his bow has long been associated with (8): cf. <ref target="t101" n="U">T 101</ref>, with <bibl>Dohl 1968</bibl>; Moreno figs. 14-23), and several reliefs (Relief of Kairos by Lysippos, <rs key="Turin Museum D317" type="sculpture">Turin Museum D317</rs>; <bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, figs. 66-68; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 555) and gems evidently reproduce (9), which caught the imagination of poets and rhetoricians from the Alexandrian age to the Byzantine:</p>

<quote><p>Questioner: Who and whence your sculptor? Statue: From Sikyon. Q: And his name? S: Lysippos. Q: And who are you? S: Kairos that subdues all. Q: Why do you go on tiptoe? S: I'm always running. Q: And why a pair of wings on your feet? S: I fly with the wind. Q: And why do you hold a razor in your right hand? S: As a sign to men, that I am sharper than the sharpest edge. Q: Your hair, why is it over your eyes? S: For anyone I meet to take me by the forelock. Q: And Heavens, why are you bald behind? S: Because once I've raced by someone with winged feet, he'll never grab me from behind no matter how strong his desire. Q: Why did the artist fashion you? S: For your sake, stranger, and set me up on the porch as a lesson.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Save for Kallistratos, <title>Descriptions</title> 6, who remarks tellingly that Kairos was "the only creator of beauty", later writers add little to this; for an interpretation of the statue as a critique of Polykleitos see <bibl>Stewart 1978a</bibl>. Reinterpreted in later antiquity as Time and set on a globe (so, already, Kallistratos), it was taken to Constantinople only to perish with other famous masterpieces in the catastrophic Lauseion fire of A.D. 476:</p>

<cit xml:id="t128" n="testimonium"><bibl>Kedrenos, <title>Historiarum Compendium</title> 322</bibl>

<quote><p>[In the Lauseion] there stood the image of Lindian Athena, four cubits [6 feet] high and made of <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">smaragdos</foreign> , a work of the sculptors Skyllis and Dipoinos, which Seostris, ruler of Egypt, once sent as a gift to Kleoboulos tyrant of Lindos; the Knidian Aphrodite of white marble, nude, covering only her private parts with her hand, the work of Praxiteles of Knidos; the Samian Hera, a work of Lysippos and Boupalos of Chios; the winged Eros with a bow, coming from Myndos; the ivory Zeus of Pheidias, which Perikles dedicated in the temple at Olympia; and the statue representing Time, the work of Lysippos, bald behind and long-haired in front.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Yet it was for statues of men that Lysippos was most renowned (<ref target="t115" n="U">T 115</ref>). His studies of Herakles, for instance, apparently outdid even Praxiteles (<ref target="t103" n="U">T 103</ref>) in exploring violent oscillations of mood (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">pathe</foreign>):</p>

<cit xml:id="t129" n="testimonium"><bibl>Niketas Choniates, <title>De Signis Constantinopolitanis</title> 5 (ed. Bekker)</bibl>

<quote><p>The mighty Herakles, conceived over three nights, sat mightily cast down, upon a basket whereon his lionskin is strewn. There he sat with no quiver hung about him, carrying no bow in his hand, brandishing no club, but extending his right leg and hand as far as he could, bending his left leg at the knee to support the elbow of his left arm, stretching up the forearm and gently resting his head, full of despondency, upon his opened palm. His chest was broad, his shoulders wide, his hair thick, his buttocks ample, his arms brawny, and his height such (I think) that Lysimachos [<foreign xml:lang="la">sic</foreign> ] might have thought the original Herakles to reach when he cast this in the bronze, the choicest jewel of his art, first and last, so big that a string fastened around its thumb would serve as a man's belt, and the shin of its leg was as tall as a man.</p></quote></cit>

<p>These and other accounts have enabled (10) and (13) to be securely identified in replica, the first in a series of bronze statuettes (<bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, figs. 144-56), the second in a host of replicas ranging from tiny to colossal (<bibl>Visscher 1962</bibl>; <bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, figs. 30-34) — though its alleged pedigree is surely fictitious. Indeed, was Vindex' statuette the original or a (contemporary?) version of a big bronze, like the colossus from Alba Fucens published by de Visscher? For the latter showed Herakles correctly <emph>at</emph> the table — i.e. feasting in Olympos — while the statuette punned upon the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">epi</foreign> (literally "at" <emph>or</emph> "on") of his cult-title to make him a table ornament. As for the others, many associate the 'Farnese'-type Herakles (<rs key="Louvre Br 652" type="sculpture">Louvre Br 652</rs>; <bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, figs. 96-113; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 566) with (11), while (14) may be reflected in a powerful marble in the Capitoline Museum, a small bronze group in Palermo, and on Roman sarcophagi: see most recently, <bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, figs. 124-41. Finally, the Boston-Copenhagen Herakles type is often attributed to him too, on general stylistic grounds.</p>

<p>His portraits were evidently equally varied. For the Alexanders one must turn from Pliny (<ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>) to Plutarch:</p>

<cit xml:id="t131" n="testimonium"><bibl>Plutarch, <title>Moralia</title> 335A-B</bibl>

<quote><p>When Lysippos had finished his first Alexander with his face looking up towards the heavens (just as Alexander himself was accustomed to look, slightly inclining his neck to one side), someone not inappropriately inscribed the following epigram:

<quote type="inscription"><l met="dact">This statue seems to look at Zeus and say:</l>
<l>Take thou Olympos; me let earth obey!</l></quote>
</p>
<p>For this Alexander ordered that Lysippos alone should make his portraits. For only he, it seemed, brought out his real character in the bronze and gave form to his essential excellence (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">arete</foreign>). The others, in their eagerness to imitate his crooked neck and melting, limpid eyes, failed to preserve his virile and leonine demeanor.</p></quote></cit>

<p>The decree is a Hellenistic fiction, and the Plutarch also seems to conflate the earlier and later Alexander types ("Fouquet" Alexander: <rs key="Louvre 370" type="sculpture">Louvre 370</rs>, "Nelidow" Alexander: <rs key="Harvard 1956.20" type="sculpture">Harvard 1956.20</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 564-65); elsewhere, though, he again stresses the heroic character of Lysippos's Alexanders as against the quasi-divine iconography favored by Apelles:</p>

<cit xml:id="t132" n="testimonium"><bibl>Plutarch, <title>Moralia</title> 360D</bibl>

<quote><p>Lysippos the sculptor did well to find fault with Apelles the painter for painting Alexander with a thunderbolt in his hand; he himself represented Alexander with a spear, an attribute true and proper to him, which time would never rob of its glory.</p></quote></cit>

<p>For possible copies of (17), perhaps produced in multiple versions, see ; <bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, figs. 44-45; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 561-62, 564-65: "Schwarzenberg" Alexander; "Azara" Alexander (<rs key="Louvre MA 436" type="sculpture">Louvre MA 436</rs>); "Fouquet" Alexander (<rs key="Louvre 370" type="sculpture">Louvre 370</rs>); "Nelidow" Alexander (<rs key="Harvard 1956.20" type="sculpture">Harvard 1956.20</rs>). A statuette in Naples has been connected with the Alexander of (19): <bibl>Calcani 1989</bibl> investigates this and many more possible echoes, some more plausible than others. A Messenian relief in Paris probably echoes (20): cf. <bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, fig. 55; Stewart 1993. Of the other portraits, see <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 557-58 for (26): head of Sokrates (<rs key="Rome, Museo Nazionale Romano (Terme) 1236" type="sculpture">Rome, Museo Nazionale Romano (Terme) 1236</rs>); statuette of Sokrates (<rs key="London 1925" type="sculpture">London 1925</rs>). As for the victor-statues, (27), (31), and (34) were discussed above, and <bibl>Schauenburg 1963b</bibl> proposes to add several anonymous copies to the list; cf. <bibl>Moreno 1987</bibl>, figs. 4, 11-12. Finally, a series of headless marbles have regularly been connected with (40); an attractive bronze statuette in Santa Barbara (<rs key="Santa Barbara Museum of Art 1981.64.4" type="sculpture">Santa Barbara Museum of Art 1981.64.4</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 556) now gives the complete composition.</p>

<p>As for dates, most of these seem to fall in the second half of the century. <bibl>Arnold 1969</bibl>, 210 and 236-37 proposes the following sequence, based largely upon an increasing freedom of movement and space-enclosing poise of the arms: Copenhagen Herakles, ca. 350; Eros, ca. 340; Kairos, 330s; Herakles and the Hind, ca. 330; Apoxyomenos, ca. 320; Farnese Herakles, ca. 315.</p>

<p>Lysippos's versatility places him in the forefront of the fourth-century virtuosi; his achievement was, as Pliny tells us in <ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>, to perfect a phenomenal idealism that adapted the legacy of the past (such as the ancient principle of <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign> ) to the demands of subject and setting. Nowhere is this clearer than in his portraiture, where his aim was to create idealized images whose meticulous attention to detail nevertheless made them absolutely compelling as likenesses (<ref target="t131" n="U">T 131</ref>).</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>In this he may have been helped by his brother Lysistratos, who <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> with him in 328-325 (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>), and whose known work in portraiture (Tatian, <title>Contra Graecos</title> 54.117) is complemented by a precious description of his method:</p>

<cit xml:id="t133" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 35.153</bibl>

<quote><p>The first man to mould a likeness in plaster from the face itself, and to institute the method of making corrections upon a casting produced by pouring wax into this plaster mould was Lysistratus of Sicyon, brother of Lysippus, of whom we have already spoken. He introduced the practice of making likenesses, for before him they used to try to make portraits as beautiful as possible. He also invented the technique of taking casts from statues, and this practice increased to such an extent that no figures or statues were made without using clay.</p></quote></cit>

<p>This method is completely congruent with Lysippos's work as described in <ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref> and 131, and seems to have been highly congenial to Roman neo-classic taste, which also valued "likeness" or <foreign xml:lang="la">similitudo</foreign> highly (<ref target="t121" n="U">T 121</ref>), but wanted it tempered with more than a dash of idealization (<ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>; cf. <bibl>Pollitt 1974</bibl>, 430-44). Yet even despite their admiration for Lysippos, neo-classic critics like Quintilian evidently found no difficulty at all in assessing his standing vis-a-vis the giants of the fifth century: for (<ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>) since Pheidian <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">agalmatopoia</foreign> had already penetrated the essence of the gods (<ref target="t53" n="U">T 53</ref> and 61), and Polykleitan <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">andriantopoia</foreign> that of men (cf. <ref target="t65" n="U">T 65</ref> and 70), their successors could only turn to representing external appearance (cf. <bibl>Pollitt 1974</bibl>, 131-38 on the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="la">veritas</foreign> in <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>). And of those engaged in this lesser enterprise, Praxiteles and Lysippos struck the best balance between Truth and Beauty, while the vulgar realism of Demetrios (cf. <ref target="t91" n="U">T 91</ref>) banished him irrevocably below the salt.</p>

<div type="Chapter" n="5"><head>The Hellenistic Period</head>

<p>As indicated above, the period of the Successors (ca. 323-280) was later regarded as the twilight of classical sculpture, even though the art of painting was still at its zenith (Quintilian 12.10.6: cf. <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>). Hellenistic connoisseurship stopped with the sons of Praxiteles and the school of Lysippos, though some Roman neo-classicists were more radical, accepting nothing after the great masters themselves (<ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref>). Their imitators, no matter how good, were "inferior" (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>). Consequently, as the texts dwindle, inscriptions play a much greater part, offering different kinds of evidence from the value-judgments of the critics. Attic sculpture provides a case in point:</p>

<div type="section" n="1"><head>Early Hellenistic Athens</head>

<p>Over forty Athenian sculptors are known from ca. 330 through the late third century (<bibl>Stewart 1979</bibl>, 158-61), but only a handful appear in the literature; fortunately, epigraphy provides much information about commissions, shifts in the art market (particularly after Athens' defeat in the Chremonidean War of 266-261), and other issues. The following selection includes some of the major personalities active to ca. 260; the "renegade" Xenokrates is treated among the pupils of Lysippos.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Kephisodotos (II) and Timarchos, sons of Praxiteles</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Kephisidotos</persName></head>

<p>As indicated above, these two were active around 345-290. Yet their mature work must have fallen during the Lykourgan administration of 336-324, when they also paid heavy naval liturgies (<title>IG</title> 22 nos. 1628, lines 57, 68, 74, 11; 1629, line 674; 1633, line 100; cf. <bibl>J.K. Davies 1971</bibl> no. 8334; <bibl>Stewart 1979</bibl>, 106; Lauter 1980). So Pliny's <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> of 296-293 (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>) must originally have been calculated either by simple association with their Peloponnesian counterparts, the pupils of Lysippos (for Lysippos' own <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> in 328-325 naturally determined theirs, a generation later), or from the death of Menander (no. 12, below) around 293/2. The latter is less likely, since only Pausanias mentions the statue <bibl n="Paus. 1.21.1">Paus. 1.21.1</bibl> but without naming its authors, who remained anonymous till the inscribed base was found in 1862.</p>

<p>Almost half of these (10, 12, 14, 15, 17-23) are known only from their inscribed bases; in addition, a single signature of Timarchos was found at Rome in 1874.</p>

<p>Clearly, the brothers not only inherited their clientele from their father, but continued to work in his favorite genres and techniques: marble for divinities, bronze for portraits (on the continuing Eleusinian connection here see esp. <bibl>Harward 1982a</bibl>). As for the works themselves, Pliny provides a brief introduction:</p>

<cit xml:id="t134" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny <title>N.H.</title> 36.24</bibl>

<quote><p>The son of Praxiteles, Cephisodotus, inherited also his skill. His group of People Grappling (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symplegma</foreign> ) at Pergamon is much praised, being notable for the way in which the fingers seem really to sink into living flesh rather than marble. At Rome his works are a Leto in the Palatine temple, a Venus in the collection of Asinius Pollio, and the Asclepius and Diana in the shrine of Juno within the Porticus Octaviae.</p></quote></cit>

<p>The stress on realism with regard to (24) echoes the concerns of e.g. <ref target="t3" n="U">T 3</ref> (see commentary to <ref target="t133" n="U">T 133</ref>, above). This apart, Pliny obviously had no critical tradition to draw on, only a bare list of Kephisodotos' works in Rome. Of these, (1) was not the only Praxitelean piece in Pollio's collection (cf. <ref target="t167" n="U">T 167</ref>), while (5) is reproduced, with Timotheos' Artemis and Skopas' Apollo, on a relief commemorating Augustus' dedication of the Palatine cult group: cf. <ref target="t90" n="U">T 90</ref>. The cult complex for (6) dates these to after ca. 350.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Whereas we have no original fragments of these, or even copies in the round, the finds from (7) do seem persuasively post-Praxitelean (<title>Classical Quarterly</title> cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 604-05). An early Hellenistic poet describes a visit to what appears to be this complex (<foreign xml:lang="la">contra</foreign> , somewhat speciously, I.A. Cunningham in <title>Classical Quarterly</title> N.S. 16 [1966]: 115-17):</p>

<cit xml:id="t135" n="testimonium"><bibl>Herondas, <title>Mimiambos</title> 4</bibl>

<quote><sp><speaker>KYNNO</speaker><p>Hail, Lord Paieon, ruler of Trikka, who dwells in sweet Kos and Epidauros too; hail Koronis too, who bore you, and Apollo, and Hygieia whom you touch with your right hand, and those whose honored altars are here too; hail to Panake, Epio, Ieso, and those who sacked house and walls of Leomedon, doctors of savage diseases, Podaleirios and Machaon, and all the gods and goddesses who inhabit your shrine, father Paieon.

<p>No doubt most of the personages addressed by Kynno were figured on the altar. The Olympia Hermes (<ref target="t93" n="U">T 93</ref>) is probably also a post-Praxitelean original, as is a splendid female head from Chios (<rs key="Boston 10.70" type="sculpture">Boston 10.70</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 606-08).</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Typically, Pliny confines his survey of Kephisodotean works at Rome to divinities; yet a second-century Christian apologist reveals that portraits of his were also there, and Coarelli 1971-72 has shown that he is almost certainly speaking of a display in Pompey's theater complex, dedicated in 55:</p>

<cit xml:id="t136" n="testimonium"><bibl>Tatian, <title>Contra Graecos</title> 33</bibl>

<quote><p>Lysippos cast the bronze of Praxilla (who said nothing useful in her poetry), Menestratos the Learchis, Silanion the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">hetaira</foreign> Sappho, Naukydes the Erinna from Lesbos, Boiskos the Myrtis, Kephisodotos the Myro of Byzantion, Gomphos the Praxigoris, and Amphistratos the Kleito. But what should I say about Anyte, Telesilla, and Mystis? The first is by Euthykrates and Kephisodotos, the second by Nikeratos, the third by Aristodotos. Euthykrates made for you the Mnesarchis of Ephesos, Silanion the Korinna, Euthykrates the Argive Thalarchis, [. . . lacuna . . .], Praxiteles and Herodotos the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">hetaira</foreign> Phryne, and Euthykrates cast the Panteuchis made pregnant by a seducer. I set all this forth not having learned it from another, but [as a result of my trip to Rome where I saw the statues seized from you Greeks].</p></quote></cit>

<p>Unfortunately, nothing of this dazzling array survives, and no copies have so far come to light; indeed, among (9)-(24) only the Menander (12) is presently identified: inscribed bust of Meander (<rs key="Malibu 72.AB.108" type="sculpture">Malibu 72.AB.108</rs>), head of Meander (<rs key="Dumbarton Oaks 46.2" type="sculpture">Dumbarton Oaks 46.2</rs>; see <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 610, 613).</p>

<p>Like their father, the brothers inspired no Hellenistic critic to consider their work in depth; even the epigrammatists apparently ignored them. In this respect, Greek sculpture's long twilight truly begins with them.</p>

<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Telesinos</persName></head>

<p>Telesinos appears here only because of the long Delian inscription honoring him for his lavish donation of time, labor, and materials to the Asklepieion:</p>

<cit xml:id="t137" n="testimonium"><bibl><title>IG</title> 11.4 no. 514</bibl>

<quote><p>Since Telesinos undertook to make for the Delians statues of Asklepios and Queen Stratonike; and since he donated them to the people and made the Asklepios of bronze and the Stratonike [of stone]; and since he made them well, on time, and [	]; and since he personally restored all the other statues in the sanctuary that required it; and since he has chosen to be a benefactor of the sanctuary and the Delians for no monetary reward; BE IT RESOLVED (1) to praise Telesinos [the Athenian and to crown] him with a laurel crown and to [announce] at the festival of Apollo that [the Delian people] have given Telesinos the Athenian crown for his piety towards the Delian sanctuary and his goodwill towards the Delian people; (2) to appoint him honorary Athenian consul [<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">proxenos</foreign> ] and benefactor; (3) to give him and his descendants [the right to own land on Delos]; (4) to give him first right of hearing before the Council and people after the sacred business and that pertaining to other consuls and benefactors of the sanctuary and the Delians; (5) and to inscribe this decree on stone in the Council-chamber and the sanctuary, and set it up in the most convenient place.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Though this indicates a man of means, he may stand as a representative of that large but almost faceless throng of Hellenistic sculptors who, despite major commissions and handsome rewards, have nevertheless been all but erased from history.

<p>Indeed, our only authority for (1), Clement of Alexandria 4.41 (cf. <ref target="t13" n="U">T 13</ref>, 14, 149) reads 'Telesios', so even this citation, a quote from the normally reliable Philochoros (<bibl><title>FGH</title></bibl> 328 F 176; cf. <ref target="t34" n="U">T 34</ref>, 48) is not quite certain. Excavations have yielded fragments of feet, hands, and faces from the temple: Etienne-Braun 1986, pls. 131-39. Philochoros died ca. 261, Stratonike ca. 270, giving a rough date for Telesinos' shadowy career.</p>

<p>After the defeat of 261 Athens' sculptors left the city <title>en masse</title>. Some went to Rhodes, to join an already extensive array of portraitists with whose work time has dealt particularly savagely: though vast numbers of bronzes were displayed there even in Pliny's day (<title>N.H.</title> 34.36), the 'Adorans' [REF] alone survives, while Pliny himself only noted Chares' colossus (<ref target="t142" n="U">T 142</ref>), Philiskos' Muses (<ref target="t157" n="U">T 157</ref>), and the baroque-style mythological groups (<ref target="t167" n="U">T 167</ref>, <ref target="t171" n="U">T 171</ref>). Yet the signed bases record the activities of no fewer than 150 portraitists working on the island down to the sack of 42, including immigrants from all over the Aegean area: <bibl>Marcadé 1969</bibl>, 471-83; <bibl>Goodlett 1991</bibl>.</p>
</div></div></div>

<div type="section" n="2"><head>The School of Lysippos</head>

<p>In <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>, Pliny gives Lysippos' pupils a <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> of 296-293, a date perhaps derived from Eutychides' commission for the Tyche of Antioch (<ref target="t140" n="U">T 140</ref>). 'Laippus', repeated in <ref target="t139" n="U">T 139</ref>, is evidently a misreading (by Varro) of Daippos (cf. Paus. 6.12.6, 16.5), i.e., <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*A*I*P*P*O*S</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="greek">*D*A*I*P*P*O*S</foreign>.</p>

<cit xml:id="t139" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny <title>N.H.</title> 34.66-7</bibl>

<quote><p>Lysippus left behind three sons who were his pupils, the celebrated artists Laippus, Boedas, and above all Euthycrates, though he imitated his father's rigor rather than his elegance, preferring to find favor in the austere rather than the graceful style. His masterpieces are a Hercules at Delphi, an Alexander Hunting at Thespiae, a cavalry battle, a Trophonius at the god's own oracular shrine, several chariots-and-four, a horse with baskets [?], and a pack of hounds. His pupil was Tisicrates, another Sicyonian, but closer to the school of Lysippus; indeed, many of Tisicrates' statues can hardly be distinguished from his, like his Aged Theban, his king Demetrius, and his Peucestes, the man who saved Alexander the Great's life and so was worthy of such an honor.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Pliny's account of Euthykrates' style seems rhetorically-based. In <title>N.H.</title> 34.41, 80, 83 he adds Chares of Lindos, Phanis, and Xenokrates of Athens to the list; like Teisikrates, Xenokrates was not a direct disciple of Lysippos (<ref target="t146" n="U">T 146</ref>), and Pausanias and surviving inscriptions extend the school into the later third century.</p>

<p>As with the Polykleitan school, a complete catalogue of their works is unnecessary: to those genres recorded in <ref target="t139" n="U">T 139</ref> one should add numerous portraits (<ref target="t136" n="U">T 136</ref>: Euthykrates) and victor-statues (known mainly from Pausanias and scattered inscriptions). Daippos' <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">perixyomenos</foreign> or "All-round Scraper" (<title>N.H.</title> 34.87) evidently attempted to outdo the master himself (<ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>). Survivors include the Ephesos athlete (<rs key="Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum I15372" type="sculpture">Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum I15372</rs>) and the Getty Bronze (<rs key="Malibu 77.AB.30" type="sculpture">Malibu 77.AB.30</rs>), and Teisikrates' Demetrios (<ref target="t139" n="U">T 139</ref>) has been recognized in a fine copy from the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum (<rs key="Naples, Museo Nazionale 6149" type="sculpture">Naples, Museo Nazionale 6149</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 617-22). Of all their bronzes, however, only two attracted more than passing notice: Eutychides' Tyche of Antioch (overlooked by Pliny) and Chares' colossal Helios for Rhodes.</p>

<p>Personifications like the Orontes were a specialty of his: Pliny describes his River Eurotas as "wetter than water" (<title>N.H.</title> 34.78), evidently after an epigram such as this:</p>

<quote><p>But the work that surpassed all in admiration was the colossal statue of the Sun at Rhodes, made by Chares of Lindos, the pupil of the above-mentioned Lysippus. This statue was 70 cubits [105 ft.] high, and 66 years after its erection it was overthrown by an earthquake [228 or 226], but even lying on the ground it is a marvel. Few people can get their arms around its thumb, and the fingers are larger than most statues. Vast caves yawn within its fractured limbs, while inside one sees great masses of rock, which he used to stabilize it when he erected it. It is recorded that it took 12 years to complete and cost 300 talents, which they seized from the sale of the siege-engines left by king Demetrius when he gave up his protracted siege of Rhodes in disgust [305].</p></quote></cit>

<cit xml:id="t143" n="testimonium"><bibl>Philo, <title>On the Seven Wonders of the World</title> 4</bibl>

<quote><p>The colossus at Rhodes . . . stood seventy cubits high, and took the form of a Helios; the image of the god was subsequently determined by it alone. The artist expended so much bronze upon it, that it nearly caused a dearth in the mines; for the casting of the image became the industry of the world . . . .
</p>
<p>Having built a base of white marble, he first fixed upon it the feet of the Colossus up to the ankle-joints, bearing in mind the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">symmetria</foreign> of a god intended to stand to a height of 70 cubits; for the sole of the foot was already longer than other statues are high. For this reason it was impossible to hoist up the remainder and place it upon the feet, but the ankles had to be cast upon them, and, as when a house is being built, the whole work had to rise upon itself.
</p>
<p>And so, while other statues are first modelled, then dismembered for casting in parts, then finally recomposed and erected, in this case when the first part had been cast, the second was modelled upon it, and when this had been cast, the third was built upon it, and the next again was done according to the same technique. For the individual metal sections could not be moved. When a new section had been cast upon those already completed, the spacing of the horizontal tie-bars and the joints of the framework were taken care of, and the stability of the stone blocks placed inside it was ensured.
</p>
<p>In order to keep the plan of operations on a firm footing throughout, he heaped up a huge mound of earth around the completed limbs, burying the finished work and carrying out the next section of casting on that level. So having thus ascended little by little to the summit of his hopes, and having expended five hundred talents [30,000 lbs.] of bronze and three hundred [18,000 lbs.] of iron upon it, he made a god to equal the god, and produced by his daring a mighty work; for he had given the world a second sun to match the first.</p></quote></cit>

<p>A mutilated Rhodian relief (<title>Clara Rhodos</title> 5.2: no. 35) is our only evidence for its overall appearance, which resembled the Getty bronze (<rs key="Malibu 77.AB.30" type="sculpture">Malibu 77.AB.30</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 618), though Rhodian Helios coins perhaps reproduce its head.</p>

<p>Another passage concerning Chares, written in Rome around 70 B.C. but probably derived from a second-century Hellenistic rhetorician, has been taken by <bibl>Preisshofen 1970-1</bibl> as a manifesto for eclectic neo-classicism:</p>

<cit xml:id="t144" n="testimonium"><bibl>Auctor <title>ad Herrenium</title> 4.6.9</bibl>

<quote><p>Do not these schoolmasters, teachers of rhetoric to all the world, see that they are making asses of themselves when they seek to borrow the very thing they offer to bestow on others? . . . Chares did not learn from Lysippus how to make statues by Lysippus showing him a head by Myron, arms by Praxiteles, a torso by Polycleitus, but observed the master making all right in front of him; he could study the works of others, if he wished, on his own initiative. But these writers believe that those who want to learn [rhetoric] can best be taught by the methods of others.</p></quote></cit>

<p>To this view, the public for such statues — a common feature of late Hellenistic-Roman decor — would recognize the quotations and savor the resulting combinations of styles. Yet as <bibl>Hallett 1983</bibl> points out, text and interpretation do not match: the author ridicules the idea, and Roman connoisseurship was never that discriminating: cf. <ref target="t4" n="U">T 4</ref>. Indeed in both <ref target="t144" n="U">T 144</ref> and the later <ref target="t99" n="U">T 99</ref>, the point is purely literary and rhetorical, with no indication of a reference to real sculptural practice. Such eclecticism is to be explained on other grounds, such as the associations of the Achillean physique for pseudo-heroic portraiture, or the evident allure of often androgynous beings such as the pseudo-Polykleitan lamp holders (<bibl>Zanker 1974</bibl>; <bibl>Hallett 1983</bibl>) in a decorative, intimate context.</p>

<p>To return to the third century. With the loss of all their major works, the School's main attraction for the historian must lie in the personality of Xenokrates, sometimes dubbed the father of art history. He is probably identical with the Xenokrates son of Ergophilos ("Work-lover") who signed statues at Elateia and Oropos, and whose father (<bibl>Marcadé 1953</bibl>, 32-33) worked at Delphi around 300. Pliny cites him in his source-list for book 34, but in the text allows him just one sentence:</p>

<quote><p>Xenocrates, a pupil of Tisicrates or, as some say, Euthycrates, surpassed both in the number of his statues. He also wrote books about his art.</p></quote></cit>

<p>From these meager gleanings and an analysis of Parrhasios' <foreign xml:lang="it">disegno</foreign> attributed to "Xenokrates and Antigonos" in <title>N.H.</title> 35.67-8 scholars have resurrected a powerful if partisan thinker, whose personality has done much to color our picture of the classical masters. After the analyses of the (presumed) echoes of his book in the commentaries to <ref target="t40" n="U">T 40</ref>, 42, 43, 62, and 124, little remains to be said of his work, except that very contemporary lessons may still be learned from it. If the rigorously formalistic Xenokrates, incomparably closer to his material than we, was able to bungle the relative chronology of Polykleitos, Myron, and Pythagoras so badly, then a humbler attitude on our part might well be in order, and in particular latter-day formalists, whether inspired by <bibl>Krahmer 1923-4</bibl>, <bibl>Carpenter 1971</bibl>, or others, might ask themselves whether their own schemes do not risk equally unpleasing results.</p>

<div type="section" n="3"><head>Egypt and Syria</head>

<p>Inadequate though it is, our information on early Hellenistic sculptors from the Aegean area is incomparably greater than that concerning their counterparts from further East. Pliny overlooks this area entirely, so that e.g. <ref target="t139" n="U">T 139</ref> omits the Tyche of Antioch and <title>N.H.</title> 34.42 and 73 ignore Bryaxis' great cult statues for Antioch and Alexandria; he names no sculptors from these cities. Worse, the comprehensive catalogue of artists published in "Prosopographia Ptolemaica 6", <title>Studia Hellenistica</title> 17 (1968): nos. 17060-17126 contains numerous painters and gem-cutters, but only a handful of sculptors, all nonentities except for Bryaxis and Avianius Evander (<ref target="t168 t169 t170" n="U">T 168-70</ref>), neither apparently native Alexandrians. As for Syria, a handful of names are extant, mostly belonging to the Menodotos-Charmolas family from Tyre, active in the second and first centuries, and probably producers of the pseudo-archaic Piombino Apollo for the Roman art market: <rs key="Louvre inv. 61" type="sculpture">Louvre inv. 61</rs>; <bibl>Dow 1941</bibl>, with <ref target="t106" n="U">T 106</ref>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 857. Yet nothing else of theirs survives, leaving just a lonely Bryaxis to bestride the two kingdoms in the early third century.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Bryaxis (II)</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Bryaxis</persName></head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Bryaxis (II)</persName></head>

<p>As noted in the commentary to <ref target="t107 t108" n="U">T 107-08</ref>, this Bryaxis is almost certainly to be distinguished from the man who worked on the Mausoleum ca. 360.</p>

<p>His authorship of the Apollo at Daphni, made between 300 and 281 is only mentioned by the Byzantine chronicler Kedrenos (<title>Compendium Historiarium</title> 306B ed. Paris); for a detailed description, however, one must turn to two other late writers, mourning its destruction by fire in A.D. 362:</p>

<cit xml:id="t147" n="testimonium"><bibl>Libanios 60.8-12 (selections)</bibl>

<quote><p>Did the fire begin at the top, and spread to the rest — his head, his face, his phiale, his kithara, his foot-length tunic? Citizens, I direct my soul to the form of the god, and my mind sets his likeness before my eyes, his face so gentle, his stone neck so soft, his girdle across his chest that holds his tunic in place, so that some of it is drawn taut, other parts allowed to billow out. Did not the whole composition soothe the spirit to rest? For he seemed like one singing a melody, and one could hear him strumming, so they say, at noon-tide. Ah, blessed ears that did so! For his song was in praise of our country. And I see him as if pouring a libation from his golden bowl . . . and as the fire spreads it destroys first the Apollo, almost touching as he does the roof, then the other statues, the Muses fair, the portraits of the Founders, the sparkling stones, the graceful columns.</p></quote></cit>

<cit xml:id="t148" n="testimonium"><bibl>Philostorgios, <title>Historia Ecclesiastica</title> p. 87, 19-88, 9 ed. Bidez</bibl>

<quote><p>The image of Apollo was constructed as follows: the body was made of wood of the vine, and fitted together with such astonishing skill as to seem like a single, indivisible piece; it was draped in a golden tunic that allowed the nude and ungilded parts of the body to shine forth with inexpressible beauty. It stood with a kithara in one hand, in the attitude of one leading the Muses. Its hair and crown of laurel, intertwined, were of gold and shone with a grace that flashed like lightning into one's eyes. Two enormous aquamarine (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">hyakinthos</foreign>) stones filled the cavities of its eyes, alluding to Hyakinthos, the boy of Amyklai; and the beauty and size of these stones completed the statue's prodigious embellishment.</p></quote></cit>

<p>To this Ammianus 22.73.1 adds that the image was the size of the Zeus at Olympia. For a coin-picture see <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 629, and for other possible replicas, <bibl>Linfert 1983</bibl>, though the colossal marble in Rome claimed by <bibl>Herrmann 1973</bibl> as a replica has now been shown by <bibl>M. Fuchs 1982</bibl> to belong to a first-century Muses group in mixed classical and Pergamene style, from Pompey's theater-complex. To link Bryaxis' Seleukos (<title>N.H.</title> 34.73), the "Founder" of <ref target="t147" n="U">T 147</ref>, and the Herculaneum bust (<rs key="Naples, Museo Nazionale 5590" type="sculpture">Naples, Museo Nazionale 5590</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 630) is perhaps equally unwarranted, for Lysippos and one Aristodemos both made portraits of him too (<title>IG</title> 14.206; <title>N.H.</title> 34.86), but no less tempting for all that.</p>

<p>As for the Sarapis, Bryaxis' authorship was noted by a respected first- century historian from Tarsos, Athenodoros (<bibl><title>FGH</title></bibl> 746 F 3):</p>

<cit xml:id="t149" n="testimonium"><bibl>Clement of Alexandria, <title>Protrepticus</title> 4.43</bibl>

<quote><p>Athenodoros son of Sandon . . . says that Sesostris the Egyptian king, having conquered most of the nations of Greece, brought back with him to Egypt a number of skilled craftsmen. He ordered that a lavish statue of his own ancestor, Osiris, should be made, and the artist Bryaxis did so — not the Athenian, but another of the same name — using a mixture of variegated materials in its construction. He had filings of gold, silver, bronze, iron, lead, and even tin; and not a single Egyptian stone was lacking, including sapphire, hematite, emerald, and topaz also. He ground them all up, mixed them together, and colored them dark blue, so that the statue is almost black, and mingling this with the pigment left over from the funeral rites of Osiris and Apis, he made Sarapis; the god's very name implies this connexion with the funeral rites, and construction from material for burial, since Osirapis is a compound from Osiris and Apis.</p></quote></cit>

<p>This problematic account has been perceptively analyzed by Hornbostel 1973, 36-58. He remarks that since the name Bryaxis is rare and the sculptor was not ranked among the great masters, the attribution is unlikely to be fabricated, for in such cases antiquity invariably selected a virtuoso like Pheidias or Praxiteles (q.v.). Yet the ascription to Sesostris (Dyn. XII: 1971-1840 B.C.), invented by a tradition-hungry priesthood, either entailed postulating an earlier namesake for the sculptor (cf. <ref target="t149" n="U">T 149</ref>) or quietly consigning him to oblivion (as, e.g. Plutarch, <title>Moralia</title> 361-2; Tacitus, <title>Histories</title> 4.83-4). Thus the sculptor must either be the 'Athenian' Bryaxis after all, presumably the artist of <ref target="t107 t108" n="U">T 107-08</ref>, or his son or grandson. Hornbostel opts for the former, updating the Sarapis and overlooking the chronology of the Apollo (for Seleukos, the "founder" of <ref target="t147" n="U">T 147</ref>, acquired Syria only in 301, and founded Antioch shortly after). Consequently, I prefer to ascribe the statue to a second Bryaxis, following e.g. <bibl>Bieber 1961b</bibl>, 83-84.</p>

<p>As for the description of Bryaxis' method, this clearly conflates the chryselephantine technique with the finishing touches of color. Other sources (e.g. Rufinus, <title>Hist. Eccl.</title> 11.23) speak of a wooden core, and the use of gold and precious stones parallels <ref target="t148" n="U">T 148</ref>. For the numerous replicas see Hornbostel 1973, 59-102; cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 632-34: statuette of the Sarapis (<rs key="Museo Ostiense 1125" type="sculpture">Museo Ostiense 1125</rs>), head of the Sarapis (<rs key="Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR 15.1850" type="sculpture">Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum GR 15.1850</rs>); others give him the Zeus from Otricoli on general stylistic grounds.</p>

<div type="section" n="4"><head>Sculptors Active at Pergamon</head>

<p>The only list of such artists is given by Pliny:</p>

<cit xml:id="t150" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 34.84</bibl>

<quote><p>Several artists have represented the battles of Attalus and Eumenes against the Gauls: Isigonus, Pyromachus, Stratonicus, and Antigonus, who wrote books about his art.</p></quote></cit>

<p>For the possibility that the source was Antigonos himself see <bibl>Gallet de Santerre 1983</bibl>, 85-86 with <ref target="t145" n="U">T 145</ref>. At this point we move definitively into the "black hole" between the classical and neo-classical masters; for although <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref> dates Phyromachos to 296-293, there seems little doubt that he was really active considerably later (see below). To take each name in turn:</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Epigonos son of Charios of Pergamon</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Epigonos</persName></head>

<p>Since Pliny's Isigonos is otherwise unknown, and he mentions Epigonos (known from inscriptions as the leading sculptor of late third-century Pergamon) a little later, the two are usually equated:</p>

<cit xml:id="t151" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 34.88</bibl>

<quote><p>Epigonus, who imitated almost all the subjects already mentioned [philosophers, orators, monarchs, athletes, divinities] excelled with his Trumpeter and Weeping Child pitifully caressing its murdered mother.</p></quote></cit>

<p>These are slim pickings, and only the lucky survival of a putative copy of the Trumpeter (<rs key="Rome, Museo Capitolino 747" type="sculpture">Rome, Museo Capitolino 747</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 666-70) and the eight signed bases from the citadel allow the reconstruction of a strong personality who stands at the heart of Pergamene sculpture of the later third century; the mother-and-child group has yet to be identified (cf. Wenning 1984, 43 n. 277). On five of the bases only the signature is preserved, a sixth carried a portrait of a certain Leontes, and the remaining two bore victory dedications by the general Epigenes and the army, and by Attalos himself, for the Kaikos and other battles. Both were erected, it seems, shortly after 223, the date of the last victory mentioned.</p>

<p><ref target="t115" n="U">T 115</ref> includes Phyromachos among the four great <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">andriantopoioi</foreign> of Greek sculpture — the only post-classical master thus honored. Since his date (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>: 296-293) is fiercely controversial, it is best to begin by listing his works and those of his collaborator, Nikeratos son of Euktemon. Nikeratos was evidently the senior, since his name always comes first when the two sign together:</p>

<p>To take these in turn. Pliny's text for Nikeratos (2), <title>N.H.</title> 34.88, is problematic, but seems best resolved after the story in <bibl n="Hdt. 6.61">Hdt. 6.61-70</bibl>; since Demaratos ended his days in Asia, the Demaratides of Pergamon possibly commissioned the piece. For Nikeratos (3) and (4), displayed among other famous (or notorious) women by Praxiteles, Silanion, Lysippos, Euthykrates, Kephisodotos, and others, see <ref target="t136" n="U">T 136</ref>, <title>N.H.</title> 7.34, and Coarelli 1971-72: 103. A revealing epigram is appended to Nikeratos (5):</p>

<cit xml:id="t153" n="testimonium"><bibl><title>IG</title> 11.4.1105</bibl>

<quote><l>O blest Philetairos, our lord who for godlike poets</l>
<l>And skilful modellers shows equal care;</l>
<l>These proclaim your great power, the first with hymns,</l>
<l>The others with display of the skill of their hands.</l>
<l>Since once you brought swift Ares against the Celts, unlucky in war,</l>
<l>And drove them far beyond your land's frontiers,</l>
<l>These choice works of Nikeratos did Sosikrates</l>
<l>Set up for you, in sea-girt Delos,</l>
<l>As a memorial, famous in song; and not even Hephaistos himself,</l>
<l>Beholding their art would censure it.</l></quote></cit>

<p>Since Philetairos is called <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">makarios</foreign> , "blessed", the group (portraits or a battle-scene?) commemorates his death in 262, though may postdate it by no long interval: the Celtic victories of his successors (from ca. 237: <ref target="t152" n="U">T 152</ref>) are not mentioned, and the letter-forms closely resemble a Delian dedication datable on historical grounds to 277-239 (<bibl>Marcadé 1957</bibl>, 83). The phrase "choice works" suggests a well-established reputation. Despite e.g. <bibl>Bieber 1961b</bibl>, 107 and <bibl>M. Robertson 1975</bibl>, 533, the fallen Celt from the Agora of the Italians (N.B.) does <emph>not</emph> belong to this monument: <rs key="Athens, NM 247" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 247</rs>; cf. <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 838, with <bibl>Marcadé 1969</bibl>, 115.</p>

<p>As for the joint commissions, (1) combines Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 34.80 and 88 (cf. <bibl>Marcadé 1957</bibl>, 102 <foreign xml:lang="la">verso</foreign> ; <bibl>Gallet de Santerre 1983</bibl>, 260) and presumably relates to Alkibiades' exile in Asia (cf. Nikeratos no. 2), while (2)-(4) are inscribed bases, untitled. Before leaving Nikeratos, however, it is worth remarking that a Mikion son of Nikeratos was working at Delphi before 215 (<bibl n="Paus. 6.12.4">Paus. 6.12.4</bibl>, <bibl n="Paus. 15.6">Paus. 15.6</bibl>; <title>SEG</title> 17.196); though he signs as a Syracusan, he could easily have emigrated West and received citizenship there.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Finally, Phyromachos. The Asklepios (1) was plundered in 156 by the Bithynian king Prusias, but returned almost immediately at Rome's insistence:</p>

<cit xml:id="t154" n="testimonium"><bibl>Diodoros 31.35</bibl>

<quote><p>King Prusias of Bithynia, having failed in his design on Attalos, destroyed the sanctuary outside the walls, known as the Nikephorion, and plundered the temple. He also carried off the statues, the images of the gods, and the famous cult-image of Asklepios, supposed to be the work of Phyromachos, a piece of extraordinary workmanship, and plundered all the shrines.</p></quote></cit>

<p>For coin-pictures see <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 679; <bibl>Andreae 1990</bibl> has recently shown that a superb marble head in Syracuse is a copy. His attempt to connect it with a seated statue in Cherchel, however, is less convincing, for among other discrepancies the coins show that the Asklepios was standing. The only full-length marble copy seems to be a statue in Herakleion: <bibl>Kranz 1989</bibl>, pl. 47, 4.</p>

<p>Even though the ancient authors ignored it, the Antisthenes (3) has fared rather better, for the signed base, a renewal, was discovered at Ostia in 1969,</p>

<cit xml:id="t155" n="testimonium"><bibl><title>AJA</title> 75 (1971): 434, pl. 95</bibl>

<quote><l>Plato, poet of the Old Comedy. Lysikles made it.</l>
<l>Antisthenes the philosopher. Phyromachos made it.</l>
<l>Charite, prophetess in Delphi. Phradmon of Argos made it.</l></quote></cit>

<p>This discovery led immediately to the association of Antisthenes' (hitherto) unattributed but clearly Hellenistic portrait type, known in a dozen marble replicas (<rs key="Vatican, Sala delle Muse 288" type="sculpture">Vatican, Sala delle Muse 288</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 678), with the great <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">andriantopoios</foreign> . These two works establish Phyromachos as a leading sculptor of the "baroque" style in Pergamon, perhaps even (given his stellar reputation, <ref target="t115" n="U">T 115</ref>), its instigator. This brings us, in turn, to the thorny question of his chronology.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p><bibl>Andreae 1980</bibl> and <bibl>Andreae 1990</bibl> uses the similarity of the Asklepios and the Antisthenes to the head of the Naples giant from the "Small" dedication (<rs key="Naples, Museo Nazionale 6014" type="sculpture">Naples, Museo Nazionale 6014</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 688) to down-date Phyromachos to the mid second century. Yet since the original monument was probably set up at Athens in 200, then copied in Pergamon somewhat later (perhaps after Eumenes II's suppression of the great Celtic revolt in 166), these figures may well be copies of copies, and the comparanda belong around 200 rather than 160. Indeed, if Phyromachos really were active as late as this, as Andreae argues, one is entitled to ask why Pliny's source placed his <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign>in 296-293, when "the art ceased", not in 156-153, when it "revived again" (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>). This low chronology also conflicts with the evidence of <ref target="t153" n="U">T 153</ref> that Nikeratos was active around or shortly after 250, and with the terminal date of ca. 200 established for the citation in <ref target="t150" n="U">T 150</ref> if Antigonos (see below) were really its source. More compelling is Pliny's note in <title>N.H.</title> 35.135 that Phyromachos's pupil Herakleides of Macedon (a painter: <title>N.H.</title> 35.146) moved to Athens in 168; though we have no idea of his age at the time, this and <ref target="t153" n="U">T 153</ref> locate Phyromachos's activity between the later 3rd century and ca. 170. This in turn explains his supposed <foreign xml:lang="la">floruit</foreign> in 296-293 (<ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>): though he fell in the "black hole" between the two dates, he was too famous to be ignored (<ref target="t115" n="U">T 115</ref>), and so Pliny's source naturally put him with his peers in the late classical period, not with his "inferiors" of the mid second century.</p>

<p>Pliny's mention of another painter taught by Phyromachos in <title>N.H.</title> 35.146 is powerful evidence that he was a painter himself, like some of the great sculptors of the classic period: an all-round virtuoso indeed.</p>

<p>Yet while Nikeratos and Phyromachos remain only vaguely dated, Stratonikos of Kyzikos (a well-known <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">toreutes</foreign> and maker of philosopher-portraits, <title>N.H.</title> 34.85, 90, etc.) appears on a Delian inscription of 235/4, where a certain kind of metal vessel is called "Stratonikean" (<title>Inscriptions de Delos</title> 313 line 33). Unfortunately, no further work of his is known.</p></div>

<div type="subsection"><head>Antigonos of Karystos</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Antigonos</persName></head>

<p>Following Wilamowitz' brilliant monograph of 1881(<bibl>Wilamowitz-Moellendorf 1881</bibl>), many scholars now accept that the Antigonus whom Pliny explicitly acknowledges as a source in <ref target="t145" n="U">T 145</ref> and <title>N.H.</title> 35.67-8 is indeed the Antigonos of Karystos who wrote on painting and sculpture (<ref target="t78" n="U">T 78</ref>, cf. commentary to <ref target="t19" n="U">T 19</ref>, 35, and 41-2), and who also produced a <title>Lives of the Philosophers.</title> In his study of <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">toreutike</foreign> he used Xenokrates' book as a framework for material drawn both from his own research and from others', chiefly Douris of Samos (cf. <ref target="t124" n="U">T 124</ref>), enriching Xenokrates' rather dry analyses with appropriate biographical and anecdotal material. His work on marble sculpture (<ref target="t78" n="U">T 78</ref>, cf. commentary to <ref target="t19" n="U">T 19</ref>) was evidently published as a separate book. Learned in both iconography and texts, and attentive to epigraphy, he emerges as the true prototype of the modern art historian; predictably, his impact upon ancient writing about art was enormous, thanks to Varro's liberal use of his books.</p>

<p>Wilamowitz reconstructs his life as follows: a pupil of the philosopher Menedemos of Eretria (ca. 339-265), he spent his mature years traveling in the Aegean area, presumably both working as a sculptor and collecting material for his books. The later third century found him based at Pergamon, where he continued to practice his craft and (in his old age) wrote the <title>Lives</title> , the last of whose subjects died in 205. He himself cannot have lived much longer. His own sculpture is lost, and attempts to attribute the so-called Pasquino group (head of "Menelaos" from a copy of the group <rs key="Vatican, Sala dei Busti 311" type="sculpture">Vatican, Sala dei Busti 311</rs>) to him (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 745-47) are pure conjecture. If his Celtic groups were in the up-to-date Pergamene manner, as Attalid tastes presumably would have dictated, then his own private sympathies were apparently very different, leaning to the classical (cf. <title>N.H.</title> 35.67-8): a peculiarly Hellenistic dilemma. In this, as in so much else, he seems very much a man of his times.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Damophon son of Xenophilos(?) of Messene.</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Damophon</persName></head>

<p>Damophon was ignored by Pliny's source for <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>, which has stirred some controversy about his date. Coins recently discovered under the base of the Lykosoura group led the excavator to propose (and then retract) a Hadrianic date; yet though certainly repaired in Hadrianic times, both this and his statues for Messene surely go with their respective temples, around 200-150. Supporting this date are several local inscriptions naming his sons, written in a persuasively second-century script: <title>BCH</title> 91 (1967): 540-41.</p>

<p>His known works are as follows:</p>

<list type="simple">
<item n="1"><rs type="work">Mother of the Gods in Parian marble, at Messene</rs></item>
<item n="2"><rs type="work">Artemis Laphria at Messene</rs></item>

</list>

<p>In addition, he dedicated a herm to Poseidon Asphaleios at Megalopolis (conclusion of a successful sea-voyage?), which he surely made himself, and restored the ivory of Pheidias' Zeus at Olympia, which had begun to peel off (<bibl n="Paus. 4.31.6">Paus. 4.31.6</bibl>). This earned him honors from the Eleians.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Though he was evidently an <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">agalmatopoios</foreign> of a most traditional kind, a master of many techniques, and well-rewarded for his pains (to judge by (13) and his family's impressive list of dedications: <title>BCH</title> 91 (1967): 538-42), only Pausanias deigned to notice his work. From his descriptions I select that of (12):</p>

<cit xml:id="t156" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Paus. 8.37.1">Pausanias 8.37.1-6</bibl>

<quote><p>The actual images of the goddesses [at Lykosoura], Despoina ["the Mistress"] and Demeter, together with the throne on which they sit, and the footstool under their feet, are all made from one piece of stone. No parts of the drapery, nor the carvings about the throne, are fastened to another stone by iron or cement, but all are of one block. This stone was not imported, but they say that after a vision in a dream they excavated within the sanctuary and found it. The size of both images corresponds roughly to that of the Mother at Athens; these too are works of Damophon. Demeter carries a torch in her right hand, and has laid her other hand upon Despoina. Despoina has a scepter and the so-called chest on her knees, which she holds with her right hand.
</p>
<p>Beside the throne stand, first, Artemis alongside Demeter, draped in a fawn-skin and with a quiver on her shoulders, holding in one hand a torch, in the other two snakes; by her side lies a bitch, of a breed suitable for hunting. Near the image of Despoina stands Anytos, represented in the form of a man in armor. Those around the sanctuary say that Despoina was brought up by Anytos, who was one of the so-called Titans. . . . The story of the Kouretes, who are represented under the images, and that of the Korybantes (a different race from the Kouretes), carved in relief on the base, I know, but pass by.</p></quote></cit>

<p>On these statues see <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 788-92: reconstruction of the sanctuary of Despoina (<figure n="1993.01.0583"></figure>; <rs key="Athens, NM 1734-7, 2171-5" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 1734-7, 2171-5</rs>); head of Artemis (<rs key="Athens, NM 1734" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 1734</rs>); head of Demeter (<rs key="Athens, NM 1735" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 1735</rs>); head of Anytos (<rs key="Athens, NM 1736" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 1736</rs>); robe of Despoina (<rs key="Athens, NM 1737" type="sculpture">Athens, NM 1737</rs>); they were not of one block.

<div type="subsection"><head>The Polykles family from Thorikos (Attica)</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Polykles</persName></head>

<p>In the second century the Polykles family occupied a position in Athens second only to that of the Praxiteles clan in the fourth. Capitalizing upon their rising fortunes, occasioned by commissions from Aitolians, Romans, Athenians, and others, they enrolled their teenage children in the <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">ephebia</foreign> , the educational program for the elite, and volunteered as festival officials and mint magistrates (sources: <bibl>Stewart 1979</bibl>, 108; <bibl>Habicht 1982</bibl>, 172, 178-80); all these high-profile activities involved considerable expense.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, owing to the popular practice of repeating or alternating the same names over several generations, the family tree is extremely problematic, though absolute dates for their activities, which extend throughout the century, are quite plentiful. For the alternatives (neither very satisfactory) see most recently <bibl>Stewart 1979</bibl>, 42-44; <bibl>Habicht 1982</bibl>, 178-80. The issue is too complicated to address here, but it seems likely that more individuals are involved than either reconstruction allows. Since, in addition, to decide which family member among the various namesakes made which statue is often impossible, a complete list of their works (17 in all, involving at least 7 sculptors) would only be confusing. Instead, a selection of the most important sources must suffice to indicate the range (geographical and thematic) of their output:</p>

<p>As well as cult statues and portraits, they produced victor-statues and worked in other genres too. Attributions include the Cyrene-type Apollo (<rs key="London 1380" type="sculpture">London 1380</rs>) and the Medusa Rondanini (<rs key="Munich 252" type="sculpture">Munich 252</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 783-85), though the Apollo (cf. <ref target="t157" n="U">T 157</ref>) has recently been challenged: <bibl><title>LIMC</title></bibl> 2.1: 366-67 nos. 5-7 (<bibl>Simon 1984</bibl>); but see <bibl>La Rocca 1984</bibl>, 639 n. 48.</p>

<p>The family's continuing commitment to the neo-classical style, which unfortunately evoked no response from critics bar the condescending citation in <ref target="t1" n="U">T 1</ref>, is illustrated by the Ofellius (<ref target="t160" n="U">T 160</ref>), carved near the end of the century.

<p>Boethos, the most celebrated silversmith of his day, also produced high-quality bronzes:</p>

<quote><p>Boethus, though he is better in silver, did a child strangling a goose by hugging it.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Both activities were, after all, branches of <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">toreutike</foreign> , involving cast, embossed, and engraved metalwork. Statues associated with him are:</p>

<list type="simple">
<item n="1"><rs type="work">"Agon" (Eros Enagonios) and a signed herm in bronze, found in a wreck off Mahdia, near Tunis</rs></item>

<item n="7"><rs type="work">Epigenes of Melite in bronze, dedicated by the traders and shippers on Delos (with Theodosios)</rs></item>
</list>

<p>In addition, he is also credited with high-priced tableware and couches (Cicero, <title>In Verrem</title> 4.32; Porphyrius on Horace, <title>Epistles</title> 1.5.1; cf. <bibl>W. Fuchs 1963</bibl>, 31). On the contents of the Mahdia wreck and (1) see <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, 229 and figs. 847-54: Herm signed by Boethos; winged youth; another version of the herm (<rs key="Malibu 79.AB.138" type="sculpture">Malibu 79.AB.138</rs>); grotesque dancer; fragments of a krater (Dionysus supported by a satyr: <rs type="vase">Tunis, Bardo Museum 26</rs>); fragment of a krater (Dionysiac thiasos: <rs type="vase">Tunis, Bardo Museum 26</rs>; figs. 859-50 (<rs key="New York 17.230.32" type="sculpture">New York 17.230.32</rs>) show an unprovenanced, unsigned, and inferior version of the herm now in Malibu, whose exact relation to the Mahdia bronze is problematic. Fuchs 1963, 34-35 and 45 suggests that all the wreck's bronzes and marbles are from the same workshop.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Now, (1) is signed "Boethos of Kalchedon", (5) and (6), dated to ca. 184 and 166-164, are signed "Boethos son of Athenaion of Kalchedon", and (7), dated to ca. 130-126, is signed simply "Boethos." When one considers, in addition, that the manuscripts of Pausanias attribute (4) to Boethos of <title>Carthage</title> (lone signature, first century B.C., <bibl>Marcadé 1957</bibl>, 34), and that <bibl>W. Fuchs 1963</bibl>, 13 dates (1) to ca. 130/20 on stylistic grounds, while the lamps and pots from the wreck place its last voyage ca. 100, it will be evident that we, too, are entering treacherous waters. For all else apart, the author of (5) must have been well established to be thus honored ca. 184, making him around ninety by 130/20, if (7) and Fuchs' date for (1) are to hold. Certainly, if the Mahdia pieces (even just its bronzes) come from the same shop, then it is logical to assume that all of them are contemporary and that they did not lie around unused for a generation prior to shipment. This lower date of ca. 100 for (1) would therefore give (5) and (6) to an ancestor, presumably a grandfather. The sequence would then be Athenaion I - Boethos I (maker of nos. 5 and 6) - [Athenaion II?] - Boethos II (maker of no. 1 and presumably, given the distinct similarity in subject-matter, nos. 2 and 3 also).</p>

<l>The deftness of men of old, did Nikomedes set you up.</l></quote></cit>

<p>As for (4), KALCEDONIOS and KARCADONIOS are easily confused, so Pausanias may well have meant the putative author of (1) - (3); <bibl>W. Fuchs 1963</bibl>, 31 gives further reasons for thinking that he, not our 'Boethos I' was the great <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">toreutes</foreign> celebrated in the sources.</p>

<p>As for attributions, (3) has been recognized in popular type best represented by a group in Munich, but scholars cannot agree whether to date this ca. 250 or 150. Its compact, pyramidal composition, which looks like a precedent for the Suicidal Celt, suggests the former, its very "rococo" treatment and advanced modeling, the latter. The motif was already known in the early third century (Herondas 4.31, at Kos: <emph>not</emph> to be identified with Boethos' statue); <bibl>Kozloff 1980</bibl> plausibly interprets the Munich boy as Harpokrates.</p>

<p><bibl>Picard 1947</bibl> gives Boethos the New York Eros (<rs key="New York 43.11.4" type="sculpture">New York 43.11.4</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 821), which was also copied in antiquity; the wing-feathers, so similar to those of (1), make this attribution more attractive than most. Yet despite his neoclassical leanings and high, even proverbial reputation (add ps.-Vergil, <title>Culex</title> 67) Boethos too has suffered from the general neglect of Hellenistic art by later connoisseurs. Pliny mentions him but three times, Pausanias (<ref target="t93" n="U">T 93</ref>) only once, and other critics not at all.</p>

<div type="section" n="6"><head>Greek Sculptors and Rome</head>

<div type="subsection"><head>Pasiteles</head>

<p>A Greek from South Italy given Roman citizenship in 89 (<ref target="t163" n="U">T 163</ref>), Pasiteles was a contemporary of Pompey the Great (106-48) (<title>N.H.</title> 33.156) and the leading sculptor of his day. Pliny tells us what little we know of him:</p>

<cit xml:id="t163" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 36.39-40</bibl>

<quote><p>Varro also admires Pasiteles, who wrote a five-volume treatise on Noble Works of Art throughout the World. He was born on the Greek coast of Italy and was given Roman citizenship along with the towns there [89/88]. He made the ivory Jupiter in the temple of Metellus at the entrance to the Campus Martius. It so happened that once he was at the docks, where there were wild beasts from Africa, and was peering into the cage of a lion which he was engraving, when a panther broke out of another cage and caused no slight danger to this most diligent of artists. He is said to have made many works, but their titles are not recorded.</p></quote></cit>

<cit xml:id="t164" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 35.156</bibl>

<quote><p>Varro also praised Pasiteles, who called modelling the mother of sculpture in metal and stone, and who, although he was preeminent in these arts, never made anything before he had made a clay model.</p></quote></cit>

<p>His reputation, then, was based equally on his writing and on his metalwork, making him a scholar-artist in the tradition of Xenokrates and Antigonos.</p>

<p>Pliny lists his writings as a source for all four books of the <title>Natural History</title> that deal with art (cf. <ref target="t145" n="U">T 145</ref>), but it is doubtful if he read them himself. Most likely, as <ref target="t163 t164" n="U">T 163-64</ref> suggest, he simply followed Varro. As a result, the contents of Pasiteles' treatise have proved quite elusive, and even its title appears in two versions — "Marvelous Works" (<ref target="t145" n="U">T 145</ref>) and "Noble Works" (<ref target="t163" n="U">T 163</ref>). As <bibl>Pollitt 1974</bibl>, 402-04 recognizes, each colors his purpose in slightly different ways. In particular, the latter sounds more thoroughly neo-classical than the former, for sculpture can be "marvelous" (technically adventurous, huge, or whatever) without necessarily being "classic". One senses a man in total sympathy with the Neo-Attic currents of his time, but the connection cannot quite be proved.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>The same tantalizing uncertainty exists with regard to his sculptures. Pliny (<ref target="t157" n="U">T 157</ref>?, 163) knew of only one by name, and no signed examples have survived — though two generations of his workshop are represented in signed, costively pseudo-classical productions of almost stupefying sentimentality (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 860-61: athlete signed by Stephanos; Orestes and Elektra signed by Menelaos: <rs key="Rome, Museo Nazionale Romano (Terme) 8604" type="sculpture">Rome, Museo Nazionale Romano (Terme) 8604</rs>); his pupil Stephanos reappears in <ref target="t167" n="U">T 167</ref>. His own work was surely more lively, as the anecdote in <ref target="t163" n="U">T 163</ref> and another told by Cicero suggest:</p>

<cit xml:id="t165" n="testimonium"><bibl>Cicero, <title>de Divinatione</title> 1.36.79</bibl>

<quote><p>And what about your charming and beloved friend, [the actor] Roscius? Did he lie or did the whole of Lanuvium lie on his behalf? For when he was still in the cradle and was being brought up in Solonium, an area in the territory of Lanuvium, his nurse once woke up suddenly in the night and by the light of a lamp noticed the boy, still asleep, with a snake coiled about him. Terrified at the sight, she sounded the alarm, but his father referred the matter to the soothsayers, who replied that the boy would attain unrivaled eminence and glory. Pasiteles engraved the scene in silver, and our friend Archias has described it in verse.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Yet before one brands him a realist pure and simple, <ref target="t164" n="U">T 164</ref> should give pause. Like Lysistratos (<ref target="t133" n="U">T 133</ref>) and other supposed latter-day "realists" such as Corot, Constable, and Rodin, he actually never worked without an intermediary: the aim, as ever, was the <emph>illusion</emph> of <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">mimesis</foreign> as representation, not as direct imitation. In this, as in his reverence for the past, his versatility, and his extraordinary attention to finish, he stands in the mainstream of Hellenistic art.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>Arkesilaos</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Arkesilaos</persName></head>

<p>Our only source here is Pliny, once again quoting Varro, who makes it clear that Arkesilaos (whose home and parentage are also unknown) was a contemporary of Pasiteles:</p>

<cit xml:id="t166" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 35.155</bibl>
<quote><p>Varro also speaks highly of Arcesilaus, the friend of L. Lucullus, whose clay maquettes used to sell for more among artists themselves, than the finished work of others. He made the Venus Genetrix in Caesar's Forum, which was dedicated in a hurry before it was complete. He was contracted by Lucullus to make a statue of Happiness (Felicitas) for 1 million sesterces, which was prevented by the death of both parties; and that when Octavius the <foreign xml:lang="la">eques</foreign> ("knight") wanted him to make a krater he produced an archetype in plaster for the price of a talent.</p></quote></cit>

<p>There are some minor chronological difficulties here: Caesar's Forum was begun in 51 and dedicated in 46, yet L. Lucullus died soon after his brother Marcus (58); perhaps, then, the Lucullus mentioned at the end is the younger, who fell at Philippi in 42.</p>

<p>The range of Arkesilaos' output shows that he was quite as versatile as Pasiteles:</p>

<p>Hadrianic coins of the empress Sabina with a Venus labelled "Venus Genetrix" on the reverse have prompted many scholars to see (1) as a close version of the late fifth-century statue type there depicted, the so-called "Fréjus Aphrodite", often attributed to Kallimachos (cf. <ref target="t83 t84" n="U">T 83-84</ref>, above). Yet there are alternatives: a fully-draped, diademed Venus on coins of the year 46 itself, holding scales and a scepter, and with a Cupid perched on her left shoulder (Crawford, M., <title>Roman Republican Coinage</title> (Cambridge 1974): 473-75 no. 463), and another on the Altar of the Lares of ca. 7 B.C. (Zanker 1988, fig. 177). The first would make Arkesilaos a total slave to genre-style, the others allow him some individuality; the issue cannot be resolved on the evidence to hand.</p>

<quote><p>Asinius Pollio, an ardent enthusiast, naturally wanted his art collection to be seen. In it are the Centaurs carrying Nymphs by Arcesilaus, the Heliconian Muses of Cleomenes, the Oceanus and Jupiter of Heniochus, the Appian Nymphs by Stephanus, the Hermerotes by Tauriscus (not the well-known engraver but the native of Tralles), the Jupiter Hospitalis by Papylus, Praxiteles' pupil, and the group by Apollonius and Tauriscus that was brought from Rhodes: Zethus and Amphion, along with Dirce, the bull, and the rope, all carved from one block. These two artists started a dispute about their parentage, alleging that though Menecrates appeared to be their father, their real father was Artemidorus. In the same collection there is a praiseworthy Liber Pater [Bacchus] by Eutychides.</p></quote></cit>

<p>The direction of Pollio's tastes (cf. also <ref target="t134" n="U">T 134</ref>) are clear: late classical and Hellenistic marbles with often erotic or Dionysiac themes, carved by leading sculptors, often in the Praxitelean neo-Attic tradition. A marble sea-Centaur abducting a Nereid with Cupids sporting around, in the Vatican, is often mentioned along with (3) on the strength of this passage: in style it strongly recalls the Munich slabs from the "Ahenobarbus Ara" (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 843-44: marriage of Poseidon and Amphitrite: <rs key="Munich 239" type="sculpture">Munich 239</rs>; Nereid on hippocamp). At any rate, both (3) and (4) were evidently quintessentially late Hellenistic in their virtuoso technique and (pictorially inspired?) eroticism. Above all, it seems, Arkesilaos was concerned that his work be both up-to-date and absolutely in accord with current Roman fashion, and profited hugely thereby.</p>

<div type="subsection"><head>C. Avianius Evander</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Evander</persName></head>

<p>A freedman of the patrician M. Aemilius Avianius, Evander first appears in 46 as a supplier of decorative marbles to a reluctant Cicero:</p>

<cit xml:id="t168" n="testimonium"><bibl n="Cic. Fam. 7.23">Cicero, <title>Epistulae ad Familiares</title> 7.23</bibl>

<quote><p>[To M. Fadius Gallus] I had just got back from Arpinium, when a letter from you was delivered to me; and by the same hand I also got one from Avianius, containing this very generous offer, that when he came, he would enter my debt to him on whatever day I pleased. . . But everything would have been easy, my dear Gallus, had you bought only what I wanted, and that only up to the price I was willing to pay. But still, I will not only ratify the purchases you list in your letter, but be gratified by them too; for I fully understand that you bought up things that pleased you (and I have always judged you to be a man of the most refined taste in all such matters) and which you thought were worthy of me, acting not merely from zeal but out of affection too.
</p>
<p>Still, I should like Damasippus to stick to his intention. For in fact, out of all your purchases there is not one which I really want. You, though, in ignorance of my principles, bought these four or five statues at a price beyond what I would pay for all the statuary in creation. You compare your Maenads with Metellus's Muses. Where is the comparison? To begin with, I would never have thought those Muses worth so much money, and all the Muses would have agreed. But they would at least have been appropriate to my library and in keeping with my studies: where on earth do I put the Maenads? They are pretty little figures, of course: I know them well, and have often seen them. Had I fancied them, I would have specifically commissioned you to buy statues that were known to me. For I often buy the sort of sculpture that will embellish a place in my palaestra and give it the appearance of a study center (gymnasium). But a statue of Mars? What do I, the advocate of peace, want with that? I am glad you didn't get one of Saturn too, for I would suspect these two of running me into debt. I would rather a Mercury of some sort, for then I might have had better luck in my business with Avianius.
</p>
<p>As for the table-support, which you must have intended for yourself, if you like it, keep it; but if you've changed your mind, I will of course keep it. For the money you've spent I must say that I'd much rather have bought a house at Tarracina, so as not always to be a bother to my host there. On the whole I reckon that the fault lies with my freedman, whom I had definitely commissioned to make certain purchases, and also with Junius, whom I think you know, Avianius's friend. I have installed some new sitting-rooms in a little colonnade in my Tusculan villa, and would like to decorate them with pictures; indeed, if anything of that sort gives me any pleasure at all, it is painting.</p></quote></cit>

<p>The transaction is complicated (and the Maenads may not have been Evander's own work, for Cicero says that he had often seen them), but throws much light on the Roman art market in general, and Cicero's tastes in particular. Like the Cossutii (<bibl>Rawson 1975</bibl>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 861), Evander was both dealer and sculptor, catering to a buyer's market; Gallus had bought the pieces from him, but at too high a price and without considering Cicero's tastes, in particular the <foreign xml:lang="la">decor</foreign> of his villa. Cicero's exasperation is "barely dissembled under a flurry of courtesies" (D.R. Shackleton-Bailey, <title>Cicero, Epistulae ad Familiares</title> II [Cambridge 1977]: 370-3, with excellent commentary), for not only had he given his own freedman precise instructions to the contrary, to no avail, but doubts that another connoisseur, Damasippos, will abide by <emph>his</emph> promise to underwrite the deal and take the statues in the event that Cicero rejected them.</p>

<p>Evander seems to have escaped unscathed from all this, however, for only a few months later Cicero writes to Memmius as follows:</p>

<cit xml:id="t169" n="testimonium"><bibl><title>Epistulae ad Familiares</title> 13.2</bibl>

<quote><p>[To Memmius] I am on intimate terms with C. Avianius Evander, who is lodging in your family shrine, and particularly so with his patron M. Aemilius. I therefore beg you, more earnestly than usual, to accommodate him with regard to his residence as far as you can without inconveniencing yourself. For he has so many commissions on hand for so many people that it would really pressure him to move back to his old quarters on July 1. Tact inhibits me from preferring my request at greater length.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Returning some time later to Athens, Evander next attracted the attentions of Mark Antony (perhaps during his state visit in 39). Referring to Horace's remark about a bowl by him, a commentator notes:</p>

<cit xml:id="t170" n="testimonium"><bibl>Porphyrius on Horace, <title>Satires</title> 1.3.90</bibl>

<quote><p>Those who write about characters in Horace say that this Evander was an engraver and modeller of statues whom Mark Antony took from Athens to Alexandria, and who, after his transfer to Rome among the prisoners of war, made many marvellous works.</p></quote></cit>

<p>Arriving back in Rome, then, in the winter of 30/29, he was immediately put to work by Augustus, restoring the head of Timotheos' Artemis (<ref target="t90" n="U">T 90</ref>) for the cult-group of the new temple of Apollo Palatinus, which was dedicated the very next year, on Oct. 9th, 28. Thereafter, perhaps exhausted by his peregrinations, he disappears from history.</p>

<p>Numerous other Greek sculptors are attested working for Romans in the first century B.C., most of them either identifiably Attic or affiliated with neo-Attic workshops: cf. <bibl>Lippold 1950</bibl>, 386-87; <bibl>Richter 1951</bibl>, 41-48; <bibl>Stewart 1979</bibl>, 167-69. One or two, like Apollonios son of Nestor, author of the Belvedere torso (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 856), were craftsmen of the highest order, but most, like his namesake Apollonios son of Archias, who made the Doryphoros herm from the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum (<rs key="Naples, Museo Nazionale 4885" type="sculpture">Naples, Museo Nazionale 4885</rs>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, fig. 380-81), were merely humdrum. Yet regardless of their talent or lack of it, the sources still fail to bring them to life; our last example, therefore, comes neither from the Attic school nor (most probably) from the first century B.C., but from the early empire:</p>
</div></div>

<div type="subsection"><head>Hagesandros son of Paionios, Polydoros son of Polydoros, and Athanodoros son of Hagesandros, of Rhodes.</head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Hagesandros</persName></head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Polydoros</persName></head>
<head type="Sculptor"><persName type="alt">Athanodoros</persName></head>

<p>These three men are the first Rhodians since Chares (<ref target="t142 t143" n="U">T 142-3</ref>) to emerge in any sense as personalities, though the Apollonios and Tauriskos apparently adopted by Menekrates of Rhodes (<ref target="t167" n="U">T 167</ref>, with <bibl>Jex-Blake 1896</bibl>, 206-7 on Pliny's misunderstanding) attain a sort of twilight existence through the recovery of a — now much restored — copy of their Dirke group: see <bibl>Lippold 1950</bibl>, 383-4, pl. 135,1; <bibl>Bieber 1961b</bibl>, 133-4, fig. 529; <bibl>M. Robertson 1975</bibl>, 609; <bibl>Marvin 1983</bibl>; <bibl>Lambrinoudakis 1989</bibl> (new version on a Roman cuirassed statue).</p>

<p>As to Hagesandros and his collaborators, controversy still rages concerning the date of their Laokoon and Sperlonga groups (<bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, figs. 732-44). The former is described by Pliny as follows:</p>

<cit xml:id="t171" n="testimonium"><bibl>Pliny, <title>N.H.</title> 36.37-8</bibl>

<quote><p>Furthermore, many have little fame, because despite the distinction of their work, the number of artists involved becomes a barrier to recognition, since no single man monopolizes the credit, nor can several of them be recognized on equal terms. Such is the case with the Laocoon in the palace of the emperor Titus, a work to be preferred to any other painting or sculpture. From one stone the eminent craftsmen Hagesander, Polydorus, and Athenodorus of Rhodes made him [Laocoon] and the extraordinary intertwining coils of the snakes, following a plan agreed in advance.</p></quote></cit>

<p>The arguments (see most recently <bibl>Simon 1984</bibl>; <bibl>Andreae 1988</bibl>) are far too complicated to address here. Suffice it to say, though, that <ref target="t171" n="U">T 171</ref> and the section following specifically examine the advantages and disadvantages of collaboration; thus, to translate the words <title>de consilii sententia</title> (here, "by common agreement") as "by edict of the [Emperor's] council" and to interpret the <foreign xml:lang="la">similiter</foreign> ("likewise") that begins the next section as confirming that Titus (or Nero) actually <emph>hired</emph> the three "in the same way" as earlier emperors had hired other Greeks to embellish the Palatine palaces (so <bibl>Simon 1984</bibl>, 646-48; cf. <bibl>Andreae 1988</bibl>), is to strain the Latin and ignore the context. Pliny's point remains the simple one that they are all examples of successful collaboration, but for that very reason have slipped from memory, too many names being involved for comfort; he gives no chronological hints whatsoever.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="Card"/>

<p>Ostensibly more promising is the epigraphical evidence, recently reexamined by <bibl>Rice 1986</bibl>. Identifying Athanodoros with the recipient of an important commission on Rhodes in 42, and Hagesandros with one of the dedicants of a Rhodian family monument ca. 50, she revives an old opinion that the Sperlonga sculptures were carved between 40 and 10, the workshop having migrated to Italy in the meantime. Though this is plausible, and can even be reconciled with the presumed patronage of Tiberius (see <bibl>Stewart 1977b</bibl>; <bibl>Andreae 1988</bibl>; <bibl>Stewart 1990</bibl>, 96-99: he was born in 42), it rests on "one crucial assumption ... [that] there is only one Rhodian sculptor by the name of Athanodoros; he is the one Athanodoros listed in Blinkenberg's catalogue of sculptors working in Rhodes" (<bibl>Rice 1986</bibl>, 237). Yet since (as she herself admits, p. 236) the Athanodoros family, like other Rhodians, habitually alternated names over the generations, a homonymous grandson of Athanodoros, working between A.D. 21 (when Tiberius virtually retired to Sperlonga) and 26 (when the cave roof partially collapsed, nearly killing him) cannot be ruled out. Preoccupied with arguing her own case for a Neronian date, <bibl>Simon 1984</bibl> overlooks all these issues entirely.</p>

<p>As to an initial date, the Sperlonga marbles were surely designed for the grotto: a duplicate arrangement on Rhodes or elsewhere, plundered by some unknown Roman, strains all credulity. This in turn excludes a mid Hellenistic date (<bibl>Richter 1951</bibl>; more recently, <bibl>Conticello 1974</bibl>), indeed any period before the Augustan, when the cave's circular basin was built. "On the cusp" of Greco-Roman sculpture, the three Rhodians' pivotal position has been neatly characterized by Simon:</p>

<cit>
<quote><p>This region, comprising Rhodes, Tralleis, and Aphrodisias must be regarded as the center of marble sculpture in the imperial period, surpassing even Attica in quality. The Vatican Laokoon group stands not at the end of the Hellenistic, but at the beginning of the neo-Hellenistic, a movement in which Rhodes and Caria were to play a special part.</p></quote>
<bibl>[Simon 1984, 672]</bibl>
</cit>

<p>Together with the continued impact of their work through Michelangelo and the Baroque even into the modern world (where "punk" versions have already appeared) this makes them worthy candidates with which to terminate this survey.</p>
